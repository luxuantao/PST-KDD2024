<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We propose and analyze a globally convergent algorithm for the solution of a finitedimensional quasi-variational inequality (QVI), which is the problem of finding a point x * ∈ K (x * ) such that F(x * ) T (yx * ) ≥ 0, ∀y ∈ K (x * ), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where F : R n → R n is a (point-to-point) mapping and K : R n ⇒ R n is a point-to-set mapping with closed and convex images. QVIs were introduced by Bensoussan and Lions in a series of papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in connection with the study of impulse control problems and soon they turned out to be a powerful modeling tool capable of describing complex equilibrium situations that can appear in such different fields as generalized Nash games (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>), mechanics (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>), economics (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>), statistics (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), transportation (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>), and biology (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). We refer the reader to the monographs of Mosco <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and Baiocchi and Capelo <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for a more compehensive analysis of QVIs.</p><p>In spite of their modeling power, relatively few studies have been devoted to the numerical solution of finite-dimensional QVIs; a topic which, beside being of great interest in its own, also forms the backbone of solution methods for infinitedimensional QVIs. Motivated by earlier research on the implicit complementarity problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>, Chan and Pang introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> what is probably the first globally convergent algorithm for a QVI. In this seminal paper, the authors use a fixed point argument to prove convergence of a projection-type algorithm in the case in which K (x) = c(x) + Q, where Q is a closed convex set and c : R n → R n a mapping satisfying certain conditions. It is safe to say that practically all subsequent papers, where globally convergent algorithms are analyzed, consider variants or extensions of the basic setting proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and also follow the fixed point approach, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> and references therein. In a departure from this setting, Pang and Fukushima <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> proposed a sequential penalty approach to general QVIs. The method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> reduces the solution of a QVI to the solution of a sequence of variational inequalities (VIs); however, even if this approach is very interesting and promising, its global convergence properties are in jeopardy since they ultimately hinge of the capability of solving a sequence of possibly very challenging VIs. More recently, Fukushima <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> studied a class of gap functions for QVIs, reducing the solution of a QVI to the global minimization of a nondifferentiable gap function, but no algorithms are explicitly proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for a further and more detailed application of this approach in a specialized game setting). This essentially completes the picture of globally convergent proposals for the solution of QVIs. We also mention that Outrata and co-workers studied some interesting local Newton methods, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, but the globalization of these methods is not discussed.</p><p>In this paper we propose a totally different approach to the solution of a QVI. Assuming that the feasible set mapping K (•) is described by a finite number of parametric inequalities, we consider the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the QVI, reformulate them as a system of constrained equations and then apply an interiorpoint method. It turns out that the convergence properties of the resulting algorithm depend essentially on the nonsingularity of a certain Jacobian matrix JH . Our main contributions are therefore:</p><p>-An in-depth analysis of the nonsingularity of JH , showing that global convergence of the proposed method can be obtained in the case in which K (x) = c(x) + Q, but also in many other situations covering a wide array of new and significant settings, thus enlarging considerably the range of QVIs that it is possible to solve with theoretical guarantees; -A discussion of the boundedness of the sequence generated by the algorithm; -A numerical testing on a set of test problems demonstrating the effectiveness of the new method and its robustness even if compared to the PATH solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We remark that our set of test problems is by far the largest in the literature and includes problems with up to 4,900 variables and 4,900 constraints.</p><p>The approach we consider in this paper is based on an interior-point-like framework introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and it can be viewed as a generalization of the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for the solution of Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems (GNEPs). Indeed, it is well-known that, under mild conditions, GNEPs can be reformulated as QVIs, so that the extension might appear quite natural. But we remark that the technical issues that we must deal with when facing a QVI are considerably different from those encountered in the analysis of GNEPs. This forced us to take a quite different path from that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and, as a consequence, the results in this paper are considerably deeper than those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and the analysis is more sophisticated. This is shown also by the fact that, when we specialize some of the results in this paper to the GNEP setting, we improve on the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we first describe in detail our setting and then, based on the general framework introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, introduce the interior-point algorithm along with its main convergence properties. In Sect. 3, we identify several classes of QVIs for which the nonsingularity of JH can be established. Section 4 deals with the boundedness of the sequence generated by our algorithm while in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> we report the results of our numerical experimentation. Some definitions and auxiliary results are discussed and proved in the "Appendix".</p><p>Notation R + denotes the set of nonnegative numbers, while R ++ is the set of positive numbers. The symbol v denotes the Euclidean norm of a vector v ∈ R n . Similarly, given a matrix M ∈ R m×n , M is the spectral norm, i.e. the norm induced by the Euclidean vector norm. We recall that M = max{ √ λ | λ is an eigenvalue of M T M}. The spectral norm is compatible with the Euclidean norm in the sense that Mv ≤ M v . For a differentiable mapping F : R n → R m , we denote its Jacobian at x by JF(x), whereas ∇ F(x) is the transposed Jacobian. Similarly, when F : R n × R n → R m depends on two sets of variables (y, x), the notation J y F(y, x) and ∇ y F(y, x) denote the corresponding partial Jacobian and its transpose, respectively, where the derivatives are taken only with respect to y. A matrix A ∈ R n×n (not necessarily symmetric) is positive semidefinite (definite) if x T Ax ≥ 0 holds for all x ∈ R n (x T Ax &gt; 0 for all x ∈ R n \ {0}), whereas A ∈ R n×n is a P 0 -matrix (P-matrix) if, for each x = 0, there exists an index j ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that x j = 0 and x j [Ax] j ≥ 0 (x j [Ax] j &gt; 0). Note that every positive semidefinite (definite) matrix is a P 0 -matrix (P-matrix). For more details, we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The symbol μ m (A) denotes the minimum eigenvalue of a square, symmetric matrix A, whereas μ + m (A) denotes its minimum positive eigenvalue. Similarly, μ s m (A) indicates the minimum eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the square matrix A, that is the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix 1 2 (A T + A). Finally, given two vectors x, y ∈ R n , we denote by x • y := (x i y i ) n i=1 ∈ R n their Hadamard (componentwise) product, by x -1 its componentwise inverse vector 1 x 1 , . . . , 1   x n and by y/x := y • x -1 the componentwise quotient of two vectors (provided that x i = 0 for all i).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Problem definition and interior-point algorithm</head><p>Let F : R n → R n be a (point-to-point) continuous mapping and K : R n ⇒ R n a point-to-set mapping with closed and convex images. The Quasi-Variational Inequality QVI (K , F) is the problem of finding a point x * ∈ K (x * ) such that (1) holds. For sake of simplicity, we always assume that all functions involved are defined over R n , even if this request could easily be weakened. A particularly well known and studied case occurs when K (x) is actually independent of x, so that, for all x, K (x) = K for some closed convex set K . In this case, the QVI becomes the Variational Inequality VI (K , F), that is the problem of finding x * ∈ K such that F(x * ) T (yx * ) ≥ 0, ∀y ∈ K . For this latter problem, an extensive theory exists, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>In most practical settings, the point-to-set mapping K is defined through a parametric set of inequality constraints:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K (x) := {y ∈ R n | g(y, x) ≤ 0},<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where g : R n × R n → R m . We will use the following assumption.</p><p>Assumption 1 g i (•, x) is convex and continuously differentiable on R n , for each x ∈ R n and for each i = 1, . . . , m.</p><p>The convexity of g i (•, x) is obviously needed in order to guarantee that K (x) be convex, while we require the differentiability assumption to be able to write down the KKT conditions of the QVI. We say that a point x ∈ R n satisfies the KKT conditions if multipliers λ ∈ R m exist such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F(x) + ∇ y g(x, x)λ = 0, 0 ≤ λ ⊥ g(x, x) ≤ 0. (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>Note that g(x, x) ≤ 0 means that x ∈ K (x) and recall that ∇ y g(x, x) indicates the partial transposed Jacobian of g(y, x) with respect to y evaluated at y = x. These KKT conditions parallel the classical KKT conditions for a VI, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and it is quite easy to show the following result, whose proof we omit.</p><p>Theorem 1 Suppose Assumption 1 holds. If a point x, together with a suitable vector λ ∈ R m of multipliers, satisfies the KKT system (3), then x is a solution of the QVI (K , F). Vice versa, if x is a solution of the QVI (K , F) and the constraints g(•, x) satisfy any standard constraint qualification, then multipliers λ ∈ R m exist such that the pair (x, λ) satisfies the KKT conditions (3).</p><p>In the theorem above, by "any standard constraint qualification" we mean any classical optimization constraint qualification for g(•, x) at y = x such as the linear independence of the active constraints, the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification, Slater's one and so on. The KKT conditions (3) are central to our approach as our solution algorithm aims at finding KKT points of the QVI (K , F). In view of Theorem 1, the solution of these KKT conditions is essentially equivalent to the solution of the underlying QVI and, in any case whenever we can find a solution of the KKT conditions, we are sure that the corresponding x-part solves the QVI itself.</p><p>As we already mentioned, we propose to solve the KKT conditions (3) by an interior-point method designed to solve constrained systems of equations. In order to reformulate system (3) as a constrained system of equations (CE for short), we introduce slack variables w ∈ R m and consider the CE system</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H (z) = 0, z = (x, λ, w) ∈ Z (4)</formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H (x, λ, w) := ⎛ ⎝ L(x, λ) h(x) + w λ • w ⎞ ⎠</formula><p>and where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L(x, λ) := F(x) + ∇ y g(x, x)λ, h(x) := g(x, x)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Z := {z = (x, λ, w) | x ∈ R n , λ ∈ R m + , w ∈ R m + }.</formula><p>It is clear that the couple (x, λ) solves system (3) if and only if (x, λ), together with a suitable w, solves the CE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.

A related, albeit practically less crucial, question is whether we can guarantee that the sequence {z k } generated by Algorithm 1 is bounded. This obviously would guarantee that the algorithm actually has at least a limit point and therefore that a solution is certainly found. The first question will be answered in detail in the next section, whereas the second question will be dealt with in Sect. 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Nonsingularity conditions</head><p>As noted before, the main topic in order to guarantee global convergence of Algorithm 1 to a solution of CE ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is the nonsingularity of JH (z). The structure of this Jacobian is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">JH (x, λ, w) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ J x L(x, λ) ∇ y g(x, x) 0 J x h(x) 0 I 0 d i a g (w) diag(λ) ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ .</formula><p>This section is devoted entirely to the study of QVI classes for which the nonsingularity of JH can be established. It is not too difficult to give conditions that guarantee the nonsingularity of JH ; what is less obvious is how we can establish sensible and significant conditions for interesting classes of QVIs. This we achieve in two stages: in the next subsection we give several sufficient or necessary and sufficient conditions for the nonsingularity of JH which are then used in the following subsections to analyze various QVI classes. In particular, we will discuss and establish nonsingularity results for the following QVI classes:</p><p>-Problems where K (x) = c(x) + Q (the so called "moving set" case, already mentioned in the introduction); -Problems where K (x) is defined by a linear system of inequalities with a variable right-hand side; -Problems where K (x) is defined by box constraints with parametric upper and lower bounds; -Problems where K (x) is defined by "binary constraints", i.e. parametric inequalities g(x, y) ≤ 0 with each g i actually depending only on two variables: x j and y j ; -Problems where K (x) is defined by bilinear constraints.</p><p>While we refer the reader to the following subsections for a more accurate description of the problem classes, we underline that, as far as we are aware of and with the exception of the moving set case, these problem classes are all new and we can establish here for the first time convergence results, according to Theorem 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">General nonsingularity conditions</head><p>The results in this subsection do not make explicit reference to a specific structure of the QVI and, in particular, of the feasible set mapping K . However, they are instrumental in proving the more specific results in the following subsections. The first result we present is a necessary and sufficient condition for the nonsingularity of JH . Theorem 3 Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Let (x, λ, w) ∈ R n ×R m ++ ×R m ++ be given. Then the matrix N (x, λ, w)</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">:= J x L(x, λ) + ∇ y g(x, x) diag w -1 • λ J x h(x) (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>is nonsingular if and only if JH (x, λ, w) is nonsingular.</p><p>Proof We first prove the only-if-part. Let q = q (1) , q (2) , q (3) be a suitably partitioned vector such that JH (x, λ, w)q = 0. This equation can be rewritten in partitioned form as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">J x L(x, λ)q (1) + ∇ y g(x, x)q (2) = 0,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>J x h(x)q (1) + q (3) = 0, (10) diag(w)q (2) </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">+ diag(λ)q (3) = 0. (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>Solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> for q (3) gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">q (3) = -diag λ -1 • w q (2) . (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>Inserting this expression into (10) yields J x h(x)q (1) diag λ -1 • w q (2) = 0 which, in turn, gives (1) . <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> Substituting this expression into (9) finally yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">q (2) = diag w -1 • λ J x h(x)q</formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">J x L(x, λ) + ∇ y g(x, x) diag w -1 • λ J x h(x) q (1) = 0.</formula><p>However, the matrix in brackets is precisely the matrix N (x, λ, w) from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) and, therefore, nonsingular. Hence, it follows that q (1) = 0 which then also implies q (2) = 0 and q (3) = 0. Now, to prove the if-part, we show that if N (x, λ, w) is singular, then JH (x, λ, w) is singular, too. If N (x, λ, w) is singular, there exists a nonzero vector q (1) such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">J x L(x, λ) + ∇ y g(x, x) diag w -1 • λ J x h(x) q (1) = 0.</formula><p>Now, let q (2) and q (3) be vectors defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, respectively. Then ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">9</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> hold, and hence JH (x, λ, w)q = 0 for q = q (1) , q (2) , q (3) = 0. This shows that JH (x, λ, w) is singular and, therefore, completes the proof.</p><p>We next state a simple consequence of Theorem 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corollary 1 Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold and let</head><formula xml:id="formula_25">(x, λ, w) ∈ R n × R m ++ × R m</formula><p>++ be given.

Since J x L(x, λ) is positive definite by assumption, the statement is trivially satisfied under condition (a). Hence, suppose that (b) holds. Since h(x) = g(x, x), we have J x h(x) = J y g(x, x) + J x g(x, x). This implies</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">N (x, λ, w) = J x L(x, λ) + ∇ y g(x, x) diag w -1 • λ J x h(x) = J x L(x, λ) + ∇ y g(x, x) diag w -1 • λ J y g(x, x) + ∇ y g(x, x) diag w -1 • λ J x g(x, x).</formula><p>Now, the first term J x L(x, λ) in the last expression is positive definite by assumption, the second term is obviously positive semidefinite since λ, w &gt; 0, and the third term is positive semidefinite by condition (b).

Taking into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, we have, using the notation in (2) and (5),</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">g(y, x) = q(y -c(x)), h(x) = q(x -c(x))</formula><p>and, hence,</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">∇ y g(x, x) = ∇q(x -c(x)), J x h(x) = J q(x -c(x))(I -J c(x)).</formula><p>Therefore we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">N (x, λ, w) = JF(x) + S(I -J c(x)),</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">S = m i=1 λ i ∇ 2 q i (x -c(x)) + ∇q(x -c(x)) diag(w -1 • λ)J q(x -c(x)).</formula><p>Note that, for any positive λ and w, S is positive semidefinite and symmetric. Therefore, we can write S = SS T for some suitable square matrix S. Recalling that JF(x) is nonsingular by assumption, we have that the matrix N (x, λ, w) is nonsingular if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">I + JF(x) -1 SS T (I -J c(x))</formula><p>is nonsingular. In turn, since μ is an eigenvalue of JF(x) -1 SS T (I -J c(x)) if and only if 1+μ is an eigenvalue of I +JF(x) -1 SS T (I -J c(x)), we see that N (x, λ, w) is surely nonsingular if JF(x) -1 SS T (I -J c(x)) has all real eigenvalues nonnegative. But, similar to the proof of Corollary 2, it follows that JF(x) -1 SS T (I -J c(x)) has the same eigenvalues as S T (I -J c(x))JF(x) -1 S. If we can show that (I -J c(x))JF(x) -1 is positive semidefinite, we obviously also have that S T (I -J c(x))JF(x) -1 S is positive semidefinite and, therefore, has all the real eigenvalues (if any) nonnegative. Hence, to complete the proof, we only need to show that <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> implies that (I -J c(x))JF(x) -1 is positive semidefinite. In order to see this, it is sufficient to observe that for any v ∈ R n we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">v T J c(x)JF(x) -1 v ≤ J c(x) JF(x) -1 v 2 ≤ μ s m (JF(x) -1 ) v 2 ≤ v T JF(x) -1 v,</formula><p>where the second inequality follows from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. From this chain of inequalities the positive semidefiniteness of (I -J c(x))JF(x) -1 follows readily and this concludes the proof.</p><p>Note that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">15</ref>) is a condition purely in terms of F and c, neither q nor the values of λ and w are involved. The fact that q is not involved simply indicates that the nonsingularity of N is not related to the "shape" of the set Q, but only to the trajectory the moving set follows. More precisely, as will also become more clear in the following corollary, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> requires the trajectory described by c to be not "too steep", where the exact meaning of "too steep" is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.

By Proposition 3(a) in the "Appendix", we have α = sup x∈R n J c(x) . We now recall that since F is strongly monotone on R n , its range is R n , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 5.4.5]</ref>. Therefore, by Proposition 3 in the "Appendix" and taking into account that JF -1 (F(x)) = JF(x) -1 , we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">σ -1 L -1 = inf y∈R n μ s m (JF -1 (y)) sup y∈R n JF -1 (y) = inf x∈R n μ s m (JF(x) -1 ) sup x∈R n JF(x) -1 ≤ inf x∈R n μ s m (JF(x) -1 ) JF(x) -1 .</formula><p>This completes the proof.</p><p>Although the sufficient condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_44">16</ref>) is the strongest one among those we analyzed, it gives a clear geometric picture of the kind of conditions we need in order to guarantee nonsingularity. Note that Lipschitz continuity and strong monotonicity of F imply that also the inverse of F enjoys the same properties, see Proposition 5 in the "Appendix", so that L -1 and σ -1 are well defined. Furthermore, observe that (σ -1 /L -1 ) ≤ 1 (this is obvious from the very definition of these constants, see "Appendix"). Therefore <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> stipulates that c(x) is rather "flat" and consequently, K (x) varies "slowly", in some sense.</p><p>Remark 2 Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> is one of the most interesting papers where the moving set structure has been used in order to show convergence of some algorithm for QVIs. It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> that if α ≤ σ L , where α and L are the Lipschitz moduli of c and F, respectively, and σ is the strong monotonicity modulus of F, then a certain gradient projection type method converges to the unique solution of the QVI. It is then of interest to contrast this condition to our condition α ≤ σ -1</p><p>L -1 in Corollary 3 (d) (which is the strongest among the conditions we considered). If the function F is a gradient mapping, then Proposition 6 in the "Appendix" implies that σ/L = σ -1 /L -1 , so that our condition and that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> are exactly the same. However, in general σ -1 /L -1 &lt; σ/L and σ -1 /L -1 &gt; σ/L can both occur. In fact, consider the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">F(x) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ x. It is easy to see that σ (R n , F) = 1 -1 √ 2</formula><p>and L(R n , F) 1.8019. Moreover, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">F -1 (x) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 1 1 -1 0 1 0 0 -1 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ x.</formula><p>Again, it is easy to see that σ (R n , F -1 ) = 1 2 and L(R n , F -1 ) 2.2470. Therefore, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">σ (R n , F) L(R n , F) 0.1625 &lt; 0.2225 σ (R n , F -1 ) L(R n , F -1 ) ,</formula><p>and then for this function our condition is less restrictive than that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. But it is sufficient to switch the function with its inverse to get exactly the opposite. Therefore there is no one condition that dominates the other one in general.</p><p>The following example shows how condition (c) in Corollary 3 simplifies in certain situations and the way it can be used (i) to show how interesting classes of problems can be analyzed and (ii) to easily check whether this condition is actually satisfied in a concrete situation.</p><p>Example 1 The discretization of many (elliptic) infinite-dimensional QVIs involving suitable partial differential operators often leads to linear mappings of the form F(x) = Ax + b for some positive definite matrix A, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Furthermore, in many applications in mechanics an implicit-obstacle-type constraint described by the set K (x) := {y | y ≤ c(x)} for some smooth mapping c is present, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In these cases K (x) belongs to the class of moving sets with q being the identity mapping in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Taking into account that JF(x) = A, we can easily calculate</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">μ s m (JF(x) -1 )</formula><p>JF(x) -1 which is obviously a positive constant. It actually turns out that there are interesting applications where A is symmetric. Furthermore the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of A, here denoted by λ min (A) and λ max (A) respectively, are even known analytically in some cases, e.g., if A corresponds to a standard finite difference-discretization of the two-dimensional Laplace operator on the unit square (0, 1) × (0, 1). In this setting we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">μ s m (JF(x) -1 ) JF(x) -1 = λ min (A -1 ) A -1 = 1/λ max (A) 1/λ min (A) = λ min (A) λ max (A) &gt; 0.</formula><p>Hence condition (c) in Corollary 3 holds provided that J c(x) is less or equal to this positive constant, i.e. provided that c is Lipschitz continuous with a sufficiently small Lipschitz constant.</p></div>

To this end, suppose that a sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_122">{(x k , λ k , w k )} ⊆ Z I exists such that lim k→∞ (x k , λ k , w k ) = ∞. We will show that H (x k , λ k , w k ) → ∞ as k → ∞.</formula><p>We first claim that the sequence {x k } is bounded. Assume we have x k → ∞. Then condition (a1) would imply max{0, h(x k )} → ∞. Hence there would exist an index j ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that, on a suitable subsequence, h j (x k ) → +∞, and therefore also h(x k ) + w k → ∞ since w k &gt; 0. But this would imply H (x k , λ k , w k ) → ∞ and gives the desired contradiction. Hence it remains to consider the case in which (λ k , w k ) → ∞ and {x k } is bounded. Suppose that w k → ∞ and {x k } is bounded. Then {h(x k )} is also bounded due to the continuity of h. We therefore obtain h(x k ) + w k → ∞. This, in turn, implies H (x k , λ k , w k ) → ∞ which, again, is a contradiction. Thus we have to consider only the case where λ k → ∞ and {(x k , w k )} is bounded.</p><p>For λ k → ∞, let J λ be the set of indices such that {λ k j } → ∞, whereas, subsequencing if necessary, we may assume that the remaining components stay bounded. Without loss of generality, we may also assume that x k → x and w k → w. If, for some j ∈ J λ , we have w j &gt; 0, it follows that λ k j w k j → +∞ and, therefore, again H (x k , λ k , w k ) → ∞. Consequently, it remains to consider the case where w j = 0 for all j ∈ J λ .</p><p>Since (x k , λ k , w k ) belongs to Z I , we have h j (x k )+w k j &gt; 0 which implies h j ( x) ≥ 0 for all j ∈ J λ .

This implies</p><formula xml:id="formula_123">lim k→∞ L(x k , λ k ) T d = lim k→∞ ⎛ ⎝ F(x k ) T d + j ∈J λ λ k j ∇ y g j (x k , x k ) T d ⎞ ⎠ + lim k→∞ ⎛ ⎝ j∈J λ λ k j ∇ y g j (x k , x k ) T d ⎞ ⎠ = -∞</formula><p>since the first term is bounded (because {x k } → x and the functions F and ∇ y g are continuous, and because all sequences {λ k j } for j ∈ J λ are bounded by definition of the index set J λ ), whereas the second term is unbounded since λ k j → +∞ and ∇ y g j ( x, x) T d &lt; 0 for all j ∈ J λ . Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we therefore obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_124">L(x k , λ k ) d ≥ |L(x k , λ k ) T d| → ∞ for k → ∞. Since d is a fixed vector, this implies L(x k , λ k ) → ∞ which, in turn, implies H (x k , λ k , w k ) → ∞ for k → ∞.</formula><p>This contradiction, together with Theorems 1 and 2, completes the proof.</p><p>Note that condition (a1) in Theorem 12 guarantees boundedness of the x-and w-parts, whereas (a2) is needed for the λ-part. In principle, if we knew an upper bound for the multipliers value, we could add this bound to the constrained equation reformulation of the KKT system and dispense with assumption (a2) altogether; we do not elaborate further on this idea for lack of space.</p><p>Condition (a1) is a mild coercivity condition that implies neither the boundedness of K (x) for any x nor the existence of a compact set K such that K (x) ⊆ K for all x, as one might think at first sight.</p><p>Example 4 Consider a problem with K (x) = {y ∈ R | y + x 2 ≤ 1}. In this case, for every x, the set K (x) is unbounded and yet (a1) is easily seen to hold, since</p><formula xml:id="formula_125">h(x) = x + x 2 -1.</formula><p>Example 5 Consider a problem with K (x) = {y ∈ R 2 | y+x 2 ≤ 1}. In this case, for every x, the set K (x) is a ball of radius 1 and center in -x. We have</p><formula xml:id="formula_126">∪ x∈R n K (x) = R n . But h(x) = 4 x 2 -1 and so (a1) holds.</formula><p>However, uniform boundedness of K (x) does imply (a1) if some, very common and natural, further structure is assumed. So suppose K (x) = K ∩ K (x), i.e. suppose that K (x) is given by the intersection of a fixed set K and a point to set mapping K . Analytically, this simply means that if K (x) = {y ∈ R n | g(x, y) ≤ 0}, then some of the g i actually only depend on y. Obviously, if K is bounded, K (x) is uniformly bounded when x varies. In the proposition below we assume for simplicity that K is a bounded polyhedron (a quite common case, but see the remark following the proposition for a simple generalization).</p><p>Proposition 1 Let K (x) be defined by (2) with g continuous and convex in y for every x ∈ R n . Suppose that the first p inequalities of g are of the form Ay ≤ b and that the polyhedron defined by these inequalities is bounded. Then (a1) in Theorem 12 holds. Proof Denote by K the bounded polyhedron defined by the inequalities Ay ≤ b. By Hoffman's error bound, we know there exists a positive constant c such that for every x ∈ R n we have dist(x, K ) ≤ c max{0, Ax -b} . Since K is bounded, this shows that lim x →∞ max{0, Ax -b} = ∞. But then (a1) in Theorem 12 follows readily.</p><p>Remark 4 It is clear that the polyhedrality of the set K is only used to deduce that an error bound holds. Therefore, it is straightforward to generalize the above result in the following way: Suppose that the first inequalities of g define a bounded set K = {g i (y) ≤ 0, i = 1, . . . , p} and that an error bound holds for this system of p inequalities. Then (a1) in Theorem 12 holds. The literature on error bounds is vast and there are many conditions that ensure the error bound condition, polyhedrality is just one of them. We refer the interested reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Condition (a2) in Theorem 12 is a very mild constraint qualification. It is related to the well-known extended Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification (EMFCQ) for a system of inequalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1</head><p>We say that a system of continuously differentiable inequalities f (x) ≤ 0, with f : R n → R m , satisfies the EMFCQ if, for all x ∈ R n , there exists a vector d ∈ R n such that ∇ f i (x) T d &lt; 0, for all i such that f i (x) ≥ 0.</p><p>For each given x, the set K (x) is defined by the system of inequalities g(y, x) ≤ 0. It is then clear that condition (a2) is the requirement that an EMFCQ-like conditions holds just at the point y = x and that this is a much weaker requirement than requiring the EMFCQ to hold for the system g(y, x) ≤ 0. We give an example to clarify this point.</p><p>Example 6 Consider a problem with</p><formula xml:id="formula_127">K (x) = {y ∈ R | y 2 + x 2 -1 ≤ 0}. We have ∇ y g(x, x) = 2x.</formula><p>It is clear that we can find a d ∈ R such tht 2xd &lt; 0 at any point except at x = 0. Therefore, (a2) holds because we have h(0) &lt; 0. The EMFCQ, instead, is not satisfied for the set K (1). In fact ∇ y g(y, 1) = 2y and for y = 0 it is immediate to verify that the EMFCQ fails. It is interesting to observe that for this problem also (a1) clearly holds.</p><p>Furthermore, if x is greater than 1, we have K (x) = ∅, hence this simple example also shows that (a1) and (a2) together do not imply K (x) = ∅ for all x. The latter is a condition often encountered in papers dealing with algorithms for the solution of QVIs.</p><p>Armed with the developments so far, we can now study the applicability of Theorem 12 to the moving set case, which is the only setting, among those considered in the previous section, for which an additional analysis is useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The moving set case</head><p>Consider the QVI structure defined in Sect. 3.2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_128">K (x) := c(x) + Q = {y ∈ R n | q(y -c(x)) ≤ 0}, Q := {y ∈ R n | q(y) ≤ 0}.</formula><p>We recall that, in the previous section, we have given sufficient conditions for nonsingularity of JH . Such conditions presuppose that J c(x) ≤ 1 for all x ∈ R n . In the next proposition, we show that if the constraints q(x) ≤ 0 define a full-dimensional bounded set and J c(x) is uniformly bounded away from 1, then conditions (a1) and (a2) of Theorem 12 hold. Proposition 2 In the setting described above, assume that c and q are continuously differentiable. Suppose that: (b1) J c(x) ≤ α &lt; 1 for all x ∈ R n ; (b2) Q is compact and the system q(y) ≤ 0 satisfies Slater's condition, i.e. there exists ȳ such that q( ȳ) &lt; 0.</p><p>Then conditions (a1) and (a2) of Theorem 12 hold.</p><p>123</p><p>Proof Since J c(x) ≤ α for all x ∈ R n , the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies y T J c(x)y ≤ α y 2 for all x, y ∈ R n . Therefore, y T (I -J c(x))y ≥ (1 -α) y 2 for all x, y ∈ R n , hence the function xc(x) is strongly monotone on R n and, consequently, lim x →∞ x -c(x) = ∞. Now, since q i is convex for all components i, it follows that max{0, q i } and, therefore, also max{0, q(z)} is convex. Hence, the corresponding level sets are bounded for all levels if and only if at least one level set is bounded. But the level set with level zero is precisely the set Q which was assumed to be compact. It therefore follows that all level sets of the function z → max{0, q(z)} are bounded. But then lim x →∞ xc(x) = ∞ implies lim x →∞ max{0, q(xc(x))} = ∞, hence condition (a1) holds.</p><p>To show that also (a2) is satisfied, we first note that ∇ y g(x, x) = ∇q(xc(x)). Therefore, taking d := ȳ -(xc(x)), with ȳ being the Slater point from assumption (b2), the convexity of q i implies 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_129">&gt; q( ȳ) ≥ q i (x -c(x)) + ∇q i (x -c(x)) T ȳ -(x -c(x)</formula><p>for all components i such that h i (x) = q i (xc(x)) ≥ 0. But this immediately gives ∇ y g i (x, x) T d &lt; 0 for all i with h i (x) ≥ 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Final examples and comments</head><p>We complete our discussion by giving a few additional examples on which we apply the results of both this and the previous section in order to show the ability of our algorithm to solve problems that are not solvable by other methods. This will also give us the opportunity to discuss very briefly some existence implications of the results obtained so far.</p><p>An often used assumption in the analysis of algorithms and also in many existence proofs is that either K (x) is nonempty for all x ∈ R n or that there exists a convex compact set T ⊂ R n such that K (T ) ⊆ T and K (x) is nonempty for all x ∈ T . The following example shows that this assumption is not implied by our conditions.</p><p>Example 7 Consider a one dimensional QVI with F(x) = x 3 and K</p><formula xml:id="formula_130">(x) = {y ∈ R n | y 2 + x 2 + x 4 -1 ≤ 0}. First of all note that K (x) = ∅ if x ∈ [-a, a],</formula><p>where a ≈ 0.7862 is the only positive root of the equation x 2 + x 4 = 1. Furthermore, it is not difficult to see that there cannot exist a convex compact set T (which would be a closed interval in our case) such that K (T ) ⊆ T holds and K (x) is nonempty for all x ∈ T . In fact, it should be T ⊆ [-a, a] since otherwise K (x) is empty for some x ∈ T . Furthermore, 0 can not belong to T , otherwise K (0) = [-1, 1] ⊆ T . Then T should be an interval of either all negative or all positive numbers. But if nonempty, K (x) always contains both positive and negative points.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can show that the conditions of Theorem 10(a) are satisfied. We have h(x) = 2x 2 +x 4 -1, so that ∇ y g(x, x)∇ x h(x) = (2x)(4x +4x 3 ) = 8(x 2 +x 4 ) ≥ 0. Furthermore J x L(x, λ) = 3x 2 + 2λ which, for every x and positive λ, is positive. So Theorem 10(a) tells us that JH (x, λ, w) is nonsingular for any x and positive λ and w.</p><p>We next verify that also the assumptions of Theorem 12 are met. Condition (a1) is obvious from the expression of h(x), so we consider (a2). We have ∇ y g(x, x) = 2x, and if x = 0, it is sufficient to take d = -x to have ∇ y g(x, x)d &lt; 0. If x = 0, this is not possible, but in this case we also have h(x) &lt; 0 so that (a2) is satisfied. We can then conclude that every sequence generated by our interior-point method will be bounded and that every limit point is a solution of the QVI. Note that this also gives an algorithmic proof of the existence of a solution. We do not know any method that could provably solve this example. Also proving existence by using other known results seems not obvious.</p><p>As far as we are aware of, all methods for which convergence to a solution can be proved make assumptions that imply the existence of a (at least locally) unique solution and require the function F to be strongly monotone. In the following example, we present a problem with a monotone, but not strongly monotone F, that has infinitely many solutions and for which we can prove convergence of our method.</p><p>Example 8 Consider again a one dimensional problem with</p><formula xml:id="formula_131">F(x) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ -(x + 1) 4 if x ≤ -1, 0 i f x ∈ [-1, 0], x 4 if x ≥ 0 and K (x) = {y ∈ R | -10 ≤ y ≤ -2x}.</formula><p>The function F is monotone, but not strongly monotone, and the solutions of the problem are all points in [-1, 0]. The assumptions of Corollary 6 are easily checked to be satisfied; in fact a 1 = -2, b 1 = 0 and since F is monotone, its Jacobian is positive semidefinite. Also condition (a1) in Theorem 12 holds trivially. Consider then (a2) in the same theorem. We have h(x) = (-x -10, 3x) T , so that it is clear that at most one component of h can be positive at any point, a fact that easily permits to check that also (a2) is satisfied. We conclude that the interior-point method is able to find a solution of this problem which admits infinitely many solutions.</p><p>We remarked already several times that, when it comes to algorithms, the most studied QVIs are those with a moving set type of constraints. One of the most interesting papers in this category is <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> where, among other things, a wider class of problems is studied under a condition, subsequently used also by other authors, which is implied by the moving set structure (which actually constitutes the main case in which the condition below can be verified). This condition is</p><formula xml:id="formula_132">Π K (x) (z) -Π K (y) (z) ≤ α x -y , α &lt; 1, ∀x, y, z ∈ R n , (<label>33</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_133">)</formula><p>where Π K denotes the Euclidean projector on K and α is a positive constant whose exact definition is immaterial here. Roughly speaking, condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> is a strenghtening of a contraction property of the point-to-set mapping K (•). The following example shows that our assumptions do not imply condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</p><p>123</p><p>Example 9 Consider the same problem as in the previous example and, in particular, its feasible set mapping</p><formula xml:id="formula_134">K (x) = {y ∈ R | -10 ≤ y ≤ -2x}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Numerical results</head><p>In this section we report the results obtained by a preliminary implementation of the method analyzed so far on a reasonably varied set of test problems. These results are intended to show the viability of our approach and to give the reader a concrete feel for the practical behavior of the interior-point method on QVI problems. All the computations in this paper were done using Matlab 7.6.0 on an Ubuntu 10.04 64 bits PC with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 870 and 7.8 GiB of RAM. A larger set of experiments and a more detailed analysis, with comparisons, is currently being performed and will be reported elsewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Implementation details</head><p>The implemented algorithm corresponds exactly to the theoretical scheme given in Algorithm 1. In what follows we give some implementation details. At step (S.2), Algorithm 1 calls for the solution of an n +2m square linear system in order to determine the search direction d k . However, this system is very structured and some simple manipulations permit to reduce its solution to that of a linear system of dimension n. More precisely, we must find a solution ( d1 , d2 , d3 ) of the following linear system of dimension n + 2m</p><formula xml:id="formula_135">⎛ ⎜ ⎝ J x L(x, λ) ∇ y g(x, x) 0 J x h(x) 0 I 0 d i a g (w) diag(λ) ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ d 1 d 2 d 3 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ b 1 b 2 b 3 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ , (<label>34</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_136">)</formula><p>where all the quantities involved are defined in detail in Sect. 2. It is easy to verify, by substitution and by the fact that w &gt; 0, that if we compute d1 as solution of</p><formula xml:id="formula_137">J x L(x, λ) + ∇ y g(x, x) diag(w -1 • λ)J x h(x) d 1 = b 1 -∇ y g(x, x) diag(w) -1 b 3 + ∇ y g(x, x) diag(w -1 • λ)b 2</formula><p>and d2 , d3 by d3 = b 2 -J x h(x) d1 and d2 = diag(w) -1 b 3diag(w -1 • λ) d3 , respectively, this is indeed a solution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. This shows clearly that the main computational burden in solving the linear system <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> is actually the solution of an n × n square linear system. In order to perform the linear algebra involved, we used Matlab's linear system solver mldivide. The procedure just described has the advantage of reducing the dimension of the system as much as possible; however this might not always be the best strategy, since sparsity patterns could be lost. For example it might be more convenient, from this point of view, to eliminate just the λ variables and then solve the resulting n + m system in x and w. Or solve directly the original n + 2m system and leave to the solver the task of exploiting sparsity. This, as well as the choice of the most suitable linear solver, along with numerical procedures to deal with singularities, are very important issues that can have huge practical impact. We are currently investigating on these topics and will report on this research elsewhere.</p><p>In the line search at step (S.3) of Algorithm 1, we take β = 0.5, γ = 10 -2 and ξ = 2m. In order to stay in Z I we preliminarily rescale</p><formula xml:id="formula_138">d k = (d k x , d k λ , d k w ).</formula><p>First we analytically compute a positive constant α such that λ k +αd k λ and w k +αd k w are greater than 10 -10 . This ensures that the last two blocks in z k + αd k are in the interior of R 2m + . Then, if necessary, we further reduce this α until h(x k + αd k x ) + w k + αd k w ≥ 10 -10 thus finally guaranteeing that z k +αd k belongs to Z I . In this latter phase, an evaluation of h is needed for each bisection. At the end of this process, we set d k ← αd k and then perform the Armijo line-search.</p><p>The value of ρ k is set to 0.1. This is only changed, and increased by 0.1, if in the previous iteration the step size t k is smaller than 0.1. Should ρ k reach the value of 0.9, it is reset to 0.1 in the following iteration.</p><p>The stopping criterion is based on an equation reformulation of the KKT conditions which uses the Fischer-Burmeister function that, we recall, is defined by φ(a, b) = √ a 2 + b 2 -(a + b) and has the property that φ(a, b) = 0 if and only if a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0, ab = 0. The equation reformulation is then defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_139">V (x, λ) = L(x, λ) (φ(λ i , -g i (x, x))) m i=1 .</formula><p>The main termination criterion is V (x k , λ k ) ∞ ≤ 10 -4 . The iterations are also stopped if the number of iterations exceeds 1,000 or the running time exceeds 1 h.</p></div>

However in the test problem we used, we took the friction coefficient large to make the problems more difficult. More in general, we included many problems whose nonsingularity is not guaranteed (i.e. we actually do not know whether nonsingularity is satisfied or not) in order to test the robustness of the method.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> we report the numerical results of our algorithm on the test problems described above. For each problem we list -the x-part of the starting point (the number reported is the value of all components of the x-part of the starting point); -the number of iterations, which is equal to the number of evaluations of JH ; -the number of evaluations of the constraints vector g; -the number of evaluations of F, which is equal to the number of evaluations of the gradients of the constraints vector ∇g; -the value of the K K T violation measure V (x, λ) at termination. Note that for the (λ, w)-part of the starting vector, we always used λ 0 = 5 and further set w 0 = max(5, 5h(x 0 )), so as to ensure that the starting point is "well inside" Z I .</p><p>We see that overall the algorithm seems efficient and reliable and able to solve a wide array of different problems. The four failures deserve a few more comments. The failures on KunR31 and KunR32 are due to the limit on computing time (3,600 s), but the algorithm actually appears to be converging in both cases. In fact, the value of V (x, λ) at the last iteration is 1.1 × 10 -3 and 1.3 × 10 -3 , respectively. In the case of Box3A and Box3B instead, difficulties arise because of an almost singularity of the linear system giving the search direction; this leads to a failure due to the inability of the algorithm to find a step-size satisfying the acceptance criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>In order to better gauge the robustness of our algorithm we also solved all the problems using a C version of the PATH solver with a Matlab interface downloaded from http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ferris/path/ and whose detailed description can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. PATH is a well-established and mature software implementing a stabilized Josephy-Newton method for the solution of Mixed Complementarity Problems and it can be used to solve the KKT conditions of a QVI, although with no theoretical guarantee of convergence in our setting. We used the same x-part for the starting point as we used in the testing of our method. For the λ part, we considered two options. In the first we took λ 0 = 5, therefore using exactly the same starting point we used in the testing of the interior-point algorithm. In the second option we set λ 0 = 0; this latter alternative was considered because the choice of λ 0 = 5 is geared towards our interior-point method, while λ 0 = 0 seems more natural for PATH. It might be useful to remark that we run PATH with its default settings and the stopping criterions using by PRA and PATH are marginally different. In spite of this, the precision at the computed solution, measured in terms of V (x, λ), is consistently comparable. In both the tested cases, PATH was not able to solve 4 problems (the failures are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, where under the heading PATH (5) we report the timings for PATH with λ 0 = 5 and analogously under PATH (0) we have the timings for PATH with λ 0 = 0). These results seem to indicate that our method has the potential to become a very robust solver for the solution of the KKT conditions arising from QVIs.</p><p>The comparison of CPU times is somewhat more problematic. In fact one should take into account that, although the main computational burden in our algorithm is given by the solution of linear systems, a task very efficiently performed by the Matlab built-in function mldivide, we did use Matlab, an interpreted language, and furthermore, what we implemented is a straightforward version of our algorithm, with none of all those crash and recover techniques that are to be found in a well developed software as PATH. In spite of this, Sven Leyffer kindly suggested that having current CPU times would still be of interest, and so we report them in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Note that we do not report major, minor and crash iterations for PATH. In fact PRA and PATH are very unlike, and the meaning of "iteration" is so different in the two methods that we feel that, besides the number of failures, CPU time is the only other meaningful parameter to compare. These results show that even the current prototypical Matlab implementation of the interior-point method compares well to PATH, also in terms of computing times. The development of a more sophisticated C version of our method, fully exploiting its potential for parallelism, is currently under the way and more extended and detailed numerical results, along with more accurate comparisons, will be reported elsewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We presented a detailed convergence theory for an interior-point method for the solution of the KKT conditions of a general QVI. We could establish convergence for a wide array of different classes of problems including QVIs with the feasible set given by "moving sets", linear systems with variable right-hand sides, box constraints with variable bounds, and bilinear constraints. These results surpass by far existing convergence analyses, the latter all having a somewhat limited scope. In our view, the results in this paper constitute an important step towards the development of theoretically reliable and numerically efficient methods for the solution of QVIs. ∇ F 1 (ξ (1) ) T . . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_140">∇ F n (ξ (n) ) T ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ ∈ R n×n ,</formula><p>this can be rewritten in a compact way as</p><formula xml:id="formula_141">F(x) -F(y) = G(ξ )(x -y).

It seems difficult to find a stronger bound in the general context discussed here. In a more specialized situation, much better results can be obtained, see Proposition 6 below. This completes the proof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>123</head><p>The following result gives an exact estimate of the Lipschitz and strong monotonicity moduli of the inverse of a function under the assumption that the mapping F itself is a gradient mapping, i.e. that F = ∇ f for a differentiable real-valued function f . Proposition 6 Let D ⊆ R n be an open convex set and F : D → R n be a gradient mapping. Assume that F is strongly monotone with modulus σ and Lipschitz continuous with modulus L on D. Then the inverse function F -1 exists on F(D), is Lipschitz with modulus 1 σ and strongly monotone with modulus 1 L . Proof The result can easily be derived from the Baillon-Haddad Theorem, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, when D = R n . We give here a direct proof which is valid also when D = R n . In view of Proposition 5, we only have to verify the statement that F -1 is strongly monotone with constant 1 L . To this end, first consider a symmetric positive definite matrix A ∈ R n×n , let A 1/2 be the corresponding (unique) symmetric positive definite square root of A so that A 1/2 A 1/2 = A, and let A -1/2 be the inverse of A 1/2 . Then the symmetry of A 1/2 together with the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies</p><formula xml:id="formula_144">d 2 = d T d = d T A 1/2 A -1/2 d ≤ A 1/2 d • A -1/2 d , ∀d ∈ R n .</formula><p>Squaring both sides shows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_145">d 4 ≤ d T Ad d T A -1 d , ∀d ∈ R n (41)</formula><p>holds. Since F is strongly monotone, the Jacobian JF(x) is positive definite for all x ∈ D; furthermore, since F is a gradient mapping, this Jacobian is also symmetric. Hence we can apply inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> to the matrix A := JF(x) and obtain By a well-known result, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 5.4.3]</ref> this is equivalent to saying that F -1 is strongly monotone on F(D) with constant 1/L.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Algorithm 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Potential Reduction Algorithm (PRA) for QVIs (S.0) : Choose z 0 ∈ Z I , β, γ ∈ (0, 1), and set k := 0, a T = (0 T n , 1 T 2m ).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Proposition 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>The smallest L for which such relation holds is termed the Lipschitz modulus of F on D: L(D, F) := supx =y,x,y∈DF(x) -F(y) xy . (d) F is a homeomorphism of D onto F(D) if F is one-to-one on D (that is F(x) = F(y)whenever x, y ∈ D, x = y, or, in other words, F has a single-valued inverse F -1 defined on F(D)), and F and F -1 are continuous on D and F(D), respectively. Characterizations of the Lipschitz and strong monotonicity moduli are given in the following result. Let D ⊆ R n be an open, convex subset of R n and let F : D → R n be a continuously differentiable function. Then the following statements hold: (a) F is Lipschitz continuous on D with constant L if and only if JF(x) ≤ L for all x ∈ D; consequently L(D, F) = sup x∈D JF(x) , provided the sup on the right hand side is finite.(b) F is strongly monotone on D with constant σ if and only if h T JF(x)h≥ σ h 2 for all x ∈ D, h ∈ R n ; consequently σ (D, F) = inf x∈D μ s m (JF(x)),provided the inf on the right hand side is positive.Proof (a) From Theorem 3.2.3 in<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, if JF(x) ≤ L then L is a Lipschitz constant for F on D. Conversely, assume thatF(x) -F(y) ≤ L xy , ∀x, y ∈ D (35)holds. Applying the differential mean value theorem to each component function 123 F i of F, it follows that, for any given x, y ∈ D, we can find suitable points ξ (i) ∈ (x, y) such that F i (x) -F i (y) = ∇ F i (ξ (i) ) T (xy) ∀i = 1, . . . , n.</figDesc></figure>

Then F is co-coercive with constant σ L 2 . Furthermore, it holds that the inverse F -1 exists on F(D), is Lipschitz with constant 1 σ and strongly monotone with constant σ L 2 . Proof We can writeF(x) -F(y) T (xy) ≥ σ xy 2 , ∀x, y ∈ D and F(x) -F(y) 2 ≤ L 2 xy 2 , ∀x, y ∈ Dby assumption. A combination of these two inequalities yieldsF(x) -F(y) 2 ≤ L 2 xy 2 ≤ L 2 σ F(x)-F(y) T (xy), ∀x, y ∈ D. (40)Hence F is co-coercive with constant σ L 2 . By Proposition 4 we know that F is a homeomorphism from D to F(D) and F -1 is Lipschitz continuous with constant 1 σ .
