<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, many unions or countries have announced a new round of development plans in manufacturing. For example, the European Union proposed 20-20-20 goals to achieve a sustainable future, which means 20% increase in energy efficiency, 20% reduction of CO2 emissions, and 20% renewables by 2020. Those goals can only be realized by incorporating more intelligence into industrial manufacturing process. The US government has proposed a new industrial internet framework for developing the next generation of manufacturing. Japan announced a revitalization plan for manufacturing. Germany proposed the concept of industry 4.0, the main aim of which is to develop smart factories for producing smart products. Similarly, China has announced a new manufacturing plan more recently, which is known as China Manufacturing 2025, the aim of which is also to make the manufacturing process more intelligent. As an important part of manufacturing, the process industry needs to be re-formulized in the era of new information technologies. How to improve process understanding and accumulate effective knowledge plays an important role in all aspects of the process industry, such as sustainability design, system integration, advanced process/quality control, decision supports, etc. From the viewpoint of automation, data mining and analytics may serve as a basic tool to promote the process industry from machine automation to information automation and then to knowledge automation.</p><p>In the past several decades, a large amount of data has been achieved in the process industry, due to the wide use of distributed control systems. While it becomes more and more difficult to build first-principle models in those increasingly complex processes, data-driven process modeling, monitoring, prediction and control have received much attention in recent years. At the very beginning, those large amounts of data have rarely been used for detailed analyses, which are instead only used for routinely technical checks and process log fulfillments. Later, awareness of the importance in extracting information from data has taken a leading role in the process industry. At the same time, the technical development of database and data analyses has been in a fast pace during those years. Therefore, researches on data mining and analytics in the process industry have become quite popular since then <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. By analyzing the patterns of process data and relationships among variables, useful information can be extracted, based on which statistical models can then be developed for various applications, such as process monitoring, fault diagnosis, mode clustering, soft sensing of key variables/quality variables, etc. In a word, the main aim of data mining and data analyses is to extract useful information from process data, and transfer it to effective knowledge for improvement of understanding and decision supports of the process.</p><p>To effectively carry out data mining and analytics in the process industry, machine learning algorithms have always played an important role. There are four different types of machine learning algorithms, termed as unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. While the reinforcement learning is used in robotics, gaming and navigation areas, other three types of machine learning have all been widely used for data mining and analytics in the process industry. According to the introduction provided by Wikipedia, machine learning is a subfield of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. However, the theory of probability and statistics also plays a very important role in modern machine learning. Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a ''Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and later Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition: ''A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Compared to other definitions, this definition is more notable. Since its definition, machine learning has attracted lots of attention in various areas, such as pattern recognition, industrial applications, bioinformatics, image analyses, etc. Although the research of machine learning sunk for several times, the ship has been re-sailed and will become increasingly more powerful since we entered the 21 century.</p><p>During past several decades, machine learning has been playing an important role in constructing experience based models from process data, based on which useful information can be extracted, new patterns of data can be identified, predictions can be made more easily for new data samples, decisions can be made more quickly and effectively, etc. All these applications of machine learning have fundamentally changed the manufacturing style of the process industry. For data mining and analytics in the process industry, lots of works have been reported in the past years, among then there are several reviews and books which provided more detailed state-of-the-art of the research on this topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, there exists no such a report that details data mining and analytics from the viewpoint of machine learning, although the terminology has been mentioned many times in various papers and books.</p><p>The first aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review on data mining and analytics in process industry up to date, from the viewpoint of machine learning. This will include reviews on the topics of unsupervised learning, supervised learning and semi-supervised learning methods for applications in the process industry. Under each specific review topic, various applications of machine learning algorithms will be introduced, with detailed discussions among different methods. The second aim of this paper is to provide new perspectives for future applications of machine learning algorithms in the process industry. With the rapid development of the modern industry, new phenomena of process data have emerged, e.g. big data problem, which need to be carefully addressed when applying machine learning methods. On the other hand, the technology of machine learning itself continues to evolve all the time. For example, neural networks have been used for data mining for many years. With the increased computing power, we can create neural networks with many layers, which is known as deep learning neural networks. Both of the change in industry environments and the increased power of modern technologies have made the application of machine learning more challenging, more exciting, and thus need more future investigations and more ambitious researchers to explore in this area.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, the main methodologies of data mining and analytics in the process industry are provided. Detailed machine learning reviews for data mining and analytics are carried out in section III, in which discussions and some remarks are also provided. In section IV, some new perspectives on the topic of machine learning applications in the process industry are presented. Finally, conclusions are made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODOLOGY OF DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS</head><p>In this section, the methodology of data mining and analytics is illustrated, with detailed descriptions and discussions in each of the main procedures, including data preparation, data pre-processing, model selection, training, performance evaluation, and data mining and analytics based on the trained model. It should be noted that there are too many application aspects of data mining and analytics in the process industry, only some commonly used ones are discussed here. An overview of the data mining and analytics methodology is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, in which the areas related to machine learning are highlighted in yellow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. DATA PREPARATION</head><p>Data preparation is an initial step for machine learning model development, and the aim of this step is to get an overview of the process data and then select the most appropriate data samples for modeling. The main tasks of this step are to extract the dataset from the historical database, examine the structure of the dataset, and make data selections through sample and variable directions, etc. In order to extract an effective dataset from the historical database, the operating regions of the process need to be analyzed, and any changes of operating condition also need to be identified. To ensure the efficiency for the information extraction step, the natures or characteristics of the process data should be analyzed, such as  non-Gaussianity, linear/nonlinear relationships among different variables, time-series correlations, etc. Another important issue of this step is to carry out sample and variable selections. Actually, this is highly related to the step of machine learning model development <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It depends on what kind of model we want to develop, and what is the main task of the model. For example, if the machine learning model is developed for monitoring a specific part of the process, e.g. PCA model, then a dataset from a stable operating condition of the process needs to be selected, and the corresponding variables in this specific part should be selected for modeling. If the aim of the model is for quality prediction, then those variables which are highly related to the predicted quality variables/indices needs to be picked out for development of the machine learning model. In summary, data preparation is a fundamental step for machine learning of the process data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. DATA PRE-PROCESSING</head><p>After the dataset has been prepared in the previous step, data pre-processing needs to be carried out in order to improve the quality of the data, and some appropriate data transformations may be needed to make the data modeling more efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. First, the time axis of the process data should be carefully checked, any inconsistency needs to be eliminated. To do this, some methods for time warping/dynamic time warping may be useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Second, outliers and gross errors should be removed from the modeling dataset, which will otherwise greatly deteriorate the performance of the machine learning model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Third, there may be some missing data in the prepared dataset, those missing values need to be addressed, e.g. deletion of the sample, missing value estimation, Bayesian inference, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Fourth, the scale difference among process variables needs to be considered. For example, process variables are always normalized to zero means and unit variance in the PCA modeling method, in which the scale difference among different variables has been removed. As a result, the data model will not be inclined to any process variable, which means all variables are equally considered no matter how big or how small the absolute value is. However, this data-preprocessing step needs to be addressed carefully, since some models or learning tasks may have requirements on different scales for different variables. In this case, there are also other data-scaling and data transformation methods which may enhance the performance of the data model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. MODEL SELECTION, TRAINING, AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</head><p>When the training dataset is ready to use, we are in the position to select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for data model construction. Based on the detailed analyses of data characteristics, the complexity of the data model can be evaluated <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; for example, what kind of model we should employ for machine learning of the training dataset? How much complexity the model structure should provide to describe the data information? Is a single model structure enough? Or is a multiple model structure needed? And so on. Take the regression based modeling for an example, if the relationships among the two types of variables are linear, then a multivariate linear regression learning algorithm can be selected; if there are strong nonlinear relationships, a nonlinear learning algorithm such as artificial neural networks or support vector regression model is required; if multiple operating conditions have been identified in the training dataset, a multiple regression model structure needs to be selected; or if the time-series dynamic feature is obvious in some process variables, a dynamical learning method should be employed to include the dynamic information of the process data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Although there is no unified model selection method, the machine learning community provides several useful rules or criterions which could be considered as promising tools for model selection, such as Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, Hannan-Quinn Criterion, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Once the structure of the model has been selected, the model parameters can be determined by implementing the machine learning algorithm on the training dataset. In this step, different data models depend on their own learning algorithms, most of which can actually be formulated as optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Before putting the model for online utilization, its performance needs to be evaluated. There are many well defined methods for model validation and performance evaluation, such as cross-validation, model stability analysis, model robust analysis, parameter sensitivity analysis, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To do model validation and performance evaluation, another separate testing or validation dataset is always required. However, in some particular cases, we may not be able to obtain sufficient data to carry out separate model validation and performance evaluation. In this case, some re-sampling methods such as bagging and boosting, and the Bayesian learning algorithms are particularly useful. With the change of the process operating condition, model selection, training and performance evaluations should be carried out periodically, in order to provide a satisfactory model for data mining and analytics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS</head><p>Now, suppose the machine learning procedure is completed, and the data model has been trained and validated. The model can now be used for both offline and online data mining and analytics, such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, data visualization, trend analysis, process monitoring and fault diagnosis, fault classification, online soft sensing and quality prediction, and so on. Several examples are provided as follows.</p><p>For process monitoring and fault diagnosis, appropriate statistics can be constructed for online monitoring the operating condition of the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For example, two monitoring statistics T 2 and SPE are usually constructed in multivariate statistical monitoring methods. By defining control limits for those two monitoring statistics, the good and bad operating condition of the process can be well differentiated. If the values of the monitoring statistics exceed their corresponding control limits, a fault alarm should be triggered, which denotes the abnormal condition of the process. In this case, further analyses need to be carried out, in order to find the root cause of the abnormal event. This is the main task of fault diagnosis, which has been researched in the process industry for many years <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Fault diagnosis intends to provide detailed reasons for the announced fault in the process. Depending on different fault diagnosis methods, the root causes of the fault may be located in a small part of the process or precisely to some specific sensors/actuators <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>As soon as the fault diagnosis results have been obtained, an evaluation report about the operating performance of the process can be generated, based on which appropriate process improvements or optimizations can be made afterward <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>There may be various abnormal events or faults that can occur in the process. Therefore, when a fault alarm has been trigged in the process, we may want to know which type of faults it belongs to. This is corresponding to the data/fault classification problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. For data classification modeling, machine learning has provide many useful algorithms, detailed reviews of which will be provided in the section 3. In order to develop an effective classification model, acquirements of data information from different fault types are important. If the detected data pattern/fault can be successfully identified, it may provide a great convenience for engineers to understand the condition of the process, and thus appropriate maintenance strategy can be quickly formulated.</p><p>In order to examine the data pattern of the process, e.g. how many clusters are among the whole dataset, clustering analysis can be carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This can be done in both offline and online stages. In the offline stage, different clusters can be identified, which may correspond to various operating modes of the process. This clustering result can help one to understand the operating pattern/mode of the process, depending on which specific data mining and analytics can take place for different clusters. As a result, different process improvements or decision supports can be made for different operating regions of the process. In the online stage, the pattern of the new data sample can be identified and located in a specific operating region of the process. Therefore, the corresponding data model or process knowledge can be employed for information mining and analytics of the new data. This will greatly improve the efficiency for online data mining and analytics.</p><p>Usually, the dimensionality of the process data is very high, due to the wide use of various instrumentation tools in modern industry processes. Carrying out data mining and analytics from the original high-dimensional process variables is difficult, since those variables are highly correlated with each other, and data information is strongly overlapped, making data visualization difficult. Therefore, dimensionality reduction is necessary for mining effective data information from the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. With the help of dimensionality reduction, the key data information can be extracted while simultaneously the computational complexity of the following data analytics procedures could be significantly reduced. Furthermore, with the compression of data information, data visualization will become much easier which is of great importance for information expression and results release.</p><p>Another interesting application of data mining and analytics is for soft sensing or prediction of key performance indices in the process. While those ordinary variables such as temperature and flow can be routinely recorded from the process, some key performance indices are very difficult to measure online <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For example, measuring the melt index in the polypropylene production process is very difficult, the value can only be obtained through laboratory analysis. If those key performance indices cannot be measured on time, the control system will be introduced by a significant delay. Fortunately, based on soft sensing or prediction modeling techniques, those key performance indices may be estimated online. Through mining the regression relationships between the ordinary process variables and those key performance indices, predictive data models can be derived and applied for online prediction of new data samples. As a result, realtime predictions can be obtained through regression analytics based on the predictive model. Actually, this predictive data mining and analytics can be applied throughout the whole process, including quality estimation, key performance index prediction, energy consumption estimation, environment performance evaluation, economic performance calculation, etc. All of those results from predictive data mining and analytics can help us to improve the efficiency and understanding of the process system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MACHINE LEARNING METHODS APPLIED IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRY</head><p>This section carries out a systematic review on machine learning methods that have been applied in the process industry in the past years. As have been mentioned, machine learning methods can be partitioned into four different categories: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semisupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Two of the most widely adopted machine learning methods are supervised learning and unsupervised learning, which may account 80-90 percent of all industry applications. While semisupervised learning methods have recently been used for data classification and regression in the process industry, the reinforcement learning has rarely been used in this area.</p><p>Cases in which the data consists of samples of the inputs along with their corresponding targets are termed as supervised learning applications. For example, for process fault classification, we try to classify the faults into different categories. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task of supervised learning is called regression. A typical example of the data regression problem is the prediction of the key performance in the process, in which the inputs contain routinely recorded process variables such as temperature and pressure. Those applications in which the data only consists of a set of inputs without any corresponding targets are known as unsupervised learning. The goal of such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data which is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to lowdimensional space for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and data visualization. Semi-supervised learning has recently attracted much attention in the process industry, which is applied for similar purposes as supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data are typical assumed for modeling. Semi-supervised learning is particularly useful when the cost associated with labeling is too high to allow for a fully labeled training process. Instead, unlabeled data is much cheaper and takes less effort to acquire from the process. This type of machine learning methods can also be used for data classification, regression and prediction of key performance indices of the process. With appropriate information integrations, model structure modifications and training improvements, both unsupervised learning and supervised learning methods can be made semi-supervised. Therefore, semi-supervised learning can be considered as a bridge connecting unsupervised learning and supervised learning.</p><p>Machine learning methods that have been widely used in the process industry are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Detailed literature reviews on specific topics are provided in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS</head><p>As have been introduced, the unsupervised learning methods are used against data which have no labels. The main goal of the unsupervised learning method is to explore the data and find some hidden structure among them. For industry applications, this type of machine learning methods are mainly used for dimensionality reduction, information extraction, data visualization, density estimation, outlier detection, process monitoring, etc. Conventionally applied unsupervised learning methods in the process industry include principal component analysis, independent component analysis, k-means clustering, kernel density estimation, self-organizing map, Gaussian mixture models, manifold learning, support vector data description and so on. Detailed reviews of those representative unsupervised learning methods are provided as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS</head><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Usually, the number of principal components is less than the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance, and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> provides an intuitive view of a three-dimensional data transformation example based on PCA. Compared to the original variables, principal components will not influence to each other due to the uncorrelated nature, which may greatly improve the efficiency for data analytics. Along the past 15 years, lots of applications of PCA have been made in the process industry, such as process monitoring, dimensionality reduction, data visualization, novelty detection, abnormality detection, outlier detection, etc.  The most popular application of PCA has probably been made for the process monitoring purpose. This is because process monitoring has become a hot research spot since 2000, and PCA serves as a basic modeling tool. In order to meet the requirements for monitoring processes under different conditions, various modifications and improvements have been made for the PCA method, such as nonlinear PCA, multi-model/mixture PCA, adaptive/recursive PCA, dynamic PCA, multiway PCA, and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Due to the limited space of the paper, only a small part of the related and relatively new literatures are provided in the reference list.</p><p>Dimensionality reduction is another interesting application topic of the PCA method, which is quite useful in the process industry. For high-dimensional correlated process variables, data information can be greatly compressed through dimensionality reduction by the PCA method, while the main data information can be well reserved. After the dimensionality of the process variables has been reduced, further data analytics could become much easier. For example, data visualization will be physically possible if the dimensionality of the data is reduced to 2 or 3 dimensions. In the past years, there are lots of applications of PCA that have been used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Besides, the PCA method can be used for novelty detection, abnormality detection, and outlier detection, which are also common applications in the process industry. For example, a recent review of novelty detection was proved by Pimentel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. A recursive dynamic PCA model has been developed for online novelty detection under drift conditions of gas sensor arrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. An improved PCA method has been proposed for anomaly detection and applied to an emergency department <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. An Improved Methodology has been formulated for Outlier Detection in dynamic industrial process datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Besides, several robust PCA methods were developed and applied for outlier detection in the process industry [50]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS</head><p>Independent component analysis is an emerging technique for finding independent latent components from the measured variables, which is firstly proposed to handle the blind source separation problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The aim of ICA is to recover the real components from observed variables through optimization algorithms. Different from the PCA method, ICA tries to find those latent components that are both statistically independent and non-Gaussian. Therefore, ICA may reveal more meaningful information in the non-Gaussian data than PCA. Similar to the PCA method, ICA can also be used for various applications in the process industry, such as dimensionality reduction, non-Gaussian information extraction, process monitoring, data visualization, and so on.</p><p>ICA was first introduced for process monitoring and dimensionality reduction by Li and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and Kano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6) GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL</head><p>Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model for representing the presence of subpopulations within an overall population, without requiring that an observed data set should identify the sub-population to which an individual observation belongs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For those processes which have multiple operating modes or aim to produce multiple grades of products, the Gaussian mixture model is particularly useful to characterize those multi-modal data natures. Besides, the Gaussian mixture model would also be helpful in those processes which have highly nonlinear relationships among process variables, or the distributions of some process variables are non-Gaussian.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7) MANIFOLD LEARNING METHODS</head><p>For dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data for the process industry, the manifold learning method has recently been introduced. High-dimensional data requires more than two or three dimensions to represent, which is practically difficult to interpret. One approach to simplification is to assume that the data of interest lie on an embedded nonlinear manifold within the higher-dimensional space <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. If the manifold is of low enough dimension, the data can be visualized in the low-dimensional space. Conventionally used manifold learning methods include principal curves, generative topographic mapping, Gaussian process latent variable model, maximum variance unfolding, isomap, locally linear embedding, laplacian eigenmaps, diffusion maps, neighborhood preserving embedding, locality preserving projections, etc. Based on the nonlinear dimensionality reduction procedure provided by the manifold learning method, further data analytics can be carried out, such as process monitoring, fault detection and fault diagnosis, soft sensor modeling and applications, and so on.</p><p>Shao and Rong <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> proposed a nonlinear process monitoring method based on the maximum variance unfolding projection method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8) SUPPORT VECTOR DATA DESCRIPTION</head><p>The method of support vector data description is similar to one-class support vector machine, based on which the boundary of a dataset can be used to detect novel data or outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>. SVDD obtains a spherically shaped boundary around a dataset, which defines a region for description of normal data samples. By introducing the kernel trick, the SVDD method can be made flexible to use various kernel functions and thus is able to describe highly nonlinear data. The main features of the SVDD method are demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. According to the feature of the SVDD method, it can be used for novel detection, outlier detection, monitoring abnormality of data, etc. Along the past years, the SVDD method has been introduced into the process industry, and lots of applications of this method have been reported. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref> used the SVDD method to characterize the non-Gaussian data information extracted by the ICA model, and defined the control limit of the developed statistic for monitoring non-Gaussian systems. A similar SVDD based non-Gaussian statistical modeling method has been proposed for process monitoring by Ge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9) SUMMARY</head><p>In summary, unsupervised learning methods have been widely used in the process industry in the past two decades. The most applications of the unsupervised method were made through the PCA model. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> provides a general application status about all of the 8 main unsupervised learning methods between 2000 and 2015, which is based on the key database in the web of science. It can be seen that the applications based on the PCA model accounts over half of the all applications. In recent years, with more and more manifold learning algorithms introducing into the process industry, the applications of these methods grow rapidly, which accounts for 12% of all industrial applications. Particularly, detailed applications of all unsupervised learning methods in terms of dimensionality reduction, outlier detection, process monitoring, and data visualization are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. It can be seen that PCA plays as a dominant role in each application aspect. For dimensionality reduction, the manifold learning method has also served a lot of applications, due to its great ability in nonlinear dimensionality reduction. The self-organizing map method has provided a comparative application number in terms of data visualization, compared to PCA. This is mainly because self-organizing map describes a mapping from a high-dimensional data space to a low-dimensional data space, which makes data visualization more convenient for the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. SUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS</head><p>Different from the unsupervised learning method, supervised learning deals with labeled data samples, discrete or continuous. When the label of the data sample is a discrete value, the supervised learning can be used for classification of process data, e.g. fault classification, or operating mode classification. Otherwise, when the label of the data sample is a continuous value, regression models can be constructed for prediction and estimation purposes. Main applications of the supervised machine learning method include process monitoring, fault classification and identification, online operating mode localization, soft sensor modeling and online applications, quality prediction and online estimation, key performance index prediction and diagnosis, etc. Some well used supervised learning methods in the process industry include principal component regression, partial least squares, fisher discriminant analysis, multivariate linear regression, neural networks, support vector machine, nearest neighbor, Gaussian process regression, decision tree, random forest, and so on. Detailed reviews of those representative supervised learning methods are provided as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION</head><p>Principal component regression (PCR) is a regression analysis technique that is based on principal component analysis method. In this method, instead of regressing the dependent variable on the explanatory variables directly, the principal components of the explanatory variables which are extracted by the PCA method are used as regressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>. Therefore, the major use of the PCR method is similar to PCA, which lies in overcoming the multicollinearity problem which arises when two or more of the explanatory variables are close to being collinear. This is the common situation that happens in the process industry. As a result, both of the PCA and PCR methods have been widely used in the past years.  Compared to the PCA method, further information has been incorporated into the PCR method. Based on the regression modeling between the extracted principal components from PCA and the dependent variable, various applications have been made in the process industry, such as quality-related process monitoring, soft sensor modeling, online product quality prediction, etc.</p><p>Here are some typical and recent application examples in the process industry. Xie and Kalivas <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> developed local prediction models based on the PCR method.</p><p>Hartnett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref> made online dynamic inferential estimation for the process by using the PCR model. Yang and Gao <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> developed a nonlinear form of the PCR model, and used it for online prediction and control for the product weigh in the injection molding process. PCR was combined with the residual analysis method for determination of multivariate concentration by Keithley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>. A mixture probabilistic form of the PCR model has been proposed for online soft sensor development and was applied to multimode processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref> used the PCR method for near-infrared spectroscopic calibration modeling and quality analysis. Yuan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref> developed a locally weighted form the PCR model for online soft sensing of nonlinear time-varying processes. Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> applied the PCR method for identification of key factors which influenced primary productivity in two river-type reservoirs. Other related applications of the PCR methods include Khorasani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>, Kolluri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>, Popli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>, Ghosh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES</head><p>Partial least squares regression (PLS regression) is a statistical modeling method, which is quite similar to the PCR method. However, instead of finding hyperplanes of minimum variance between the response and independent variables, PLS finds a linear regression model by simultaneously projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to the latent variable space <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>. Therefore, the predicted variables and the observable variables are connected through the latent variables. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the main idea of the PLS method, where X and Y correspond to observable and predicted variables, T and U are components in the latent variable space, and P and Q are loading matrices of X and Y, respectively. To date, PLS has been widely used in chemometrics and related areas, although the original applications of this method were in the social sciences. In the process industry, PLS has been used for quality-related process monitoring, fault classification, soft sensor development and online applications, product quality predictions, and so on. Here are some examples of the PLS method applied in the process industry. Kresta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[144]</ref> applied the PLS method for development of inferential process models. Kruger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[145]</ref> proposed an extended PLS approach for enhanced condition monitoring of industrial processes. Zhang and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[146]</ref> proposed a modified PLS method and combined with the independent component regression model for monitoring complex processes.

Shao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[152]</ref> developed an online soft sensor design method by using local PLS models with adaptive process state partition. A MATLAB toolbox was recently been developed for class modeling based on oneclass PLS classifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[153]</ref>. Vanlaer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref> used the PLS method for quality assessment of a variance estimator in prediction of batch-end quality. A multiway interval form of the PLS model was proposed for batch process performance monitoring by Stubbs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[155]</ref>. Godoy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[156]</ref> made several new contributions to nonlinear process monitoring through the use of the kernel PLS model. A comparison and evaluation of key performance indicator-based multivariate statistics process monitoring has been carried out between the PLS method and other related approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[157]</ref>. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[158]</ref> proposed a total projection form of the PLS model for the purpose of process monitoring. Qin and Zheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[159]</ref> formulated a concurrent form of the PLS model, and used it for quality-relevant and processrelevant fault monitoring. Peng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[160]</ref> developed a quality-related prediction and monitoring for multi-mode processes based on multiple PLS method, and applied it to an industrial hot strip mill.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) FISHER DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS</head><p>Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) is a supervised linear dimensionality reduction technique designed for data classification. The basic idea of FDA is to seek a transformation matrix which maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes the within-class scatter simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[161]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> provides an illustration of the FDA method, where Sw means within-class covariance and Sb is the betweenclass covariance. Due to the ability of the FDA method in dimensionality reduction and data classification, it has been widely used in the process industry. The method can be used directly for classification of different operating modes in the process, or to differentiate various faults that happen in the process. On the other hand, FDA can be applied as a dimensionality reduction step, which can efficiently extract data information that makes the subsequent data classification step more convenient.</p><p>In the past years, FDA has mainly been used for process monitoring, fault classification and fault diagnosis purposes in the process industry.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6) SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE</head><p>Support vector machine is a supervised machine learning method, which was originally developed by Vapnik in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[201]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[202]</ref>, with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, conventionally used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new samples into one category or the other. The main idea of SVM is to construct a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high or infinite-dimensional space, based on which different types of data samples can be well separated. When the target data is continuous, support vector regression model can be developed for regression analysis. In addition to performing linear classification/regression, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification/regression using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. More detailed descriptions of SVM classification and regression algorithms can be found in Vapnik <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[202]</ref>, Schölkopf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[203]</ref>, and Schölkopf and Smola <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[204]</ref>.</p><p>Since SVM was proposed by Vapnik, it has become more and more popular in various application areas, due to its great modeling abilities in data classification and regression. Compared to other widely used supervised learning methods such as artificial neural networks, SVM may have better generalizations under many cases. In the process industry, particularly, SVM has also gained lots of successful applications, in terms of process monitoring, fault classification, soft sensor developments, product quality regression modeling and predictions, etc.</p><p>Due to the data classification ability of SVM, it has been used for process monitoring, fault classification and diagnosis in the past years. Due to the limited space, only some recent application examples are presented here.

Multi class SVM has been used for simultaneous fault diagnosis in a Dew Point process <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[211]</ref>. A weighted form of the SVM method was developed for control chart pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[212]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7) NEAREST NEIGHBORS</head><p>Nearest neighbors algorithm also known as k-nearest neighbors is a non-parametric method in machine learning, which can be used for both classification and regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[230]</ref>. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training samples in the feature space. The output depends on whether the method is used for classification or regression. For data classification, the output is a class membership. A data sample is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors. If k is selected as 1, the output of the data sample will simply be assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor. For data regression, the output is a continuous value for the data sample. Normally, the output value for the predicted data sample is determined through averaging the values of its k nearest neighbors. In this method, the model structure is totally open to any type. For both classification and regression, NN or kNN has been considered as one of the simplest method of machine learning algorithms. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> gives examples of the NN method for data classification and regression.</p><p>In the past years, like other supervised machine learning algorithms, NN or kNN has also been used for various applications in the process industry, e.g. process monitoring, fault classification and soft sensor development.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8) GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION</head><p>The concept of Gaussian processes is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, since it is based on the notion of the Gaussian distribution. Statistically, it can be seen as an infinite-dimensional generalization of multivariate normal distributions. In a Gaussian process, every point in the input space is associated with a normally distributed random variable. The distribution of a Gaussian process is the joint distribution of all those random variables, and thus it is actually a distribution over functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">[242]</ref>. It has been demonstrated that a large class of methods will finally converged to an approximate Gaussian process. Inference of continuous values with a Gaussian process prior is known as Gaussian process regression. In this case, the Gaussian process can be used as a prior probability distribution over functions in Bayesian inference. Thus, given some available data samples, the distribution over functions can be inferred through Bayesian method, providing the posterior for the distribution. An illustration for the Gaussian process regression method is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>, where the left figure denotes samples from the prior distribution, and the right figure presents samples from posterior distribution through Bayesian method.</p><p>To date, the Gaussian process regression method has mainly been used for soft sensor modeling, quality-related monitoring and prediction purposes in the process industry. Here are some application examples based on the Gaussian process regression method. A combined local Gaussian process regression model has been proposed for quality prediction of polypropylene production process <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">[243]</ref>.

Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[245]</ref> proposed an independent component regression-Gaussian process algorithm for real-time mooney-viscosity prediction of mixed rubber. Chen and Ren <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[246]</ref> introduced the bagging approach into Gaussian process regression model, in order to improve its performance. Grbic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[247]</ref> developed an adaptive soft sensor for online prediction and process monitoring based on a mixture of Gaussian process models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9) DECISION TREE</head><p>As its name indicates, a decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model to describe relationships among different variables and makes decisions. Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, particularly in decision analysis, in order to help identify a strategy that most likely to reach the aim <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">[252]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[254]</ref>. Recently, decision tree has also been introduced into the process industry. The most common applications have been made in process monitoring, fault diagnosis, and quality prediction. For example, Kuo and Lin <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[255]</ref> used neural network and decision tree for prediction of machine reliability; Yeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">[256]</ref> used the decision algorithm to extract classification knowledge in mold tooling test; A fuzzy decision tree method was proposed by Zio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">[257]</ref> for fault classification in the steam generator of a pressurized water reactor; Ma and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[258]</ref> carried out inductive data mining based on genetic programming for automatic generation of decision trees from data, and used it for process historical data analysis; He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[259]</ref> applied the decision tree learning technique for online monitoring and fault identification of mean shifts in bivariate processes; Demetgul <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[260]</ref> proposed a fault diagnosis method for production system with support vector machine and decision trees algorithms; An approach for automated fault diagnosis based on a fuzzy decision tree and boundary analysis of a reconstructed phase space has been proposed by Aydin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[261]</ref>; An improved decision tree construction method was developed and used for fault diagnosis in rotating machines, which is based on attribute selection and data sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b260">[262]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10) RANDOM FOREST</head><p>The general method of random forest was first proposed by Ho in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[263]</ref>. It is a notion of the general technique of random decision forests, which can be used for classification, regression and other tasks. Usually, the method of random forest is carried out by constructing a multitude of decision trees based on the training dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">[264]</ref>. When used for new data samples, the method outputs the mode class (when it is used for classification) or the mean prediction value (when it is used for regression) of the individual trees. Similar to the decision tree method, random forest has also been introduced into the process industry. Here are some application examples. Pardo and Sberveglieri <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[265]</ref> used random forests and nearest shrunken centroids for the classification of sensor array data. Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[266]</ref> developed a random forest classifier for machine fault diagnosis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11) SUMMARY</head><p>To summarize the supervised machine learning methods used in the process industry since 2000, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> provides an overview of application status for 10 different supervised learning methods, the results of which are from the key database of Web of Science. As can be seen, artificial neural networks and partial least squares are two most widely used methods in the past 15 years, which account for over half applications in the process industry. More specifically, application statuses of all those supervised learning methods in terms of process monitoring, fault classification, soft sensor and quality prediction are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>. For the purpose of process monitoring, PLS and ANN have played dominant roles. Due to the great ability of SVM in data classification, it has gained the most applications in fault classification. For soft sensor developments and quality predictions, PLS and ANN are also the two most popular methods which occupy about 60% of all applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS</head><p>For applications in the process industry, the semi-supervised learning method is particularly useful when the cost of labeling data samples is expensive or time consuming. For example, assigning the type of detected faulty data samples is a difficult task, which may require process knowledge and experiences of process engineers, thus will be costly and may need a lot of time. As a result, there are only a small number of faulty samples that are assigned to their corresponding types. Although most faulty samples are unlabeled, they still contain important information of the process. If those unlabeled samples can be used in a good way, the efficiency of the fault classification system could be greatly improved. In this case, semi-supervised learning with both labeled samples and unlabeled samples will provide an improved fault classification model, compared to the model that only depends on a small part of labeled data samples. Another example is for quality prediction, in which a regression model needs to be developed between the ordinary process variables and quality variables. Compared to the ordinary process variable, the quality variable is much more difficult to obtain. Here, the quality variable serves as the label for the ordinary process variable. While the samples for ordinary process variables are quite easy to obtain from the process, acquirements of quality related variables are much more difficult, which are usually resorted to lab analysis, expensive analytical tools, additional human efforts, etc. As a result, the input and output samples of the regression model are imbalanced, which means there are a lot of missing output values in the historical database. Similar to the case in fault classification, those samples which only have input values also contain important information of the process. From a probabilistic modeling perspective, the distribution of the input variables will become more accurate if more sampled data are used for modeling, which may then provide a positive support to the predictive modeling performance for the quality variable. Semi-supervised learning in this case is to construct the regression model based on a small number of quality data samples and a large number of data samples from ordinary process variables. Compared to the supervised learning method, those additional unlabeled data samples may greatly improve the regression performance of the prediction model.</p><p>Compared to unsupervised and supervised learning, the application of semi-supervised learning has not received too much attention in the process industry until in the recent several years. Represented semi-supervised learning schemes include generative model based method, self-training, co-training, graph-based method, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">[270]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[271]</ref>. There are already some semi-supervised application examples in both data classification and regression. Ge and Song <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">[272]</ref> proposed a semi-supervised Bayesian method for soft sensor development, which can successfully incorporate the information from unlabeled data. Shao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">[273]</ref> proposed a Bayesian method for multirate data synthesis and model calibration. Ji et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[274]</ref> developed a recursive weighted kernel regression for semi-supervised soft sensing modeling of fed-batch processes. Ge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[275]</ref> introduced the selftraining strategy for statistical quality prediction of batch processes with limited quality data. Deng and Huang <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">[276]</ref> developed an identification method for nonlinear parameter varying systems with missing output data, which is based on a particle filter under the framework of the expectationmaximizaiton algorithm. Zhong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">[277]</ref> proposed a semi-supervised fisher discriminant analysis model for fault classification in industrial processes. Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref> proposed a semi-supervised mixture discriminant monitoring method for batch processes. Jin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b276">[278]</ref> developed a multiple model based LPV soft sensor under the condition of irregular and missing process output measurements. Ge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b277">[279]</ref> proposed a mixture semi-supervised principal component regression model for soft sensor application in the process industry, and later extended it to the nonlinear form <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[280]</ref>. Raju and Cooney <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">[281]</ref> developed an active learning method for process data modeling and applications. Ge <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">[282]</ref> also developed an active learning strategy for smart soft sensor development under a small number of labeled data samples. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">[283]</ref> proposed a semi-supervised PLVR models for process monitoring with unequal sample sizes of process variables and quality variables. Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[284]</ref> proposed a robust form of mixture semi-supervised principal component regression model for soft sensor applications. Bao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">[285]</ref> combined the co-training strategy with PLS for development of a semi-supervised soft sensor.</p><p>Due to the space of this paper, lots of machine learning methods have not been mentioned here, although they are also quite important for data mining and analytics in the process industry. For example, the Markov model is a very important class of machine learning method, which has been used for dynamic modeling of process data. To date, lots of applications has already been made in the process industry. Several regularization techniques such as L2 (Tikhonov) and L1 (lasso) have also been applied for data mining and analytics in the past decades. Like Markov model, linear dynamic systems is also a class of dynamic machine learning methods, which can be used for dynamic process data modeling and analytics. Besides, ensemble learning methods such as bagging and boosting have also been introduced into the process industry in the past years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PERSPECTIVES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>Due to the fast development of new computing technologies, machine learning today is quite different from its past. The ever increased power of modern computers has also helped data mining and analytics techniques make better use of machine learning algorithms. For example, neural networks have long been used in data mining and analytics applications. However, the computational burden could be a problem if neural networks are used to handle big computing problems. With more computing power, we can create deep neural networks with many layers, which enable fast processing and automated learning of training dataset. Another example is about the big data problem, which has recently become very popular in various areas. While many machine learning algorithms have been proposed for a long time, the ability to handle big data is a recent development, e. g. self-driving Google car, online recommendation offers like those from Amazon, knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter, etc.</p><p>For the applications of machine learning in the process industry, increasingly more new developed machine learning algorithms have been introduced. However, different from other application areas of machine learning, the process industry has its own nature which should be taken into account for promoting the grade of data mining and analytics. How to efficiently utilize the knowledge discovered from data and transfer it to effective decisions need more re-investigations under emergence of new industrial natures. Also, some fundamental issues related to machine learning based data mining and analytics such as data quality evaluation, data acquirements, model selection should be reconsidered and paid more attentions. The followings are some perspectives that we believe may lead to more future researches on the topic of data mining and analytics in the process industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. MACHINE LEARNING OF BIG DATA IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRY</head><p>With the development of modern process industry, the data volume becomes much larger, which poses great challenges to information capture, data management and storage. More importantly, it becomes difficult to efficiently interpret the information hidden within those data. With more measuring devices introduced into the process industry, different types of structured and unstructured data have been collected, such as sensor data, pictures, videos, audios, log files and so on. Qin <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">[286]</ref> details the process data analytics in modern industrial processes in the era of big data. Usually, big data refers to the size and variety of data sets that challenge the ability of traditional software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze. Often four V's are used to characterize the essence of big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[287]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[289]</ref>, termed as Volume, Variety, Value, and Velocity. According to this definition, the modern process industry is actually driven by big data.</p><p>In the era of big data, machine learning has also faced a big challenge that has never met before <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">[290]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">[291]</ref>. To date, lots of strategies have been proposed to address the machine learning problems for big data, among which the distributed learning strategy is a very attractive one <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">[291]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">[295]</ref>. For the application of machine learning in the process industry, the distributed learning strategy is particularly useful. Distributed natures of operating units, process equipment, and manufacturing plants have provided a basic application environment for the distributed machine learning strategy. Recently, a distributed modeling framework has been proposed for plant-wide process monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">[296]</ref>. In this framework, the whole industrial process is divided into various blocks, in which machine learning algorithms are employed for sub-model developments. Then, the final decision is made through fusing the results obtained from different blocks. Besides, several research challenges and promising issues have also been discussed in this paper. For distributed machine learning in the process industry, the clouding computing technology may provide an efficient tool to facilitate data mining and analytics in large-scale/plant-wide process industries. Cloud computing solutions would not only handle huge amounts of process data but also minimize operational costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. SUSTAINABILITY DRIVEN DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS</head><p>While the process industry has gained lots of developments in the past several decades, the sustainability problem has recently received great attentions, not only in energy efficiency research, but also for those issues related to environment pollution and protection, such as gas emission monitoring, sewage treatment and pollution analytics, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b295">[297]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b296">[298]</ref>. Both of the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of the process industry depend on optimal operations, which require advanced process control, monitoring and optimization. To this end, deep mining and analytics of process data may discover more useful knowledge, making the process more understandable and efficient for sustainability analyses. As a result, the process could be able to forecast the abnormal events which may cause sustainability degradation, improve the energy efficiency throughout the whole process, prediction and diagnose of key performance indices related to process safety, environment pollution, energy consumption, etc.</p><p>To carry out those advanced data mining and analytics in the process industry, machine learning always plays an important role in model training and prediction. First of all, machine learning can serve as a predictive modeling tool for advanced process and quality control. Those machine learning algorithms which can efficiently describe dynamic relationships among process data are particularly useful to real-time process control and optimization. Second, hierarchical machine learning algorithms can be employed for multi-level modeling of different key performance indices, such as operating performance, energy consumption, gas emission, recycle efficiency, and so on. Based on this developed model in different levels of the process, the sustainability indices can be connected together throughout the whole process. Therefore, the sustainability of the process can be predicted and evaluated through observing some easy-tomeasure process variables. Any performance degradation of the process sustainability can then be detected, and the root causes of which could be located for further investigations and improvements. Besides, machine learning algorithms can also be employed for sustainability performance evaluation and prediction along the evolving of the process industry from past, present to future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. PROCESS CAUSALITY MODELING AND ANALYTICS</head><p>Like other complex systems such as biological systems and social networks, the modern process industry is also featured by connecting different elements in terms of operating units, process equipment, or different sensors/measurement devices. The whole process behavior is determined by the relationships among different process elements as well as the local behavior within each element. For effective data mining and analytics, it is essential to identify connection relationships or process causality among different elements. For fault/abnormality detection and diagnosis, identification of process causality is particularly important, since the abnormality can easily propagate among various process units. Based on the effective identification of process causality, root causes of the abnormality can be located more quickly and efficiently as well as the track to its propagation path among the process.</p><p>The process causality can be captured in two ways, namely knowledge-based and data-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b297">[299]</ref>. However, for large-scale modern industrial processes, identification of process causality could be a very troublesome task, which in most time may be impossible to be captured from process knowledge or experiences from engineers. Instead, through effective mining and analytics from history data, the process causality may also be captured, which is relatively much easier for practical application. To date, several methods have been introduced or proposed for causality identification in the process industry, such as Granger causality, frequency domain methods, cross-correlation analysis, informationtheoretic methods, Bayesian networks and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b298">[300]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">[305]</ref>. However, there are still some open issues that require more deep investigations. As an extension of Bayesian networks from the view of machine learning, the probabilistic graphic modeling approach may provide a more general way for description of process causality, based on which more advanced data mining and analytics could be expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. DATA CLEANING AND QUALITY EVALUATION</head><p>This is a quite fundamental step for data mining and analytics in the process industry, since the quality of data determines the effectiveness of the following machine learning model development step. If the quality of the process data cannot be well guaranteed, even a best machine learning algorithm could generate a misleading model. Therefore, before applying the machine learning algorithms for model development, process data should be cleaned, and its quality needs to be evaluated. More specifically, the missing data should be addressed appropriately; the outliers need to be detected; the problem of different sampling rates among process variables needs to be taken into account. Besides, noises from various measurement devices and process itself should also be well considered during this step, e. g. removal, reduced, well modeled, etc. In summary, how to improve the quality of data is a critical step for machine learning, data mining and analytics for knowledge discovery.</p><p>To date, researches have been carried out on specific issues for improvements of data quality, e.g. missing data, outlier, multi-rate sampling, etc [100]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">[306]</ref>. Recently, Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> carried out an review on data cleaning in the process industry, in which different data cleaning methods have been introduced, including missing data imputation, outlier detection, noise removal and time alignment. Several future research directions on data cleaning have also been highlighted. Here, an open question is how to evaluate the quality of the process data? This is actually related to the aim of machine learning and data mining. For example, if we intend to implement a process monitoring method, outlier detection is particularly important since it will greatly deteriorate the performance of the monitoring algorithm; if we want to develop a soft sensor for predictions of key process variables, the problems of missing values and multiple sampling rates need to be taken good care of, since they play critical roles in the development of soft sensor model. To our best knowledge, those methods which can simultaneously handle several data cleaning issues have rarely been reported. Due to the advantages in dealing with irregular data, the robust machine learning algorithms may be considered as a promising way for data cleaning and quality improvement, thus should be more introduced for data mining and analytics in the process industry. Also, how to combine the data cleaning method with online machine learning algorithms is also an interesting issue for future research, as indicated in Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. SENSOR NETWORK DESIGN FOR THE PROCESS INDUSTRY</head><p>For data acquirement from the process, the design of sensor network shall be considered as an important task. This is because the sensors serve as eyes of the data system to observe the whole process. Therefore, the quality and completeness of the process data both depends on the design of sensor network. With the proposal of industry 4.0 in the past several years, the concepts of industrial internet, cyber physical systems and internet of things become more and more popular. In the same time, more and more wireless sensing technologies have been introduced into the process industry. As can be expected, most existing process sensors may be replaced by wireless sensors in the near future. For design of sensor network in the process industry, a lot of methods that have been developed in the areas of wireless sensor networks, industrial internet, cyber physical systems and internet of things can be referred and employed for utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">[316]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">[318]</ref>.</p><p>Based on a well-designed sensor network, the information of the process can be efficiently captured and transferred to useful knowledge by machine learning, data mining and analytics. Simultaneously, the obtained topology of sensor network can also be used for capturing the process causality, based on which the process behavior can be deeply described and analyzed. In the current context of industrial internet/industrial 4.0, data mining and analytics driven by new emergences of machine learning technologies may be promoted to a new level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS AND REMARKS</head><p>In this paper, methodologies of data mining and analytics in the process industry are introduced, with a systematical review through the viewpoint of machine learning. It is no doubt that machine learning plays a key role in data mining and analytics in the process industry. While both unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods have already been widely used in the process industry, which approximately accounts for 90%-95% of all applications, the semisupervised machine learning has been introduced in recent years, thus its application will become more popular in the near future. A total of 8 specific unsupervised learning methods and 10 supervised learning methods have been introduced in detail, with corresponding reviews in data mining and analytics in the process industry. Furthermore, several perspectives have been illustrated and discussed for future research on this topic. It can be expected that data mining and analytics will play increasingly important roles in the process industry, with the development of new machine learning technologies.</p><p>However, it should be noted that data mining and analytics is quite a multi-disciplinary research area, which may require expertise from process control, chemometrics, machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, etc. In order to make efficient data mining and analytics in practice, barriers among various disciplines will have to be eliminated, new educational and training strategies will need to be developed for industry and the level of cooperation between universities and the industrial sectors will need to be increased as well. In this respect, the role of data mining and analytics is to bring researchers and practitioners from different cultures to work together.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
