<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper proposes a novel approach to optimal placement of wind turbines in the continuous space of a wind farm. The control objective is to maximize the power produced by a farm with a fixed number of turbines while guaranteeing the distance between turbines no less than the allowed minimal distance for turbine operation safety. The problem of wind farm micro-siting with space constraints is formulated to a constrained optimization problem and solved by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on penalty functions. Simulation results demonstrate that the PSO approach is more suitable and effective for micro-siting than the classical binary-coded genetic algorithms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Micro-siting is one of the most fundamental problems of wind farm design. Unfortunately, only few studies were carried out. The most commonly adopted scheme, also known as the empirical method, was the staggered siting scheme, which is mainly suitable for a relatively flat wind farm with a dominant wind direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Mosetti, Poloni and Diviacco first systematically optimized turbine positions in a wind farm by a genetic algorithm (GA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Their work was further improved by Grady, Hussaini and Abdullah <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Marmidis, Lazarou and Pyrgioti <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and Wan, Wang, Yang, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In the above studies, a wind farm was partitioned into square cells, the width of which is usually five times of the diameter of the turbine rotor for operation safety. The turbines could only be placed in the center of each cell. Although this kind of "discret" siting is convenient for the realization of optimal methods, some freedom was lost so was the performance of the wind farm. Wan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed an algorithm to allow each turbine to be freely adjusted inside its cell in order to increase the energy generated by the wind farm. Unfortunately, as the constraints on turbine-minimum-distance were not considered, the turbines could be placed quite closely especially when the wind direction was dominant.</p><p>The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is easy to implement and converges quickly. Furthermore, the PSO algorithm is especially suitable for real-valued optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. In this paper, a PSO algorithm based on penalty functions is proposed for the optimal micro-siting of a wind farm in a spatially-continuous manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Formulation of Wind and Turbine Models</head><p>For completeness and clarity, this section presents the models of wind directions and speeds, the wake effects among turbines and the power evaluation of turbines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Models of Wind Direction and Speed</head><p>The wind energy rose map is used to describe the characteristics of wind direction and speed variations of a wind farm. The length of each segment of the rose map represents the frequency of the corresponding wind speed in a certain direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Models of Wake Effects</head><p>In a wind farm, wake effects among turbines could be approximated by a linear wake model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. According to the momentum balance theorem and the Betz theory, the wake speed at a given downstream distance d is <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u 0 (d) = u 0 1 -1 -1 -C T D D + 2αd 2 (1)</formula><p>where u 0 is the freedom wind speed, C T is the turbine thrust coefficient, D is the turbine rotor diameter, and α is the wake spreading constant.</p><p>For a wind farm with N turbines, the wind speed of the ith turbine, u i , can be computed according to the theory of kinetic energy balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Models of Turbine Power</head><p>The different wind directions and speeds are not considered in the above wake models for clarity. Suppose a wind farm has N turbines and the wind has M directions. Moreover, each wind direction is partitioned to P speeds. The total power of the wind farm could be calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (Z) = M i=1 P j=1 f i,j N k=1 0.3u 3 i,j,k (2)</formula><p>where f i,j is the percentage of the jth wind speed in the ith wind direction, u i,j,k is the actual wind speed on the kth wind turbine under condition of the jth wind speed in the ith wind direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Optimization Methods</head><p>Suppose the allowed minimum distance between turbines is d min . The optimal micro-siting problem is to maximize the power produced by the wind farm, i.e.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Penalty Function Method</head><p>The penalty function method is most commonly utilized to handle constraints in optimization problems. It transforms a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one by penalizing the infeasible solution based on the amount of constraint violations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>According to Equations ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">4</ref>), the present optimization problem is a maximization problem.

In this paper, the penalty function method transforms the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one so that the computational complexity is reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Particle Swarm Optimization</head><p>The PSO algorithm is a population-based, global and stochastic optimization algorithm. It was inspired by social behavior of fish schooling and bird flocking, and developed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It is easier to implement and has a faster convergence rate than the traditional evolutionary algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Additionally, it is computational inexpensive and especially suitable for the present complex continuous problem.</p><p>The PSO algorithm starts with a population of particles whose positions Z and velocities V are randomly initialized in the search space. In the present study,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Z = [Z T 1 Z T 2 • • • Z T P S ]</formula><p>T represents the position matrix of turbines for all the potential solutions in the swarm, "P S" represents the population size, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">V = [V T 1 V T 2 • • • V T P S ]</formula><p>T represents the modification to the position Z. The search for optimal position is carried out by updating the velocities and positions of the particles iteratively. The search of particles is focused toward promising regions by biasing the particles' velocities vector toward both their own historical best positions Z p and the swarm's historical best position Z g . Here, the best position of a particle or the swarm is corresponding to the smallest fitness value defined in Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> .</p><p>The velocities and positions of particles are usually updated by the following equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V(t + 1) = wV(t) + c 1 R 1 . * (Z p (t) -Z(t)) + c 2 R 2 . * (Z g (t) -Z(t)) (7) Z(t + 1) = Z(t) + V(t + 1) (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where t is the generation index, w is the inertial weight which balances the global and local search ability, c 1 and c 2 are cognitive and social parameters respectively, R 1 and R 2 are random matrices of a dimension P S × 2N whose elements are uniformly distributed within [0, 1], and ". * " represents the elementby-element product.</p><p>In order to improve the convergence ability of the PSO, a constriction factor K can be added to the velocity update rule. The effect of the constriction factor is to reduce the velocity of the particles as the search progresses and thereby contract the overall swarm diameter. This in turn results in a progressively smaller domain being searched. In this case, the velocities of particles are updated as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">V(t + 1) = K(V(t) + c 1 R 1 . * (Z p (t) -Z(t)) + c 2 R 2 . * (Z g (t) -Z(t)))<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">K = 2 |2-c- √ c 2 -4c| , c = c 1 + c 2 &gt; 4.</formula><p>Experimental results pointed out that c 1 = 2.8 and c 2 = 1.3 yielded good results for the test problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. In this paper, this type of PSO algorithm is used to solve the present problem.</p><p>The maximum velocity V max of the particle is limited to the dynamic range of the search space <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The convergent criterion is that the relative improvement in consecutive 100 generations is less than 0.01% and the algorithm has proceeded at least 1000 generations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and Discussions</head><p>In this paper, computer simulations are carried out by MATLAB. The allowed minimum distance between turbines is set as d min = 4D, where D = 50m is the turbine diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. As the Grady's results <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> are the most classical ones, the present optimal results are compared with Grady's under the same wind farm conditions in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>In Grady's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a square wind farm was partitioned into a 10 × 10 grid. The turbines were only allowed to be installed in the center of each cell with the objective of minimizing the cost per unit energy. Genetic algorithms were used to solve the optimization problem.</p><p>The characteristics of the wind turbines in Grady's paper are as follows: The hub height of the turbines is 60m, rotor diameter 40m, thrust coefficient 0.88. The turbine thrust coefficient is considered constant throughout the process. The farm is a 2000m × 2000m site and the ground roughness is z 0 = 0.3m.</p><p>In Grady's study, three cases with different complexities were investigated: (a) uniform wind direction with a speed 12m/s; (b) 36-direction evenly distributed wind with a speed 12m/s; (c) 36-direction distributed wind with varied probability of the speeds 8, 12, and 17m/s. The wind roses for three cases are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The optimal wind farm configurations of Grady's study for the three cases are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and the numbers of installed turbines are 30, 39 and 39, respectively. The limitation of Grady's study is that the positions of turbines could not been adjusted freely in the continuous space.</p><p>In the present study, the PSO algorithm with penalty functions is applied to the same cases. The wind farm model and parameters are the same as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> while the objective function is to maximize the total power extracted from the wind farm. The same type of wind turbines as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> are used. The numbers of turbines for all three cases are set to be the same as those of Grady's. In Grady's study, the wind farm is a square of 2000m × 2000m and the width of each cell is 200m. Since the turbines are only installed in the center of each cell, the effective domain of the wind farm in Grady's study is 1800m × 1800m. Thus, the computational domain of the present study is set as 1800m×1800m so that the optimal results could be fairly compared with Grady's study.</p><p>The population size for the optimization is set to the twice of the total turbine number. The penalty coefficients γ for the Cases a, b and c are chosen to be 500, 500 and 1000 respectively by trial-and-error tunings. The wind farm configurations are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the area in the black thick square represents the effective domain of the wind farm. The turbine positions in the present study have been adjusted within the boundary of the wind farm effective domain. Since there are position constraints in the optimization, the turbines have been positioned to satisfy the constraints on minimum distances. In Case a, the turbines assemble on the upper and lower boundary of the wind farm, which is in coincidence with the uniform wind condition. In Case b and Case c, since the wind is distributed among 36 wind directions, the turbines "scatter" around the outer perimeter of the site.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> compares the wind farm performances by the two methods. Since the positions of turbines of the present study could be adjusted more freely, the wind speed loss has been further reduced. The total power output P and the wind farm efficiency η are respectively improved by 6.34%, 4.13% and 4.02% in three cases. It is obvious that wake effects in the wind farm, as well as energy loss, have been greatly reduced by optimizing the positions of turbines in the continuous space, and the wind resource could be more effectively exploited. However, since the number of turbines of the latter two cases are larger than that of the first case and the wind conditions are more complex, their relative free space to adjust is lower than that of the first case. As a result of that, the relative improvement is also lower than the first case. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to optimize the positions of turbines in the continuous space. The goal is to extract the maximal energy when the wind resource, topography and the number and types of turbines are given. The key question to solve the formulated problem is the large number of constraints and the high complexity of the optimization problem. A particle swarm optimization algorithm based on a penalty-function method is employed to solve the present problem. Simulation results demonstrate that more energy could be extracted from the wind farm by the proposed approach under the same conditions. In the application of the penalty-function method, the selection of penalty coefficient is problem dependent and time consuming. Determining an appropriate value of penalty coefficients is itself a difficult optimization problem. It will be of importance to propose an adaptive fitness-evaluation method in the future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
