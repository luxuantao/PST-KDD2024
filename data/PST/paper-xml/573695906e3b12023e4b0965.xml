<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Although both anecdotal and academic sources have suggested that interpersonal recommendation is an important means to promote mobile applications (apps), little to no research has investigated this topic. To fill the void, we develop a research model based on the Customer Value, Satisfaction, and Loyalty Framework (VSL). While prior VSL studies treated customer value as a black box and examined its effects as a whole, this research breaks down customer value to utilitarian benefits (consisting of app utility and app quality), hedonic benefits (consisting of app aesthetics and enjoyment), monetary sacrifices and non-monetary sacrifices (consisting of technicality, knowledge of alternative quality and privacy risk). This research extends VSL to the mobile app context and discerns factors that influence app recommendation. Based on the data analysis of 347 app users, we found that intention to recommend is a strong predictor of app recommendation behavior. Satisfaction with apps, users' app continuance intention, and hedonic benefits obtained from using apps are the direct antecedents of intention to recommend. Moreover, non-monetary sacrifices and utilitarian benefits have indirect effects on intention to recommend through satisfaction and app continuance intention. Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find the significant effects of monetary sacrifices in the refined VSL. We also provide a detailed discussion about these findings, and the theoretical and practical implications of the research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The past decade has witnessed a phenomenal growth of smartphones, as well as its killer applicationmobile applications (apps). Buoyed by an enormous user-base, mobile apps have captured the attention of business <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. In order for organizations to reap the benefits of information technology (IT), they must understand user behaviors. Presumably, the forgoing argument also applies to mobile apps, an emerging IT artifact. Organizations' initiatives in apps cannot succeed without a deep understanding of individuals' app usage behaviors. To date, only a handful of information systems (IS) research directly address the topic of mobile app usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">80]</ref>. Among them, the main focus is on examining users' intention regarding the initial acceptance and the continuance of apps. Given that IT usage exists in multiple forms beyond simple adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we believe that the current literature provides a limited explanation of app users' behaviors. Thus, the first objective of this research is to examine users' recommendation of mobile apps, a type of user behavior in the post-adoption stage of IT that is not well addressed in prior research.</p><p>The importance of recommendation is well-established in communication, social psychology, consumer, and IS literature. According to the Diffusion of Innovation Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref>, most people rely on recommendation as a reliable, credible information source for assurance to adopt an innovation. In the social psychological discipline, numerous studies showed that interpersonal influence plays an important role in various contexts, such as consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Consumer research has confirmed that recommendation impacts customer purchase decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[88]</ref> and that recommendation is a critical success factor in the contexts where the information giver and receiver are powerful customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. With the rise of the Internet, customers continue to use recommendation from others to make purchase decisions in the online environment <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. In the IS field, the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behaviors, the Model of PC Utilization, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and UTAUT2 [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">79]</ref> indicate that individuals' IT adoption decisions are largely dependent on social influence, the degree to which an individual perceives that others believe s/he should use the new technology. In the context of mobile apps, recommendation is of particular importance. Apps are a form</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>of -experiential computing‖ technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[86]</ref>, and people are more likely to rely on recommendation when products/services are intangible and experiential <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, voices from the practical world also consolidate the importance of recommendation in the mobile app context. Mobile business consultants have viewed referral and recommendation as the most effective way of promoting mobile apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Industrial reports have provided further support for this proposition, revealing that recommendation plays an important role in mobile app downloads:</p><p>personal recommendation is the most important factor for 43% of the surveyed people to make download decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, motivated by the gap between a dearth of research on mobile app recommendation and the aforementioned theoretical and practical justification regarding its importance, we believe it necessary, relevant and timely to examine factors that influence app users' recommendation behaviors as a topic to organizations' benefits. To this end, we draw upon the Customer Value, Satisfaction and Loyalty Framework (VSL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">85]</ref>. According to VSL, customers who perceive they obtain greater value from using a product/service tend to be more satisfied with the product/service in question; both customer value and satisfaction are significant antecedents of customer loyalty. Considering that recommendation is an important facet of customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">87]</ref>, we believe VSL an appropriate theoretical lens to examine why users make recommendation of apps.</p><p>Furthermore, we refine the original VSL using auxiliary theories and empirical studies from prior IT adoption research. Specifically, this work: 1) acknowledges the predominant conceptualization that customer value is the customers' overall assessment of what is received (benefit) versus what is given (sacrifice), 2) breaks down the -black box‖ view of customer value used in prior VSL studies, and 3) explores specific benefits and sacrifices associated with using mobile apps. Therefore, the second and third objectives of this research are to adapt VSL to the mobile app context and to investigate how the decomposed value components influence satisfaction and recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>By accomplishing the foregoing three research objectives, this research makes several theoretical contributions. First, it fills the gap created by the importance of mobile app recommendation and a scarcity of research on this topic. Second, given that recommendation (or more broadly speaking, wordof-mouth (WOM)) is essentially a type of information exchange where messages flow from senders to receivers through channels, by focusing on app users who will potentially initiate recommendation, this research fills the gap that a handful of IS studies investigated the -sender‖ elements in the WOM process.</p><p>Third, given that recommendation resides along the positive end of the WOM valence continuum, this research fills an IS research gap identified by de Matos and Rossi <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Harrison-Walker <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> that only a few WOM studies examined WOM valence and this dimension of WOM was only measured indirectly.</p><p>Fourth, it echoes several research calls. By examining the recommendation topic, this research responds to Chin and Marcolin's <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> call that IS research shift its attention to complex -deep usage‖ of IT. By examining the mobile app context, this research responds to Yoo's <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[86]</ref> call that it is time for IS researchers to focus on experiential computing. Fifth, the refined VSL we developed to examine recommendation in the mobile app context also bears valuable theoretical implications. Identifying the specific benefits/sacrifices that shape customer value and testing their effects within VSL, this research enhances VSL by decomposing the value construct that was unanimously treated as a -black box‖ by past works. In addition, by considering sacrifices factors such as knowledge of alternative quality and privacy risks, the refined VSL framework here offers insights into why satisfied users are not loyal (e.g., not recommending apps), an increasingly critical issue in the marketing and IS domains. discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the results in greater detail, lists the limitations of this study, and suggests directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>In this section, we first present an overview of VSL and explain the key constructs (i.e., value and satisfaction). Then, we introduce the use of VSL in the IS field and summarize three major issues underlying prior research that employed VSL. Next, we discuss the key constructs in our research model, which expands and builds upon the original VSL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Customer Value, Satisfaction and Loyalty Framework</head><p>Originating in the marketing discipline, VSL has been developed and validated by a plethora of literature in the strategic marketing, service management, and consumer behavior areas that examined the interrelationships among customer value, satisfaction and customer loyalty in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contexts [e.g., 45]. VSL holds that customer value and satisfaction are two primary antecedents of customer loyalty while customer value positively influences satisfaction.</p><p>Customer value is defined as -consumer's overall assessment of the utility of a product based on perceptions of what is received and what is given‖ <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref>. Therefore, the formation of customer value involves a trade-off process where customers evaluate the benefits received and the sacrifices given from using a product/service. Early marketing studies focused on product quality as the primary -get‖ component and product price as the main -give‖ component [e.g., 73]. Later, Sinha and DeSarbo <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref> pointed out that customer value is a complex and multi-dimensional construct and called for exploring other factors that shape customer value. That is to say, there are various benefits/sacrifices beyond product quality/price from using a product, for example, shopping experiences and product risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Another important characteristic of customer value is that its benefit/sacrifice components vary with new consumption contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, prior IS literature that took the value perspective to examine IT adoption was busy with identifying new compositions of customer value and exploring their effects in different IT contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Another important factor in VSL is satisfaction-the key to cultivate and retain loyal customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Satisfaction has taken a central, predominating position in marketing theory and practice because, as a major outcome of marketing activities, it transforms the initial consumption and purchase to postpurchase phenomena such as attitude change, re-patronage and brand loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The American Customer Satisfaction Index is an important customer-based measurement system that assesses performance of firms, industries and national economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Customer Value, Satisfaction and Loyalty Framework in the Information Systems Field</head><p>IS researchers have drawn upon VSL to examine user behavior in the post-adoption stage of a variety of IT contexts such as SNS services <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, China' telecommunication market <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref>, organizational IT services <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, mobile value-added services <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and mobile-commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. This research supplements this stream of research by addressing three issues related to employing VSL.</p><p>First, despite its multi-dimensionality, VSL research treated perceived value mainly as a black box: little to no VSL research identifies specific benefits/sacrifices that shape customer value and tests the influences on satisfaction and customer loyalty. This is surprising because IS researchers commonly decompose customer value in using this construct, leading to a series of value-based technology adoption Therefore, this research not only builds on VSL, but also: 1) decomposes customer value, 2) explores specific benefits and sacrifices related to app usage, and 3) examines how the benefits and sacrifices influence other key factors in our refined VSL.</p><p>Second, even for the limited VSL and IS research [e.g., 52, 74, 75] that decomposed customer value, most inquiries focus on the benefit component of value, leaving the sacrifice component less examined. In fact, the ignorance of sacrifice is a known historical issue in VSL studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Echoing Lam et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, this research refines VSL by identifying primary sacrifice factors and examining the effects of the sacrifice component in VSL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Third, to enhance its explanatory power, prior research supplemented VSL with addendum variables (e.g., service quality and trust). Although these research provided sound justifications for adding the addendum variables to VSL, one may still question not adding other variables such as information quality and cognitive absorption. Referring to several versions of UTAUT that streamlined factors influencing technology acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">79]</ref>, we believe it important to introduce a systematic approach that justifies categorizing similar addendum variables into the same group so that we can investigate the effect of each group in VSL as Venkatesh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">79]</ref> did in developing UTAUT and UTAUT 2. Motivated by valuebased IT adoption research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, this research borrows the utilitarian-and-hedonic classification of IT benefits and monetary and non-monetary classification of IT sacrifices to synthesize the addendum variables of VSL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Constructs in the Refined Customer Value, Satisfaction and Loyalty Framework</head><p>Building upon early discussion regarding the necessity of refining VSL, here, we present an overview of the constructs that were used in this research to further VSL and discuss the details of these constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Utilitarian and Hedonic Benefits of Perceived Value in Mobile Apps</head><p>IS researchers have long explored the utilitarian and hedonic motivations (also called extrinsic and intrinsic motivations) to use IT, and compared their relative strengths across different types of IS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">79]</ref>.</p><p>This paper defines utilitarian benefits of mobile apps as functional benefits delivered by the performance of the apps that is instrumental in achieving valued outcomes distinct from the usage itself, and defines hedonic benefits of mobile apps as non-functional benefits delivered by the performance of the apps for no apparent reinforcement other than the process of using the apps to obtain fun and self-fulfillment.</p><p>Similar to prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, our identification of utilitarian/hedonic factors is based on literature review and interviews with mobile app users. The identified utilitarian benefits are app utility and app quality, and the hedonic benefits are enjoyment and app aesthetics.</p><p>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.1">App Utility</head><p>App utility is the extent to which a person believes that using an app will deliver desired, superior outcomes; we derive app utility from system utility. Reflecting the utilitarian benefits of using IS, system utility has been represented by perceived usefulness in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and performance expectancy in UTAUT and UTAUT2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">79]</ref>. With the extensive application of TAM, UTAUT and UTAUT2 to examine IT adoption in numerous voluntary and non-voluntary settings, research shows system utility to be a salient predictor of users' behavioral intention. Furthermore, it is the sole factor that describes utilitarian benefits in the Motivation Model of IT Adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and the Valuebased Adoption Model of Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Hence, we believe app utility is a representative factor of the utilitarian benefits derived from using apps and enjoys the potential to explain user behavior in most apps.</p><p>In the Mobile Internet context, utility is an important value component <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The more useful a person perceives the Mobile Internet, the greater value he/she receives. While people employ utilitarian mobile apps for utility such as information-seeking, file-synchronization and music-identification, our focus group discussion revealed that utility is also the major concern of most hedonic app users. This is consistent with previous findings that perceived usefulness also plays a critical role in users' intention to play online games and mobile games <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Specifically speaking, people play gaming apps for entertainment, relaxation, escape from reality, and other reasons; a gaming app becomes a favorite when it serves their needs best compared to other alternatives, which addresses the utility of hedonic apps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.2">App Quality</head><p>Consistent with Wixom and Todd's <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83]</ref> conceptualization of system quality, in this research, app quality reflects the quality of app features such as reliability, responsiveness and integration. Wixom and Todd <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83]</ref> incorporated system quality into their IT adoption model as a supplement to system utility (equivalent to perceived usefulness advocated in TAM) because system quality is an object-based belief.</p><p>While system utility reflects a behavior-based belief about the consequences of using a system, objectbased beliefs such as system quality that describe the system itself also matters to user behaviors. Given</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>the extensive use of the Wixom and Todd's Model in various IT contexts, we believe the inclusion of app quality as another dimension of utilitarian benefits can further predict user behavior in mobile apps.</p><p>Previous research found app quality to be an important factor influencing users' post-adoption intention of mobile apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Per our focus-group interviews, we observed individuals are concerned with app quality issues such as whether an app can run smoothly on the smartphone platform, whether it quickly responds to users' inputs, and whether it can deliver its utility in a reliable manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.3">Enjoyment</head><p>Enjoyment is the extent to which using an app is enjoyable in its own right, apart from any anticipated performance consequences. In various settings, IS research indicates that enjoyment influences technology acceptance and use intention directly [e.g., 77], including the use of utilitarian systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It was treated as the most salient factor to represent hedonic benefits in UTAUT 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref> and the Motivation Model of IT Adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Given that enjoyment has a direct effect on user attitudes toward mobile games <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, we believe its effects will be similar for hedonic apps. Prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> revealed that people experience enjoyment when they use such utilitarian apps that deliver information in a timely fashion.</p><p>Thus, we also believe that enjoyment is a critical value component, despite the utilitarian/hedonic nature of apps. Our focus-group discussion provides insights. For example, one member mentioned that she was put into a good mood by using Evernote (a utilitarian app that helps users take notes with online synchronization and backup provided) because it reminded her just how technologically-savvy she is.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.4">App Aesthetics</head><p>Aesthetics is an emerging guideline in IS design <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Akin to system quality, aesthetics is an objectbased belief about the visual appearance of a system. Recent IS research shows that system aesthetics plays a determinant role in influencing IT adoption in many settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. The effect of system aesthetics on IT user behavior can be explained by many theories such as the Signaling Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[82]</ref>, the Visual Rhetoric Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the -beauty is good‖ stereotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>. While prior research recognizes the influence of aesthetics on conventional IT products [e.g., 72], aesthetics also affects user appraisals of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>mobile games and websites displayed on mobile phones <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Anecdotal sources [e.g., 69] viewed app aesthetics as the key in helping a mobile app stand out in a crowded market and determining its success; our focus group interview supports this perspective. As one respondent commented, how the snapshot of an app looks really matters, because it determines whether or not she will download it, especially when she has little knowledge of the app. Moreover, others agreed that an appealing interface brings about a wonderful user experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Monetary and Non-Monetary Sacrifices of Perceived Value in Mobile Apps</head><p>Prior research suggested that sacrifices that decrease customers' value perception are both monetary and non-monetary <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The term monetary sacrifices refers to what one has to give up financially to obtain a product/service <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> whereas non-monetary sacrifices usually includes time, physical effort, or mental effort needed to acquire and use a product <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. We find both monetary and non-monetary sacrifices relevant to this research because in the mobile context, individuals bear the dual role of consumer and technology user. As a consumer, mobile app users pay at iTunes or Google Pay to download paid apps (e.g., Monopoly). The effects of non-monetary sacrifices are also pronounced. For example, as technology users, individuals need to work at learning to gain familiarity with the interface and functions of apps in a manner similar to using other IT products. Therefore, we incorporated both monetary and non-monetary sacrifices in the refined VSL. We used perceived price to measure monetary sacrifices, a construct that was unanimously adopted in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> to operationalize monetary sacrifices 1 . Using the same procedures to obtain utilitarian and hedonic benefits, we identified three nonmonetary sacrifices, namely privacy risk, knowledge of alternative quality and technicality, and added them to the research model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.1">Perceived Price</head><p>Price is an important financial cost required to obtain and use a product. Perceived price is the result of encoding a product's price by customers in a way that is meaningful to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref>. A large body of 1 The remainder of the paper will use the terms -perceived price‖ and -monetary sacrifices‖ alternatively.</p><p>marketing literature shows that perceived price influences perceived value. If a price is perceived as unacceptable, customers will then assess the product with little or no value <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[94]</ref>. The recent decade has witnessed the rise and popularity of IT products that require payment and that are used voluntarily (known as consumer technologies). Against this backdrop, an increased number of IS research [e.g. <ref type="bibr">, 79]</ref> posited that in the consumer technology context, IT users are also consumers because they bear the monetary costs associated with using the technologies. This stream of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> examined the role of perceived price and found it significant in predicting IT adoption in various settings. Particularly, perceived price (or its variant) was shown to be a critical construct in the Value-based Adoption Model of Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and UTAUT 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref> that compliments conventional factors such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use in understanding IS success. Also, the price of using paid mobile apps includes the download fee and charges associated with value-added features. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to incorporate perceived price into the refined VSL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.2">Privacy Risk</head><p>Privacy risk refers to the app developers' malicious behavior concerning the collection and use of an app user's individual information. The inclusion of privacy risk as a sacrifice component has its roots in conventional consumer literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref> that conceptualized product price and product-related risk as two common sacrifice components that decrease customer value: while the effect of product price occurs at the time of purchase, product-related risk has a longer-term impact during the ownership of a product.</p><p>Thus, the consideration of product-related risk is advocated in assessing customer value at the postconsumption stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>. The use of technologies is not free of risks. In fact, privacy risk as IT users' largest concern is of a growing interest to IS researchers that have spawned numerous studies that explored its antecedents and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>. This is because online companies generally tend to behave opportunistically with users' personal information to realize inappropriate gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>.</p><p>While privacy risk has long been a critical issue in mobile commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the advent of mobile apps offers seemingly unbounded options for collecting, processing, distributing, and using private information</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>of app users, which renders privacy risk a sacrifice component that merits our immediate attention. In mobile app usage, one problem area is the generalized use of Facebook verification. For example, a mobile app may require users to provide verification to register for an offered service, but if users sign in through their Facebook accounts, these apps gain access to users' Facebook information. Apps that offer more personalized services may require more detailed private information. Apps may track individuals' usage behaviors, and with GPS smartphones, record usage and location data. In an attempt to mitigate potential privacy risks, California's Online Privacy Protection Act has extended its footprint to the mobile app context <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>. Specifically, the Act requires app developers to include privacy policies in their apps so that users will be informed about the data that apps will access, use, and share before they download the apps. Despite these precautions there is simply no guarantee that app developers will not invade users' privacy. All these facts underscore that privacy risk continues to be an important source of sacrifices associated with app usage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.3">Knowledge of Alternative Quality</head><p>This research defines knowledge of alternative quality as the extent to which a person is aware that an alternative app, when compared to the primary app, is able to fulfill his/her needs. The concept is grounded in the relationship perspective of marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and the Commitment and Trust Model of IT Continuance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Both theories posit that intention of relationship continuance with a company, postconsumption of a product, or IT continuance is also dependent on alternative quality. In the IT context, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> indicated that although users may be satisfied with a particular website, they may incline to switch to an alternative site as long as they perceive that an alternative website works better. The role of alternative quality is also salient in the experiential computing context. Under the paradigm of the value perspective, Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> conceptualized knowledge of alternatives as a vital sacrifice that reduces customer value of using experiential technology such as IPTV. Due to the competitive app market where the core function of an app can be easily achieved by others, consistent with Lin et al.'s work, we</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>included knowledge of alternative quality to capture another dimension of sacrifice when people use mobile apps (another form of experiential technology).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.4">Technicality</head><p>This study defines technicality as the extent to which a mobile app is perceived as being technicallydifficult to use. According to the Value-based Adoption Model of Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, technicality is a primary non-monetary sacrifice in using mobile-related services. In the same vein, we conceptualized technicality as a non-monetary sacrifice. In the context of mobile apps, high technicality can be attributable to a wide range of factors. For example, mobile app users rely on touch interfaces (fingers) rather than standard interfaces (mouse) to type or operate mobile apps; they are required to change their interfacing habits to adapt to touch screen design. This new IT context will foreseeably produce significant psychological discomfort among users such as frustration, anxiety and mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, technicality represents a significant factor in non-monetary sacrifices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Intention to Recommend, App Continuance Intention and Recommendation</head><p>This research draws a clear distinction between recommendation and WOM activities. WOM has two dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The first dimension is termed as -WOM activities‖ which addresses the frequency of the WOM communications, the number of people influenced, and the information supplied by the WOM initiators. The second dimension is termed as -WOM praise‖ (or -WOM valence‖) which reflects the valence of the WOM communications that could be positive, neutral and negative. Thus, recommendation differs from WOM activities in that it represents the positive valence of WOM whereas WOM activities might involve disseminating negative information of a product. Consistent with prior VSL and WOM works [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">85]</ref>, this research conceptualized recommendation as the extent to which one says positive things about an app and encourages others to use an app.</p><p>This research examined both intention to recommend and the actual recommendation behavior in the refined VSL. Although the intention-behavior relationship is strong and robust in the IT context, we believe it necessary and valuable to examine the actual actions of mobile app users for two reasons. First,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>recommendation behavior is easy to measure in the context of this research. A review of the IS research that employed use intention as a proxy for usage behavior shows that most authors recognized the limitation and they did so because actual usage is difficult to assess [e.g., 95]. However, the assessment issue does not pose a challenge in this research because the participants in this study have already adopted the apps which allows us to measure the recommendation behaviors that occurred. Second, usage behavior lacks scrutiny in the IS field <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref> and particularly, recommendation as a form of -deep usage‖ behaviors of IT receives little attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>; therefore, our approach could expand the discipline's understanding in this regard.</p><p>This research included app continuance intention in the refined VSL to be another antecedent of intention to recommend. This construct reflects individuals' willingness to continue to use an app. Past marketing research found that WOM is closely associated with customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> which is characterized by repatronage <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">89]</ref>. On the other hand, IS research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> posited that IS continuance (intention) is in the same spirit of repatronage and it is a sign of loyalty in the IT context. Taken together, it is reasonable to expect that app continuance intention might affect intention to recommend. This is particularly true when recent IS literature found that intentions to adopt biometric technologies increases users' intention to recommend the technologies to their friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The relationship is important to explore to provide better understanding of the outcome variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Hypothesis Development</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> summarizes our research model. In this research, we identified value components that are specific to the mobile app context and incorporated app continuance intention. In addition, we refined the original VSL in two respects. First, we conceptualize utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits, and nonmonetary sacrifices as second-order constructs. We pursue this methodology for three reasons.</p><p>1) One of the primary interests of this research is to break down the -black box‖ view of customer value used in previous VSL studies and examine the individual effects of the value components (i.e., utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits and non-monetary sacrifices) on satisfaction, app</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>continuance intention and intention to recommend. Accordingly, conceptualizing various dimensions of utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits and non-monetary sacrifices as a whole respectively fits the purpose of this research. If we draw inferences at higher levels based on the analysis of a decomposed model, it will result in atomistic fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. For example, in a decomposed model, while privacy risk impacts intention to recommend and knowledge of alternative quality does not, it would be arbitrary to say non-monetary sacrifices matters (or does not matter) to intention to recommend. As Petter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> posited, -Relationships that hold, or do not hold at lower units of measurement and aggregation, may not hold at the higher levels‖. 2) For these three value components, the decomposed dimensions (e.g., app utility and app quality)</p><p>have the same relationships with other constructs. Under this circumstance, it is suggested to develop a second-order construct with first-order factors as its formative indicators and then to formulate research hypotheses at the higher-order factor level rather than at the individual subconstruct level <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The advantage of this approach is to produce a parsimonious model that provides abstractions that generate insightful explanations about complex phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. If we were to decompose utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits and non-monetary sacrifices and then test</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>the effects of each dimension, we would have 12 extra paths. While it is not the intent of this research to know the effects of the decomposed value components of mobile apps at the cost of creating a complex model, the higher-order approach offers a viable solution to this paradox.</p><p>3) We recognize that multiple approaches exist to approximate second-order constructs [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>]. For example, the repeated indicator approach measures second-order constructs directly with items of all its first-order constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. But this approach is most effective when all the first-order factors have equal number of indicators. The second approach models the paths between firstorder and second-order constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This research takes the latter approach because the two dimensions of utilitarian benefits, two dimensions of hedonic benefits and three dimensions of non-monetary sacrifices have unequal number of indicators.</p><p>Second, we propose that user satisfaction, app continuance intention, intention to recommend are directly influenced by utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits, and non-monetary sacrifice without testing the mediation of customer value. According to Liang and Xue <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, the exclusion of a mediator can precisely delineate the direct effects of the mediated factors which allows for a rich understanding of the mediated factors. Decomposing the black box of customer value and investigating the individual effects of utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits, and non-monetary sacrifices shed light on how app developers can better manage user satisfaction, maintain continued use and foster users to recommend apps. Next, this section presents empirical evidence that supports the relationships in our research model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Satisfaction to App Continuance Intention and Intention to Recommend</head><p>According to the Expectation Confirmation Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, satisfaction positively influences IS continuance.</p><p>Such effect was confirmed in a wide range of IT environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">92]</ref>. On the other hand, VSL studies found that satisfaction positively influences customers/users' intention to recommend products/services <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">85]</ref>. Thus, we hypothesize that:</p><p>H1. Satisfaction positively influences users' app continuance intention. H2. Satisfaction positively influences users' intention to recommend mobile apps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Utilitarian Benefits, Hedonic Benefits, Perceived Price and Non-Monetary Sacrifices to App Continuance Intention and Intention to Recommend</head><p>Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> found that customer value is a function of benefits and sacrifices (including both monetary and non-monetary sacrifices) perceived by users and customer value is a predictor of continuance intention of using IPTV. Similarly, Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> found that benefits such as usefulness and enjoyment and sacrifices such as technicality and perceived price are determinants of customer value, which in turn affects individuals' intention to adopt mobile Internet. In addition, VSL works in the IT context <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref> indicated that customer value influences repatronage intention/continued use intention and intention to recommend. Given the definition that customer value is consumers' overall assessment of the utility of a product based on the received benefits and given sacrifices <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref>, perceived benefits and sacrifices capture different facets of customer value and each should affect app continuance intention and intention to recommend. Thus, we hypothesize:</p><p>H3. Non-monetary sacrifices negatively influences users' app continuance intention. H4. Non-monetary sacrifices negatively influences users' intention to recommend mobile apps. H5. Perceived price negatively influences users' app continuance intention. H6. Perceived price negatively influences users' app intention to recommend mobile apps. H7. Utilitarian benefits positively influences users' app continuance intention. H8. Utilitarian benefits positively influences users' intention to recommend mobile apps. H9. Hedonic benefits positively influences users' app continuance intention. H10. Hedonic benefits positively influences users' intention to recommend mobile apps.</p><p>Per VSL, customer value impacts satisfaction, an association that has received substantial empirical support [e.g., 12]. Based on the forgoing argument that utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits, perceived price and non-monetary sacrifices are significant components of customer value, we hypothesize:</p><p>H11. Non-monetary sacrifices negatively influences satisfaction. H12. Perceived price negatively influences satisfaction. H13. Utilitarian benefits positively influences satisfaction. H14. Hedonic benefits positively influences satisfaction.</p><p>As noted earlier, motivated by de Matos and Rossi's <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> meta-analysis of prior WOM literature, this research explores the effect of app continuance intention on intention to recommend. This approach is consistent with recent IT adoption literature that began to use intention to recommend as outcome</p></div>

The intention-behavior relationship was confirmed in numerous IS research studies [e.g., 78].</p><p>Thus, we hypothesize:</p><p>H16.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Measurement Development</head><p>We developed all measurements based on their theoretical underpinning and previous relevant literature.</p><p>The two utilitarian benefits dimensions-app utility and app quality-were contextualized from Davis's <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Wixom and Todd's <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83]</ref> works. On the other hand, app aesthetics was developed based on previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">76]</ref> that examined the influence of visual aesthetics in contexts relevant to mobile apps; the questions for enjoyment, the other dimension of hedonic benefits, were drawn from van der Heijden's <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref>  works. We measured satisfaction with the items adapted from Bhattacherjee's <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> research, app continuance intention from Chen et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> research, intention to recommend from Turel et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref> research and recommendation from Harrison-Walker's <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[97]</ref> research. We evaluated all the questions by a 5-point Likert scale. To further assess the content validity of all items, we invited experts in relevant areas to examine the items. We revised the questionnaire based on the comments received.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Data Collection</head><p>A total of 347 respondents participated in the study and successfully completed the questionnaires.

According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, the Cronbach's alpha values of all constructs ranged from 0.81 to 0.95, higher than the minimum cutoff score of 0.70 suggested by Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>; the lowest composite reliability value is 0.88, which satisfies the benchmark of 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In addition, all of the average variance extracted (AVE) values are higher than the threshold of 0.50.

For the utilitarian benefits construct, the impacts of app utility and app quality on utilitarian benefits are significant (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>); the correlation between</p></div>

Our model accounts for 44% of variance in recommendation and 34% of variance in intention to recommend.

The effects of utilitarian benefits, non-monetary sacrifices and perceived price on intention to recommend are not significant. Moreover, the hypotheses regarding the effects of utilitarian benefits (β = 0.11, p &lt; 0.05), hedonic benefits (β = 0.12, p &lt; 0.05), non-monetary sacrifices (β = -0.16, p &lt; 0.01) and satisfaction (β = 0.49, p &lt; 0.001) on app continuance intention are well-supported except the effect of perceived price on app continuance intention. Last but not least, although the effect of perceived price on satisfaction were found to be insignificant, utilitarian benefits (β = 0.32, p &lt; 0.001) and hedonic benefits (β = 0.50, p &lt; 0.001) positively affect satisfaction and non-monetary sacrifices (β = -0.10, p &lt; 0.05) has negative impact on satisfaction.     </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Discussion of Findings</head><p>The present research extends VSL to the mobile app context and investigates factors that affect users to recommend apps. The results show that intention to continue to use apps, satisfaction with apps, and hedonic benefits obtained from using apps directly influence users' intention to recommend the apps which is a strong predictor of their recommendation behavior. Utilitarian benefits and hedonic benefits have positive effects on user satisfaction and app continuance intention: the more utilitarian benefits and hedonic benefits users obtain, the more satisfied they are with the apps and the stronger their intention to continue to use the apps. As to the specific value components, app utility and app quality are the main utilitarian benefits in the context of mobile apps whereas enjoyment and app aesthetics are the primary hedonic benefits associated with app usage. The three sources of non-monetary sacrifices related to app usage are privacy risk, knowledge of alternative quality and technicality; they as a whole, negatively influence user satisfaction and app continuance intention.</p><p>Although not a direct determinant, utilitarian benefits was found to exert its influence on intention to recommend through satisfaction and app continuance intention. This result is in line with de Matos and Rossi's <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> meta-analysis of prior WOM literature which concluded that few studies found that product quality (a concept similar to utilitarian benefits) is a direct antecedent of WOM. The result here implies that users do not recommend their apps simply because they are useful and high in quality; in fact, they recommend apps that deliver such utilitarian benefits when they are satisfied with the apps and are willing to continue to use them in the future.</p><p>Moreover, contrary to our expectation, perceived price does not have effects on satisfaction, app continuance intention and intention to recommend. This finding suggests that monetary sacrifices plays a less important role in the post-adoption stage of mobile apps. The insignificant relationships here could possibly be attributable to the following reasons. First, it may be due to the low app price. Previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">99]</ref> showed that due to lack of price variation, for low-cost products, customers regard</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>other factors such as time and effort costs as more important than monetary sacrifices. Nowadays, a large portion of mobile apps are free and the price of paid apps is also low. Statistics showed that 60% of paid apps were priced at $.99; others mostly range from $.99 to $1.99; few to no apps have prices above $4.99 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> 2 . The low price of mobile apps could cause the influences of monetary sacrifices to be minimal when compared to monetary sacrifices (e.g., the time and mental efforts spent to deal with the concern of privacy invasion or to gain familiarity with the app interface), the benefits associated with using the apps and user satisfaction. Second, it may well be that monetary sacrifices is not always perceived as something one has to give up in using mobile apps. Previous literature indicated that the negative effects of perceived price could be neutralized to be insignificant if it is positively used for other purposes such as inferring product quality and vendor quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[99]</ref>. In this paper, the app users should know the app quality well, but there are still uncertainties regarding whether the app vendors are capable of preventing security breach (e.g., Starbucks app 3 ) and whether they will discontinue the service of the apps out of sudden (e.g., Evernote Hello app 4 ) and so on. Such uncertainties, highly relevant to users' interest, are difficult to detect because users do not have enough information and expertise to discern any signs of them. When app price is used as a cue to infer those uncertainties (e.g., a paid app could rely on revenues contributed by the users, thus the vendor is less likely to share user data with third parties for personal gains), it could attenuate the negative effects of perceived price to be insignificant. Similarly, we cannot rule out the possibility that individuals who chose a paid app care less about the price partially because they have a good impression of the product in the first place. As result these individuals are more likely to be satisfied, to intend to continue to use the app in the future, and to recommend the app regardless of reasonable variation in price. This rationale could also be a potential explanation for perceived price to be insignificant. Third, the price paid by app users is a source of switching costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> which tends to result in  4 In February 2015, Evernote announced to discontinue its support for Evernote Hello, an app that facilitates managing business cards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. While loyal customers are more likely to exhibit satisfaction, repurchase the products, and recommend them to others, switching costs by itself can also foster repatronage and encourage recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. We speculate that users who have paid for their apps are more satisfied with the apps and are more willing to continue to use and recommend them (which are the opposite of our hypotheses and the notion of VSL). Therefore, when app price is perceived as a form of switching costs, its negative effects on other VSL constructs are minimized.</p><p>Interestingly, we also did not observe non-monetary sacrifices to influence users' intention to recommend apps. This result and the insignificant relationship between monetary sacrifices and intention to recommend echoes de Matos and Rossi's <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> meta-analysis of prior WOM literature which did not identify any types of sacrifices to be the direct predictors of WOM. A theoretical rationale for this result is provided by Lam et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> work. The classic attitudinal framework (cognition -&gt; affect -&gt; behavioral intent or behavior) postulates that cognition evokes affect which subsequently determines one's behavioral intention or behavior. In the context of VSL, customer value as a whole is regarded as cognition, satisfaction is regarded as affect and customer loyalty represents behavioral intent or behavior.</p><p>There are two types of loyalty behaviors, namely customer retention and customer attraction. In the consumer context, cognition and affect play different roles in shaping these two loyalty behaviors. While repatronage pertains to customer retention and recommendation to customer attraction, Lam and his associate found that under the VSL paradigm, recommendation is solely driven by customers' affective state (satisfaction) and repatronage is determined by both cognitive evaluation (customer value) and affective state (satisfaction). Therefore, it is not a surprise that we did not find the significant relationship between non-monetary sacrifices and intention to recommend. In fact, our findings with respect to the effects of all four value components (utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits, monetary sacrifices and nonmonetary sacrifices) on intention to recommend are supported by Lam et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> work. While other three value components do not have direct effects on intention to recommend, the only significant relationship between hedonic benefits and intention to recommend is due to the fact that hedonic benefits</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>(e.g., having a good time when using an app, enjoying the visually-appealing interface of an app) reflect users' affective state (which is a determinant of recommendation according to Lam and his associates).</p><p>This research supports the significant effects of satisfaction on app continuance intention and intention to recommend. App continuance intention and intention to recommend are two facets of loyalty disposition.</p><p>While satisfied customers are not necessarily loyal (which raises the concern that satisfied users might not necessarily intend to continue using an app and recommend an app), the Investment Model Theory and the Commitment-Trust Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Li et al., 2006)</ref> indicate that this phenomenon is fundamentally attributable to the intervention of four factors-alternative quality, opportunistic behavior, communication quality and investment size. The former two factors were considered in the research model in the forms of knowledge of alternative quality and privacy risk. The latter two factors were excluded from the main analysis because in the a priori focus group interview and pre-test used to develop and refine the research model, it was found that communication quality and investment size were not appropriate in the context of this research. Taking into consideration these issues that might weaken the satisfaction-loyalty relationship, we believe the significant associations between satisfaction and app continuance intention/intention to recommend found in this research are robust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Theoretical Implications</head><p>The theoretical implications of this paper are five-fold. First, this research contributes toward filling a gap in the IS discipline that app recommendation is a critical success factor of mobile apps, but our understanding of this phenomenon is limited.</p><p>Second, this research contributes to the electronic WOM (eWOM) research. WOM is a type of information exchange in which messages flow from senders to recipients. This process consists of five elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>: (1) (the sender's) perception as to the value of the source knowledge, (2) (the sender's) willingness of the source to share that knowledge, (3) the availability of rich information channels, (4) the willingness of the recipient to acquire the knowledge, and (5) the absorptive capacity of the recipient.</p><p>Cheung and Thadani's [9] meta-analysis of eWOM found that prior IS research mainly focused on the last</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>with using mobile apps, and investigated their individual influences with VSL. To date, little VSL research has systematically identified specific benefits/sacrifices that shape customer value. Such oversight is problematic. Because customer value is context-based, a new context, such as mobile apps, may change the compositions of the value construct. Our findings indicate that the identified four value components behave differently with regard to their linkage with satisfaction, app continuance intention and recommendation, thus providing support for the necessity to decompose the -black box‖ of the value construct. Our approach that decomposes a construct for deepened insights into its components is in similar spirit to prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">84]</ref> responding to Benbasat and Barki's <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> call to pry open the black box of perceived usefulness to refocus on IT artifact design. Just as prior research identified factors that shape perceived usefulness, our research, by identifying the compositions of perceived value, provides mobile app design guidelines and helps stakeholders effectively build their value-enhancing programs.</p><p>Furthermore, the refined VSL framework here offers insights into why satisfied users are not loyal (e.g., not recommending apps), an increasingly critical issue in the marketing and IS disciplines that could not be addressed by the original VSL framework. IS researchers have long questioned IT post-adoption models such as the Expectation Confirmation Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in that satisfaction plays a vital role in these theories and in voluntary IT usage settings, satisfied users may still discontinue to use an IT <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. This criticism is also applicable to VSL that has satisfaction at the core. By considering knowledge of alternative quality and privacy risk, the refined VSL framework presented here ensures that the associations between satisfaction and two loyalty constructs-app continuance intention and intention to recommend-are robust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Practical Implications</head><p>Given the importance of soliciting recommendation from app users, the findings of this research could benefit practitioners in several ways. First, our research identifies two utilitarian benefits and two hedonic benefits. In cultivating customer value to enhance users' intention to recommend apps, app developers</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>should stress on the benefits of app utility, app quality, app aesthetics and enjoyment that the apps can deliver in their marketing campaigns.</p><p>Second, given the effect of app aesthetics on value formation, app developers should focus on interface design to ensure that the apps are visually aesthetic. Aesthetic design can be achieved by a variety of approaches including the appropriate choice of background color, use of human images, and so forth <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Third, sacrifices associated with app usage influence users' intention to recommend through satisfaction and app continuance intention. Therefore, app practitioners should endeavor to minimize three sacrifice factors-technicality, privacy risk and knowledge of alternative quality-to maintain user satisfaction and app continuance intention. Given the distinctive difference between app interfaces and website interfaces, creating a user-friendly interface is an important task that merits app developers' attention. To this end, they need to design an app interface such that it is easy for users to operate. A user guide video can be provided particularly for users who are new to the apps. To offset users' privacy concerns, app practitioners could emphasize their privacy policies in marketing campaigns like TV ads to make the policies publicly known. Practitioners can also compare their apps with competing products in order to reduce the influence of the alternatives.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>First, our sample respondents consist of undergraduate students (with an average age of 21) and graduate students (with an average age of 31). They are representative users of mobile apps because Nielson's<ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> report shows that teens and young adults are the major users of smartphones. Nevertheless, future studies could examine app recommendation with different segments of users. Second, our respondents represent the U.S. population. Thus, future research could examine how culture influences app recommendation. Third, customer loyalty is a multi-faceted concept where recommendation is just one of them. Future research could draw upon our refined VSL model to investigate other facets of mobile app loyalty such as willingness to pay and intention to explore other features. Fourth, our research model did not consider individual factors such as seeking reputation, sense of belonging and enjoyment of helping. Individual factors are significant antecedents of WOM activities or knowledge sharing (a concept similar to WOM) where the information communicated could be positive, neutral or negative [e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. The focus of this research, however, is mobile app recommendation, a different dimension of WOM. In order for users to spread words favorable to apps, there must be salient factors beyond individual factors, and this is when the effect of product/ attributes kick in. VSL attends to product factors perceived by app users. This is why we chose VSL to examine the outcome variable. The refined VSL framework explains 34% of the variance in intention to recommend and 44% of the variance in recommendation, which are high for social science research and similar to prior research using alternative models to explain technology recommendation of<ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. This result indicates that our model captures the majority of variance in app users' recommendation intentions and behaviors and individual factors are less important in affecting WOM valence. Nevertheless, we suggest future research examine how VSL works in conjunction with individual factors in order to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the issue and to enhance the explanatory power of VSL. Fifth, the benefit and sacrifice components identified in this research are not exhaustive. Although they are key factors in other well-established IT adoption models and the R-square values of the current model are high, we suggest future research pay attention to any new benefits or sacrifices when applying the current model in a new context. Sixth, an interesting area for future research would be the use of paid apps so that IS academia could inform practitioners of how to attract individuals to use paid apps, thus expanding their revenue models. Seventh, this research did not examine negative WOM. The mechanisms of why and how negative WOM is given is different from positive WOM; as a result, the determinants of negative WOM are far beyond satisfaction and customer value<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. On the other hand, negative WOM is alien to customer loyalty. Thus, we believe VSL insufficient to capture the whole notion of this concept. Future research could examine negative WOM in the mobile app context.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell cols="3">Appendix Construct Items</cell></row><row><cell>AE 1</cell><cell>The interface of my application is aesthetically appealing</cell><cell>KA Q1</cell><cell>An alternative application is appealing</cell></row><row><cell>AE 2 AE 3 AE 4 AE 5 PE 1 PE 2 PE 3 a PE 4 PE 5</cell><cell cols="3">M A N U S C R I P T KA An alternative application is better than this The interface of my application is attractive Q2 one The interface of my application is aesthetically designed KA Q3 To my knowledge, another application is close to ideal The overall look and feel of the application is visually appealing KA Q4 An alternative application is attractive to me The interface of my application pleases my senses KA Q5 My needs could easily be fulfilled by an alternative application I find using the application to be enjoyable ACI 1 I intend to continue using the application Using the application is pleasant ACI 2 My intentions are to continue using the application rather than Using the application is dull using any alternatives I have fun using the application ACI 3 I plan to keep using this application in the future M A N U S C R I P T ACI I expect my use of the application to continue I enjoy using the application 4 in the future</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">A C C E P T E D U1 The application enables me to do it more quickly A C C E P T E D U2 The application helps me be more effective</cell><cell>AQ 1 AQ 2</cell><cell>The application is reliable</cell></row></table></figure>

This finding is understandable because information channels are the IT artifacts; IS researchers were interested in how factors such as argument quality and source credibility influence individuals' intention to acquire eWOM through different information channels. Because the stimuli associated with the first two elements of information flow may not be IT artifacts, they were less interesting to IS researchers. This research shifts the attention from -IT artifacts as the information channel‖ to -IT artifacts as the stimuli‖. Specifically, it identifies factors that influence individuals' willingness to initiate eWOM in the first place. Our results show that senders' perceptions of the value of mobile apps is formed as a function of app benefits and app sacrifices (corresponding to element 1), and it is the benefits derived from app usage, user satisfaction and app continuance intention that shape app users' intention to recommend apps (corresponding to element 2). In this sense, our research enriches IS research in eWOM because it identifies a potential research area where IT artifacts serve as information exchange stimuli.</p><p>Third, given that recommendation resides along the positive end of the WOM valence continuum, this research represents the efforts from the IS discipline to fill the gap identified by de Matos and Rossi <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Harrison-Walker <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> that only a few WOM studies examined WOM valence and that this dimension of WOM was only previously measured indirectly.</p><p>Fourth, this research echoes several research calls. It responds to Chin and Marcolin's <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> request that IS research examine complex -deep usage‖ of IT. Moreover, given that mobile apps are a type of experiential computing technology, this work also responds to Yoo's <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[86]</ref> call that it is time for IS research to focus on experiential computing.</p><p>Fifth, the refined VSL framework is another intellectual contribution to the IS discipline. To examine app recommendation, this research not only draws upon VSL but also adapts it to the mobile app context. We acknowledged the predominant conceptualization that customer value is customers' overall assessment of what is received (benefit) and what is given (sacrifice). Thus, we broke down the value construct that was unanimously treated as a -black box‖ by past VSL works, explored specific benefits/sacrifices associated</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Highlights  While a handful of research addressed the use of mobile applications (apps), this paper initially examines why people recommend apps to others, an IT behavior that is critical to the success of mobile apps.  The present paper develops a research model based on the customer value, satisfaction, and loyalty framework (VSL). Realizing certain issues underlying prior VSL studies, this paper identified specific benefits (i.e., app utility, app quality, app aesthetics and enjoyment) and sacrifices (technicality, privacy risk and knowledge of alternative quality) associated with app usage to refine the VSL model.  The identification of the knowledge of alternative quality factor examines users' IT behaviors with consideration of the effects of alternatives.  This paper contributes to the electronic word-of-mouth research by looking into (1) how individuals' perceive the value of mobile applications and (2) why individuals are willing to make the recommendation. These two questions are the first two elements in Susssman and Siegal (2003)'s information flow. However, they are rarely addressed by prior Information Systems research.</p></div>			</div>
