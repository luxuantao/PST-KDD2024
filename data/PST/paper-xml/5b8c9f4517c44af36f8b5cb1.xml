<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Low-voltage distribution networks are emerging as an increasingly important component of power system operations due to the deployment of distributed renewable resources (e.g. rooftop solar supply) and the need to mobilize the flexibility of consumers that are connected to the low-voltage grid. The pricing of electric power at distribution nodes follows directly from the theory of spot pricing of electricity. However, in contrast to linearized lossless models of transmission networks, an intuitive understanding of prices at the distribution level presents challenges due to voltage limits, reactive power flows and losses. In this paper we present three approaches towards understanding distribution locational marginal prices by decomposing them: (i) through a duality analysis of the problem formulated with a global power balance constraint, (ii) through a duality analysis of a second order cone program relaxation, and (iii) through an analysis of the impact of marginal losses on price. We discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach in terms of computation and physical intuition, and demonstrate the concepts on a 15-bus radial distribution network.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The theory of spot pricing of electricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> has laid the theoretical foundations for the deregulation of electricity markets. Decades of experience with deregulation have led to bidbased, security constrained unit commitment and economic dispatch as the reference paradigm for wholesale electricity market design, closely following the guidelines of the original theory. Despite the progress of wholesale electricity markets, the low-voltage network is largely excluded from short-term (day-ahead and real-time) markets. The current role of distribution systems is passive, in the sense that distributed loads consume power at will and distributed renewable resources inject power as it becomes available, without any coordination with the rest of the system. It is then the responsibility of distribution system operators to ensure that distribution network constraints are respected, and the responsibility of transmission system operators to carry sufficient reserve in order to ensure that aggregate imbalances between real-time power supply and demand are dealt with. Retail and commercial consumers are largely absent from this process, since they are typically exposed to either fixed or time-of-use rates that do not reflect the real-time conditions of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The paradigm shift envisioned in recent work focused on the mobilization of distributed resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, including the EU SmartNet project, entails a move towards active coordination of low-voltage resources with high-voltage resources through an integrated scheduling of the entire system. The basic schemes for TSO-DSO coordination and ancillary service provision envisioned in the SmartNet project are developed in detail by Gerard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Anthony Papavasiliou is with Center for Operations Research and Econometrics, Université catholique de Louvain and n-Side; Email: anthony.papavasiliou@uclouvain.be; Phone: +32 10 474325.</p><p>Correct price signals at the distribution level are essential for providing correct incentives for improving fuel cost efficiency, limiting real power losses over distribution lines, promoting the utilization of renewable resources, preventing the overloading of circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and enabling the provision of ancillary services by distributed resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Residential and commercial consumption represents the majority of consumer flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Since these resources are connected to lowvoltage distribution grids, pricing energy and services at the distribution level is becoming an increasingly important aspect of electricity market design. The relevance of distributed resources is expected to increase due to the advent of electric vehicles which will require coordinated charging <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and due to the increase of rooftop solar installations, which may necessitate local consumption in order to respect distribution network constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The integration of distributed resources in market clearing raises numerous market design questions that pertain to the interaction of TSOs and DSOs. In contrast to wholesale transmission markets, where linearized lossless models of power flow are deemed acceptable for practical purposes, reactive power flows and voltage need to be accounted for explicitly in distribution networks. The first fundamental question which emerges is what products should be traded, and in which markets. Caramanis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> propose (i) a transmission system market that trades real power and reserves, and (ii) low-voltage markets that clear real power, reactive power and reserves, such that the reserves can be delivered by distributed resources while respecting distribution line limits and voltage limits.</p><p>A related question is how distribution locational marginal prices should be computed. In this respect, the common approach adopted in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is the following: (i) locational marginal prices of high-voltage buses (TLMPs) are determined by clearing transmission markets, and (ii) DSOs clear local markets in the low-voltage grid in order to determine distribution locational marginal prices (DLMPs) for real power at the level of individual distribution nodes, given the TLMP of the corresponding transmission buses.</p><p>Day-ahead distribution markets are studied by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, who propose the following arrangement for day-ahead market clearing: (i) aggregators submit demand functions for non-deferrable loads and multi-part bids for deferrable loads that represent the energy requirements and technical constraints of deferrable loads, (ii) the DSO solves a welfare maximizing problem where the marginal cost of power for serving consumers is a forecast of the TLMP of the node at which the distribution feeder is located, and (iii) the DSO uses the DLMPs at the corresponding distribution nodes as market clearing prices for aggregators over a daily horizon. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> extend the model of Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> in order to address the fact that the price signal announced by the DSO may support multiple optimal dispatch schedules (this is especially the case for deferrable loads such as EVs and heat pumps), which may result in the violation of distribution network constraints. The authors propose that the DSO create a linear approximation of the system supply function around the optimal dispatch level, which results in a unique market clearing solution that respects distribution network constraints. A similar approach for ensuring uniqueness of the DLMPs is adopted in the model of Verzijlbergh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Forward dynamic pricing is also considered by Zugno et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, who focus on a monopolist retailer who procures electricity at a stochastic price from the spot market, and faces uncertainty in the reaction of consumers to its chosen retail price, as well as an imbalance penalty. Realtime markets for distributed resources are analyzed by Ding et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, who present the organization of the real-time market in the context of the EcoGrid EU pilot project.</p><p>The motivation for this paper is that being able to interpret the DLMP will be crucial in the policy debate that will surround the evolution of distribution markets, in the same way that understanding the behavior of locational marginal prices was crucial in the policy debate that surrounded wholesale markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This question has received limited attention in the literature. Compared to transmission systems, distribution networks exhibit a simpler radial topology, which implies that loop flows (which have been a cause for heated debates surrounding TLMPs) are not relevant. In this respect, the analysis of DLMPs is simpler. However, insofar as the nonlinearities of power flow need to be accounted for, the analysis is more complicated than that of TLMPs. In particular, we wish to understand how congestion, voltage constraints, and real power losses affect the formation of DLMPs. For this purpose, we analyze and compare three alternative approaches for decomposing DLMPs: (i) duality analysis of a second order conic programming (SOCP) relaxation of optimal power flow; (ii) duality analysis of a formulation of optimal power flow with a global power balance constraint; (iii) analysis of the contribution of marginal losses on DLMPs.</p><p>(i) Duality analysis of SOCP. The analysis of KKT conditions often provides important insights about the behavior of prices. For example, the KKT analysis of the DC optimal power flow based on power transfer distribution factors reveals how TLMPs can be expressed as the weighted sum of a reference price plus the weighted sum of the shadow price of congested lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This result is intuitive, and allows for a better understanding of TLMP formation. DLMPs have been commonly analyzed in the literature using the KKT conditions of linearized formulations of the optimal power flow problem. Sotkiewicz and Vignolo <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> derive DLMPs for active and reactive power. Line congestion and voltage are ignored in the analysis of the authors. Similarly, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> assume a linearized model of power flow which ignores voltage, reactive power and real power losses. Recently a large number of convex relaxations of optimal power flow have emerged, including SDP relaxations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and conic relaxations based on the bus injection formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and branch flow formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Although the tightness of such formulations has been studied extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, there has been limited focus on duality analysis, which often provides insights about pricing. In this paper we focus on the duality analysis of the branch flow formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>(ii) Duality analysis of formulation with global power balance constraint. A particularly interesting decomposition of DLMPs is obtained by considering power flows as implicit functions of nodal net injections. This is the approach adopted by the originators of the spot pricing of electricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and it has been applied recently in the context of radial distribution systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Although the DLMP nicely decomposes into components that are directly associated to problem constraints (distribution line capacity, voltage limits, ...), we demonstrate that its computation requires numerical estimation.</p><p>(iii) Analysis of marginal losses. Finally, we discuss a third alternative approach to decomposing DLMPs, which focuses exclusively on the role of real power losses. We argue that this latter approach is well grounded in terms of physical interpretation, and may therefore provide a more intuitive understanding regarding the behavior of DLMPs.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. In section II we present two alternative formulations of the AC optimal power flow problem on radial networks. Each of these formulations is used for obtaining three different decompositions of DLMPs in section III. These alternative decompositions are analyzed and compared on a 15-bus distribution system in section IV. Conclusions and perspectives for future research are discussed in section V. The notation used in the paper is summarized in the appendix. This research has been conducted in the framework of the SmartNet EU project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. OPTIMAL POWER FLOW FORMULATIONS</head><p>In this section we consider two alternative formulations of the optimal power flow problem. Both of these formulations are used in the subsequent analysis. We focus on a radial distribution network, which is represented as a graph (N, E), where N is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges. This graph is a tree, and we denote the root of the tree as 0 and N + = N -{0} as the set of all nodes except the root.</p><p>We associate with each node i: (i) the following decision variables: real power generation p g i , real power consumption p c i , reactive power generation q g i , reactive power consumption q c i , voltage magnitude squared v i ; and (ii) the following parameters: marginal cost of generators C g i , marginal benefit of , and maximum and minimum voltage limits V + i and V - i . Since the network is radial, lines i ∈ E can be indexed by the set N + . We associate with each edge i an ancestor A i and a set of children C i , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In addition, we associate with each edge i: (i) the following decision variables: real power flow f p i from node i to A i (with flow measured on the side of i), reactive power flow f q i from node i to A i (with flow measured on the side of i), current magnitude squared l i ; and (ii) the following parameters: resistance R i , reactance X i , and complex power flow limit S i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Implicit Function Formulation</head><p>This formulation is based on determining a reference node in the network, the voltage magnitude of which is fixed. We set the root node as the reference node. Then the real and reactive power injection at all buses except the reference node, and the voltage magnitude at the root node, fully determine the power flow over the entire network. One can therefore define the following functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(v i (y p , y q , v 0 ), i ∈ N + ), (f p i (y p , y q , v 0 ), i ∈ E), (f q i (y p , y q , v 0 ), i ∈ E), (l i (y p , y q , v 0 ), i ∈ E) where y p = (p g 1 -p c 1 , p g 2 - p c 2 , . . . , p g |N | -p c |N | ) and y q = (q g 1 -q c 1 , q g 2 -q c 2 , . . . , q g |N | -q c |N |</formula><p>). That is to say, the vectors y p and y q specify the real and reactive net power injections for all nodes except the root. We refer to this formulation as an implicit function formulation, because voltage magnitude, current magnitude, and real and reactive power flows are not directly expressed as decision variables, but instead as non-linear functions of voltage magnitude at the root, and net power injections at all buses except for the root. The general model can then be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(I) : max i∈N + C c i p c i - i∈N C g i p g i<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">(η + i ) : f p i (y p , y q , v 0 ) 2 + f q i (y p , y q , v 0 ) 2 ≤ S 2 i , i ∈ E (2) (η - i ) : (f p i (y p , y q , v 0 ) -R i l i ) 2 + (f q i (y p , y q , v 0 ) -X i l i ) 2 ≤ S 2 i , i ∈ E (3) (δ g+ i ) : p g i ≤ P g+ i , i ∈ N (4) (δ g- i ) : P g- i ≤ p g i , i ∈ N (5) (δ c+ i ) : p c i ≤ P c+ i , i ∈ N + (6) (δ c- i ) : P c- i ≤ p c i , i ∈ N + (7) (θ g+ i ) : q g i ≤ Q g+ i , i ∈ N (8) (θ g- i ) : Q g- i ≤ q g i , i ∈ N (9) (θ c+ i ) : q c i ≤ Q c+ i , i ∈ N + (10) (θ c- i ) : Q c- i ≤ q c i , i ∈ N + (11) (σ + i ) : v i (y p , y q , v 0 ) ≤ V + i , i ∈ N + (12) (σ - i ) : V - i ≤ v i (y p , y q , v 0 ), i ∈ N + (13) (φ1) : i∈N p g i = i∈N + p c i + i∈E R i l i (y p , y q , v 0 ) (14) (φ2) : i∈N q g i = i∈N + q c i + i∈E X i l i (y p , y q , v 0 ) (15)</formula><p>where the dual multipliers are indicated with Greek letters in the left of the constraints. The objective of (I) is to maximize social welfare. Constraints ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and (3) correspond to complex flow constraints on both directions of each line <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Constraints ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) correspond to real power capacity limits of distributed generators, and constraints ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) are the upper and lower real power limits of consumers. Constraints ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) -( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) impose analogous limits for reactive power to generators and consumers. Voltage limits are represented in constraints ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>). Real and reactive power balance are represented in constraints ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. We note that limits on line current magnitude can be included in the model of this and the subsequent section in the same way as constraints ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>), but are omitted here in order to simplify the exposition.</p><p>From a computational standpoint, it makes little sense to formulate the problem as (I) because it is highly non-linear and will lead to divergence of commercial non-linear optimization solvers, for networks containing as few as two nodes. Moreover, it is typically not possible to derive the functions</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f p i (•), f q i (•), v i (•), l i (•) in closed form</formula><p>, even for networks of relatively small size. Nevertheless, these functions can be defined (even if one cannot derive them in closed form), and one obtains interesting insights about the formation of DLMPs from this formulation, as we show in the next section.</p><p>In order to derive distribution locational marginal prices for real power (denoted λ n ) and reactive power (denoted µ n ), we decompose the problem by agent and focus on the subproblem of the consumer at location n. This consists of maximizing consumer surplus C c n p c n -λ n p c n -µ n q c n , subject to consumer constraints ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. The optimality conditions of the consumer subproblem reveal the DLMP for real power as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">λ n = C c n -δ c+ n + δ c- n .</formula><p>Analogously, the DLMP for reactive power is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">µ n = θ c+ n -θ c- n .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Second Order Conic Program Formulation</head><p>The following second order cone program corresponds to a convex relaxation of the problem, and is based on Peng and Low <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(II) : max i∈N + C c i p c i - i∈N C g i p g i (<label>16</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(η + i ) : (f p i ) 2 + (f q i ) 2 ≤ S 2 i , i ∈ E (17) (η - i ) : (f p i -l i R i ) 2 + (f q i -l i X i ) 2 ≤ S 2 i , i ∈ E (18) (β i ) : v i -2(R i f p i + X i f q i ) + l i (R 2 i + X 2 i ) = v Ai , i ∈ E (19) (γ i ) : (f p i ) 2 + (f q i ) 2 l i ≤ v i , i ∈ E (20) (λ 0 ) : - j∈C0 (f p j -l j R j ) -p g 0 + G 0 v 0 = 0 (21) (λ i ) : f p i - j∈Ci (f p j -l j R j ) -p g i + p c i + G i v i = 0, i ∈ N +<label>(22)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">(µ 0 ) : - j∈C0 (f q j -l j X j ) -q g 0 -B 0 v 0 = 0 (23) (µ i ) : f q i - j∈Ci (f q j -l j X j ) -q g i + q c i - B i v i = 0, i ∈ N + (24) (σ + i ) : v i ≤ V + i , i ∈ N (25) (σ - i ) : V - i ≤ v i , i ∈ N (26) (4) -(11)</formula><p>Constraints ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) are analogous to constraints (2), (3), with the difference that the flow variables f p i and f q i are expressed as decision variables of (II), rather than functions of decision variables, as is the case in (I). Similarly, constraints (25)-( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) are analogous to constraints ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), and we can set V - 0 = V + 0 in order to fix the root voltage exogenously. Constraints ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) -( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) correspond to a relaxation of the power flow equations, and are derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> is a second order cone constraint, and needs to be satisfied as an equality in order for the problem to admit physical interpretation. The SOCP relaxation is exact under the condition that P c+ i = +∞, Q c+ i = +∞ for all i ∈ N + , see theorem 1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. By 'exact', what is meant is that there exists an optimal solution of (II) such that the inequality constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> is satisfied as an equality. The advantage of (II) over (I) is computational tractability. Nevertheless, duality analysis of each of these problems provides a different viewpoint to DLMPs, as we demonstrate in the next section. DLMPs for real power (denoted λ n ) and reactive power (denoted µ n ) correspond to the dual multipliers of the real power balance constraints ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">22</ref>) and reactive power balance constraints (23)-( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) respectively.</p></div>

DLMP Decomposition Based on the SOCP Formulation</head><p>In this section we derive a recursive formula for DLMPs which exploits the radial structure of the network.

The KKT conditions (52), (53) are appropriate for deriving such a recursive relation, since they link real and reactive power price at a certain node i to the price of the ancestor node. We additionally use KKT condition (51) in order to substitute out β i and γ i from condition (52), thereby arriving at the result of the proposition, which expresses the DLMP at node i as a function of the active power price at the ancestor node, the reactive power price at the current and ancestor node, and the price of congestion over the line that is adjacent to i and A i .</p><p>Certain dual multipliers admit a natural economic interpretation. From conditions (45) we can interpret δ g+ i -δ g- i as the scarcity rent of a generator in location i, which equals the DLMP in that location minus the marginal cost of the local producer. This condition, combined with conditions (55) and (56), simply states that if a generator at a certain location i is producing strictly within its technical region, then the DLMP at that location is equal to the marginal cost of the local resource, but if the DLMP in that location is different from the marginal cost of the local resource then the local generator is at its operating limits (either upper or lower). Analogous interpretations hold for multipliers δ c,+/i and θ g/c,+/i , based on KKT conditions (46) -(48), combined with conditions (57) -(62). Arguing on the basis of sensitivity, the multipliers η +/i can be interpreted as the marginal value of additional distribution line capacity, while the multipliers σ +/i can be interpreted as the marginal value of relaxing voltage constraints. It is not straightforward to provide a meaningful interpretation for multipliers β i and γ i .</p><p>It might be tempting to interpret the recursive condition of proposition 3.2 physically, as follows: a marginal change in real power injection in node i only requires a marginal change in real power injection of the ancestor node and a marginal change in reactive power of the present and ancestor node, while leaving the rest of the network unaffected. This interpretation is incorrect. One can show that nodes beyond the neighbors of i exhibit a non-zero change in their variables (e.g. voltage) in response to a marginal change in real power injection in location i. This inspires the decomposition approach of the next section, based on marginal losses. Interestingly, there seems to be no recursive relation that involves the DLMPs for real power alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. DLMP Decomposition Based on Marginal Losses</head><p>An alternative approach towards understanding DLMPs involves the analysis of the sensitivity of real power losses over branches with respect to marginal changes in nodal injections. This approach provides a physical intuition for understanding DLMPs. In the subsequent proposition we use the following notation for real power losses on a given line i ∈ E:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">Losses i = R i l i . (<label>67</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>Proposition 3.3: Suppose that a single marginal resource is re-dispatched in order to optimally balance a marginal change dD n in net power injection in location n, and denote m as the bus of the marginal resource.

On the other hand, we have that λ m = C g m . Moreover, by definition of the marginal resource, the derivative of p g i with respect to D n is equal to zero for all i = m and the derivative of p c i with respect to D n is also zero for all i ∈ N + . We thus arrive to the following identity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">λ n = λ m (1 + i∈E dLosses i dD n ). (<label>71</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">)</formula><p>The derived identity demonstrates that the DLMP of a given location cannot be understood by reasoning exclusively in terms of the DLMP of the neighbor, even for a radial network. Instead, the impact on losses and re-dispatch over the entire network needs to be understood.</p><p>The sensitivity of losses to nodal injections can be approximated numerically. What we observe in numerical examples, which is in line with physical intuition, is that the sensitivity of losses with respect to nodal injections weakens as we move further away from a node.</p><p>One can gain additional physical intuition about the sensitivity of losses to nodal power injections, dLosses i /dD n , by considering Ohm's law. Provided voltage angles are close across a given line i (which must be true due to stability constraints), decreasing the magnitude of the voltage with the greater magnitude results in a decrease of the voltage difference phasor magnitude. This will therefore decrease the magnitude of the current phasor, as a consequence of Ohm's law, which will reduce losses. The idea is illustrated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Given that a net power injection will tend to reduce the voltage magnitude on a given bus, by inspection of the optimal power flow solution one can predict whether a given net power injection will tend to align voltage magnitudes across neighboring buses (and therefore reduce losses along the line), or vice versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATION</head><p>In this section we analyze the decomposition of DLMPs on a 15-bus example for two scenarios: (i) a case without capacity limits on complex power flows over lines, and (ii) a case with binding capacity limits on complex power flow over lines. We consider the radial system presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, whose parameters are provided in table I. Two flexible resources are located at the root node (node 0) and node 11, with g 0 = 50 $/MWh and C g 11 = 10 $/MWh. The flexible resource at the root has unbounded capacity, P + 0 = +∞, whereas P + 11 = 0.4. Voltage limits are set uniformly to V - i = 0.81 and V + i = 1.21 for all i ∈ E. Demand for real and reactive power, p c i and q c i , is fixed. Most real power consumption is in bus 1. These parameter values remain valid for both the cases considered in sections IV-A and IV-B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Without Line Capacity Limits</head><p>In this case we assume that S i = +∞ for all i ∈ E. Since C g 11 = 10, the maximum possible quantity of real power is injected in node 11. The binding constraints are the voltage magnitude limit and the available capacity of the distributed generator at node 11 (indicated with bold font in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>). The DLMPs are shown in the last column of table II. Observe the drop in the DLMP of location 11, which is the location of the low-cost producer. The DLMP then increases as one moves away from this node. The reason that the DLMP is not equal to C g 11 at location 11 is that the generator at location 11 is   utilized up to its full capacity. A marginal increase in demand in location 11 would have to be served by the root node, (which would incur the marginal cost of the root generator) but would result in real and reactive power savings (instead of losses) since it would depress the voltage in location 11 and bring it closer to the voltage of its neighbors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">i R i X i S i p c i q c i B i •10 -3 0 - - - - -<label>0</label></formula><p>To further illustrate the usefulness of reasoning in terms of losses, consider the prices in locations 7 and 8. One might find it counter-intuitive that the DLMP in location 7 should be lower than that of location 8, since location 7 is further away from the production resources and therefore a marginal increase in real power demand in node 7 might be expected to increase losses. An explanation that stems from reasoning terms of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> is developed as follows: in node 7 we have v 7 = 1.188, which is in fact larger than the voltage magnitude 1949-3053 (c) 2016 IEEE.

The direction of flows is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and the solution is indicated in table III. Note that the transmission capacity limit is binding on line 8 (indicated by bold font in the table), and a load pocket is created in the subset of buses 7-11.</p><p>a) Implicit Function Formulation: The components of the DLMP according to this price decomposition are shown in table IV. Slight differences between the DLMP and the sum of the components may occur due to numerical errors and rounding. The term φ1 is the marginal cost of providing an extra MW at the root node, and is common for all nodes. The voltage contribution is zero for all nodes, since there are no voltage limits that are binding at the optimal solution. The negative sign of the transmission component in the load pocket (nodes 7-11) can be understood physically as follows: a marginal increase in real power demand in any node within this load pocket results in a slight de-congestion of link 8. This implies that demand in other parts of the network can be met by an increase in the output of the low-cost generator in location 11, which results in cost savings.</p><p>b) SOCP Formulation: The decomposition of DLMPs according to this approach is shown in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">V</ref>. The DLMP at a given node is mostly driven by the λ A component, i.e. the  contribution of the DLMP for real power from the ancestor node. The term related to the η + i multiplier is non-zero for node 8, which is located under a congested line. Reactive power prices appear to have a minor influence on the formation of DLMPs.</p><p>c) Marginal Losses: The results for the method based on marginal losses are shown in table VI for a subset of nodes. Note that the loss component that contributes most to the formation of the price is typically in the neighborhood of the node whose DLMP we are considering, and there is a tendency for the contributions to diminish the further away we move from the node in question. For example, when considering the DLMP of node 1 there is tendency for the components to diminish as we move further away from node 1.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Discussion</head><p>The DLMP decomposition based on the KKT analysis of the SOCP formulation (section III-B) is simplest from a computational standpoint. The reason is that there is no need for numerical approximation: the DLMP decomposition for all nodes N + can be obtained by solving model (II) once. The DLMP decomposition based on the implicit function formulation (section III-A) requires additional computational effort, because it is necessary to approximate the partial derivatives of primal decision variables numerically, and this is done by solving the optimal power flow for a reference level of net demand and a slightly perturbed level of net demand. Thus, in order to evaluate the DLMP decomposition for all nodes N + , we need to solve |N + | + 1 optimal power flow problems (once for the reference case, and once for each n ∈ N + at a slightly perturbed level of net demand). The DLMP decomposition based on marginal losses (section III-C) requires the same amount of computation as the approach based on the implicit function formulation.</p><p>We note that as long as the SOCP relaxation remains tractable for large-scale radial networks, the proposed DLMP decompositions remain tractable, even if they scale linearly with the size of the network. It is reasonable to expect that SOCP relaxations of optimal power flow problems for radial networks should scale well with respect to network size, given the recent progress that has been achieved in developing distributed algorithms for these problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and the demonstrated performance of distributed methods on problems of massive scale with hundreds of thousands of nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Note that the DLMP decomposition of each node can be computed independently of other nodes, thereby enabling further benefits from parallelization.</p><p>In terms of physical intuition, the approach based on marginal losses appears to be the most intuitive to interpret. The approach based on the implicit function formulation generalizes the standard models used in the literature by the originators of the theory of the spot pricing of electricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, while the approach based on the KKT analysis of the SOCP relaxation provides an alternative recursive relation. However, both approaches are more challenging to interpret than the approach based on marginal losses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES</head><p>In this paper we have presented three approaches towards understanding the formation of DLMPs in radial distribution networks. We have demonstrated that these methods are capable of predicting DLMPs within acceptable numerical error on a 15-bus example. Among these methods, the approach based on marginal losses appears to be better grounded in terms of physical intuition. In future work it will be interesting to explore the KKT conditions of alternative convex relaxations that may provide further insight regarding the behavior of DLMPs, and the impact of reserve on energy price formation. At a higher level, the transition towards mobilizing distributed resources will require the clarification of the interactions between TSOs, DSOs and aggregators, and addressing the computational challenges that arise from the vast number of distributed resources and the non-linearities of the distribution network.</p></div>

However, lowering the voltage in node 7 brings it closer, in magnitude, to the voltage in node 8, which tends to reduce the current magnitude flowing over the line. Therefore, one can expect that a marginal increase in demand in location 7 should result in reduced losses in line 8. This is indeed validated by the numerical solution of the model, which gives dLosses 8 /dD 7 = -0.017.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>431</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>50</cell></row><row><cell>1</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.218</cell><cell cols="3">0.945 0.231 50.06</cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.152</cell><cell cols="3">1.009 0.151 46.79</cell></row><row><cell>3</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.169</cell><cell cols="3">1.121 0.151 42.04</cell></row><row><cell>4</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.005</cell><cell cols="3">1.118 0.004 42.14</cell></row><row><cell>5</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.003</cell><cell cols="3">1.116 0.002 42.21</cell></row><row><cell>6</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.001</cell><cell cols="3">1.113 0.0005 42.30</cell></row><row><cell>7</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.039</cell><cell cols="3">1.188 0.033 39.78</cell></row><row><cell>8</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.262</cell><cell cols="3">1.168 0.224 40.49</cell></row><row><cell>9</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.118</cell><cell cols="3">1.177 0.101 40.23</cell></row><row><cell>10</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.139</cell><cell cols="3">1.199 0.116 39.60</cell></row><row><cell>11</cell><cell>0.4</cell><cell>0.092</cell><cell>0.158</cell><cell>1.21</cell><cell cols="2">0.130 39.32</cell></row><row><cell>12</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.436</cell><cell cols="3">0.959 0.455 50.07</cell></row><row><cell>13</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.001</cell><cell cols="3">0.950 0.001 50.46</cell></row><row><cell>14</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.001</cell><cell cols="3">0.944 0.001 50.69</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">of the neighboring node 8, v 8</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>

Distribution line capacity constraints become relevant in this context. Ignoring capacity constraints would simplify the DLMP decomposition presented in the following sections, since terms related to line capacity constraints drop out.</p></note>
