<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the primary protocol used to exchange routing information between various Autonomous systems (AS) and domains. BGP can exhibit anomalous behavior due to malicious attacks, system failure, extra traffic or network operator problems. Once BGP messages with wrong information make their way into the network, it can have a cascading effect as more and more systems update their BGP records with the wrong information. These anomalies are not easily detected due to the large volume of BGP messages sent and received over the network. Typically, most autonomous systems do not confirm if a BGP update is authentic or not because of the associated cost of verifying a huge number of BGP messages, which creates the need for an alternate way of detecting BGP anomalies. This work attempts to use supervised machine learning techniques on BGP records to detect such anomalies. In this study, an SVM model and an MLP model are developed, trained, and fine-tuned to detect BGP anomalies. In the simulation, the SVM and MLP models achieve the best accuracy of 91.31% and 90.05% respectively, over a scrapped dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The internet as we know it today exists because innumerable routers transfer data amongst each other so that the relevant information reaches the desired IP destination. IP addresses are usually grouped to form a prefix, which are owned by Autonomous Systems (AS). When routers need to forward packets outside of their own Autonomous System, they use an exterior gateway protocol to decide which AS they should forward the packet to so that it reaches the destination IP in the least possible time. BGP is the most commonly used exterior gateway protocol that accomplishes this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The internet was designed with the inherent assumption of trust, which becomes apparent in the case of BGP. This protocol relies on the assumption that interconnected networks ultimately tell the truth about which IPs are under them. This is where BGP Hijacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> comes into the picture. Each AS advertises the IP prefixes which are under its network, and by its very design, BGP assumes that route announcements made by the Autonomous Systems are true. An AS can announce that it owns a prefix although it actually does not. If this announcement is done in a planned manner, it can lead to Denial of Service. The AS can also announce that it can provide the shortest route to the destination IP (even if it is not true). This broadcast makes all the data go through the malicious AS, while it sniffs the packets for sensitive information or causes large scale redirection of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>BGP attacks can compromise the end user's confidentiality and availability of resources. Further, BGP attacks are not a thing of the past -they pose a contemporary threat to the functioning and security of the internet. One of the recent BGP attacks happened in April 2020 on Amazon's AWS and Akamai's CDN services, which caused service disruptions at a global level <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It is important to detect BGP anomalies in a timely manner to stop such scenarios from repeating.</p><p>A BGP session begins after the TCP connection has been established. It is debatable that on which layer does BGP exactly works. As anything working over TCP is considered in the Application Layer, that is the decided upon norm. The basic TCP + BGP handshake is shown Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A BGP session is preceded by a three-way TCP handshake, and starts with a 6-way BGP handshake, including the Open, Keep Alive, and an Update message from each side <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The records of all the BGP messages over various routes are maintained by monitoring agencies, which can be used as a log. For any given minute, tens of thousands of BGP messages are sent over the internet, thus making anomaly detection a computationally intensive task. In this study, we have tried to build and optimize models that use fewer features than previous approaches without compromising much on the accuracy. The resultant models are comparatively less computational intensive, which is essential for working with real-time data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>BGP is the default routing protocol for communication between autonomous systems. However, it is prone to various malicious attacks, power failures and other system problems due to its simplicity. BGP anomaly detection has been an interest of research for various researchers and scientists across the globe. BGP anomalies can be due to worm attacks (like Nimda, Code Red, Slammer) or due to IP prefix hijacks. In some cases, the anomaly can also be caused by non-malicious reasons like simple electric failures or router misconfigurations. Over time, quite a few approaches have been used to detect BGP anomalies. These approaches range from rule based detection techniques to the more recent approaches of using machine learning and neural networks.</p><p>The problem with rule based detection techniques to detect BGP anomalies is that the rules do not scale easily. As the systems become increasingly complex with more number of features, the complexity of rules increases as well. Rule based systems are also not efficient in catching novel attacks. Machine learning approaches, on the other hand, are not limited by this. They can be provided with sufficient information about the features and can be used to build a model having a reasonable accuracy even with previously unseen data.</p><p>Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks for solving scientific and engineering problems has become an active area of research. A survey for BGP anomaly detection techniques can be found in Bahaa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. A good review of the application of machine learning techniques (mainly feature selection) is presented by Zhida et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Various supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and unsupervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> machine learning models have been introduced to detect these anomalies. For supervised, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Perceptron have been used for binary classification. Alternatively, the unsupervised mechanisms primarily include the k-means clustering technique.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> used decision trees and fuzzy rough sets and extreme learning machine classifier, thereby achieving an accuracy of 80.08%. Marijana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> used 15 BGP features and also took care of the imbalanced classes by re-sampling. This process significantly improved the classification accuracy. The work done by Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> used a single decision tree for classifying into anomalous and normal classes; an accuracy of 85% was achieved in it. Allahabadi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> used a framework of multiple SVMs, which achieved an accuracy in the range of 88-95%. Among various approaches, SVM (Support Vector Machine) finds its usage owing to its robust nature regarding better feature generalization. Furthermore, it uses a variety of kernels to deal with both linear and non-linear data.</p><p>Using Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP) is another approach that has consistently been used to achieve high accuracy. Working on a limited dataset, Karimi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> used an MLP model to get an accuracy of 98% in detecting BGP anomalies over Slammer, Nimda, and Code Red worms. Hence, in this study, we have attempted to develop machine learning models that can detect BGP anomalies using fewer features, while retaining high recognition accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. METHODOLOGY</head><p>The broad methodology of the project is the following sequence of processes. Firstly, we collect the feature dataset for three worm attacks -Slammer, Nimda, and Code Red-I (along with the relevant normal day dataset) from the RIPE NCC database <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In this regard, RIPE NCC stands for Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre. Amongst other things, it maintains the records of BGP update messages sent over the internet in the form of MRT dumps. These dumps are then processed and converted into a usable format. We identify crucial features from these dumps for the detection of BGP anomalies, which are subsequently used for training the SVM and MLP models with varied settings. We perform extensive empirical analysis for optimizing and fine-tuning the models. Finally, we compare our results with related works <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in detecting known BGP attacks like Slammer, Code Red, and Nimda. The block diagram of our work is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Attacks</head><p>Table I lists the three of the most well-known BGP attacks along with the time period in which they happened. The individual attacks are explained as follows. • Slammer caused Denial of Service by exploiting a buffer overflow bug, this one in Microsoft's SQL Servers. It generated random IP addresses and sent its copy to those addresses. In case the address happened to be a valid one (along with a few more favorable conditions), the machine would get infected and will start sending copies of Slammer. The complete raw dataset of BGP update messages in the form of MRT messages is available from the RIPE route collector site <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The datasets are month-wise organized in folders. When converted using a suitable tool, the MRT files give us the raw BGP messages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data Pre-processing</head><p>Using ML models for finding BGP anomalies is becoming an increasingly relevant field of research. For research purposes, Simon Fraser University (SFU) hosts an archive of aggregated values for certain select features over the time period of a few famous BGP attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. It contains the data for 37 features, aggregated for time slots of one minute each, along with corresponding labels for supervised learning (-1 for normal behaviour and 1 for anomalous behaviour).</p><p>Some open-source API tools exist that help in data collection and extraction of selected features. One such tool is the BGPStream API, which can be used to dump selected feature details in a CSV file using a python script. However, some features are not present in the archives and the APIs have not been programmed to extract them. As such, a scrapybased crawler was developed to manually download the MRT dumps for the selected dates from the RIPE NCC database. As presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, an MRT dump is encoded and is hence not readable. To extract the BGP messages from these dumps, we use mrtparse.</p><p>It is an open-source tool that can parse and convert MRT files to BGP dumps. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows a sample BGP message extracted from an MRT file. Using MRT RFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> as a reference, a python script was developed to process the BGP messages and aggregate feature counts for time slots of one minute. These extracted feature records were labeled as -1 for a normal record, and 1 for an anomalous record. This labeling process enabled us in maintaining consistency with the SFU archives database. After decoding and labeling, the records were exported to a CSV file, which was subsequently used for training and testing the models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Training the SVM Model</head><p>A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally characterized by a separating hyperplane. An SVM algorithm takes labeled data for training and builds a model that assigns a category to the new testing data. This classifier separates the data by creating an optimal hyperplane which separates the new input data. For example, a hyperplane would be a line separating the two classes in a 2-D space. There are different tuning parameters which are available for SVM. These are stated as follows:</p><p>• Kernel: Different standard kernels are available like linear, polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid. • Regularization: This parameter controls how much misclassification is allowed. • Gamma: This value defines how far or close points will be considered or not as valid points for the decision function.</p><p>• Margin: A good margin is equidistant from the support vector of both classes. The main parameter tuned for this work is the kernel; hence different kernel functions are tried and compared. The SFU database <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> was used for training the SVM model. The dataset consists of one minute update information for 37 features for 5 days, 7 days and 5 days for Slammer, Nimda and Code Red-I respectively. In total, 37, 32 and top 5 features were finally used for the current model. The dataset was upscaled to avoid imbalanced classes. Further, it is necessary to normalize the data to have meaningful insights since it is measured along different scales. Hence, the data was normalized using the StandardScaler method of the scikitlearn's library. Table II lists all the 37 extracted BGP features.</p><p>Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) is calculated for each of the features against each feature. This metric determines the strength of association between two variables X and Y , and how closely are they related. In our work, r is calculated for each of the 37 features as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r = n i=1 (x i − x)(y i − y) n i=1 (x i − x) 2 (y i − y) 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x i and y i iterate over all the individual values of features X and Y respectively, whereas x and y denote the corresponding mean values of features X and Y respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the heatmap of the correlation between the different features. It can be used for forecasting wheather a BGP record is normal or anomalous. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Training the MLP Model</head><p>A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based neural network is used for training and testing the model on the labeled dataset (supervised learning). MLP uses Back-Propagation for training. The neural network was chosen to contain two hidden layers whose number of nodes was determined by using the optimal formula as stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Accordingly, the number of nodes in the first and second hidden layers was fixed at 153 and 51. The activation function used for the input layer and the hidden layers was relu (Rectified Linear Unit), while the activation function used for the output layer was sigmoid.</p><p>For the MLP model, the data was manually collected using the scrapy crawler, parsed through the mrtparse tool, processed by building a python script, and finally exported in a CSV file. The data was present for six days in total -three days when the attacks happened and three days that work as base cases. The final dataset contains 8640 rows for a total of 11 fields -the eight extracted features, two fields indicating the hour and minute for which the row was processed, and a label that marks whether the row is anomalous or not. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>   No. of prefixes announced 5</p><p>No. of prefixes withdrawn 6</p><p>No. of duplicate prefixes announced 7</p><p>No. of duplicate prefixes withdrawn 8</p><p>No. of prefixes announced after withdrawal and vice versa</p><p>The model was simulated while using binary cross-entropy loss function, along with the Adam optimizer. The model randomly divides the dataset into a 9:1 ratio, trains over 90% of the dataset, while the rest 10% (containing both anomalous and normal records) is used to test the model. The simulation was repeated multiple times to make sure that the results are consistent in each iteration. An epoch of 25 and a batch size of 5 was taken while training the model due to limited computing resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Performance Metrics</head><p>The metric used to measure the effectiveness of the model is accuracy. It is a measure of the fraction of the predictions that the model gets right. Formally, it is defined as the correctly predicted data points out of all the data points. It is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">accuracy = T P + T N T P + T N + F P + F N<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where, T P is the True Positives, T N is the True Negatives, F P is the False Positives, and F N denotes the False Negatives. The performance of any pattern recognition model can be visually analyzed through the associated ROC curve under various threshold settings. The curve is a graph between True positive rate (T P R) on the y-axis and False positive rate (F P R) on the x-axis. These terms are further defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T P R = T P T P + F N F P R = F P F P + T N (3)</formula><p>The Area under the curve (AUC) scores, defined in the interval [0, 1], are also computed for the various models. The closer the value of AUC is to one, the better is the model performance, and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Results on SVM</head><p>The test accuracy values for different SVM kernels are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">IV</ref>. The accompanying ROC curves are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. As noticeable, SVM with the linear kernel performs better with the top five features. The best performance is obtained by the quadratic kernel, which resulted in an accuracy of 91.31% over the top 5 features. When compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, there is a slight deviation in the results. They concluded that the kernel with linear function gives the best accuracy because the inputs are linearly separable, while in our case, the quadratic kernel gives the best accuracy when considering the top five features. The input features get transformed into a higher dimension while using a polynomial kernel with degree two. Instead of finding a point that separates the anomalies and normal data, the support vector finds a line that separates the two categories. The RBF kernel and the cubic kernel correspond to the highest ROC scores for the "All features" and "Selected Features" categories, followed by the linear kernel. In the "Top 5 features" category, the linear kernel outperforms all the others. This is in line with the results achieved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, who attributed this observation to the fact that the inputs were linearly separable. Another interesting observation is that the quadratic kernel has the lowest ROC AUC score in all the categories. This result is contrary to one would anticipate from taking into account just the accuracy scores. However, the AUC and Accuracy are not directly comparable in a practical scenario. This contradiction occurs since the accuracy has been obtained is for a specific threshold value, whereas AUC gives a rough idea of how a binary classifier performs when it is averaged across all possible decision thresholds. One reason for this apparent mismatch is that the quadratic kernel performs much better than others only above an optimal threshold. This trend can also be seen in the ROC curves for "Top 5 features", wherein the curve for quadratic kernel tops the others.  The overall accuracy of the MLP model was observed to be 90.05%. These results are significantly better than Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which has an accuracy of 85%, and are also comparable to that of Allahabadi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which achieves an accuracy of 85%, 95%, and 98% for the three attacks separately. However, our results significantly deviate from Karimi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, since they were able to attain an accuracy of 98%. The possible explanations for this deviation can potentially be attributed to the difference in the used datasets. For both this study and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the dataset is over the same six days. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have considered 5535 records (one record is for one minute), while this project has considered all the 8640 records. Some of these records correspond to fading work attacks. Although these attacks are technically anomalous, they effectively resemble regular updates. A higher classification accuracy could be potentially achieved if these specific records are removed from the dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Results on MLP</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE</head><p>The work in this paper attempts to detect anomalies in the BGP using two supervised machine learning techniques, namely SVM and MLP. The quadratic kernel of the SVM Model and MLP with two hidden layers were both able to attain an accuracy of over 90%. As normal BGP records are abundant while anomalous records are scarce, balancing needs to be done when training the models on larger datasets. Various sampling techniques like SMOTE, down-scaling the majority class and up-scaling the minority class can be used for balancing. Finding which techniques give the most optimal results would be an important area of research. Further, a hybrid model can be developed and fine-tuned for achieving better classification accuracy.</p><p>Another future scope of this work is to automate it on realtime data. However, there are some challenges to this objective. The trends of BGP records (and their reporting formats) have evolved significantly over time with the increased usage of the internet. Hence, the accuracy achieved in detecting the BGP anomalies when training with Slammer, Nimda, and</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
