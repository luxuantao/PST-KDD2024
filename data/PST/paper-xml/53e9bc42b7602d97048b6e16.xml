<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper studies optimal tracking and regulation control problems, in which objective functions of tracking error and regulated response, defined by integral square measures, are to be minimized jointly with the control effort, where the latter is measured by the plant input energy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N RECENT years, there has been growing attention devoted to the studies of intrinsic performance limits achievable by feedback control (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and the references therein). In these studies, it has been customary to examine certain classical optimal control problems under optimality criteria formulated in time or frequency domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which have led to explicit expressions of the best achievable performance. Two of such well-studied problems are the optimal reference tracking and optimal regulation problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It has been known that the minimal tracking error depends upon the nonminimum phase zeros and time delays in the plant, while the minimal regulation energy depends upon the plant unstable poles. These results, together with Bode and Poisson integral relations which form another branch of performance studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, reveal that in one way or another the performance of feedback systems is fundamentally constrained by the nonminimum phase zeros, unstable poles, and time delays in the plant.</p><p>It should be recognized, nevertheless, that the performance criteria alluded to beforehand are highly idealistic, and thus serve more appropriately as an ideal, theoretical bound. Indeed, in the optimal tracking problem, in order to attain the minimal tracking error, the input to the plant is often required to have an infinite energy. This, of course, is seldom possible in practice, and in a more realistic setting, the input must be constrained in magnitude or energy. This consideration leads us to reexamine the tracking problem, to study the best tracking accuracy achievable when only finite input energy is available. More specifically, we consider an optimal tracking control problem in which not only the step error response, but also the plant input energy, both quantified under a square-integral or an measure, is penalized. It is worth noting that such a performance objective, albeit a standard one in optimal control, has been investigated mainly in the so-called cheap control strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, that is, in the limit when the control penalty vanishes. In the present formulation, the control effort is fixed instead of being "cheap." This effectively restrains the control effort, defined as the energy of the control input.</p><p>Optimal tracking with finite control energy is just one case of many design objectives which seek to constrain the control effort explicitly. Another example of primary interest in this paper is the problem of optimal regulation under control effort constraint. In this classical optimal control problem, the output response due to a nonzero initial condition is to be restored to zero. We seek to accomplish this while minimizing jointly the output response and the control energy under the objective. Additionally, we also study some related constrained optimization problems which seek to constrain rather than penalize the control effort. It is worth emphasizing that both the tracking and regulation problems under consideration, whether the control energy is a control objective or a constraint, are all dual objective optimal control problems, in which a predominant concern lies in the control effort. In the optimal control framework, they amount to the so-called "two-block" problems. With this defining feature, the control objectives take into account the system's properties at both the plant input and output, which in general may vary widely, a fact perceived as a main source of control design difficulty for multivariable systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. More generally, both problems may be viewed as certain special cases of the general optimal disturbance attenuation problem, where the disturbance signal may enter the system at either the plant input or output. Specifically, while the step reference tracking problem can be reformulated as one of disturbance attenuation with a step disturbance at the plant output, the regulation problem corresponds to an impulse disturbance signal at the plant input.</p><p>We study these dual objective problems in both one-and twoparameter control schemes. Our primary motivation in this work is twofold. First, not only are the problems practically more relevant and generically more meaningful, but they in fact find rather pertinent applications in the design of mechanical systems; indeed, our investigation into the aforementioned tracking problem has been motivated by issues encountered in control of mechanical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It has been found in these studies that due to control energy constraint, which is typically required in mechanical systems, the system's performance may be restricted in rather different ways than predicted by the existing theory; for example, in some cases, the system's nonminimum phase behavior is no longer a dominant factor. Next, our investigation is also driven by a deeper goal, in hope of discovering control constraints and limitations beyond those already known. Specifically, under more realistic and thus more restrictive conditions allowable for control, would there exist other performance limitations than those imposed by nonminimum phase zeros, unstable poles, and time delays? We maintain that this question may receive an answer only when more practical performance goals are taken into consideration, specifically when conflicting design objectives are to be considered jointly; such is not the case with the standard tracking and regulation problems, nor will the answer be available from the Bode and Poisson integrals, or from the standard sensitivity and complementary sensitivity minimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In these problems, only a single, limiting control objective is considered.</p><p>While from a numerical standpoint the problems under study herein can all be solved using standard control methods and routines, our development yields analytical solutions. These analytical expressions are crucial for analyzing the limitations on the best achievable performance. Among other things, they show how the bandwidth of the plant may constrain the tracking accuracy when its input energy is finite. Control limitation due to the plant bandwidth is frequently encountered in practical designs, but rarely seems to have been characterized analytically. It is clear from our result that a constraint on the plant bandwidth will play a significant role in hampering tracking capability; the limitation exists whenever the plant input energy is kept finite, though it does vanish when the energy is allowed to be arbitrarily large. More generally, our results demonstrate in all cases how the best achievable performance may depend on the plant gain in the entire frequency range, and in particular help explain how lightly damped poles and antiresonant zeros in the plant may limit the achievable performance. The latter has a particularly close bearing on the control of mechanical systems, which typically exhibit lightly damped modes and anti-resonant zeros. The results thus unravel and quantify analytically yet another source of intrinsic feedback constraints. Needless to say, these constraints are consistent with one's intuition and exist in practical designs, though they may not be observed nor captured in theoretical, idealized control design problems, such as the aforementioned single-objective optimal control problems.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we define the notation and introduce the Youla parameterization of stabilizing controllers. We then proceed in Section III to formulate and solve the problem of optimal tracking under control effort constraint. This is done for plants that contain integrators but otherwise are stable, and with a one-parameter control structure; herein the presence of integral actions in the plant is necessary for the problem to be wellposed. The section also provides a brief narrative of allpass factorization of nonminimum phase transfer function matrices. Our development gives rise to a closed-form expression of the minimal achievable performance, which is seen to depend upon the plant nonminimum phase zeros as well as its gain at all frequencies, and which is further analyzed for its implications. A related constrained optimization problem is also investigated and a closed-form solution is obtained. Some numerical examples are provided which are shown to confirm the theoretical results. In Section IV, we state and develop parallel results for the optimal regulation problem with control effort consideration, using also one-parameter controllers. The results show similarly how the best performance may be constrained by the plant unstable poles, and by its gain. The roles of lightly damped poles and antiresonant zeros will then become clear. Extensions of these results are pursued in Section V, which investigates whether or not two-parameter controllers may improve the performance, thus ridding the performance of the effect due to the plant gain. It is shown nonetheless that two-parameter control cannot at all alter the performance limits fundamentally, especially that imposed by the plant gain. The paper concludes in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARY BACKGROUND</head><p>We begin with a brief description of the notation. For any complex number , we denote its complex conjugate by . For any vector , we denote its transpose by and conjugate transpose by</p><p>. For a pair of nonzero vectors and , we define the principal angle between their directions (i.e., the spaces spanned by the vectors), by For any signal , we denote its Laplace transform by . The transpose and conjugate transpose of a matrix are denoted by and , and its largest and smallest singular values are, respectively, and . If is a hermitian matrix, we denote its largest and smallest eigenvalues by and . For simplicity, we shall suppress the dimensions of vectors and matrices, with the understanding that all the dimensions are compatible. Let the open right-half plane be denoted by , the open left half plane by , and the imaginary axis by . Moreover, let denote the Euclidean vector norm. We shall frequently encounter the Hilbert space in which the inner product is defined as It is a well-known fact that admits an orthogonal decomposition into the subspaces Thus, for any and . We caution that for each of these normed spaces, we use the same notation to denote the corresponding norm; however, use of each of these norms will be clear from the context. Finally, we denote by the class of all stable, proper rational transfer function matrices.</p><p>We shall first consider the feedback configuration of finite dimensional linear time-invariant systems depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which represents the standard unity feedback, one-parameter control scheme; the more general two-parameter control structure will be deferred till Section V. In this setup, represents the plant model and the compensator. We shall denote by and their transfer function matrices; more generally, from this point onward we shall use the same symbol to denote a system and its transfer function, and whenever convenient, to omit the dependence on the frequency variable . The signals , and are, respectively, the reference input, the disturbance input, the plant input, and the system output. For a given reference , a compensator is to be designed so that the output tracks , while preventing the energy of from being excessively large. Similarly, for a given insures that its response be attenuated with a finite energy in . For the rational transfer function matrix , let its right and left coprime factorizations be given by . It is well-known that to stabilize every compensator is characterized by the Youla parameterization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Thus, to either track the reference or regulate the response of , the controller is to be selected from .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Formulation</head><p>In the optimal tracking problem, we assume that the system's response results solely from the reference input . Hence, we assume that , and that the system is initially at rest. The tracking control system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. We adopt an integral square criterion to measure the tracking error and the plant input energy. This leads to the performance index</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(3.1)</formula><p>Here,</p><p>, is a parameter to be determined a priori at one's choice, and it may be used to weigh the relative importance of tracking objective versus that of constraining the input energy. It follows from the well-known Parseval identity that Furthermore, let the system sensitivity function be defined by Then, it is immediate to find that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(3.2)</formula><p>For any given , we want to determine the optimal performance achievable by all stabilizing compensators from the set , defined by Hence, for a nonzero , the optimal compensator attempts to minimize jointly the tracking error and the plant input energy. In the limiting case, when defines the minimal tracking error with no regard to input energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and the minimization problem coincides with one of cheap control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For , it reduces to an optimal energy regulation problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>In studying the optimal tracking problem, we shall assume that is right-invertible, by which we mean that has a right inverse for some . For a right-invertible , it is well-known (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) that each of its nonminimum phase zeros is also one for . In other words, a point is a nonminimum phase zero of if and only if for some unitary vector , where is the (output) direction vector associated with the zero , and the subspace spanned by is termed the (output) direction of . Let , be the nonminimum phase zeros of . It is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to factorize as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(3.3)</formula><p>where represents the minimum phase part of , and an allpass factor. A useful allpass factor is given by (3.4) We refer the details of this factorization to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; for the present purpose, it suffices to point out that the unitary vector can be sequentially determined from the zero direction vectors of , and forms together with a unitary matrix. Likewise, if has poles , it is also possible to factorize in the same manner, yielding</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(3.5)</formula><p>where is minimum phase, and is allpass and collects all the poles of in . Specifically, can be constructed as <ref type="bibr">(3.6)</ref> where the unitary vector can be computed analogously from the pole direction vectors of , and forms a unitary matrix together with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. It is useful to note that both and admit right inverses analytic in , and hence are the outer factors of and , respectively. It is also worth pointing out that and . These two properties will be used explicitly in the subsequent development.</p><p>Throughout this section, we consider the step reference input</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(3.7)</formula><p>where the constant vector specifies the magnitude and the direction of the input. Without loss of generality, we take as a unitary vector, , and call the subspace spanned by the input direction. The Laplace transform of is . In view of (3.2), it is clear that in order for to be finite, the sensitivity function must have a zero at ; that is, either the plant or the compensator must contain an integrator, and to prevent hidden instability, none may have a zero at the origin. This necessitates the following assumption.</p><p>Assumption 1: has no zero at . On the other hand, it is also clear from (3.2) that to maintain a finite energy cost precludes the possibility that may have an integrator; instead, the required integrator must be in . Thus, it is also necessary to postulate.</p><p>Assumption 2: has a pole at . We note that Assumption 1 is standard in step reference tracking problems, while Assumption 2 can be met in many cases of interest (e.g., mechanical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>), where the plant contains integrators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Main Results</head><p>We will now attempt to derive an analytical expression for the optimal performance . To proceed, we first rewrite as or, equivalently <ref type="bibr">(3.8)</ref> These follow from a standard algebraic manipulation. Furthermore, we perform an inner-outer factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> such that <ref type="bibr">(3.9)</ref> where is an inner matrix function, and is outer. Our main result in this section concerns plants which have no pole in , i.e., marginally stable plants. Proof: See Appendix A. Theorem 1 demonstrates that unlike in the standard tracking problem, the optimal performance herein generally depends on, in addition to the nonminimum phase zeros, also the minimum phase part of the plant. The effect from the latter is captured by the second and the third terms in (3.13), and is made especially transparent by the lower bound (3.15). Since is nonnegative, this effect will in general lead to an increase in the minimal achievable cost. Indeed, while may or may not have zeros in , which is partly due to the input direction and hence the corresponding effect may disappear, the lower bound (3.15) shows that will not vanish unless or . The former corresponds to the case that the tracking error is taken as the sole performance objective, with no regard to the control effort. In the latter case, since the plant is itself marginally stable, it is unsurprising that only an arbitrarily small amount of energy is needed to stabilize the system, that is, . This derivation yields also a byproduct useful for computing the optimal performance. The following expression for becomes clear instantly from (A.5), given in Appendix A.</p><p>Corollary 1: For defined by <ref type="bibr">(3.11)</ref>, let its zeros and poles be , and , respectively. Then, under the assumptions in Theorem 1 <ref type="bibr">(3.16)</ref> Proof: It suffices to note that and, hence, that The result then follows using (A.5).</p><p>Thus, Theorem 1, with the aid of Corollary 1, serves to provide also a rather computable expression for the optimal performance, hence solving analytically an important case of the general "two-block" optimal control problems. Additionally, for single-input single-output systems, Theorem 1 can be further strengthened, as shown in the following corollary.</p><p>Corollary 2: Let be a scalar transfer function. Under the assumptions in Theorem 1 (3.17)</p><p>Proof: For a single-input-single-output (SISO) system, , which is minimum phase. Furthermore</p><p>The result then follows from Theorem 1.</p><p>The implication of Theorem 1, and in particular that of Corollary 2, are now worth noting. First, while it has been long well known that nonminimum phase zeros impose fundamental performance limits, these results show that certain zeros in the left-half plane are also likely to play a significant role, when the performance objective takes into account of the input energy. Indeed, with the objective under consideration herein, the achievable performance can be seriously constrained as well by those minimum phase zeros close to the imaginary axis, i.e., those anti-resonant zeros. This is seen by noting that in the vicinity of such zeros may be rather small, thus rendering the integral in (3.17) large. Evidently, the statement extends to multivariable systems as well, when the plant has such blocking zeros. Due to the weighting factor , the zeros close to the origin have more negative an effect.</p><p>Let us now consider a related constrained optimization problem instead of the unconstrained problem with the performance index (3.1). The problem seeks to minimize the tracking error while constraining explicitly the control effort Let the optimal cost be denoted by . For SISO plants, we also obtain a closed-form solution for this problem, based on Corollary 2.</p><p>Corollary 3: Suppose that is a scalar transfer function satisfying the assumptions in Theorem 1. Let a positive number be given, where Proof: Denote the optimal cost in (3.17) by , to emphasize its dependence on . It follows that or, equivalently This implies that We will show from the convexity property of the problem that in the aforementioned inequality, the equality can be attained by some # . It is known that the feasibility region for the existence of a stabilizing controller in the -space is convex (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). Therefore, for any given , there always exists a straight line which is tangent to the convex feasibility region through the point , where the slope of the line is given by # # . As such, we have where Let us calculate the derivative of with respect to . From the fact that It is readily seen that which is monotonically decreasing with respect to . This implies that a positive unique solution of (3.20) is the maximizer of , provided that it exists. Note that insures the existence of a positive solution of (3.20), and that be negative for all if . The latter condition means that is the optimizer, or . This completes the proof.</p><p>The following remarks are in order for Corollary 3.</p><p>• The corollary provides a simple formula to determine the optimal cost for the constrained optimal control problem, thus making available a procedure different from that of linear matrix inequality optimization. In this vein, we may first solve the unique positive solution of <ref type="bibr">(3.20)</ref>. This is rather simple, for the equation involves only one variable, and in particular, the left-hand side of (3.20) is a monotone function with respect to . Once is found, can be calculated directly using <ref type="bibr">(3.19</ref>).</p><p>• The second and third terms on the right hand side of <ref type="bibr">(3.19)</ref> are independent of the nonminimum phase zeros. This implies that the constraint on the control input effort does not cause any extra deterioration incurred by the nonminimum phase zeros. In other words, the corollary exhibits a separation property between the effect due to control input restriction and that due to nonminimum phase zeros. • If is biproper, only the finite control effort , instead of an infinite control effort, is required to achieve the best tracking performance, which is given by . We conclude this subsection with an extension to time-delay systems. It has been known from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> that in the standard tracking problem, time delays will generally constrain the best tracking performance, in much the same manner as nonminimum phase zeros. We extend Theorem 1 to investigate how time delays may affect the tracking performance in the present setting, i.e., when control effort is also incorporated in the tracking objective. For this purpose, we concentrate on plants with measurement delays, which amount to transfer function matrices of the form <ref type="bibr">(3.22)</ref> where is a real rational transfer function matrix, and . . . collects the time-delay units in the channels of the plant with delay times . For the plant , we define in exactly the same manner as in (3.1) the performance objective, and denote it by . Accordingly, the optimal performance is We study with respect to the step reference input (3.7). Our following result shows that while time delays do constrain further the performance, in the same way as known previously, the limit due to the plant gain, i.e., , is invariant. Along with Theorem 1, this result then demonstrates a clear separation of the effect due to the nonminimum phase behavior (i.e., that of both nonminimum phase zeros and time delays) from that imposed by the minimum phase part of the plant.</p><p>Theorem 2: Let be given by (3.22) and given as in Theorem 1. Then, under Assumption 1 <ref type="bibr">(3.23)</ref> where is the optimal performance in the absence of delay, given in (3.13). In particular, if is a scalar transfer function, then <ref type="bibr">(3.24)</ref> Proof: See Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Bandwidth Consideration</head><p>As suggested in a remark ensuing Corollary 2, while in general the performance is affected by at all frequencies, this effect is particularly dominating in the low frequency range. It is clear from both (3.15) and (3.17) that a low plant gain at low frequencies will lead to a large value of . This, of course, is expected, for to achieve good tracking performance requires a high-loop gain, which, in the case of a low-plant gain, requires high controller compensation and is thus in direct conflict with the control effort constraint. The observation is captured in the following corollary.</p><p>Corollary 4: Suppose that for some constants and Intuitively, since accurate tracking also tends to demand a fast system response and, hence, a high bandwidth, it is likely that the plant bandwidth would also impose a limit on the achievable performance. This intuition is confirmed by the following result.</p><p>Corollary 5: Let be the crossover frequency for , i.e., Then, under the assumptions in Theorem 1 Similarly, to establish (3.28), we note that</p><p>Here, the equality is obtained by integration by parts, while the last inequality follows from the fact that</p><p>The proof is then completed.</p><p>From Corollary 5, we conclude that the plant bandwidth necessarily imposes a constraint on the best achievable performance, which will only become nonexistent when either or . Hence, the result brings to light another class of fundamental design constraints, one that cannot be found in usual "one-block," "single-objective" optimal control problems, some of which constitute the extreme cases of the present formulation. Yet these constraints do result when more realistic, multiple design goals are taken into consideration. Under latter circumstances, the lower bound (3.27) indicates that the performance is in general inversely proportional to the plant bandwidth, while the bound in (3.28) shows that it is proportional to the high frequency rolloff rate of the plant; the faster does the plant gain decrease, the more difficult is to achieve a good performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Illustrative Examples</head><p>We now use a number of examples to illustrate the preceding results.</p><p>Example 1: Consider the plant</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(3.29)</formula><p>Clearly, is minimum phase for . We shall first fix , but vary the value of from to 10. We compute in two different ways, by computing the expression (3.17) and by solving numerically the optimal controller, respectively. For the latter purpose, we use the perturbation method suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and compute the optimal solution using MATLAB -Toolbox. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref> shows that these two computations match rather well. Clearly, while for this plant the nonminimum phase effect dominates, the effect of its minimum phase part is not negligible. That the latter is relatively small can be explained by Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>: the weighted input energy in this case can be kept rather small. The same can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, which plots the optimal performance for different values of . It is clear that when the control effort is more emphasized (as increases), will decrease but always maintain as a nonzero value unless in the limit when and . Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows that for a wide range of values of , the lower bounds (3.27) and (3.28) give tight estimates of .

Note that possesses a pair of anti-resonant zeros   closer to the imaginary axis. Let us also fix and vary from 0.01 to 10; The smaller the value of , the closer the zeros to the origin. The computation results are given in Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref>. It is clear that the plant yields a worse tracking performance, especially when the antiresonant zeros move closer to the origin. Note also that for , the crossover frequencies are 0.378 45 rad/s for and 0.058 48 rad/s for . Thus, the results are in agreement with the assertion that a low plant bandwidth limits the best achievable performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OPTIMAL REGULATION PERFORMANCE</head><p>In this section, we formulate and solve an output regulation problem under finite control effort constraint. We consider the one-parameter regulation scheme described by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>. Throughout this section we take to be the impulse signal <ref type="bibr">(4.1)</ref> where is a constant unitary vector, which may be interpreted as a nonzero initial condition of the system. The problem of interest Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. J for P with respect to a.</p><p>is to regulate the zero-input response to zero, by the design of the compensator . We adopt the integral-square criterion as our performance measure. The best attainable performance then becomes More generally, the output regulation problem may also be considered as one of disturbance attenuation. In the latter setup, the signal is a disturbance signal entering at the plant input, and the design objective is to minimize its response at the output.</p><p>By means of Parseval identity, it is straightforward to find that Hence, in order for to be finite, it is necessary that . For , it necessitates the following assumption. Assumption 3: is strictly proper. This assumption implies that is finite, a necessary condition for the output energy to be finite. We note that such an assumption is not required in the standard energy regulation problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , where the output is unconstrained as long as it reaches zero at the steady state. We shall also assume that is left-invertible. This insures that the plant have at least an equal number of outputs available to regulate the disturbance inputs.</p><p>The performance objective also induces a two-block control problem. Using the Youla parameterization of , we may rewrite <ref type="bibr">(4.2)</ref> for some . This characterization facilitates the derivation of a similar analytical expression for the optimal performance . The following result is obtained for minimum phase plants.  where are the nonminimum phase zeros of and is minimum phase. Then, , and . Assume that is strictly proper. Then (</p><p>where is the smallest nonzero singular value of . Proof: See Appendix C. We defer the discussion of Theorem 3 to the end of this section, while stating first a number of its corollaries. As in the preceding section, it is possible to obtain an exact expression of for SISO systems. The proof for the following corollary is straightforward and, thus, omitted.</p><p>Corollary 6: Let be a scalar transfer function. Under the assumptions in Theorem 3 (4.8) Similarly, we have an analogous result on the related constrained optimization problem Let the optimal cost be denoted by . The question being asked in this problem is "What is the minimum control effort required to achieve a given regulation performance level, for minimum phase unstable SISO plants?" The following closed-form solution of the problem is the dual result to Corollary 3. Its proof is also similar and hence is omitted.</p><p>Corollary 7: Suppose that is a strictly proper scalar transfer function satisfying the assumptions in Theorem 3. Let a positive number be given, where</p><p>where is the unique positive solution of (</p><p>In other words, for any , the minimum control effort for the prescribed regulation performance is</p><p>The next corollary provides bounds on in terms of the plant bandwidth.</p><p>Corollary 8: Let be the crossover frequency for , i.e., Then (4.13) Furthermore, if for some <ref type="bibr">(4.14)</ref> then <ref type="bibr">(4.15)</ref> Proof: The proof is similar to that for Corollary 5. To obtain (4.13), we bound by</p><p>The bound in (4.13) follows at once. Next, with <ref type="bibr">(4.14)</ref>, can be bounded as</p><p>The proof can then be completed by integration by parts, and by noting that on In an analogous fashion, Theorem 3 and its corollaries show that the regulation performance also hinges closely on the plant gain and bandwidth, other than its unstable poles. However, a clear distinction exists between the tracking and the regulation problems. Indeed, unlike in the tracking problem, a large plant gain is seen to be undesirable for regulation. This does not come as a surprise, for a larger plant gain will necessarily amplify more the disturbance, making it more difficult to return the response to zero. Similarly, the lightly damped poles in the plant are now problematic factors. This too is consistent with one's intuition, since such poles tend to cause more unsettling response and thus require more control effort. Finally, Corollary 8 makes it clear that for regulation purpose a high plant bandwidth actually does more harm than benefit. This can be interpreted as the consequence that a system with a higher bandwidth responds at a faster speed, and it is more difficult to settle an "agile" response than a "sluggish" one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. TWO-PARAMETER CONTROL PERFORMANCE</head><p>Thus far our development has been restricted to tracking and regulation using a one-parameter controller, for marginally stable and minimum phase plants respectively. This section studies more general plants which may be both unstable and nonminimum phase. It is known that a two-parameter control structure is superior when tracking or regulation constitutes the sole design objective, specifically in countering the effect of plant unstable poles on tracking, and that of plant nonminimum phase zeros on regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The purpose of this section is to investigate whether it will also improve tracking and regulation performance when control effort is taken into consideration, and whether it may offer any advantage in circumventing the performance constraints imposed by the plant gain.</p><p>In its full generality, a two-parameter tracking system can be implemented as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, where the control input accesses the reference input and the output via two separately designed controllers and , by</p><p>The set of all stabilizing two-parameter compensators is characterized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> (5.1) Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. Two-parameter tracker.</p><p>Via a routine manipulation, it is easy to find that and . Hence, the tracking performance measure can be written as</p><p>The optimal performance becomes This immediately leads to the following result for , a counterpart to Theorem 1. Its proof is analogous to that for Theorem 1 and, hence, is omitted.</p><p>Theorem 4: Let be given by (3.7) and be right-invertible. Suppose that for some integer , such that has no zero at .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Let</head><p>. The regulation performance objective can then be expressed as </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The optimal performance is</head><p>The following result thus becomes clear. We note that it holds for general time-delay plants.</p><p>Theorem 5: Let be given by (4.1). Suppose that has poles , which admit the decomposition (3.5). Assume that is strictly proper. Then <ref type="bibr">(5.4)</ref> where is the smallest nonzero singular value of . Furthermore, if is a scalar transfer function, then</p><p>In summary, while two-parameter controllers do offer an distinctive advantage for tracking and regulation, their effect is limited to only nonminimum phase zeros, time delays, and unstable poles in the two respective problems. Theorems 4 and 5 make it clear that the dependence of the tracking and regulation performance on the plant gain remains unchanged, and so do the constraints due to plant bandwidth, lightly damped poles, and antiresonant zeros. Since two-parameter controllers constitute the most general linear feedback structure, these constraints are thus seen to pose a fundamental barrier to the achievable performance, and are intrinsic of the problems which both attempt to minimize the conflicting design objectives.</p><p>In the final contribution of this paper, we extend the above results to a joint performance objective that addresses reference tracking and energy regulation in the presence of disturbance signals. Thus, consider the two-parameter system given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>. We adopt the performance criterion and study the optimal performance Note that differs from and , due to the presence of and simultaneously. We shall assume that is a square invertible transfer function matrix; this stronger assumption is needed, since to track the reference signal , the plant is required to be right-invertible, while to counter the disturbance signal , it needs to be left-invertible.</p><p>Theorem 6: Let and be given by (3.7) and (4.1), respectively. Let be invertible. Suppose that for some integer , such that has no zero at . Also, suppose that has zeros and poles , which admit the decompositions of (3.3) and (3.5), and define the inner-outer factorization Assume that is strictly proper. Then</p><p>where . Proof: See Appendix D. It is interesting to note that can be both positive and negative. This on one hand shows that, unsurprisingly, the performance objective is more difficult to attain in the presence of an additional source of disturbance. On the other hand, it indicates that the reference direction may be judiciously selected to counter the effect of the disturbance signal ; in this case, is to be made negative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have studied -type optimal tracking and regulation control problems, which attempt to minimize jointly the tracking error and plant input energy, and the output response along with input energy, respectively. These problems constitute an outgrowth of the classical optimal control problems, with a central goal focused on the role of control effort, an issue one invariably has to confront with in practical designs. Our primary objective has been to investigate the impact, if any, of control effort on the best achievable performance, and how such an impact may arise in a fundamental way independent of controller design and control structures. Our work is partly motivated by practical applications found in the control of mechanical systems, and partly driven by our goal in search of fundamental design limitations beyond those known to be imposed by nonminimum phase zeros, unstable poles, and time delays. For this purpose, we have derived analytical solutions to both problems, which describe explicitly how the best achievable performance may depend on the plant nonminimum phase zeros, time delays, unstable poles, and more importantly, on the plant frequency response as a whole. The results enable us to conclude that under finite control energy, the best tracking and regulation performance both depend on the plant gain in the entire frequency range, and as a result both can be significantly affected by the plant bandwidth. Furthermore, the results help clarify the roles of lightly damped poles and anti-resonant zeros, which have been seen to have a direct pertinence on the performance. That these constraints remain to be in effect in use of two-parameter controllers suggests that they result as a consequence of conflict and tradeoff between competing design objectives, while independent of controller design and control structures. In other words, no control structure may be employed to overcome these constraints. In contrast, in more idealistic settings where control effort is of no interest and thus excluded from the performance goal, the constraints vanish and thus find no role in the classical tracking and regulation problems.</p><p>The tracking and regulation problems being considered herein belong to the category of dual objective, two-block optimal control. In a more general setting, they may be viewed as two special instances of optimal disturbance attenuation problems, with disturbance inputs taken as step and impulse signals, respectively. Nevertheless, it is possible to extend the present results to more general disturbance attenuation problems. In the latter context, the input signals may assume more sophisticated forms, and the derivations as well as solutions would become proportionally more complicated. It is also possible to employ such tracking strategies as preview control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and it will be of interest to see whether the plant gain remains to play a significant role.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 1: Using the allpass factorization (3.3), we first obtain It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> that there exists some such that</p></div>
