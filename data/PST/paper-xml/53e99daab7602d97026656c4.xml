<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In many networking scenarios, including the Internet, network users are free to act according to their individual interests, without taking into account overall network performance. Users thus may make selfish decisions (strategy choices) based on the state of the network, which depends (among other factors) on the behavior of other users, resulting in a non-cooperative game. Naturally, these scenarios call for a game-theoretic approach for studying both the behavior of such non-cooperative users, as well as their impact on the network performance. More specifically, we are interested in the properties of Nash equilibrium solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> that are the stable outcomes of a non-cooperative game. We note that there has been a considerable amount of research dealing with non-cooperative games in networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>.</p><p>We consider a multicast game with selfish non-cooperative players. There is a special source node and each player is interested in connecting to the source by making a routing decision that minimizes its payment. Thus, the strategies of the players in the game correspond to the different paths by which the players can connect to the source. Each player independently chooses a strategy minimizing its payment. The mutual influence of the players is determined by a cost sharing mechanism that stipulates how the cost of each edge in the network is shared among its users. Multicast cost sharing methods have been studied extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref>. However, while typical models for non-cooperative games in networks have focused on congestion effects, where a resource utility deteriorates with the number of users that share it, an important class of resource sharing problems occurs when a fixed cost needs to be shared between a set of users. This game was recently introduced by Anshelevich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. In this paper we study a natural cost sharing mechanism that falls into the above framework, where the cost of an edge is split evenly among all the players using it. More precisely, if k players use edge e of cost c e , then each player pays ce/k for this edge. This cost sharing formula has an intuitive appeal and it was investigated in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>; it is also the outcome of the Shapley value <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Further motivation for the multicast game we consider is provided by the facility location problem, which is of fundamental interest in operations research. In a facility location game, we are given a set of facilities, with an opening cost associated with each facility. Additionally, we have a set of clients, and for each client-facility pair, we are given a cost that the client must pay for connecting to the facility. Each client needs to connect to one facility. A natural cost sharing mechanism for facility location is splitting the opening cost of each facility between the clients served by it. Additionally, each client pays for connecting to the facility serving it. Naturally, the clients seek to minimize their total payment, thus defining a non-cooperative game. This game constitutes a special case of the directed multicast game: given an instance of the facility location game, we add a source, connect each facility to the source with an edge of cost equal to the opening cost of the facility, and then connect each client to each facility with a directed edge of cost equal to the corresponding connection cost.</p><p>We consider two different models: an integral model, where each user connects to the source through a single path, and a fractional model, where each user is allowed to split (fractionally) its connection to the source into several paths, i.e., one unit of flow is sent fractionally by the source to the user. The fractional model, in addition to being a relaxation of the integral model, is interesting in its own right, as it is a splittable multicast model. The fractional model is also closely related to improving network throughput via network coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. The games resulting from these models are referred to as the integral multicast game and the fractional multicast game, respectively.</p><p>A crucial property of our multicast game is that the peruser cost share on an edge is non-increasing in the number of users of the edge. Although, in this respect, the game differs from a classic congestion game, the integral multicast game does belong to the well known class of congestion games, that was first defined by Rosenthal <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and has been widely investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. Rosenthal showed that a potential function can be defined for each congestion game with the property that the potential decreases if a player makes a move that improves its selfish cost. This shows that every congestion game has a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, there is a one-to-one correspondence between Nash equilibrium solutions and the solutions defining a local minimum of Rosenthal's potential function. Since the integral multicast game belongs to the class of congestion games, it has a Nash equilibrium and a potential function. We note that, for the integral model, the cost sharing mechanism guarantees that a Nash equilibrium induces a tree. The Nash equilibrium of the multicast game raises several natural questions. We focus in this paper on the inefficiency resulting from the selfish behavior of the players, and on the computational complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium.</p><p>We quantify the inefficiency resulting from a non-cooperative game through the ratio between the cost of a Nash equilibrium multicast tree and the cost of an optimal Steiner tree spanning the players. In keeping with common terminology <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>, this ratio is called the price of anarchy and it quantifies the "penalty" incurred by lack of cooperation (or coordination) between the players in a non-cooperative game. Consider the graph in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> consisting of a source r and a node t with two parallel paths connecting them. The cost of one path is n, while the cost of the other path is 1. There are n players at t who want to connect to the source r. A solution where all players use the expensive path, each paying one unit, is a Nash equilibrium with a cost of n. A different and much cheaper Nash equilibrium is the one in which the players use the path of cost 1. Note that this second equilibrium is also the minimum cost Steiner tree connecting the players to the source. Thus, the price of anarchy for this game can be very large. Notice however that the expensive solution cannot be reached if the players join an initially empty game one-by-one, each of them choosing the cheapest path to connect to the source. In this paper, we investigate the price of anarchy of the integral multicast game for such scenarios. Motivated by the existence of large-cost Nash equilibria, the notion of price of stability was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>: it is defined as the ratio between the cost of a Nash equilibrium of minimum cost and the cost of an optimal Steiner tree. In the above example, the price of stability is 1 in contrast to the price of anarchy which is n. For directed graphs, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> that the price of stability is Θ(log n); for undirected graphs, an upper bound of O(log n) on the price of stability is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, however, no non-trivial lower bounds are known.</p><p>Even if the price of stability in undirected graphs is small, we still have two important questions to answer. Can a Nash equilibrium achieving (or approximating) the price of stability be computed in polynomial time? Second, can a good equilibrium be achieved as a consequence of best-response dynamics? That is, a course of the game where each player, in its turn, makes a routing decision that minimizes its cost. The price of anarchy of such a solution strongly depends on the initial configuration from which the players start. For example, if the starting solution is a Nash equilibrium with a large price of anarchy, as in the example in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, then best-response dynamics would not alter the solution. It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> that even in directed graphs, if the initial configuration is a Steiner tree of cost C, then the best-response dynamics would lead to a Nash equilibrium of cost at most O(C log n). This is shown using Rosenthal's potential function, which can only decrease with each best-response move. This is also a constructive proof that the price of stability is O(log n). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, the above argument is used to suggest a mechanism in which a central authority starts the process by first computing a near-optimal Steiner tree on the receivers, and then allows the users to follow their best-response dynamics.</p><p>In this paper we take an approach that does not rely on a central trusted authority starting the game in a specific starting configuration. There are several situations in which having such an authority is expensive or infeasible. Further, not all the players might be available at the same time. In an online setting, players might arrive one by one to join a multicast service from the source. Motivated by these issues, we explore in this paper the following setting. Players first join the game sequentially starting from an "empty" configuration. Upon arrival, each player picks a path selfishly. Once reaching the solution constructed by the players joining one by one, the natural game course induced by best-response dynamics continues until a Nash equilibrium is reached. Our model is inspired by the round model considered by Mirrokhni and Vetta <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> to analyze convergence issues in competitive games. The one round question is the following. What is the quality of the solution to the game after each player has made one selfish move, assuming that the starting solution is the empty one? We believe that this gives insight into the realistic scenario where players typically do not make multiple moves. A positive result in this model is a good indication that the price of anarchy will be reasonable in practice. Note that we assume that the arrival of the players is adversarial.</p><p>Our Results: We focus on undirected graphs. For the integral multicast game, we establish an upper bound of O( √ n log 2 n) on the price of anarchy of the best-response dynamics in the setting where the players join the game sequentially starting from an "empty" configuration. We then present a lower bound of Ω( log n log log n ) on the price of anarchy of this game. It is an interesting open question whether a polylogarithmic upper bound can be shown in this setting. We also prove that the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium minimizing Rosenthal's <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> potential function is NP-hard. It remains an open question whether a Nash equilibrium of the integral multicast game can be computed in polynomial time. We note that Fabrikant et al. <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> investigated the complexity of computing a pure Nash equilibrium for the class of congestion games, where the cost of a facility is a non-decreasing function of the number of its users, and showed that it is PLS-complete for general network congestion games. However, their proof heavily depends on the non-decreasing property of the cost sharing mechanism, and therefore does not seem to hold in our model.</p><p>For the fractional multicast game, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium by extending Rosenthal's potential function. Our main result for this model is that a Nash equilibrium that minimizes the potential function can be computed in polynomial time using linear programming. We observe that the fractional Nash equilibrium minimizing the potential function has a price of anarchy of O(log n). The results obtained for the fractional model hold also for more general settings, where the cost sharing mechanisms are cross monotone, which intuitively means that the share of a player on an edge cannot increase when additional players use it. Furthermore, the results also hold in the setting where there are multiple sources and each player needs to connect to at least one source. We note that the fact that our cost sharing mechanism is non-increasing in the number of players using an edge allows us to define a fractional extension. This does not seem possible with a non-decreasing cost sharing mechanism.</p><p>Finally, we consider a weighted extension of the multicast game, where each player has a weight, and the cost sharing mechanism splits the cost of an edge among its downstream receivers proportionally to their weights. For this game we prove that a Nash equilibrium exists in the fractional model. Initial results for the integral weighted game were obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. However, establishing whether a Nash equilibrium for weighted multicast games exists in the integral model remains an open problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE MODEL</head><p>We model our network by an undirected graph G = (V, E). Let c : E → R + be a non-negative edge-cost function, and we denote by c e the cost of edge e ∈ E. There is a special vertex r ∈ V called root (or source) and a subset of n vertices N = {t1, t2, . . . , tn} representing multicast users (also called players or terminals).</p><p>In the integral model, the goal of each user is to choose a single path P connecting it to the root, while minimizing its payment, which consists of the sum of the payments for the edges along P . A course of action chosen by player i at any time is called its strategy and is denoted by s i . In the integral model, a strategy of player i is a path connecting ti to the root. The strategy space of player i (i.e., the set of all its possible strategies) is denoted by S i , and in our integral game, and it is the set of all the possible paths between t i and the root. At any given moment, a strategy profile (or a configuration) of the game is the vector of all the strategies of the players, s = (s 1 , . . . , s n ). We use s -i to denote vector s without its ith coordinate, and (s -i , si ) to denote the strategy profile identical to s, except that the ith coordinate is replaced by si . Given a strategy profile s, c i (s) ≡ c(s i ) denotes the payment of player i (the cost of its path s i ), and ne(s) denotes the number of players using edge e. Payment of user i for edge e is denoted by c i e (s) and is determined by the cost sharing mechanism. We consider a natural cost sharing mechanism, where the cost of every edge is split evenly between the players sharing it. Thus, the payment of player i for edge e is c i e (s) = c e ne(s) . We denote by c(s) the sum of the costs of the edges participating in s (we say that edge e participates in a strategy profile s, iff at least one player chooses a path containing s to connect to the source). Let H(k) denote the Harmonic number k j=1 1 j . A strategy profile s ∈ S is at Nash equilibrium if no player has an incentive to change its routing strategy, assuming that the strategies of the other players are fixed. We assume that a player changes its routing choice if and only if it reduces its payment. A change of strategy by any player is called a Nash defection and the corresponding player is called Nash defector. We assume that at each step the acting player chooses a strategy that minimizes the cost of its path, given the strategies of the other players. We therefore say that at each step the strategy of the current player is a best response to the other players' strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">THE INTEGRAL MULTICAST GAME</head><p>As we mentione earlier, the integral multicast game is a special case of a congestion game, formulated by Rosenthal <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, who defined a potential function to show that every congestion game possesses a Nash equilibrium. For our multicast game, given a strategy profile s, the potential function Φ of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Φ(s) = e n e (s) k=1 ce k .</formula><p>It is easy to see that for every instance of our game, a Nash equilibrium solution is a tree rooted at r spanning N .</p><p>We now analyze the price of anarchy of a multicast game in an undirected graph. We are interested in a Nash equilibrium that is a consequence of best-response dynamics, where each Nash defector, in its turn, chooses a path to the source minimizing its payment. Initially, the players join the game one by one starting from an "empty" configuration and picking a path to the root that minimizes their payment. Once all players are connected to the root, they continue playing until reaching Nash equilibrium. Note that we assume that the order by which the players play is adversarial. In Section 3.1 we establish an upper bound of O( √ n log 2 n) on the price of anarchy for this game course, and in Section 3.2 we prove a lower bound of Ω( log n log log n ) on the price of anarchy. We also prove that finding a Nash equilibrium minimizing Rosenthal's <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> potential function is NP-hard in Section 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Upper Bound</head><p>In this section we establish an upper bound of O(</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">√ n log 2 n)</formula><p>on the price of anarchy of a Nash equilibrium obtained from best-response dynamics. Our analysis is performed in two steps. We first analyze in Section 3.1.1 the first round of the game in which the players connect one-by-one to the root via a cheapest path (best response). The first round finishes when all players are connected to the root. In order to bound the price of anarchy of the strategy profile T obtained from the first round, we define the notion of a level tree that serves as a basis of reference for proving the upper bound.</p><p>A greedy online Steiner tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> is defined to be the tree obtained when terminals arrive online and connect one by one via a cheapest path (i.e, the ith terminal connects by a cheapest path to the tree induced by terminals 1, . . . , i -1). The cost of the greedy online Steiner tree is known to be at most a factor of O(log n) away from the cost of an optimal Steiner tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. We consider the greedy online Steiner tree obtained from the same sequence of arrivals as in the first round of the game. Our goal is to prove that the cost of the solution obtained by the selfish moves of the players is related to the cost of the online Steiner tree. We are, however, unable to show this directly. We overcome this difficulty by first transforming the online Steiner tree to a level tree with reduced height using a procedure of Zelikovsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. The height reduction increases the cost, but maintains ancestor relationships that are critical to maintain the online nature of the problem. We prove that the cost of the solution obtained from the first round is at most O( √ n log n) times the cost of an optimal Steiner tree. We complete our analysis in Section 3.1.2. Given the solution obtained from the first round, we then follow the natural game course until a Nash equilibrium is reached. The Nash defections performed until reaching an equilibrium can only decrease the potential of the first round solution, and thus we lose at most another factor of O(log n) with respect to the cost of the solution obtained from the first round.</p><p>We paraphrase below the height reduction lemma of Ze-likovsky that we need. A bound claimed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> proved to be incorrect and a weaker correct bound is established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. lemma 3.1. Let T = (V, A) be an in-tree rooted at r ∈ V and let c : A → R + be a non-negative cost function on A. Let G = (V, A G ) be the transitive closure of T and let c :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A G → R + be such that c (u, v) is the shortest c-path from u to v in T .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">The First Round</head><p>We begin by analyzing the first round of the game in which players arrive one by one and pick a path selfishly. Let the sequence of arrivals of the terminals be t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t n (renumber if necessary), and let T be the resulting solution. We assume that the players start from an empty configuration.</p><p>Definition 1. A level tree T on the vertex set {r(= t 0 ), t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t n }, with a cost function d : E → R, is defined to be a tree having the following properties for each terminal ti.

(ii) Let t and t i be two terminals in T , such that t is the parent of t i . The cost of the edge (t i , t) in T , denoted by d(i), is no less than the cost of the cheapest path between ti and t in G.</p></div>

We use c + e (i) to denote ce/(ne(i)+1) which is the cost per player for using edge e if an additional player were to use e in T (i). We define c + (i) to be e∈P i c + e (i).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Completing the Analysis</head><p>We first generate the level tree T . Note that the greedy online Steiner tree obtained from the sequence of arrivals of the first round of the game has all the properties required by a level tree. The difficulty is that the height of the greedy online Steiner tree can be Ω(n). We generate a new level tree T from the greedy online Steiner tree by applying Lemma 3.1. The transformation preserves ancestral relationship and thus T remains a level tree, while allowing us to restrict the height of the tree to be h at the expense of increasing its cost by a factor of h • n 1/h . By choosing h = 2, we get a two level tree T and cost at most 2 √ n times the cost of the greedy online Steiner tree. As the cost of a greedy online Steiner tree is within a factor of O(log n) away from the cost of an optimal Steiner tree, we get that</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">c(T ) = O( √ n log n) • c(T * )</formula><p>, where T * is an optimal Steiner tree.

Therefore, the potential function value of T is within at most a factor of O(log n) away from c(T ). The potential function value can only decrease throughout the game. As the value of the potential function of a solution is always an upper bound on the cost of the edges participating in the solution, we get that the price of anarchy of our game is O( √ n log 2 n).</p></div>

For the sake of simplicity, we first show how to achieve a lower bound of 2-on the price of anarchy. The example is then generalized to show Ω( log n log log n ) price of anarchy.</p><p>Let q be a large integer. We start from a root vertex r and additional vertex u 1 connected to the root by a unit-length edge. We now add another unit-length path from the root to a new vertex u2. The edges and the vertices of this path are as follows. Apart from r and u2, there are log q vertices v 1 , . . . , v log q that are placed between r and u 2 in this order, with vertex v 1 adjacent to r. The distance between v 1 and r is 1 2 , and for every i &gt; 1, the distance between v i and v i-1 is 2 -i , thus the distance between v log q and u 2 is less than 1 q . Finally, there is an edge of length 1 q between u 1 and u 2 . The idea is as follows. The first q players joining the game are placed on vertex u1. They connect to r via the unit-length edge (r, u1) and pay 1 q each. In the next step we place q players on vertex v 1 . Naturally, they prefer to connect to r via edge (v 1 , r) whose cost is 1  2 , instead of connecting via u 2 and u 1 . Now the cost of the edge (v 1 , r) becomes 1 2q . When we place the next q players on vertex v 2 , they connect via (v 2 , v 1 , r), as the cost of this path is less than 1  4 + 1 2q while connecting via u2 and u1 costs more than 1  4 + 1 q . We continue in the same way, placing q users on vertices v 3 , . . . , v log q , where the users placed on vertex vi all connect via path (vi, vi-1, . . . , v1, r). Finally, we place q players on vertex u2, who also prefer to connect via path (u 2 , r), as its cost is less than 1 q . It is easy to see that this configuration is a Nash equilibrium.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2. Suppose we have an edge (a, b) of length c.</head><p>A log-division of this edge is performed by converting this edge into a path a, v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v log q , b of the same length. The length of the edge (a, v1) is c 2 , and for each i &gt; 1, the length of edge vi, vi-1 is c 2 i . Thus, the length of edge (v log q , b) is less than c q .</p><p>A building block of our construction is a path p defined below. We use = Ω( log q log log q ) copies of p. The construction of path p is as follows. We start from an edge (v, u) of length 1. Vertex u is called a level-1 vertex. We now perform iterations. In each iteration, we perform a log-division of every edge e = (w, w ) on path (v, u). When doing this division, the endpoint of e that is closer to v on the path (say, w) serves as a and the other endpoint (w ) serves as b.</p><p>For each iteration i, we call the vertices added to the path in this iteration "level i vertices". In our construction, we use copies of path p, denoted by p1, p2, . . . , p . The endpoints v of these paths are merged together and form the root r. The other endpoints of the paths are denoted by u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u . Finally, for each i, 1 ≤ i &lt; , we connect each of the level-1, 2, . . . , i vertices on path pi to the corresponding vertex on path p by an edge of length 1 q . The players are added to the game as follows. First we add q players on vertex u 1 . They connect via path p 1 to the root. Then, we add players on paths p 2 , . . . , p in this order. For i &gt; 1, we add players on all the vertices of levels 1, 2, . . . , i belonging to path p i , as well as on vertex u i , in the order by which the vertices appear on the path starting from the root. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>.1.2(b) for the resulting instance.</p><p>Similarly to the case of two paths, for each i, all the players on path p i connect via the subpath of p i leading to r. Thus, the cost of the Nash equilibrium is . In the optimal solution, all players are connected via path p . In order to connect some player belonging to path pi, i = , we use the edge of length 1 q connecting this player to path p . Note that the total number of players M is bounded by 2qk, where k is the number of vertices on path p . Clearly, k ≤ (log q) . Fixing = log q log log q , we get k ≤ q. The total cost of the optimal solution is less than 1 + k q ≤ 2 and the price of anarchy is therefore Ω( ) = Ω( log q log log q ). As M ≤ 2qk ≤ 2q 2 , the price of anarchy is Ω( ) = Ω( log M log log M ).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">THE FRACTIONAL MULTICAST GAME</head><p>In this section we introduce a fractional model of the multicast game, where each user is allowed to split (fractionally) its connection to the source into several paths. The fractional model represents a splittable multicast model. The cost of each flow fraction on an edge is evenly split between its users. We present our results for undirected graphs, yet they hold for directed graphs as well. In the fractional model, each user i has to route one unit of flow from ti to the source r. User i can split its unit of flow among any number of paths connecting r to t i . Denote the flow of user i on edge e by f e,i and the number of users on edge e by ne. Given a strategy profile s, assume without loss of generality that fe,1 ≤ fe,2 ≤ • • • ≤ fe,n e ≤ 1. Define fe,0 = 0. Edge e has capacity equal to f e,n e , and for convenience we think of the capacity of e as defining an "address space" in the range [0, f e,n e ], where user j uses [0, f e,j ]. The cost of each fraction of the capacity of e is equally split between its users, as follows: [fe,j-1, fe,j] is shared by ne -j + 1 users, where each user pays c e f e,j -f e,j-1 ne-j+1 . Therefore, the total cost c i e paid by user i for the use of edge e is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">c i e = ce • i k=1 f e,k -f e,k-1 ne -k + 1 .</formula><p>As the total flow fraction sent on edge e is f e,ne , the total cost of the edge is simply c e • f e,ne . We denote by P i the set of paths used by user i. The cost of a path p ∈ P i is the sum of its edge costs, that is e∈p c i e . The total cost c i of a user i is the sum of its path costs, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">p∈P i e∈p c i e .</formula><p>Each user i aims to establish its flow from the source r to ti so as to minimize its cost. Thus, a flow f is at Nash equilibrium if no user has any incentive of changing its flow to the root. An instance of the fractional model, consisting of a graph G, a source r, a set of receivers N , and a cost vector c is denoted by f rac(G, r, N, c). We introduce a potential function Φ for the fractional multicast game which is based on Rosenthal's potential function <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Φ = e∈s n e (s)</formula><p>j=1 n e +1-j i=1 c e f e,j -f e,j-1 i .</p><p>The proof of the following theorem follows from the proof of the potential function defined by Rosenthal <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 3.

Note that different paths can use an edge in opposite directions.</p><p>We formulate a linear program with an objective function equal to the potential of the fractional multicast game. The variables of the linear program are the flows of the users sent on the set of paths in G from the terminals t 1 , . . . , t n to the root r, and the capacities of the edges in E . Denote a path from t i to r by t i r. The capacity of edge e j is denoted by x e j , where 0 ≤ x e j ≤ 1. The linear program is as follows.

Constraint (2), the non-aggregating flow constraint, restricts the flow of each user i on edge ej to be at most its capacity xe j . The total flow, taken over all commodities on edge e j , is constrained to be precisely j • x e j , as restricted by Constraint (3), the aggregating flow constraint. This constraint is satisfied in the integral case: if j commodities are sent on edge e, then edge e j is "bought", and the number of users on this edge is j. The sum of the costs of the commodities on e j is then exactly c e .</p><p>Note that the above linear program uses an exponential number of variables. However, it can be solved in polynomial time via the dual program using the Ellipsoid algorithm. Alternatively, it can be formulated with a polynomial number of variables by using the flows of the users on the different edges in G as variables.</p></div>

Furthermore, it can also be used for settings where the users are not restricted to have a common source. Recall that finding an integral solution with minimum potential is NPhard.</p><p>There are instances for which there is a gap between the minimum potential fractional Nash equilibrium and the minimum potential integral Nash equilibrium. Consider Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, which depicts an instance (G, r, {t1, t2, t3}, c), for which the minimum potential fractional Nash equilibrium is smaller than the minimum potential integral Nash equilibrium. The edge costs are as follows: the cost of each edge (r, v i ) (i = 1, 2, 3) is x, and the cost of each edge from v i to the terminals connected to it is q</p><p>x. The fractional Nash equilibrium that minimizes the potential is as follows: each terminal ti sends 1/2 unit of flow through each of the two vertices v j (j = 1, 2, 3) connecting it to r. Therefore, the fractional potential is Φ f rac = 3x/2(1 + 1/2) + 6q/2 = 9x/4 + 3q. On the other hand, the integral Nash equilibrium that minimizes the potential is as follows: two out of the three terminals send their flow through the same vertex v i to r, and the third terminal sends its flow through one out of the other two vertices vj connecting it to r. Therefore, the integral potential is Φint = x(1 + 1/2) + x + 3q = 10x/4 + 3q. We define the price of anarchy the fractional game as the ratio between the cost of a Nash equilibrium solution and the cost of an optimal fractional solution to the Steiner tree problem. Similarly to the integral game, it can be shown that the price of anarchy of a minimum potential function Nash equilibrium is O(log n).</p></div>

Consider two canonical flows f and f , and assume that their respective flows on e k are x k and x k . That is, x k (resp., x k ) is the amount of flow routed by each player using e k according to f (resp., f ). We denote by G k and G k the sets of players that use e k according to f and f respectively, where|G k | = |G k | = k. Assume, w.l.o.g., that x k ≥ x k .By merging these two flows into a single canonical flow, we "buy" capacity x k on copy |G k ∪ G k | of edge e, capacity (x k -x k ) on e k , and capacity x k on copy |G k ∩ G k | of edge e. We thus get a new canonical flow with potential</figDesc></figure>
