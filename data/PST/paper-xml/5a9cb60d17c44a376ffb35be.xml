<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Map matching is an important technique that matches user trajectories to the real road networks on a digital map. It is crucial and has been more and more widely used in various fields, such as route plan, traffic forecast, location-based services and so on. However, most existing algorithms are less effective when applied to low-samplingrate trajectories. In this paper, we propose MSTM, a novel approach that can effectively match the low-sampling-rate trajectory to road networks. In MSTM, we first partition the trajectories into trajectory segments according to the stay points. Then we construct a map-searching tree by conditional extend and prune operations, which contains all the candidate paths. Finally, by considering the spatial and temporal information of trajectories, we evaluate each branch path in the map-searching tree and choose the one with the highest score as the result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared with two classic approaches, MSTM outperforms ST-Matching and IVMM in terms of matching accuracy as well as efficiency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation</head><p>With the development of wireless communication techniques and GPS-enabled devices, a large amount of trajectory data are generated by moving objects and the data are applied to several services, such as route plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, hot route discover <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and even social relationship infer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, due to the limitations caused by the equipment accuracy and the environment, there are a certain number of inevitable errors among trajectories. What's more, the trajectory data is not intuitive and difficult to be directly used in data analysis. Map matching is an important standardization technique for trajectory data analysis.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the matching technique on low-sampling-rate trajectory data. In practice, trajectories generated by moving objects in low-sampling-rate are common in daily datasets. For instance, cars with GPSenabled sensors report their locations to a data center in a long interval with the concern of energy cost. Another example is that mobile applications collect the user's GPS locations when the application is activated, these type of trajectories are more sparse because few applications are allowed to run uninterruptedly. Therefore, map matching on low-sampling-rate data is more challenging, and it is difficult to discovery the correct moving paths from complex road networks.</p><p>Most existing algorithms are based on high-samplingrate trajectories and can achieve good performance. In recent years, there are some researchers pay close attention to map matching techniques on low-samplingrate trajectories. ST-Matching algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is the first one solving the problem about low-sampling-rate map matching. IVMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> improved ST-Matching algorithm by adding weighted influence model and interactive voting. HRIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and feature-based-map-matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> concerned on the history features and action features of trajectories respectively. However, most algorithms tend to choose the shortest paths as the candidate result on low-sampling-rate trajectories, while the real moving paths do not always follow the shortest paths as time interval increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Related Work</head><p>There are a tremendous amount of researches about map matching approaches. We classify these approaches into two categories: methods for high-sampling-rate trajectories and methods for low-sampling-rate trajectories.</p><p>Map matching algorithms for high-sampling-rate trajectories have been relatively mature through studies for decades. Geometric algorithms pay close attention to the shape of individual links in a road network or the patterns connected by whole or part of trajectories. E.g., matching a point to the nearest road <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Topological map matching methods concentrate on the connectivity of a road network. There are two kinds of representative algorithms: one uses the Fr?chet distance to measure the similarity between trajectories and road sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, another considers incremental model which means measuring a point and judging the consecutive points at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Map matching algorithms for low-sampling-rate trajectories are less than the previous categories. There are some matching algorithms based on hidden Markov model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A trajectory is recognized as a Markov chain, in which the observation state is the point sequence and the hidden state is the road segments to be matched. Besides, some methods rely on the outer information, such as the data from mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the author combines the spatial structures of the road network and the temporal/speed constraints of the trajectories. It improves the accuracy of map matching for trajectories with time interval no less than 2 minutes. Then, paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> improves ST-Matching algorithm by considering the weight of different points. After that, more algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> try to solve the problem of low-sampling-rate trajectories matching by incorporating different factors. History information is referred to in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> takes human factors into consideration to estimate the missing movement details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Novelty and Contributions</head><p>In this paper, we propose MSTM, a novel map matching algorithm for low-sampling-rate trajectories. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>? We propose a novel map-searching tree (MS-Tree) structure to maintain all the candidate paths. We define two operations extend and prune to control the generation of MS-Tree. ? Considering both the temporal and the spatial features of trajectories, we define a measure method to infer the optimal path from all the possible branch paths in MS-Tree. ? We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of M-STM on real datasets. The results show that MSTM improves the accuracy and performance obviously, compared with ST-Matching and IVMM. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the preliminary concepts and gives an overview of the proposed approach. Then we detail MSTM algorithm in Section III and Section IV. Section V mainly reports the experimental observations. Finally we draw a conclusion in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW</head><p>In this section, we present some preliminary concepts and give an overview of the proposed approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Preliminary Concepts</head><p>Firstly, we give some preliminary concepts which are necessary for explaining the approach and describing the problem of map matching on low-sampling-rate trajectories.</p><p>Definition 1 (Trajectory): A trajectory T is a sequence of location points in chronological order, which describe the route when object moves. It is denoted as T={p 1 , p 2 , ? ? ? , p n }, where each p i contains a geo-coordinate p i .lat, p i .lon and a time stamp p i .time.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on low-sampling-rate trajectories that the time interval between consecutive points is bigger than 2 minutes. Definition 2 (Road Segment): A road segment e represents a directed edge on the road which includes a start point e.start, an end point e.end, a flag e.type representing the road type (e.g., cycleway, secondary, residential, etc.) and a speed limit e.maxspeed that can't exceed.</p><p>Definition 3 (Road Network): A road network is a directed graph G(V, E), where V is a set of vertices composed of start points and end points of the road segments, and E is a set of edges representing the road segments.</p><p>Definition 4 (Path): A path P is a directed route composed of a sequence of connected road segments. It is denoted as P:e 1 ?e 2 ? ? ? ? ?e n , where e i .end = e i+1 .start and 1?i&lt;n.</p><p>Problem Definition: Given a low-sampling-rate trajectory T and a road network G(V, E), we aim to find the path P from G that matches the real path of T well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Proposed Approach</head><p>There are three major modules in MSTM: Trajectory Pre-processing, Trajectory Partition and Map Matching.</p><p>(1) Trajectory Pre-processing: Usually, there are a certain number of inevitable errors in raw trajectories caused by the data collection equipment's failure or transmission error. In this module, we traverse the input trajectory and discard the abnormal points. I.e, the ones that the longitude and latitude become zero suddenly, and the positions change sharply that exceeds a given moving speed threshold.</p><p>(2) Trajectory Partition: A trajectory of one user which lasts hours to days may contain several stay points. Usually, in map matching, we mainly consider the moving activities. In this module, we separate the input trajectory into several trajectory segments based on the stay points. Then we can discover the user's moving path one trajectory segment by one.</p><p>(3) Map Matching: Given trajectory segments processed by the above modules, we infer the moving paths which matches the real paths best by two steps: a) MS-Tree generation. We define two operations to generate the MS-tree which maintain all the possible paths. b) Path discovery. Given all possible paths in MS-Tree, we choose the appropriate one as the result by calculating each candidate paths' score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. TRAJECTORY PARTITION</head><p>Usually, a trajectory T contains more than one segment which contains a definite source and destination. If someone stays in an area over a relatively long time, this area usually may be a destination of this movement and certainly the source of the next movement. For example, if one leaves home and goes to the company in the morning, and he leaves the company and go home directly in the afternoon, then the trajectory contains two segments that one is form home to company and the other one from company to home. This phenomenon can be illustrated by the conception of stay point proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Usually, a stay point s is determined by two parameters: a time threshold time and a distance threshold dist . If a given trajectory segment T'={p m , p m+1 , ? ? ? , p n } satisfies the conditions that m&lt;i&lt;n, dist(p m , p n )? dist and p n .time-p m .time? time , then the segment T' can be considered as a stay point s. The function dist() is to calculate the spatial distance of the two locations. The stay point s contains four attributes which are denoted as latitude, longitude, startTime and endTime, where s.latitude and s.longtitude is the center location of all the points in the segments, s.startTime and s.endTime is the time stamp of the first point and the last point respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s.latitude = n i=m p i .lat/(n -m + 1)<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">s.longitude = n i=m p i .lon/(n -m + 1)<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">s.startTime = p m .time (3) s.endTime = p n .time<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Usually, we don't have to pay more attention to the stay points which are easy for map matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Therefore, we partition the trajectories into several effective sub-trajectories by stay points. If a trajectory is divided into two sub-trajectories by a stay point s, then we add a point p' with the value (s.latitude, s.longitude, s.startTime) to the end of the first sub-trajectory and add a point p" with the value (s.latitude, s.longitude, s.endTime) to the beginning of the second sub-trajectory. As the example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the trajectory segment T' = {p 3 ,p 4 ,p 5 ,p 6 } can be seen as a stay point. Then, the trajectory can be separated into two trajectories T 1 ={p 1 , p 2 , p'} and T 2 ={p", p 7 , p 8 }.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MAP MATCHING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. MS-Tree generation</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, if there are eight points (i.e. from p 1 to p 8 ) in the trajectory, it's easy to recover the real path: e 1 ?e 2 ?e 3 ?e 4 ?e 5 ?e 6 ?e 7 . But if the trajectory is too sparse that just contains two points p 1 and p 8 , more traditional algorithms tend to choose e 8 as the result because e 8 is the only shortest path between p 1 and p 8 .</p><p>In this section, we build and maintain all the possible paths in a MS-Tree. Meanwhile, we prune the paths with low probability conditionally. Finally, for all the possible paths in MS-Tree we choose the one with the highest measure score as the result. There are two important operations extend and prune in generating the MS-Tree. 1) Extend: Given a partitioned trajectory T ={p 1 , p 2 , ... , p n }. The MS-Tree begins with a null root node, then for each neighboring points in T, we add child nodes to MS-Tree by the following way. Taking p i and p i+1 as an example.</p><p>Firstly, we find all the candidate road segments of p i . Definition 5 (Candidate Road Segment): A candidate road segment of p is a road segment e in which the shortest distance from p to e doesn't exceed a distance threshold r.</p><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, e 1 , e 2 and e 3 are candidate road segments of p, while e 4 is not.</p><p>Secondly, each candidate road segment of p i can be insert into MS-Tree as a child node of the previous one when it matches the follow conditions.</p><p>? Condition 1: The deviation ratio of the branch path P that traverses from the root of MS-Tree to the candidate road segment is smaller than a threshold conv. Definition 6 (Deviation Ratio): Given a destination point p and a moving path P, deviation ratio is the maximal consecutive road segment number which satisfy that dist(e.start, p)&lt;dist(e.end, p), where e is a road segment of P.</p><p>For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, given the point p 7 and the path e 1 ? e 2 ? e 3 ? e 4 ? e 5 ? e 6 , the deviation ratio is 2 (e 1 and e 2 ). The first condition discards the path that always tends to keep away from p i+1 , which is likely to extend to the wrong direction.</p><p>? Condition 2: The time cost of moving from the prior road segment to the candidate road segment is less than the actual time cost that moves from p i-1 to p i . It's denoted as e i .tcost&lt;?(p i .time-p i-1 .time), where e i .tcost = length(e i )/e i .maxspeed + e i-1 .tcost and e i-1 is the prior road segment. Obviously, by using the max speed, e i .tcost is the shortest time in theory. But usually, the object may not finish the entire road segment, e i .tcost is much bigger than what it should be. Therefore we define a parameter ? to adjust it. If the theoretical shortest time is even more than ? times of the real time cost, then we should discard the road segment.</p><p>Finally, by choosing each adjoining road segments of the newly inserted road segment as candidate road segment, we continue to extend the MS-tree using the above-mentioned conditions recursively until we reach to p i+1 . More intuitively, an running example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> will be illustrated in the following paragraph.</p><p>2) Prune: If the extension fails, we can prune this node and remove its parent recursively until we reach the node which has another child. Meanwhile, the conditions of the extend operation is loose, there may be inevitably loops in MS-Tree. We should not prune all the branches which include loops except the one known as retracing, which is uncommon in a partitioned trajectory that with one definite source and one definite destination.</p><p>Given a branch path P =e 1 ?e 2 ? ? ? ? ?e m in MS-Tree. If there is sub-branches P'=e i ?e i+1 ? ? ? ? ?e j and P"=e j ?e j-1 ? ? ? ? ?e i , where P' ? P, P" ? P, and P" is the reversed moving sequence of P'. We should prune the branch. In this paper, we set the minimal number of road segments in P' and P" to 2.</p><p>An running example: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> shows a simple road map between p i and p i+1 . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref> shows the progress of generating MS-Tree. The first layer in the MS-Tree includes two candidate road segments of p i . Since e 4 reach to p i+1 , we do not have to extend it. Then we extend e 1 until we reach to p i+1 . We can find that in the fourth layer, the branch e 2 ? e 1 ? e 1 ? e 2 is retracing, which obviously meets the condition of pruning. Besides, the node e 1 in the fourth layer will fail to extend because of the time cost constraints. Recursively, the node e 1 in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Path Recovery</head><p>As mention above, for a given trajectory T, there are several possible branch paths in MS-Tree. For brevity, each branch path is described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P i ={root?e 1 ?e 2 ? ? ? ? ? e n }</formula><p>, where e i is a node in the branch which represents a road segment. In this paper, we define two measure factor G(P i ) and S(P i ) that cover the spatial dimension and the temporal dimension respectively. We will calculate the score of every branch based on these two measure factors and choose the branch with the highest score as the final result.</p><p>Firstly, for each points p k in T and its candidate road segment e p k , we define a gaussian distribution function to measure the geographical deviation for the selected road. The formula is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">g(e p k ) = 1 ? 2?? e (d(ep k ,p k )-?) 2 2? 2<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where e p k ? P i , d(e p k , p k ) is the shortest distance between the road e p k and the point p k , ? is the average value and ? is the standard deviation value. ? and ? are set to 0 and 20 meters respectively in this paper. Next, we define a adjust coefficient f that describe the contribution of spatial dimension when choosing the road. f is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f (p k , p k+1 ) = 1 N(p k , p k+1 ) ? 2 1 e 2-N(p k ,p k+1 ) N(p k , p k+1 ) &gt; 2<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where N(p k , p k+1 ) is the number of road segments in P i that matches from the point p k to p k+1 . As we will see later, when N(p k , p k+1 ) is bigger than 2, the closer the value N(p k , p k+1 ) to 2, the small the value of temporal dimension factor is. So, the spatial dimension should take more contribution to avoid the tendency to complex paths. Then, we give the calculation formula of G(P i ) by combining every g with parameter f .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G(P</head><formula xml:id="formula_6">i ) = n-1 k=1 g(e p k ) ? g(e p k+1 ) ? f (p k ? p k+1 ) (7)</formula><p>where n is the total number points in the trajectory T .</p><p>Secondly, we discuss the temporal dimension measure factor S(P i ). Usually, when object moves, it tend to be close to the max speed limit of the road <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Therefore, we calculate the deviation between the average moving speed and the limit speed. Considering the waiting time spent at the road intersections, we define the time factor S(P i ) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S(P i ) = n-1 k=1 (T (p k , p k+1 ) -?t) ? (p k+1 .time -p k .time) n-1 k=1 (T (p k ,p k+1 )-?t) 2 n-1 k=1 (p k+1 .time-p k .time) 2 (8)</formula><p>where n is the total number points in the trajectory T , ?t is the average waiting time at the road intersections and it is set to 20 seconds according to the statistical results, T(p k , p k+1 ) represents the time cost between the candidate road segment of p k (denoted as e p k ) and the candidate road segment of p k+1 (denoted as e p k+1 ). The calculation is defined as: T(p k , p k+1 ) = e p k+1 .tcoste p k .tcost, and the value of e.tcost has been defined and calculated in the extend operation. Now, we can calculate the score of the path P i that matches to the trajectory T.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">M (P i ) = G(P i ) ? S(P i )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Finally, we choose the path with the max value of M(P i ) as the best matching path. P mstm = arg max</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P i ? P M (P i ) (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where P is the set that contains all the possible branch paths in the MS-Tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTS</head><p>In this section, we conduct extensive evaluations on public datasets to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach MSTM, compared with two algorithms ST-Matching and IVMM. We first describe the data set and parameter settings, then we define our evaluation approaches, and finally we present our experimental results. All algorithms in our system are implemented in Java and run on a universal rack server with 2 Intel E5-2620 CPU (2.4 GHz) and 64GB memory.  ? T-Drive: This dataset contains the GPS trajectories of 10,357 taxis during the period of Feb. 2 to Feb. 8, 2008 within Beijing. We choose 60 trajectories from GeoLife and T-Drive respectively, which remain about 50 points after resampling in the interval of 30 minutes. The statistic information of selected trajectories is shown in table I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Dataset</head><p>(2)Road Network: Depending on the selected trajectories, we choose the road network which range from &lt;115.7,39.4&gt; to &lt;117.4,41.6&gt; and include 444086 road nodes, 476622 road segments and 63555 roads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Settings</head><p>The table II lists all the parameter settings used throughout the experiments. All the parameters are set to be the default values unless specified explicitly. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Accuracy Evaluation</head><p>The sampling interval of the raw trajectory in GeoLife and T-Drive is about 1 minute. We generate eight lowsampling-rate datasets by re-sampling the raw data with different sampling intervals ( i.e., <ref type="bibr">3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes)</ref>. Next, we compare the map matching accuracy of MSTM with ST-Matching and IVMM.</p><p>Firstly, we utilize the map matching result of ST-Matching to the raw trajectory as the correct path, denoted as P true . Then, for each low-sampling-rate trajectory, we get the map matching path using ST-Matching and MSTM respectively, denoted as P st and P mstm . We calculate the LCSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> similarity of LCSS st (P true , P st ) and LCSS mstm (P true , P mstm ) as the accuracy. Secondly, we use the algorithm IVMM to generate the p true and calculate the value of LCSS ivmm (P true , P ivmm ) and LCSS mstm (P true , P mstm ) again. Finally, we use the mean value of LCSS mstm (P true , P mstm ) as the final accuracy. Obviously, the large the value of LCSS is, the similar the path to the true path is. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows the matching accuracy results on GeoLife and T-Drive respectively. Obviously, MSTM outperforms ST-Matching and IVMM and is more stable on all the eight low-sampling-rate datasets. Taking the test on Ge-oLife in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>(a) as the example, MSTM shows a higher accuracy with almost 5% improvement compared with ST-Matching and IVMM. Besides, when the sampling interval is more than 15 minutes, the accuracy of ST-Matching and IVMM drops sharply, which infers that the objects are less possible to move following the shortest paths when the sampling interval is large. However, MSTM can always remain a accuracy higher than 70%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Efficiency Evaluation</head><p>In this step, we test the time cost of the algorithms on GeoLife data with different trajectory lengths. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(a), the time cost of MSTM is less than ST-Matching and IVMM obviously. Especially, when the point number of trajectory increases, the time cost of MSTM grows more gentle than that of ST-Matching and IVMM.</p><p>We also evaluate the running time of three main modules in MSTM. The result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6(b)</ref>, from which we can find that the module of MS-Tree generation takes most time. Besides, because the time spent e.tcost in each path has been calculated in the MS-Tree generation module, the time cost in the path recovery module decreases a lot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Parameters Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate the effect of some key parameters in this section.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> (a), the result is not so good when ? is set to 1.5, that's because the extension condition is too tight that even misses the real path. As ? increases from 2 to 5, the accuracy grows and is higher that 87% as least. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> (b) shows how ? affects the running time of MSTM. When ? increases, the time cost of MSTM rises relatively gentle, although more successful extension nodes increases the process time. We can also find that when ? = 2, MSTM achieves a best balance between the accuracy and efficiency.</p><p>Effect of conv. In this section, we test the performance of MSTM with different conv. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7 (c</ref>) shows the accuracy of MSTM when conv varies from 2 to 10. We can find that when conv is set to 2 and 3, the accuracy drops sharply, that's because the constraint is too tight that there are less candidate nodes can be inserted into MS-Tree. On the contrary, when conv &gt; 3, the accuracy of MSTM is good and is higher than 83% at least. As the time cost will increase when conv becomes bigger, we choose conv = 4 as the best setting at last.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of map matching for low-sampling-rate trajectories and a novel algorithm MSTM is proposed. MSTM defines a MS-Tree structure and utilizes a tree-based approach to search for all the candidate paths. Besides, we define two conditional operations extend and prune to control the generation of MS-Tree. Extensive experiments on public trajectory datasets shows that: the accuracy of MSTM is always higher than ST-Matching and IVMM when the sampling interval of raw trajectory varies from 3 minutes to 30 minutes. Especially, the accuracy of MSTM improves over 5% than ST-Matching and IVMM on the GeoLife dataset. Furthermore, the efficiency of MSTM outperforms ST-Matching and IVMM significantly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: An example of the stay point and partition of a trajectory</figDesc></figure>

The value of ? determines the size of the branch nodes in the extend operation, which can affect the accuracy and the efficiency directly. Fig.7 (a) shows the accuracy of MSTM and Fig.7(b) shows the time cost of MSTM on GeoLife data when ? varies from 1.5 to 5. As shown in Fig.7(a), the result is not so good when ? is set to 1.5, that's because the extension condition is too tight that even misses the real path. As ? increases from 2 to 5, the accuracy grows and is higher that 87% as least. Fig.7(b) shows how ? affects the running time of MSTM. When ? increases, the time cost of MSTM rises relatively gentle, although more successful extension nodes increases the process time. We can also find that when ? = 2, MSTM achieves a best balance between the accuracy and efficiency.Effect of conv. In this section, we test the performance of MSTM with different conv. Fig.7 (c)shows the accuracy of MSTM when conv varies from 2 to 10. We can find that when conv is set to 2 and 3, the accuracy drops sharply, that's because the constraint is too tight that there are less candidate nodes can be inserted into MS-Tree. On the contrary, when conv &gt; 3, the accuracy of MSTM is good and is higher than 83% at least. As the time cost will increase when conv becomes bigger, we choose conv = 4 as the best setting at last.</figDesc></figure>
