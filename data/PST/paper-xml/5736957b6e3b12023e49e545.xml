<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Spontaneous facial micro-expression analysis has become an active task for recognizing suppressed and involuntary facial expressions shown on the face of humans. Recently, Local Binary Pattern from Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) has been employed for micro-expression analysis. However, LBP-TOP suffers from two critical problems, causing a decrease in the performance of micro-expression analysis. It generally extracts appearance and motion features from the sign-based difference between two pixels but not yet considers other useful information. As well, LBP-TOP commonly uses classical pattern types which may be not optimal for local structure in some applications. This paper proposes SpatioTemporal Completed Local Quantization Patterns (STCLQP) for facial micro-expression analysis. Firstly, STCLQP extracts three interesting information containing sign, magnitude and orientation components. Secondly, an efficient vector quantization and codebook selection are developed for each component in appearance and temporal domains to learn compact and discriminative codebooks for generalizing classical pattern types. Finally, based on discriminative codebooks, spatiotemporal features of sign, magnitude and orientation components are extracted and fused. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available facial micro-expression databases. Some interesting findings about the neighboring patterns and the component analysis are concluded. Comparing with the state of the art, experimental results demonstrate that STCLQP achieves a substantial improvement for analyzing facial micro-expressions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Micro-expression is a subtle and involuntary facial expression. It usually occurs when a person is consciously trying to conceal all signs of how he is feeling. Unlike regular facial expressions, it is difficult to hide micro-expression reaction. As a result, the importance of micro-expression study is apparent in many potential applications for the security field. Psychological research shows that facial micro-expressions generally remain less than 0.2 s, as well they are very subtle <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>. Short duration and subtle change causes human difficulties in recognizing facial microexpressions. In order to improve this ability, the microexpression training tool developed by Ekman and his team was used to train people to better recognize micro-expressions. Even so, human can achieve just around 40% recognition accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, there is a great need for a high-quality automatic system to recognize facial micro-expressions.</p><p>Some earlier studies on automatic facial micro-expression analysis have primarily focused on posed or synthetic facial micro-expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30]</ref>. Recently, researchers have conducted spontaneous facial micro-expression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43]</ref>. In contrast to posed facial micro-expressions, spontaneous facial micro-expressions can reveal genuine emotions that people try to conceal. It is very challenging to extract useful information from subtle changes of micro-expressions. It is noted that geometrybased or appearance-based feature extraction method has been commonly employed to analyze facial expressions. Specifically, geometric-based features represent the face geometry, such as the shapes and locations of facial landmarks, but they are sensitive to global changes, such as pose change and illumination variation. Instead, appearance-based features describe the skin texture of faces. Among these methods, Local Binary Pattern from Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) has demonstrated its simplicity and efficiency for facial expression recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50]</ref>. As a result, LBP-TOP has been widely used in micro-expression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6]</ref>.</p><p>Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/neucom Pfister et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref> proposed a spontaneous micro-expression recognition method using LBP-TOP. Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref> applied LBP-TOP on their CASME 2 database achieving micro-expression recognition rate of 63.41%. As well, other works used LBP-TOP to investigate whether micro-facial movement sequences can be different from neutral face sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>.</p><p>However, it should be noted that there is still a gap to achieve a high-quality micro-expression analysis. Consequently, several works have attempted to improve the LBP-TOP. Ruiz-Hernandez and Pietik√§inen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> used the re-parameterization of second order Gaussian jet on the LBP-TOP achieving promising microexpression recognition result on the SMIC database <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref> extracted Tensor features from Tensor Independent Color Space (TICS) for micro-expression recognition, but their results on the CASME 2 database showed no improvement if we compare their highest achievable accuracies with the previous results. Furthermore, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref> used Local Spatiotemporal Directional Features (LSDF) with robust principal component analysis for micro-expressions, but yet did not obtain improvement for micro-expression analysis. In addition, recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref> reduced redundant information of LBP-TOP by using Six Intersection Points (LBP-SIP) to obtain better performance than the LBP-TOP. Even so, there is still much room for improvement in the recognition performance.</p><p>In our preliminary work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>, Completed Local Quantized Pattern (CLQP) was proposed by using the completed information and vector quantization to improve the performance of the original LQP proposed by Hussain and Triggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19]</ref>. It achieved considerable results on texture classification and neonatal facial expression classification tasks. This paper proposes Spatio-Temporal Completed Local Quantized Pattern (STCLQP) by extending our spatial domain approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> for micro-expression analysis. In this work, STCLQP exploits three useful information, including sign-based, magnitude-based and orientation-based difference of pixels. Furthermore, STCLQP designs compact and discriminative codebooks for spatiotemporal domain. Different from our preliminary work, this work considers a more discriminative codebook and an application in spatiotemporal domain.</p><p>To explain the concepts of our approach, the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses recent related work. Section 3 describes the completed local quantized patterns (CLQP) in spatial domain. Section 4 provides the extension of CLQP to spatiotemporal domain and explains its implementation to microexpression analysis. Section 5 discusses parameter settings, datasets and provides experimental results with relevant discussion. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>The video feature extraction problem has been addressed from different perspectives. Some works describe a video clip from the shape features. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>, Liu et al. proposed a sketch-based method to organize video clip, where they used sketch annotations to enhance the narrations. The sketch-based approach achieves context-aware sketch recommendation for video shape extraction. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Belongie et al. proposed the shape context using a circular local pattern and histogram to measure similarity between shapes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>, Shin and Chun used eighteen major feature points defined in MPEG 4, and then applied the dense optical flow method to track the feature points for sequential frames. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>, Jain et al. used the shape feature around the eyebrows, eyes, nose, chin, inner lips and outer lips to describe the feature of each frame in video clip.</p><p>On the other hand, there are a few works to use a texture descriptor to describe the appearance and motion features of the video clip. As we know, Gabor and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) are two most representative ones for facial expression recognition. Since Gabor feature is related to the perception in human visual system, some facial expression recognition systems to date have utilized the Gabor energy filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">47]</ref>. Instead, LBP is simple to implement, fast to compute and has led to high accuracy in texture-based recognition tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>. In recent years significant progress has been made in using LBP for facial expression recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33]</ref>. Due to its simplicity, the LBP operator was further extended to video sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>, named the LBP from Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) of a space time volume. Basically, the LBP-TOP description is formed by calculating the LBP features from the planes and concatenating the histograms. In addition, LBP-TOP has efficient computation. Thus, it has become attractive for researchers in many fields.</p><p>In recent years, many extensions of LBP-TOP are developed in an application such as human action recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref> and lip reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Local Ternary Pattern from Three Orthogonal Planes (LTP-TOP) proposed by Nanni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref> quantized intensity differences of neighboring pixels and center pixel into three levels to increase the robustness against noise. However, the LTP-TOP is sensitive to the quantization levels. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, for increasing the robustness against intensity noise, Local Ordinal Contrast Pattern (LOCP) used a pairwise ordinal contrast measurement of pixels from a circular neighborhood starting at the center pixel.</p><p>Recently, Completed Local Binary Pattern from Three Orthogonal Planes (CLBP-TOP) was proposed to exploit the useful information from intensity level <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>. In their work, completed local binary pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> was extended into temporal domain. Magnitude and center pixel are severed as the complementary to the LBP-TOP, increasing the robustness of the LBP-TOP against noise. However, central pixel intensity information is very sensitive to noises caused by such things as illumination changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. Alternatively, several researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16]</ref> have demonstrated that orientation is useful because of its robustness to illumination changes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>, Zhang et al. proposed the Histogram of Gabor Phase Pattern, in which they combine the spatial histogram and the Gabor phase information coding schemes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, Xie et al. proposed local Gabor XOR patterns, which encodes the Gabor phase by using local XOR pattern. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>, Vu and Caplier presented multiple features combining patterns of oriented edge magnitude and patterns of dominant orientations. Therefore, it begs a question if orientation would be more effective for LBP-TOP.</p><p>Furthermore, LBP-TOP and CLBP-TOP inherit from the sparse sampling problem, yielding inadequate spatiotemporal descriptors. In fact, LBP histograms with small a number of bins tend to fail to provide enough discriminative information about the image appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>. Instead, as the number of increases, more discriminative information will be provided, although this will cause the number of local patterns to increase exponentially. For example, with 8 sampling points around each pixel, there are 256 possible local patterns, while with 16 sampling points the dimensionality of histogram is 65,536. More importantly, the histogram becomes extremely sparse given a limited number of pixels. For example, it is observed that only half of the 65,536 local patterns in the case of 16-point sampling occur in spontaneous micro-expression database <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>.</p><p>To address the sparseness problem, some specific codebooks were designed to reduce the number of possible codes and make the resulting histogram compact and evenly distributed. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>, Ojala et al. presented a type of codebook, namely 'uniform pattern', which consists of several binary patterns containing at most two bitwise transitions from 0 to 1 or vice versa when the bit pattern is traversed circularly. Although similar methods to uniform coding are well-established to reduce the dimensionality, they are at best limited palliatives for a serious problem, in which the codebook size is exponentially grown with the number of local sampling points and quantization depth. Furthermore, it is uncertain that uniform coding is generalized for non-circular and multi-circular structures. Thus, it wonders if another compact method can be developed to provide appropriate codebook for various sizes and expressiveness of local pattern representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Completed local quantized pattern in spatial domain</head><p>To address the sparseness problem, many typical coding methods, such as uniform patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>, have been designed by considering rotation and scale invariant properties. However, with number of sampling points increasing, these coding methods are not optimal and compact. Our preliminary work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> proposed Completed Local Quantization Pattern (CLQP) to create a more robust LBP. This approach consists of three stages: (1) component extraction, (2) a codebook obtained by using vector quantization, and (3) local pattern encoding. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the procedure for CLQP. For briefly description, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> describes the representation of the used mathematical symbols in CLQP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Component extraction</head><p>We suppose that an image can be represented as fŒæ x;y g, where Œæ x;y is the gray-level intensity or orientation angle of pixel √∞x; y√û.

For √∞x i ; y i √û, it can be sampled as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This section will in detail describe the extraction of f √∞Œæ x;y ; Œæ x i ;y i √û, which involves the orientation-based, sign-based and magnitude-based difference operators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Orientation-based difference extraction</head><p>Essentially, orientation-based difference extraction aims to encode two dominant orientations between two pixels in an image. This scheme consists of three stages. Firstly, it calculates dominant orientation of the pixel. Secondly, it quantifies dominant orientation into T levels. Finally, it compares dominant orientation of the central pixel with its neighbor pixels.</p><p>(1) Dominant orientation of the pixel: To date, several methods, such as an image gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref> and Sobel filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>, can be used to calculate dominant orientation of each pixel. Gabor filters and Gaussian recursive transformation have been recently proposed to obtain dominant orientation of each pixel <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48]</ref>. In their methods, orientation-estimation filters are designed by using a mask with various size.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, a set of N Gaussian kernels is designed to estimate dominant orientation of a pixel. Given a mask patch with D √Ç D size, the n-th Gaussian kernel is defined as the difference between two oriented with shifted kernels as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G Œ∏n ¬º G √Ä Œ∏n √Ä G √æ Œ∏n P x;y ¬Ω√∞G √Ä Œ∏n √ÄG √æ Œ∏n √û √Å h√∞G √Ä Œ∏n √ÄG √æ Œ∏n √û ;<label>√∞2√û</label></formula><p>where  </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">G √Ä Œ∏n ¬º 1 2œÄœÉ 2 exp √Ä √∞x √Ä œÉ cos Œ∏ n √û 2 √æ√∞y √Ä œÉ sin Œ∏ n √û 2 2œÉ 2 ! ; G √æ Œ∏n ¬º 1 2œÄœÉ 2 exp √Ä √∞x √æ œÉ cos Œ∏ n √û 2 √æ√∞y√æ œÉ sin Œ∏ n √û 2 2œÉ 2 ! ; h√∞G √Ä Œ∏n √Ä G √æ Œ∏n √û ¬º 1; G √Ä Œ∏n √Ä G √æ Œ∏n 4 0 0; G √Ä Œ∏n √Ä G √æ Œ∏n r 0 8 &lt; : ;</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">Œ∏ n ¬º n √Ç 2œÄ N ; n ¬º 0; ‚Ä¶; N √Ä 1.</formula><p>The response of Gaussian kernel defines the contrast magnitude of a local edge at its pixel location. The dominant orientation of pixel √∞x; y√û is obtained with the orientation of a kernel that gave the maximum response,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Œ∏ x;y ¬º arg max Œ∏n X p;q g x √Ä p;y √Ä q G Œ∏n ;<label>√∞3√û</label></formula><p>where g x √Ä p;y √Ä q is gray-level intensity of a pixel √∞x √Ä p; y√Ä q√û in an image, p; q</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">¬º √Ä‚åä D 2 c; √Ä‚åä D 2 c√æ1; ‚Ä¶; ‚åä D 2 c√Ä1; ‚åä D 2 c √à √â ,<label>and</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">‚åä D 2 c means the floor of D 2 .</formula><p>(2) Quantification of dominant orientation: With Gaussian kernels, we obtain a new image containing dominant orientation. We suppose that dominant orientations of the center pixel √∞x; y√û and its neighbors √∞x i ; y i √û are Œ∏ x;y and Œ∏ x i ;y i , respectively. Generally, we could compute the difference of orientation angle <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref> and subsequently code it as 0=1 by setting a threshold value. However, it is difficult to find the optimal threshold value. Instead, some works <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40]</ref> have quantified phase or orientation into several levels, making it easy to compare the relationship between dominant orientations. Thus, the quantification function is used to quantify dominant orientation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Œæ ¬º mod Œ∏ x;y 2œÄ T √æ 0:5 6 6 6 6 4 7 7 7 7 5; T 0 B @ 1 C A;<label>√∞4√û</label></formula><p>where T is number of quantification level.</p><p>(3) Relationship of dominant orientations: Following LBP, we aim to exploit the relationship of a pixel and its surrounding neighbors on orientation-quantified image. The dominant orientation bin of pixel √∞x; y√û and its surrounding pixels √∞x i ; y i √û are denoted as Œæ and Œæ i , respectively. Thus, their relationship is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f √∞Œæ x;y ; Œæ x i ;y i √û ¬º Œæ √à Œæ i ¬º 0; Œæ ¬º Œæ i 1; ŒæaŒæ i ( ;<label>√∞5√û</label></formula><p>where P is the number of the sampling points. Discussion: In previously mentioned procedure, N and T are important to orientation based difference extraction. The dominant orientation estimation is sensitive to N. Small N will make orientation estimation inaccurate. Instead, large N will cause expensive computation. Consequently, appropriate N would provide beneficial performance to orientation estimation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, Xie et al. showed that the appropriate quantification level could achieve a balance between robustness to orientation variation and representation power of local patterns. Additionally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>, Vu et al. discussed how the quantification level could affect the local pattern for the orientation in neighbor structure. Thus, T performs a trade-off role between the robustness to orientation variation and representation power of local patterns. The effect of N and T will be examined in experiments.</p></div>

The vector quantization aims to quantize them into K quantized depths. K-means clustering is a common way in vector quantization for generating representative "visual words" <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18]</ref>. Theoretically, the k-means clustering partitions all observations into a set Œ® n ¬º fŒ® 1 ; Œ® 2 ; ‚Ä¶; Œ® K g as to minimize the withincluster sum of squares as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Œ® n ¬º arg min Œ® X K k ¬º 1 X x ! q A Œ® k J x ! q √Ä Œº k J 2 ;<label>√∞7√û</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">Œ® n ¬º arg min b Œ® X K k ¬º 1 X y ! j A b Œ® k J w j y ! j √Ä b Œº k J 2 :<label>√∞8√û</label></formula><p>Another important issue related to the efficiency of k-means is to initialize clustering centers. Different choices of an initialization substantially affect the speed of divergence of training procedure and also the performance.

In the implementation, we firstly sort local patterns by the descending order of occurrence, and secondly select the first K local patterns as the initialization of the clustering centers.

On the other hand, STCLQP makes local patterns more compact and discriminative by developing codebooks based on Fisher criterion.</p><p>The method is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. It consists of four stages: (1) components extraction, (2) using vector quantization to obtain codebook (including local pattern pool and vector quantization), (3) local pattern encoding and (4) discriminative and compact codebook selection. The component extraction method (in Section 3.1) and an efficient vector quantization (in Section 3.2) are employed to the first and second stages, respectively.

(3) Using bigger mask patch size (Gaussian-Mask5) for Gaussian filters can contribute better performance to 'detection', 'pos/ neg/sur', '4-class' and '5-class' than Gaussian-Mask3, because using bigger mask patch size can capture sufficient pixel information for more accurate dominant orientation estimation.</p><p>These results demonstrate that Gaussian filter's strategy achieves better performance than Gradient filter and Sobel filter.

(2) For the magnitude component (in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6(b</ref>)), it is noted that the codebooks with the large codebook size have better performance for 'detection' and '5-class', while the codebook with the small codebook size offers promising result for 'pos/neg/ sur'.

F1 scores are increased at 0.021, 0.0237, 0.1172 and 0.0476 for 'detection', 'pos/neg/sur', '4-class' and '5-class', respectively. Specifically for '4-class' F1 score is substantially increased.  For orientation component, using vector quantization obtains promising performance at the increasing recognition rate of 2.14%, 4.89% and 4.68% for 'detection', 'pos/neg/sur' and '4-class', respectively. F1 scores are increased at 0.0337, 0.0207 and 0.0587 for 'detection', 'pos/neg/sur' and '4-class', respectively. Furthermore, we show the recognition rate of vector quantization for sign, magnitude and orientation, when codebook size is 60 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>. Comparing with Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>, even using the similar number for both encoding methods, at most of cases, vector quantization still performs better than 'uniform pattern'. These comparisons show that vector quantization can make original LBP-TOP better. Furthermore, they show STCLQP with small codebook size achieves better performance than 'uniform pattern'. The small codebook size can make system fast and save storage cost. For example, in the implementation, for sign component, the classification and local pattern encoding phases take average 2.3 ms and 2.12 ms for each sample using codebook, respectively, while using 'uniform pattern' they take about 6.78 ms and 5.201 ms, respectively, when they are carried out on Malab 2013a with Intel Core i5 3.10 GHz. For storage, the dimension of sign component using 'uniform pattern' is 11,328 (8 √Ç 8 √Ç 3 √Ç 59), while using codebook is 7680 (8 √Ç 8 √Ç 3 √Ç 40). Therefore, an advantage of vector quantization is to reduce the dimension and get more compact features.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8.">Algorithm comparison</head><p>Previously mentioned, STCLQP achieves the best accuracies of 75.31%, 64.02%, 57.31% and 58.39% for 'detection', 'pos/neg/sur', '4-class' and '5-class', respectively. In this section, we compare STCLQP with LBP-TOP, CLBP-TOP, local ordinary contrast pattern (LOCP-TOP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, spatiotemporal local monogenic binary pattern (STLMBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>, spatiotemporal cuboids descriptor (Cuboids) <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> and LBP-SIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>.</p><p>Results on recognition accuracy, average F1-score and mean AUC on three databases are reported in Tables 10-12, respectively. As can be seen from three tables, cuboid feature method performs poorly in four tasks. Instead, spatiotemporal feature descriptors work better than cuboid features.</p><p>(1) We can see that STCLQP outperforms CLBP-TOP, although both methods employ sign and magnitude components. STCLQP alternatively uses codebook to replace 'uniform pattern', so that it can obtain more compact and discriminative information than CLBP-TOP. In addition, orientation component is included in STCLQP.</p><p>(2) As well, we can see that STCLQP beats STLMBP. As we know, STLMBP exploits the similar way to obtain orientation and sign features. But one main difference is STLMBP first used monogenic filter to extract new images. Comparing with STLMBP and CLBP-TOP, we see that using codebook can strengthen micro-expression features. (3) We compare STCLQP with LBP-SIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref> on the three databases.</p><p>It is found that our method appears to outperform LBP-SIP on all databases. In STCLQP, it exploits more information while LBP-SIP aims to improve efficiency of LBP-TOP using intersect neighborhoods.</p><p>We provide confusion matrices for four tasks on three databases using STCLQP, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. On micro-expression detection task, STCLQP easily detects most of micro-expression videos out of non-micro expression videos. For micro-expression recognition on SMIC database, STCLQP achieves the lowest accuracy for recognizing 'positive' class, and STCLQP has the same performance for recognizing 'negative' and 'surprise' classes.</p><p>On CASME and CASME 2 databases, micro-expression classes become more complicated and diversity, for example, CASME 2 database contains five classes. From the confusion matrix on CASME dataset, it is found that STCLQP works the best on recognizing 'disgust', followed closely by 'tense', 'repression' and 'surprise'. Among four classes, 'repression' and 'tense' are two easily confused micro-expressions for STCLQP. Furthermore, it is found that samples from 'disgust' class is falsely classified to 'tense' class. On CASME 2 dataset, 'repression' and 'disgust' are the most difficult micro-expressions to recognize, while 'surprise' and 'others' classes are easy to recognize. It is found that samples of 'happiness', 'disgust' and 'repression' are falsely classified into 'others' micro-expression category. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>, Yan et al. annotated microexpression video clips that cannot be labeled according to FACS into one class. This annotation may cause STCLQP falsely classifying 'happiness', 'disgust' and 'repression' into 'others' class. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.9.">Discussion</head><p>Overall, for spontaneous micro-expressions, the effects of codebook size, sampling structure and components are examined on three spontaneous micro-expression databases. Tables 10-12 compare the proposed method with other methods under different performance evaluation metric. We see that STCLQP provides considerably improvement for recognizing spontaneous micro-expressions.</p><p>Moreover, the codebook size substantially affects the performance of STCLQP. It is also dependent on the neighboring structures. Fortunately, less bins in a codebook can achieve better accuracy than by using uniform pattern (59 bins). The advantage is that it automatically learns the statistical patterns from the dataset. In other words, the codebook is specific to the dataset. We further prove that the discriminative codebook selection strategy can substantially raise the performance in recognizing spontaneous micro-expressions. It also avoids from the manual parameter selection from many parameters. Additionally, we also see that STCLQP appears to be explicitly improved by using more local pattern neighborhoods.</p><p>Additionally, we report the effect of all components and different combination to micro-expression analysis. It is interesting to find that all three components can improve the performance of spontaneous micro-expression analysis. We also find that the orientation component can perform better than sign component in some cases, for example, in micro-expression detection. This is first time to combine those three components for LBP-TOP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In recent years, facial micro-expression analysis has been an active and challenging research in psychology and computer vision, because the durations of micro-expressions are very short and only subtle changes are involved. We proposed a spatiotemporal completed local quantized patterns, which exploits more useful information and learns compact and discriminative codebook for micro-expression analysis. In our approach, orientation component is considered as complementary to sign and magnitude components for LBP features. Furthermore, an efficient vector quantization and Fisher criterion are utilized to obtain the compact and discriminative codebook. Finally, features of three components are concatenated into one feature based on feature subspace. We demonstrated the proposed feature descriptor is efficient and can provide advantageous performance by comparing with other methods on three spontaneous micro-expression databases. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
