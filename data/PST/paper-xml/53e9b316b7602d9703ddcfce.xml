<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With globalization and the emergence of the extended enterprise of interdependent organizations, there has been a steady increase in the outsourcing of parts and services. This has led firms to give more importance to the purchasing function and its associated decisions. One of those decisions which impacts all firms'areas is the supplier selection. Since the 1950s, several works have addressed this decision by treating different aspects and instances. In this paper, we extend previous survey papers by presenting a literature review that covers the entire purchasing process, considers both parts and services outsourcing activities, and covers internet-based procurement environments such as electronic marketplaces auctions. In view of its complexity, we will focus especially on the final selection stage that consists of determining the best mixture of vendors and allocating orders among them so as to satisfy different purchasing requirements. In addition, we will concentrate mainly on works that employ operations research and computational models. Thereby, we will analyze and expose the main decision's features, and propose different classifications of the published models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In today's fierce competitive environment, characterized by thin profit margins, high consumer expectations for quality products and short lead-times, companies are forced to take advantage of any opportunity to optimize their business processes. To reach this aim, academics and practitioners have come to the same conclusion: for a company to remain competitive, it has to work with its supply chain partners to improve the chain's total performance. Thus, being the main process in the upstream chain and affecting all areas of an organization, the purchasing function is taking an increasing importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">The major purchasing decision processes</head><p>There are six major purchasing decision processes: (1) 'make or buy', (2) supplier selection, (3) contract negotiation, (4) design collaboration, (5) procurement, and (6) sourcing analysis, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In the 'make or buy' decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(1)</ref>, depending on whether the part/service is a finished/semi-finished good or not, a company would decide on whether a certain part or service should be 'produced' internally or outsourced. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we reserve the term 'outsourcing' for the case when a finished/semi-finished part or service is being procured and the term 'purchasing' for the case when a raw material is being procured. That is, the distinguishing factor between a purchased and an outsourced item is that in the latter the supplier undertakes processes that add value to the item. The analysis at this stage would typically look at the economics of the part or service (i.e., is it cheaper to produce internally?) as well as its strategic importance (i.e., is it a core product or service?). In this survey, we assume that the company has already determined that the part or service is both beneficial and strategically appealing to outsource or purchase. Thus, the papers included in this review consider only decision processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref> and the question of whether the part is being outsourced or purchased is immaterial to the models therein. Therefore, to be consistent with most of the literature on procurement, in the sequel, we use the terms 'purchasing' and 'outsourcing' interchangeably.</p><p>In the supplier selection process (2), a pool of suppliers is chosen for procurement according to a predefined set of criteria. A good proportion of the studies surveyed in this paper focus on this decision process. The problem of designing a suitable contract is the subject of the contract negotiation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(3)</ref>. Although, recently there is an increasing interest in the subject of contract design for supply chain coordination, there is only a small number of papers that have focused on procurement contracts (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1]</ref> for a discussion of when it is appropriate to use a short-or long-term procurement contract). A related decision process is that of design collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(4)</ref>. At this stage the procurer and supplier work closely to design parts/services that meet quality standards and customer specifications. Here also, we found only a small number of studies that consider design collaboration criteria in supplier selection models (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref> for a model that addresses the issue of achieving quality standards by concurrent tolerance design and supplier selection).</p><p>The procurement decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref> is concerned with the problem of guaranteeing that the suppliers would deliver the part/service in time and with minimum costs. Supplier selection papers that address lot sizing and other inventory related issues fall under this category. Finally, in the sourcing analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(6)</ref> stage, a company would try to assess the overall efficiency of its procurement process. Here, issues like assortments (ordering a group of parts/services from a single supplier), consolidation (shipping orders from more than one supplier together), and supplier performance measurements would be considered.</p><p>Typically, it is only decision processes (2), <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref>, and (6) that are under the complete responsibility of the purchasing department. For the remaining processes at least one other department, if not another company, would be involved: marketing and strategic planning (top management) for <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(1)</ref>, strategic planning and suppliers' sales department for <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(3)</ref> and engineering departments of both the company and its suppliers for <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(4)</ref>. Consistent with the purchasing department's major responsibilities, we found that the majority of the analytical studies on outsourcing decisions focus on processes (2), <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(6)</ref>. In the future we expect that more procurement studies will focus on decisions that span more than one company.</p><p>Efficient management of the purchasing processes is particularly crucial for industries where outsourcing costs constitute a significant portion of their operating costs (e.g., hi-tech industry where outsourced services and parts account for more than 80% of cost of finished goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref>). Recent data about manufacturing outsourcing activities (often called contract manufacturing) can only confirm this trend: the contract manufacturing industry is estimated to be worth $120 billion in 2001 and has been the fastest growing sector among manufacturing industries, with a yearly growth rate of more than 80% between 1996 and 2000. It is expected that 50% of manufacturing activities will be outsourced by 2010 <ref type="bibr">[4, p. 24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Overview of the purchasing literature</head><p>Overall, there are two salient viewpoints in the literature:</p><p>• The most important purchasing decision is undoubtedly selecting and maintaining close relationships with a few, albeit reliable and high-quality vendors, in order to reduce product costs while maintaining excellent product quality and customer services (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>). • There is a strong need for a systematic approach to purchasing decision making especially in the area of identifying appropriate suppliers and assigning orders among them (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>).</p><p>The Supplier Selection Problem (also called Vendor Selection Problem, used interchangeably in this paper) captures the essential characteristics of the above decisions. Apart from limited number of studies that consider purchasing services and contracts (e.g., studies by Degraeve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>, Oliveira and Lourenço <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>), the vast majority of published works deal with the procurement of materials, particularly by industrial firms.</p><p>A synthesis of the purchasing literature reveals that there are three major decisions that are related to the supplier selection problem:</p><p>• What product to order? Up to half of the papers we surveyed are for situations in which vendors are selected for only one product. In such cases, various interdependencies that could exist among the different products are not taken into account. For instance, a supplier can be offering a large discount based on total sales volume, irrespective of the product mix. Order costs could also be minimized by combining orders for several products into one single order. Finally, quality audits for different products might be executed simultaneously. Only few models consider purchasing simultaneously a set of products. Furthermore, many multiple-products vendor selection models handle the problem on an item-by-item basis and have to be applied iteratively to select suppliers for multiple items.</p><p>• In what quantities and from which supplier(s)? Basically, there are two kinds of purchasing situations: single or multiple sourcing. With the first alternative, all the suppliers can fully meet the buyer's requests in terms of quantity, quality, delivery, etc. Consequently, the only decision concerns the identification of the 'best' supplier. Regarding the second alternative, it is adopted either when none of the suppliers is able to satisfy the buyer's total demands (due to limitations on supplier's capacity, quality, delivery, price, etc.) or when procurement strategies aim at avoiding dependency on a single source to protect from shortages and maintaining steady competition among suppliers. In these circumstances, the problem is twofold: vendor selection and order quantity allocation. • In which periods? Inventory lot-sizing and supplier choice are closely interrelated. Incorporating the decision to schedule orders over time with the vendor selection may significantly reduce costs over the planning horizon. By considering a multi-period horizon, one or more suppliers could be selected in each of these periods for the purchase of products. Alternatively, products could be carried forward to a future period, incurring holding costs. The economic ordering quantity (EOQ) concept could also be introduced into procurement lot-sizing decisions to incur the least total cost possible in a supplier selection and procurement lot sizing process. Nevertheless, in spite of those advantages, the majority of models that have been proposed up to now treat vendor selection without considering multi-period inventory management issues.</p><p>The problem of selecting suitable suppliers is not new and a great number of conceptual and empirical works have been published. In fact, before supply chain management became a buzzword, numerous publications have already addressed vendor selection issues. First related papers can be traced back to the 1950s when applications of linear programming and scientific computations were at their beginning. The first recorded supplier selection model is that used by the National Bureau of Standards in the United States of America to find the minimum cost way for awarding procurement contracts in the Department of Defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>. It is worthwhile mentioning that none of the previous literature reviews have mentioned these studies and other related works around that period of time. The existent literature surveys focuses on papers starting from the mid 1960s. The earliest review is by Moore and Fearon <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> where they focus on industry applications of computer-assisted supplier selection models. Many other interesting surveys in this area followed thereafter:</p><p>• Kingsman <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> highlights the inadequacy of classical inventory management models for tackling purchasing decisions and describes some of the major models that were used for the different purchasing decision making stages. • Holt <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> reviewed and compared several decisional methods applied in contractor evaluation and selection.</p><p>• Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref> annotate and classify 74 articles with regard to the particular criteria mentioned in the study, the purchasing environment and the decision technique used. • Degraeve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> presented some published supplier selection models as well and compared their relative efficiency using the total cost of ownership approach using a real life data set. • Unlike in previous survey papers, De Boer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref> did not restrict the review to the final choice models. The authors recognized the prior steps to the ultimate stage and presented the main published works that deal with all the supplier selection process.</p><p>Motivated by the above discussion, the purpose of this paper is to extend and update previous reviews. Similar to that of De Boer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>, our study deals with the entire selection process. Nevertheless, in view of its complexity, we focus more on the final selection stage especially in multiple sourcing contexts. In addition, we will concentrate mainly on works that employ operations research and computational models. Contrary to the existing reviews that only describe briefly the published works, we propose a complete analysis of the various dimensions and characteristics of related literature and provide different classifications. Finally, our work stands previous studies by considering both parts and services outsourcing activities and covering internet-based procurement environments such as electronic marketplaces auctions.</p><p>The present paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the whole selection process giving a fair picture of the variety of approaches available to support the final choice's prior steps. In Section 3, basing on an extensive survey of the purchasing literature, we analyze and classify published final selection models in both single and multiple sourcing contexts. Supplier selection models for service industries and recent developments in the internet-based procurement environments will be described in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, several conclusions will be drawn in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The vendor selection process: different stages and characteristics</head><p>As reported by De Boer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>, several decision-making steps make up the vendor selection process: at first, a preparation step is achieved by formulating the problem and the different decision criteria. After that, prequalification of potential suppliers and final choices are successively elaborated. De Boer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23]</ref> present an interesting overview of the literature on supplier selection models. It specifies the published works treating every stage of the selection process for every purchasing situation.</p><p>In this section, we expose in a general way, the main objectives and features of each process' step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Problem definition</head><p>Due to shortened product life cycles, the search for new suppliers is a continuous priority for companies in order to upgrade the variety and typology of their products range. On the other hand, purchasing environments such as Just-In-Time, involve establishing close connections with suppliers leading to the concept of partnership, privileged suppliers, long-term agreement, etc. Thereby, decision makers are facing different purchasing situations that lead to different decisions. Consequently, in order to make the right choice, the purchasing process should start with finding out exactly what we want to achieve by selecting a supplier.</p><p>In general, the majority of decision tools for problem definition are qualitative methods that assist decision-makers in order to carefully identify the need for a decision and the alternatives that seem to be available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Decision criteria formulation</head><p>Depending on the purchasing situation, selecting the right suppliers is influenced by a variety of factors. This additional complexity is essentially due to the multi-criteria nature of this decision. The analysis of this aspect has been the focus of multiple papers since the 1960's. Cardozo and Cagley <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>, Monczka et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>, Moriarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>, Woodside and Vyas <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>, Chapman and Carter <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>, Tullous and Munson <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> propose diverse empirical researches emphasizing the relative importance of different supplier attributes. Among works that are a reference for the majority of papers we distinguish Dickson's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>. Based on a questionnaire sent to 273 purchasing agent and managers from United States and Canada, it identified 23 different criteria evaluated in vendor selection. Among these, the price, delivery, and quality objectives of the buyer, as well as the abilities of the vendors to meet those objectives, are particularly important factors in deciding how much to order from the available vendors. In the same way, Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref> observed that price, delivery, quality, production capacity and localization are the criteria most often treated in the literature. Although the evolution of the industrial environment modified the degrees of the relative importance of supplier selection criteria since the 1960s, the 23 ones presented by Dickson still cover the majority of those presented in the literature until today.</p><p>A series of experimental studies was conducted by Verma and Pullman <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref> to examine how managers effectively choose suppliers. The empirical results reveal that they perceive quality to be the most important attribute in the selection process. Nevertheless, the same sample of managers assign more weight to cost and delivery performance than quality when actually choosing a supplier. Cusumano and Takeishi <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> note as well that the choice of criteria may differ from one culture to another.</p><p>Generally, two basic types of criteria are dealt with when deciding which suppliers to select: objective and subjective ones. These former can be measured by a concrete quantitative dimension like cost whereas the latter cannot be like the quality of design. Another factor complicating the decision is that some criteria may conflict each other. Wind and Robinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> identified possible contradictions such as the vendor offering the lowest price may not have the best quality, or the vendor with the best quality may not deliver on time. As a result, it is necessary to make a trade-off between conflicting tangible and intangible factors to find the best suppliers. Observe that in compensatory models, a poor performance on one criterion (generally represented by a score) can be compensated by a high performance in another one whereas in non-compensatory models, different minimum levels for each criterion are required.</p><p>Regarding available methods, there is a lack in the purchasing literature for the formulation of criteria and their qualification. As for the previous phase, it consists essentially of applying qualitative methods that include tools for visualizing and analyzing the decision-maker's perception of a problem situation and tools for brainstorming about possible alternative solutions. In the survey proposed by De Boer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>, only two applications are mentioned and some operational research methods such as Rough Sets Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35]</ref>, and Value Focused Thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> are proposed as suitable alternatives for criteria identification and selection.</p><p>Regardless of the method used, supplier selection criteria formulation affects several activities including inventory management, production planning and control, cash flow requirements, product/service quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>. Therefore such decision must be made under the consensus of a multidisciplinary group of decision makers with various points of view and representing the different services of the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Pre-selection of potential suppliers</head><p>Today's co-operative logistics environment requires a low number of suppliers as it is very difficult to manage a high number. Therefore, the purpose of this process's stage is to rule out the inefficient candidates and reduce the set of all suppliers to a small range of acceptable ones.</p><p>Among the existing alternatives, it is possible to use an elimination method which excludes suppliers that do not satisfy the selection rule. With a "conjunctive" rule, we eliminate the suppliers whose mark, with respect to a criterion, is lower than the minimal threshold already fixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>. This is justified by the fact that if a supplier cannot satisfy a minimal threshold compared to a certain criterion, it cannot be selected in spite of its possible effectiveness with respect to other criteria because of intolerable possible consequences on quality or other constraints or objectives of the company.</p><p>In a "lexicographic" rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>, on a first level, the most significant criterion is identified. Then, we compare suppliers with respect to this criterion. If a supplier satisfies it much better than the other suppliers then it is chosen, if not, we compare the suppliers with respect to the second criterion, and so on.</p><p>Timmerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref> proposes a categorical method to sort suppliers into three classes by considering historical data. It is a simple and inexpensive qualitative rating model that requires a minimum of performance data. It consists of evaluating and categorizing supplier's performance on each criterion as either 'good' (+), 'neutral' (0) or 'unsatisfactory' (-) and combining them into a total rating. However, such method is very sensitive to changes in ratings and depends heavily on human judgment. It also weights the criteria equally, which rarely happens in practice. In view of those limitations, such method is inadequate to the final choice phase.</p><p>Likewise, as reported first by Hinkle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> and later by Holt <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>, using a classification algorithm, cluster analysis (CA) allows classifying suppliers described by a set of numerical attribute scores in groups of comparable suppliers. In this way, the difference between suppliers' performance within a cluster are minimal whereas it is maximal between different clusters. Holt <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> contends that CA offers greatest potential for pre-qualifying all suppliers. That is, CA reduces the probability of rejecting a 'good' supplier too early in the process via subjective reduction of the often large original set. CA would enlarge the scope for rationalization of the selection process by identifying the criteria involved.</p><p>Another method that aids decision makers in classifying the suppliers or their bids into a group of efficient suppliers and a group of inefficient ones is the data envelopment analysis (DEA). Due to its usefulness in evaluating multi-criterion systems and providing improvement targets, this method has been widely applied to address various decision analysis problems. DEA is a mathematical programming technique that calculates the relative efficiencies (ration of weighted outputs (benefit criteria) to weighted inputs (cost criteria)) of multiple decision making units. Its use in supplier selection was primarily discussed by Weber and Ellram <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>. Weber and Desai <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref> applied a combination of DEA and parallel coordinates representation to evaluate the performance of vendors and develop negotiation strategies with inefficient ones. Dealing with the procurement of an individual product under multiple criteria, the authors had also shown the advantages of applying DEA to such a system. Later, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref> extended Weber and Desai's research using DEA in supplier evaluation for an individual product.</p><p>Talluri and Narasimhan <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> stated that multi-factor vendor evaluation methods such as DEA have primarily relied on evaluating vendors based on their strengths and failed to incorporate their weaknesses into the selection process. They also added that such approaches would not be able to effectively differentiate between vendors with comparable strengths but significantly different weaknesses. Consequently, the authors proposed an approach based on min-max productivity methods that estimates vendor performance variability measures, which are then used in a non-parametric statistical technique in identifying homogeneous vendor groups for effective selection. In this way, buyers are provided with effective alternative choices within a vendor group. This allows the buyer to base the final decision on other intangible factors that could not be incorporated into the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Final selection</head><p>Being the emergent part of the buying process, most of the publications in the area of supplier selection have focused on determining the best mixture of vendors to supply all needed items. Therefore, at this stage, the ultimate supplier(s) are identified and orders are allocated among them while considering the system's constraints and taking into account a multitude of quantitative and/or qualitative criteria.</p><p>The research survey reveals that great attention has been paid to develop effective vendor selection models. In the remainder of this paper, we will cover in detail the state-of-the-art decision models available at present.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Decision models for the final choice phase: Review of the existing literature</head><p>As stated earlier, the vast majority of the decision models existing in literature concern the final choice phase of the buying process. To classify them, a first distinction can be made by considering the second decision related to the supplier selection problem that is to say adopting sole-sourcing where the total demand is procured from the best vendor or multiple sourcing where it is split among several vendors. Below, we present consecutively the main works dealing with each alternative.</p><p>Most models in the literature have assumed all problems parameters to be known with certainty. We will highlight the models that incorporated uncertainty, mostly in pricing, in each of the single sourcing and multiple sourcing categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Single sourcing models</head><p>When a relatively small number of parts are externally procured, the total demand can be supplied by only one vendor. Such a single sourcing scenario seems tenable especially in the last decade, which has seen a significant shift in the sourcing strategy of many firms, moving from the traditional concept of having many suppliers to rely largely on one source with which a long term win-win partnership is established. In these circumstances, the decision consists of selecting one supplier for one order to meet the total buyer's demand. This can be made while considering a single criterion or a multitude of criteria. The literature survey reveals that except the multi-item weighting model proposed by Grando and Sianesi <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref> and the mathematical programming models developed by Benton <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref> and Akinc <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>, the quasi totality of published works dealing with sole sourcing concern the procurement of a single item and does not carry over into inventory management over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Single criterion approaches</head><p>Generally, in a situation with a single criterion, one retains the cost as the most important criterion. Traditionally, vendor selection and evaluation were based on picking the least invoice cost supplier, ignoring other important sources of indirect supplier costs like those associated with late delivery times, production breaks, poor quality of delivered goods, etc. To overcome such limitations while considering cost-oriented selection, Timmerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref> proposed the cost ratio method which has the potential to yield much better decisions. It evaluates supplier performances by considering indirect costs using tools of standard cost analysis. This total cost approach aims at quantifying for every purchased item the costs associated with working with a specific vendor as much as possible in monetary units. Consequently, it collects all the costs related to quality, delivery and service and expresses them as a benefit or penalty percentage on unit price. This percentage is then used to adjust the vendor's quoted price to obtain a net adjusted cost figure. Operationally speaking, the cost ratio method is an extremely complex approach, requiring a comprehensive cost-accounting system to generate precisely the required cost data. Roodhooft and Konings <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref> suggest the use of the activity based costing approach (ABC) to compute total costs caused by a supplier in a firm's production process. As in Timmerman's model, the system chooses the supplier who minimizes the total additional costs associated with the purchase decision (e.g., price differentials and supplementary estimated internal production costs caused by the supplier). A vendor evaluation can also be done by comparing budgeted and actual scores after delivery of the products.</p><p>Mathematical programming was also employed by Benton <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref> to select only one vendor to supply all needed items. Using the economic ordering concept (EOQ), the author developed a nonlinear program and a heuristic procedure using Lagrangian relaxation for supplier selection and lot sizing under conditions of multiple items, multiple suppliers, resource limitations and all-unit quantity discounts. The buyer's objective is to minimize the sum of purchasing cost, inventory cost and ordering costs subject to an aggregate inventory investment constraint and an aggregate storage limitation constraint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Multi-criteria approaches</head><p>A large number of the researches dealing with procurement decision are concerned with selecting the best supplier taking into account the multi-objective nature of the problem. In this area, several methods have been suggested in the literature. The most common approach that has been firstly endorsed by Wind and Robinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> in supplier selection uses linear weighting models to assess the vendor's performance. This approach produces useful and reasonably reliable data, and is relatively easy to implement. Made known principally by Zenz <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref> and Timmerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, the basic model is described as follows: giving some form of scoring methods, it consists in assigning weights to each criterion so that the biggest score indicates the highest importance. After that, ratings on the criteria are multiplied by their weights and summed in order to obtain a single figure for each vendor. Finally, the supplier who has the best mark compared to the whole of the weighted criteria is chosen. We point out that such method is also suitable for the pre-selection phase of the buying process. In this situation, we retain a set of suppliers having the highest scores.</p><p>Except for Grando and Sianesi <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref> that do not combine ratings on different criteria into one overall score and De Boer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref> which propose a partially compensatory approach, these and similar methods are usually referred to as compensatory approaches. In fact, as a result of summing of the scores, a poor performance on one score can be compensated by a high one on another.</p><p>Although giving weights to the various criteria remains a subjective process, an interesting point which is common to weighting models is that they all make some kind of trade-off between tangible and intangible factors to find the best supplier. On the other hand, besides requiring a standardization of all the factor units, one problem in the linear weighting model is the difficulty to objectively determine the score of a supplier on a criterion or the importance of some criterion with a high degree of precision. Dulmin and Mininno <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref> focused on the problem of criteria weights' assessment. They propose an interesting survey of most commonly used methods and contend that the set of weights should be a dynamic vector, because of modifications in supply markets, product life cycle or changes in firm's strategies that lead decision makers to periodically update priorities in supplier performance.</p><p>A wide variety of slightly different models have been suggested for supplier choice. They principally differ on the methods used to derive partial scores and weights for the criteria. As a first adaptation of the basic model, we discern the model proposed by Gregory <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>. It has linked this basic approach to a matrix representation of data and then rated the different vendors for their quota allocations.</p><p>Using pairwise comparison, a more accurate scoring method that has been applied on supplier selection is the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Narasimhan <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>, Partovi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>, Nydick and Hill <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref>, Barbarosoglu and Yazgaç <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref>, Yahya and Kingsman <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>, Masella and Rangone <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>, Tam and Tummala <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63]</ref>, Handfield et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref> and Colombo and Francalanci <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref> propose the use of this technique to cope especially with determining scores. It is a decision-making tool that can help describe the general decision operation by decomposing a complex problem into a multi-level hierarchical structure of objectives, criteria, sub-criteria and alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref>. In a recent study, Liu and Hai <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67]</ref> presented the voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP) that is a novel easier weighting procedure in place of AHP's paired comparison. The analytical network process (ANP), a more sophisticated version of AHP, was also applied for vendor selection by Sarkis and Talluri <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">69]</ref>. In the same way, Willis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[70]</ref> use 'dimensional analysis' in a model where a series of pairwise comparisons are made among suppliers using a Vendor Performance Index such that each criterion is measured in its own units.</p><p>Categorized by Degraeve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> and De Boer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref> as a total cost approach, Monczka and Trecha <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[71]</ref> combined this approach with rating systems for criteria such as service and delivery performance for which it is more difficult to obtain the cost figures. As a result, it proposed multiple criteria vendor service factor ratings and an overall supplier performance index using linear weighting models to adjust the net price for non performance costs associated with the supplier. Smytka and Clemens <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[72]</ref> developed similarly a more elaborated total cost approach in which they first assess 'risk factors' on a go/no-go basis. After that, they developed rates on several 'business desirable factors' such as delivery performance. Finally, they collected information on a very extensive list of 'measurable cost factors' and calculated the total cost.</p><p>Simple linear weighting models have also been adapted to deal with uncertainty in decision making deriving from incomplete and qualitative data and unstructured purchasing situations (e.g., dynamic and subjective criteria and alternatives). For the major part of the proposed models, the common feature to the techniques is that we do not directly have to provide precise numerical parameters such as criteria weights.</p><p>Soukup <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[73]</ref> presents a method to deal with the uncertainty issue that focuses on the requirements' uncertainty. The author modified the linear weighting method by using probabilities for the criterion weights and a payoff matrix representing alternative scenarios with different sets of performance scores and probabilities.</p><p>Other approaches not requiring precise weight assessments are statistical, such as those proposed by Williams <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[74]</ref>, Min <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[75]</ref> and Petroni and Braglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[76]</ref>. They respectively suggest the use of conjoint-analysis, indifference trade-off method and principal component analysis.</p><p>Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[77]</ref> introduces Monte Carlo simulation to reduce the uncertainty innate to the rating mechanism. Afterward, he applied the Thurstone Case V scaling technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[78]</ref>. In this manner, setting criteria weights and assigning performance score are not required and it suffices to give ranges of scores or simply qualitative rank-order information.</p><p>Fuzzy Theory (FST) was also looked at as a tool for vendor selection. Being able to model human judgment and multi-criteria information, some papers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>) discussed its application when facing uncertainty. As a result, it was combined in many studies with weighting models. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[79]</ref> propose a fuzzy set methodology by introducing the SUR index that takes the inconsistency of the evaluator into account for each qualitative criterion. Morlacchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">81]</ref>, developed a model combining FST with AHP to evaluate small suppliers in the engineering and machine sectors. Later, he focused on the design process of such model, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of using hybrid approaches of techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[82]</ref>.</p><p>With linear weighting models, it is not possible to take into account some quantitative aspects or factors of the purchasing decision. To cope with this limitation, mathematical programming is a suitable alternative. Akinc <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref> proposed a decision support approach to select vendors in a single sourcing context under the conflicting criteria of minimizing the annual material costs, reducing the number of suppliers and maximizing suppliers' delivery and quality performances. Mathematical programming was used to elaborate several models exploring the trade-off between material costs and number of suppliers under a variety of scenarios (problem instances) defined with respect to specific quality and delivery performance standards that vendors must achieve. In this way, a first model finds the set of vendors that minimize the total invoice cost regardless of their numbers. After that, a second model is used to find the smallest set of vendors who can supply all materials within the desired minimal quality and delivery parameters. Then, those two solutions are used as benchmarks and a third model is employed to explore the quantitative trade-off between these extreme solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Single sourcing with uncertainties</head><p>Apart from the above adapted weighing models dealing with uncertainty, other works exist in the literature that considers purchasing decisions with price fluctuations. The earliest reported works date back to 1959. Fabian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[83]</ref> developed a dynamic program to investigate the problem of determining monthly purchasing volumes for a single commodity when prices and consumption are random variables. Morris <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[84]</ref> also uses dynamic programming to analyze different purchasing strategies when future prices are considered random variables. He also provides conditions for the optimality of a single purchasing strategy. Ammer <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[85]</ref> suggests using decision trees to examine different decision stages and the possible probabilities in supplier negotiations. Golabi <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[86]</ref> extends the work of Morris <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[84]</ref> by considering different assumptions about price distributions, planning horizon and the holding cost function. In a similar vein, Kingsman <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> also assumes demand is deterministic and uses dynamic programming to find optimal purchase policies when prices are random, and possibly coming from different probability distributions. Recently, Polatoglu and Sahin <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[87]</ref> investigated a multi-period procurement strategy where demand in each period is a random variable, the probability distribution of which may depend on price and period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Multiple sourcing models</head><p>A useful approach to ensure the reliability of a manufacturer's supply stream is to follow a multiple sourcing policy. In this situation, a buyer purchases the same item from more than one vendor and the total demand is split among them. Even if this choice needs more flexibility from the company, it is very interesting when one of the suppliers, for reasons like price discount offers and possible limitations on capacity, quality, delivery, price, etc., cannot satisfy the assigned demand. Researches such as Hong and Hayya's <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[88]</ref> have also argued that the use of multiple suppliers, in a majority of cases especially in just-in-time environment, reduces the overall inventory and purchasing costs.</p><p>Due to their ability to optimize the explicitly stated objective subject to a multitude of constraints, mathematical programming is the most appropriate technique that allows the decision maker to formulate such decision problems. It allows considering internal policy constraints and externally imposed system constraints placed on the buying process in order to determine an optimal ordering and inventory policy simultaneously while selecting the best combination of suppliers. Gaballa <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[89]</ref> was the first author who applied this technique to vendor selection in a real case. He used a mixed integer programming model to formulate this decision making problem for the Australian Post Office. Until the publication of the survey proposed by Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>, only ten articles proposed the use of mathematical programming techniques. But since that time, subsequent work in this area has been made and a great number of studies were conducted considering different aspects and instances of the problem.</p><p>As highlighted in the beginning of this paper, when dealing with the supplier selection, a decision maker needs to decide generally what to buy, from whom and when. As a result, to classify the published models in the situation of multiple sourcing, two distinctions can be made. The former concerns the number of different purchased items and the latter concerns the scheduling horizon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Single and multiple item models</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref> show four major categories when considering the number of items purchased, recognizing two particularly important features: single or multiple products ordered and the presence of any form of quantity discount offered by vendors.</p><p>As stated earlier, various interdependencies could exist among the different products and taking into account the different advantages of the synergy generated by the multiple products models (e.g. reducing purchasing, ordering and transportation costs) is profitable both for buyer and supplier especially in presence of quantity discounts. On the other  <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>, NBS <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, Gainen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>, Waggener and Suzuki <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[90]</ref>, Austin and Hogan <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[91]</ref>, Turner <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[105]</ref>, Sharma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[106]</ref>, Crama et al. <ref type="bibr">[109]</ref> hand, when price break schedules that depend on the size of the order quantity placed are combined with the system's constraints, selecting orders quantities becomes a difficult problem to solve. Consequently, the simplest problems in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> are successively the single item and multiple item models without considering discounts and the more complex but more advantageous are those which consider a form of quantity discount while purchasing a range of products. Classical inventory models traditionally involve two main types of discounts structure: quantity discounts and business volume discounts. In the context of quantity discount, the sales volume of a product does not affect the prices and discounts of the other products. Such structure can be applied to single item models as well as multiple item models wherein products costs are considered independently, although they are offered by the same vendor. This class of discounting strategy can be either noncumulative (incremental) or cumulative (all-units) which is the case in the majority of practical situations. The earliest studies have used a modified form of the transportation problem to model bid evaluations for procurements at the US Department of Defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>. The linear programming model considers different forms of pricings including quantity discounts and prices that increase with order quantities. Waggener and Suzuki <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[90]</ref> use a similar model that is of a larger size and accounts for more pricing and supplier requirements scenarios. Later, Austin and Hogan <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[91]</ref> extended this model to a mixed integer program that account for cases where a supplier indicates a minimum acceptable quantity.</p><p>Gaballa <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[89]</ref> uses a mixed integer programming model to minimize total discounted price (all-units form) of allocated items to the vendors, under constraints of vendor's capacity and demand satisfaction. Pirkul and Aras <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[92]</ref> analyzed as well the problem of determining order quantities for multiple items in the presence of all-unit quantity discounts. The objective was to minimize the sum of aggregate purchasing costs, holding costs, and ordering costs subject to a linear resource constraint. They formulated their problem as a non linear program and developed a solution algorithm using Lagrangian relaxation. Besides, Chaudhry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[93]</ref> presented a mixed linear integer programming formulation to minimize the purchasing costs for individual items over a single period. The authors consider capacity constraints, delivery performance and quality with successively cumulative and noncumulative quantity discounts. An extension to goal programming was also proposed. Finally, in Tempelmeier's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>, suppliers offer for a single product all-units and/or incremental quantity discounts which may vary over time. As a result, Tempelmeier formulated an uncapacitated multi-supplier order quantity problem with time varying all-units discounts as a mixed integer linear optimization problem and an uncapacitated multi-supplier order quantity problem with time varying incremental discounts as a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem. A heuristic was developed for the resolution.</p><p>In the context of business volume discount, multi-item models are considered and a vendor offers discounts on the total dollar amount of sales volume, not on the quantity or variety of the products purchased. According to Sadrian and Yoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[94]</ref> and Katz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[95]</ref>, this strategy has many benefits to both vendors and buyers. However, the computational difficulties due to interdependence of product prices tied to a single discount schedule were the obstacle for buyers attempting to purchase needed products under the business volume discount strategy. Sadrian and Yoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[96]</ref> treated such form of discount by proposing a mixed integer programming model to optimize the total cost of purchases in the presence of business volume discounts for one period.</p><p>Apart from quantity discounts and business volume discounts, a third class of discount strategy dealt with in multiitem models is the bundling. It is a scheme wherein the price of an item depends on the order quantities of other items. This occurs when two or more related items are sold together as a bundle. Several studies have identified conditions under which bundling is profitable for the seller or when it needs to be avoided (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[97]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[98]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[99]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[101]</ref>).</p><p>Rosenthal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[102]</ref> were the first who applied bundling in the context of supplier selection. The authors developed a mixed linear integer programming to minimize purchasing costs over one period with constraints addressing vendor capacities, demand satisfaction, quality and delivery requirements. The authors proposed also as extension to export the idea of product bundling to an EOQ context. Later, Sarkis and Semple <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[103]</ref> suggested a reformulation of the problem proposed by Rosenthal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[102]</ref>. Thus, they significantly reduced the computational workload and eliminated some limitations and a paradox revealing a more cost effective purchasing strategy. Recently, Murthy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[104]</ref> addressed the buyer's vendor selection problem for make-to-order items where the goal is to minimize sourcing and purchasing costs in the presence of fixed costs, shared capacity constraints, shared setup costs, and volume-based discounts for bundles of items. Giving quotes in the form of single sealed bids or facing dynamic auction involving open bids, the model has to determine the best bid among those proposed or winners at each stage of a dynamic auction. Due to the complexity of the mixed integer programming formulated, a heuristic procedure based on the Lagrangian relaxation technique was developed to solve the problem.</p><p>Slight different discount schemes also exist in literature. Treating a vendor selection problem faced by British Coal, Turner <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[105]</ref> discussed three types of discounts: deferred rebates based on the total value of the order, deferred rebates based on the order quantity, and marginal discounts based on the total value of the order. The problem was formulated as a mixed integer program that minimizes total contract cost, and constrained by demand satisfaction, vendor capacities, minimum and maximum order quantities and geographic region purchasing restrictions. This model relaxed, however, any dependence of unit price on size of order quantity. The linear program was costly to solve, so a quasi-optimizing heuristic routine was adopted. Sharma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[106]</ref> proposed a nonlinear, mixed integer, goal programming model. They considered price, quality, delivery and service as goals. The cost goal was nonlinear and the total cost of purchased materials was inversely proportional to quantity purchased and lead time, but increased linearly as the quality level increased.</p><p>Related research work dealing with price breaks regimes when selecting suppliers, concerns not only discounts but also surcharges. Contrary to the discounts offers where unit price of a vendor declines as the order quantity placed increased, with surcharges, it increases. Such situation is faced whenever the ordered material is a scare source, like an energy product <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[107]</ref>. To our knowledge, only Chaudhry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[93]</ref> considered the presence of surcharge and focused on the impact of considering price break schedules (all-unit vs. incremental, and discounts vs. surcharges).</p><p>Finally, from our analysis of the works currently being reported for supplier selection we can conclude that considering price discounts is a decisive factor for selection and order quantity allocation. Effectively, it influences significantly the final decision that is why it has been considered in several studies combining the supplier selection issue with other features. By way of example, Ganeshan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[108]</ref> strike a balance between the use of just one supplier, and the perceived cost benefits of using several while considering reliability and discounts. Crama et al. <ref type="bibr">[109]</ref> presented also an interesting extension of the basic supplier selection problem that considers price discounts. It focused on procurement decisions in presence of total quantity discounts and alternative product recipes which increased the complexity of the problem. The authors consider a medium-term purchasing decision faced by a multi-plant chemical company. Assuming that each product made by the company can be processed according to several recipes, where each recipe specifies which proportion of each ingredient, the firm aims at simultaneously optimizing its procurement plan and its production plan while considering quantity discounts based on the total quantity of ingredients purchased over a year. They formulated the corresponding cost-minimization problem as a nonlinear mixed 0-1 programming problem and proposed various ways to linearize it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Single and multiple period models</head><p>Regarding the second distinction related to the third decision of the supplier selection problem (i.e., in which periods?), the vast majority of approaches that have been investigated up to now are single period models solving only a short term planning problem. In reality, when planning horizon covers several periods, the problem becomes harder, but has the potential to yield much better procurement plan by considering inventory management. This balances ordering costs and holding costs and permits to select the supplier with a low ordering cost when frequent ordering is necessary due to inventory management reasons (e.g., perishable inventory). In addition, this flexibility of deciding when to receive deliveries and how large they will be may significantly reduce ordering and purchasing costs especially whenever there are quantity discounts, by establishing a trade-off between receiving a quantity discount and the inventory holding costs when buying larger lot-sizes. Thereby, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> , we conclude that approaches developed to model supplier selection can be classified as single period models that do not consider inventory management over time and multi-period models which consider inventory management by determining an order sizing policy scheduling while selecting suppliers.</p><p>Multi-period inventory lot-sizing has been one of the most studied problems in production and inventory management literature. Bahl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[129]</ref> proposed an interesting review of related literature providing four categories for classifying works in this area: (1) single-level unconstrained resources, (2) single-level constrained resources, (3) multiple-level constrained resources, and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>, NBS <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, Gainen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>, Oliver <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[118]</ref>, Waggener and Suzuki <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[90]</ref>, Rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[119]</ref>, Chappell <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[120]</ref>, Williams and Redwood <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[121]</ref>, Gaballa <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[89]</ref>, Austin and Hogan <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[91]</ref>, Pirkul and Aras <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[92]</ref>, Narasimhan and Stoynoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[123]</ref>, Turner <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[105]</ref>, Pan <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[111]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[127]</ref>,Tempelmeier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>, Basnet and Leung <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[128]</ref> material structure where dependency of requirements exists, and constrained resources refer to production capacity limitations. To our knowledge, level dependencies have not been considered in supplier selection problems to date.</p><p>In the survey proposed by Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>, 14 papers that use the Economic Order Quantity concept in supplier selection have been identified. More recently, Rosenblatt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[114]</ref> have used the EOQ model to develop a nonlinear program for finding optimal supplier selection and order quantities for a single item. They have assumed that a supplierdependent fixed cost will be incurred whenever a supplier is chosen. Ghodsypour and O'Brien <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[115]</ref> also used the EOQ concept in a single item model. Assuming that the supplier's lots arrive one after the former one is used up, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model to minimize the total annual cost of logistics is proposed. It includes aggregate price, ordering, and inventory costs, subject to suppliers' capacity constraints and buyers' demand and limitations on budget and quality. The authors also discussed a second multiple objective programming approach to take into account different weights for various criteria. In a similar vein, being an extension of Weber's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[112]</ref>, Liao and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[117]</ref> proposed a multiobjective program for a single item model under the assumption that all suppliers' lots simultaneously arrive at the beginning of each replenishment period. The objectives are the minimization of the total cost, the total quality rejection and the total delivery late while the constraints concern the capacity and demand satisfaction. To deal with the multiobjective optimization, a Genetic Algorithm was applied. Further, two-objective and three-objective optimization results are compared to Weber's studies, which prove GA satisfying in solving such a problem.</p><p>Included in the stream of researches integrating supplier selection and procurement lot sizing are works by Oliver <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[118]</ref>, Rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[119]</ref>, Chappell <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[120]</ref>, Williams and Redwood <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[121]</ref>, Anthony and Buffa <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[130]</ref>, Buffa and Jackson <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[110]</ref>, Bender et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[122]</ref>, Pan <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[111]</ref>, Tempelmeier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> and Basnet and Leung <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[128]</ref>. These works do not consider EOQ concept to carry out procurement lot sizing decisions. Instead, they consider a multi-period planning horizon and define variables to determine the quantity purchased in each elementary period. Several works are based on a modified version of the linear programming transportation model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[118]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[119]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[120]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[121]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">130]</ref>).</p><p>Buffa and Jackson <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[110]</ref> presented a schedule purchase for a single product over a defined planning horizon via a goal programming model considering price, quality and delivery criteria.

The authors described, but not developed, a mixed integer optimization model, to minimize the sum of purchasing, transportation and inventory costs over the planning horizon, without exceeding vendor production capacities and various policy constraints.</p><p>Contrary to single period models dealing with any form of price discount, by considering inventory management in a multi-period horizon planning, Tempelmeier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> incorporates a trade-off between ordering larger quantities to get a reduction on purchasing costs and maintaining low inventories to minimize holding costs.</p><p>Basnet and Leung <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[128]</ref> balance ordering and holding costs in a multi-item model by considering a multi-period scheduling horizon. They proposed an uncapacitated mixed linear integer programming that minimizes the aggregate purchasing, ordering and holding costs subject to demand satisfaction. The authors proposed an enumerative search algorithm and a heuristic to solve the problem.</p><p>Finally, we should highlight that only Tempelmeier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> proposed a planning model for supporting short-term selection and order sizing under time varying parameters (dynamic demand and time-varying price discounts). Due to time dependency too, Hong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[131]</ref> divided the analyzed period into several meaningful period units. An elementary period is defined as a period in which a sales environment can be distinguished from that of a previous period.</p><p>Indeed, almost all multi-period models do not consider any time depending (dynamic) parameter and assume them to be constant. However, due to multiple reasons such as market environments added to changes of production and delivery parameters and/or conditions, suppliers' capabilities and buyer's requirements may change over the periods. In fact, it is difficult to maintain the same capability condition during all supply periods especially in types of industries which have seasonal demands and have a wide fluctuation of capability condition over time. Talluri and Sarkis <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[132]</ref> report on a case where performance of a selected supplier is monitored across 18 time periods using DEA. They indicate that the supplier's efficiency changed from on period of time to another.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Technique-oriented classification</head><p>By considering the analysis of the above studies concerning the multiple sourcing supplier selection, it can be concluded that apart from the two above distinctions (single item/multi-item and single period/multi-period), we can of transforming them to a common unit of measurement. They also added that such techniques present the decision maker with a set of or nondominated solutions. Consequently, it permits the decision maker to incorporate personal experience and insight in making final decisions. The literature analysis shows also that multi-objective techniques provide a methodology to analyze the impacts of decisions that entail a reordering of priorities on firm's objectives.</p><p>As pointed out by Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[112]</ref>, the proposed mathematical approaches to model supplier selection include two kinds of constraints: system and policy constraints. System constraints are defined as those that are not directly under the control of the purchasing firm whereas policy constraints are those which the purchasing department can directly influence.</p><p>In addition to the single objective models quality and total late requirements constraints, system constraints can also include:</p><p>• supplier capacities, • buyer's storage capacity, • demand satisfaction,</p><p>• minimum order quantities established by the suppliers, • price breaks, • limitation of purchasing budget.</p><p>Policy constraints may include depending on the firm's strategy:</p><p>• minimum and/or maximum number of suppliers selected, • minimum and/or maximum order quantities placed with suppliers,</p><p>• geographic preferences and regional allocated bounds, • safety stock. Some constraints may be ignored or fall into either of the constraint categories depending upon the purchasing context or policy. By way of example, we point out that some models do not consider the supplier capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">128]</ref>. In this situation, selecting suppliers and allocating orders are only imposed by factors such as quality and led time requirements, minimum of suppliers to be selected, minimizing order and holding costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.">Alternative models 3.2.4.1. Total cost of ownership (TCO) models</head><p>As stated earlier when we introduced the total cost approaches, TCObased models attempt to include all quantifiable costs in the vendor choice process that are incurred throughout the purchased item's life cycle. Ellram <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[137]</ref> introduces the concept of TCO as applied to purchasing. She also compares TCO to other purchasing framework and provides TCO model examples for supplier evaluation and selection. Degraeve's et al. studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">139,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13]</ref> are the main works that proposed mathematical programming models that minimize the total cost of ownership. These models are based on the activities and cost drivers determined by an ABC system that allows including all relevant costs categories.</p><p>Degraeve and Roodhooft <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[139]</ref> recognized three hierarchical levels in the decision support system to describe the supplementary activities caused by the suppliers:</p><p>(1) The supplier level activities that include costs assigned to a supplier whenever he is used over the time horizon considered in the procurement decision. (2) The order level activities including costs incurred each time an order is placed with a supplier.</p><p>(3) The unit level activities where costs for the individual units of the products are considered. Degraeve and Roodhooft <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[138]</ref> recognized also a fourth level related to specific batches. Using these levels, the authors proposed formulations to select suppliers and determine order quantities over a multi-period time horizon for a single item in <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[138]</ref> and for a range of items in <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[139]</ref>. In a similar vein, Degraeve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> developed a TCO based mathematical programming model that selects suppliers of a multiple item service and simultaneously determines market shares of the suppliers selected.</p><p>Note that such models reduce subjectivity by indicating and quantifying the supplementary activities caused by the suppliers. Furthermore, the quantification of criteria and the trade-off between them is no longer a problem because the objective function is defined with respect to the purchasing decisions caused by the vendor. Nevertheless, we should add that supplier selection models using ABC are more costly to implement than traditional approaches. However, experience shows that the incremental cost of data gathering for ABC systems is often overestimated and that firms have implemented it at acceptable cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[140]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.2.">Integrated models</head><p>Another stream of research suggests considering both quantitative and qualitative measures to better model the multi-criteria nature of the decision. Ghodsypour and O'Brien <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[133]</ref>, Benyoucef et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[141]</ref> and recently Hong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[131]</ref> proposed such global approaches. They are achieved in two phases. At first, a supplier evaluation is elaborated using a multi-criteria tool. In the first three above references, the AHP method was applied to make the trade-off between tangible and intangible factors and calculate a rating of suppliers. As for Hong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[131]</ref>, they apply a CA to segment and select candidate groups by periods in time in the prequalification step (the paper treated the entire selection process).</p><p>The second stage of these global approaches consists of effectively selecting the suppliers and allocating orders using mathematical programming to take into account the system constraints. Thereby, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[133]</ref>, calculated ratings are applied as coefficients of an objective function in a linear program such that the total value of purchasing becomes a maximum. This single period single item model was constrained by the demand, capacity and quality requirements. Likewise, Benyoucef et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref> proposed a multi-period single item mixed integer programming model that has a similar objective function. The formulation considered constraints treating the requested demand, quality and lead time satisfaction, and the minimum and maximum ordered quantity.</p><p>In addition to a goal that maximizes the total value of purchase (AHP ratings input), Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[141]</ref> considered a second goal that minimizes the total cost of purchase. The resulted preemptive goal programming determines the optimal order quantity from the chosen suppliers considering as constraints vendor capacities and demand requirements.</p><p>As for <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[131]</ref>, after dividing suppliers into several groups having similar features of supply conditions during each elementary period in the previous step, each group may satisfy some criteria of procurement condition in time t but may not satisfy all the conditions. Consequently, the authors attempt to maximize the revenue by assigning more suppliers of the group which meets the procurement conditions than for those of other groups. The authors propose a mixed integer program to find the optimal solution and assign orders while maximizing the revenue and satisfying the procurement conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.3.">Efficiency-based vendor selection and negotiation models</head><p>At this stage, we turn our attention towards the vendor evaluation and negotiation models provided in the literature. Miller and Kelle <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[142]</ref> contend that limited research have been paid to supplier negotiation. Weber and Desai <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref> have shown how DEA can be used as a tool for negotiation with inefficient suppliers. Subsequently, a series of studies was conducted to integrate the process of supplier selection and negotiation in multiple sourcing contexts based on a DEA model by Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">144]</ref>. In this first paper, both multi-objective programming (MOP) and DEA are used and three approaches for the selection and negotiation are described. In a first stage, using the MOP model proposed by Weber and Current <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[112]</ref> the set of selected and not selected suppliers are identified. Then, a negotiation is established with vendors which have not been selected by the MOP model in order to become part of the solution set. In the second paper, the MOP and DEA are used a similar problem solving approach to evaluate the number of vendors a firm may wish to employ to supply a product or a service. The approach advocates developing vendor-order quantity solution (referred to as supervendor) using MOP and then evaluating the efficiency of these supervendors on multiple criteria using DEA.</p><p>Although Weber's et al. studies provided innovative ways of approaching the vendor evaluation and negotiation problem, it has certain limitations. It only allows for negotiation with inefficient vendors. In order to overcome these limitations, Talluri <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[134]</ref> proposes a buyer-seller game model minimizing the efficiency for evaluation, selection and negotiation. It evaluates the efficiency of alternative bids, with respect to the ideal targets set by the buyer. Effective negotiation strategies have also been proposed in order to make the unselected bids competitive. Four variations of the model are developed also to assist the buyer in different types of purchasing situations. The model evaluations are integrated into a 0-1 integer programming formulation in determining the optimal set of vendors to be selected in meeting the demand requirements without violating the minimum order necessities of the vendors. Zhu <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[145]</ref> shows that Talluri's model is closely related to DEA and can be simplified. The paper presents a new buyer-seller game model where the efficiency is maximized with respect to multiple targets set by the buyer. It allows the buyer to evaluate and select the vendors in the context of best practice. By both minimizing and maximizing the efficiency, the buyer can obtain an efficiency range within which the true efficiency lies given the implicit trade-off information characterized by the targets.</p><p>Recently, Cakravastia and Nakamura <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[146]</ref> proposed an integrated supplier selection and negotiation process for multiple parts/materials procurement. Their study aims at integrating decisions in the internal supply chain of a maketo-order manufacturer. During the negotiation process, two main decisions are considered: the manufacturing planning decision responsible for determining the production schedule and fabrication lot size and the supplier selection decision concerning which suppliers are selected for company business and the order volume allocated to each selected supplier. The model is designed to support the negotiation process by generating a set of effective alternatives to support the decision-maker in each negotiation period. Its structure is multi-objective and non-linear. The set of effective alternatives is generated by a combination of the interactive weighted Tchebycheff method and Benders decomposition method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.4.">Stochastic models</head><p>In a decision making situation like vendor selection, high degree of uncertainties and fuzziness are involved in the data set and the different parameters and stages of the problem. Although in real-life the problem is stochastic, almost all supplier selection approaches in the literature assume parameters to be deterministic and known. Only a very limited number of studies took into account the stochastic and uncertain nature of multiple sourcing supplier selection. Horowitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[147]</ref> considers a two-source purchasing problem. While, the first source offers the product with a known price, the second source's price is uncertain. Horowitz explains why it is rational for a buyer to purchase a positive amount from the supplier that offers higher prices.</p><p>Dasgupta and Spulber <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[148]</ref> study both single and multiple sourcing scenarios. They construct an auction model and assume that the buyer knows the suppliers cost information only after they submit their bids. They identify optimal auction mechanisms that maximize the buyers expected gain subject to the condition that the mechanisms are perceived to be fair and rational by the suppliers.</p><p>Kasilingam and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[124]</ref> handled this aspect in a multiple item single period model that considers a normally distributed demand. The authors develop of a chance-constrained integer programming formulation to address the vendor selection and order allocation by minimizing costs due to receiving poor quality, purchasing and transportation, and the fixed cost of establishing vendors. Their model also considers the lead time requirements and vendors'capacities and uses a chance constraint to model the stochastic nature of demand.</p><p>Addressing the issue of achieving quality by concurrent tolerance design and supplier selection, Feng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref> use the stochastic integer programming (SIP) to model the relationship between manufacturing cost, quality loss cost, assembly yield, and discrete tolerances. Process capability indices and quality loss functions were incorporated also in one optimization model to achieve the required quality level and the minimum total cost of manufacturing and quality loss.</p><p>Bonser and Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[127]</ref> model a multi-source fuel procurement for an electrical utilities firm. The firm has a main supply source, arranged through a yearly contract to buy a minimum fuel amount, and has the option to purchase additional amounts through the spot market. The authors consider both demand and price uncertainty and develop a stochastic program to find the optimal purchasing strategy.</p><p>Several other works have also considered the uncertainty in supplier selection processes. Ronen and Trietsch <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[149]</ref> proposed a statistical multiple item model taking into account inventory management over time and assuming the distribution of the lead time to be a known exponential distribution. They develop a decision support system for supplier choice and ordering policy in the context of a large project. Seshadri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[150]</ref> develop a probabilistic model to represent the connection between multiple sourcing and its consequences such as number of bids, the seller's profit and buyer's price. Only one criterion, cost, is considered and the authors stated that the user should transfer the other criteria like quality, delivery etc., into an equivalent price. They consider the scenario where suppliers do not know how many other suppliers are also bidding, their production cost as well as the other bidders'production costs. Seshadri <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[151]</ref> looks at the merits of dual sourcing over single sourcing under similar assumptions on the procurement environment. Laffont and Tirol <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[152]</ref> and Stole <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[153]</ref> investigate two-period procurement situations where the buyer has the option to procure from a second source.</p><p>As in single sourcing contexts, Fuzzy Set Theory has also been used to select a set of suppliers. Kumar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[154]</ref> propose a fuzzy mixed integer goal programming formulation to handle the vagueness and imprecision in the statement of the objectives in a single item single period model. The problem considers three fuzzy goals: minimizing the net cost, minimizing the net rejection and minimizing the net late delivery. It included realistic constraints regarding buyer's demand, vendors' capacity, vendors' quota flexibility, total purchase value for all the ordered quantities and restriction on the purchase budget.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Purchasing for services</head><p>The major difference between parts and services purchasing is that services cannot be 'stored' and so there are no inventory costs associated with service purchasing. Here we will only report on quantitative models for service supplier selection. A brief review of the literature that discusses general ideas and case studies related to services purchasing can be found in Degraeve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. Unlike the case of parts purchasing, we found that there is only a limited number of studies that model the service supplier selection problem. Most of these studies use some form of an auction to model, often using mathematical programming techniques, or experiment with the service procurement process. Elmaghraby <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[155]</ref> provides an overview of auction based procurement strategies that have been studied in the operations research and economics literature.</p><p>Auction environments allow the sellers and buyers to compete where the former would offer their services at charges that are in line with the latter's cost and savings information. One of the earliest works in this area is that by Grether et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[156]</ref> where they look at the problem of allocating airport time slots to airlines. They propose a two stage mechanism: (1) time slots are first procured through a competitive sealed-bid auction that does not take into account slot demand interdependencies and (2) an airlines can sell and purchase time slots on a "after market" basis to support their actual demand needs. Rassenti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[157]</ref> point out some disadvantages of this two-stage policy that stem mostly from the inefficiency of the "after market" stage. They propose instead a combinatorial sealed-bid auction that would account for airlines schedule needs. Since then auctions models have been proposed and applied in several service environments: Franchises <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[158,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">159]</ref>, public services <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[160,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">161]</ref>, space station services <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[162]</ref>, rail tracks <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">164]</ref> and transportation services <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[165,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">166]</ref>.</p><p>Mixed integer programming models have also been used to find the optimal supplier mix in a service environment. Oliveira and Lourenço <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref> discuss the problem of selecting suppliers for the construction of pipeline networks for gas distribution. They develop a multi-source and multi-period model that allocated construction orders to a pool of pre-qualified set of suppliers. They also allow for the possibility of new suppliers to the pre-selected pool. As mentioned earlier, Degraeve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> use the concept of a total cost of ownership to select airlines for a major company. They develop a large complex mixed integer program that accounts for several airline fair discounting schemed. Finally, Klundert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[167]</ref> report on a model for selecting international telecommunication carriers for a major telecommunication service provider. They account for volume discounts and show that a special case of their model results in a min-cost flow model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Recent trends</head><p>As is the case for most other supply chain processes, the availability of internet and its related information technology is having an increasing influence on the way purchasing operations are being conducted. Internet-based procurement, henceforth referred to as e-procurement, offers both buyers and suppliers access to a wider set of options for conducting their procurement relationships. Several types of e-procurement markets have been setup that handle noncritical products such as industrial chemicals and metals and printed circuit boards. Auctions are one of the most common mechanisms for running these markets. The literature on auctions theory, examples of which were described in the previous section, has mostly focused on a auctioning a single item. With the rise in the adoption of e-procurements auctions, where a company may order a combination of products, research on multi-item auctions is expected to increase. Recent surveys of auction theory can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">169]</ref>.</p><p>The literature on the modeling of e-procurement is still in its infancy. <ref type="bibr">Barua et al. [170]</ref> propose an analytical model for selecting suppliers on the internet. They account for supplier search, communication and evaluation costs and provide insights as to when a sequential evaluation or a bidding process should be adopted. Teich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[171]</ref> propose algorithms for running multi-attribute electronic auctions. A literature review on multiple attribute auctions can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[172]</ref>. Peleg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1]</ref> study three scenarios: (1) long-term single-source relationship (2) short-term e-procurement relationship and (3) a combination of the first two strategies. They also find the optimal number suppliers to evaluate in the case when e-procurement is used. Kleindorfer and Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[173]</ref> review several frameworks that have been suggested for managing e-procurement. Scott and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[174]</ref> develop both single and multiple objective models for operating e-procurement marketplaces. In their model they investigate the case where a brick-and-mortar marketplace is used and allow for dual sourcing. Buhler and Kalagnanam <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[175]</ref> discuss a multi-attribute auction with multiple sources. They propose a mixed integer program and allow for the supplier to offer different bid configuration, such as different discount level based on each attribute. Wu and Kleindorfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[176]</ref> look at the case where a buyer has access to multiple suppliers either through long-term contracting or the spot market. They investigate the problem of finding the best mix of contracting and spot buying.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and suggestions for future research</head><p>In recent years, the purchasing function has been seen by many managers as a key strategic tool in the firm's attempt to achieve positional competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[177]</ref>. Moreover, as more manufacturing organizations adopt total quality management and just-in-time concepts, the role of suppliers and supply chain management becomes even more important <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>. Consequently, subsequent work in this area has been done. Several researches have addressed the strategic importance of the vendor evaluation and selection over the last three decades, emphasizing the impact of such decisions on various functional areas of a business from procurement to production and delivery of the products to the final customer. Great attention has also been paid to develop decision models as well as decision support tools, dealing with the different aspects and stages of the buying process. In a recent study, De Boer and Van der Wegen <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> attempt to assess the perceived merit of using such formal decision tools and approaches for selection in practice by investigating the receptivity of decision makers to their use. So, applying a range of techniques in the different phases of previously solved supplier selection instances, they compared decision situations in which a formal decision tool is used with a situation in which this is not the case. The experiments reveal that formal decision models may prove to be useful in various ways throughout the whole supplier selection process and in different purchasing situations. This paper presents an up-to-date comprehensive literature review of the supplier selection. First, the main features buying process were summarized. In view of its complexity, we then focus thoroughly on the final selection step identifying different distinctions and proposing classifications of the published works.</p><p>The analysis of the decision models provided useful information and enabled us to find some gaps in the literature. First of all, given the recent rise in outsourcing, it is somewhat surprising how little attention has been paid to the purchase of services. The vast majority of the publications found seem to have been written in the context of selecting suppliers for the purchase of raw materials and products to be used in a manufacturing environment. Secondly, we point out that most of the existing papers propose decision models for the final choice phase and only few works treat the previous steps, especially those of problem and criteria formulation. However, the quality of the choice phase is largely dependent on the quality of the steps prior to that phase. Thirdly, we observed that mathematical programming is the most frequently used approach. This can be explained by the fact that MP models are more objective than rating models because they 'force' the decision maker to explicitly state the objective function. As shown numerically by Benyoucef et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, the mathematical approach was the best selection method which takes into account all the constraints. The comparison of the published approaches' relative efficiency using the total cost of ownership concept elaborated by Degraeve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> also reveals that, for their specific case study, mathematical programming models outperform rating models. Unlike mathematical programming, weighting models cannot guarantee an optimal solution to any instance of the supplier selection problem while incorporating relevant constraints.</p><p>Several conclusions can be drawn from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> . A first remark concerns the techniques used. Although many researchers such as Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">112]</ref> and Karpak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[126]</ref> contend that MOP and GP have the potential to yield much better solutions due to their ability to make a trade-off between the different and sometimes conflicting criteria, mixed integer programming is the most frequently used technique. Unlike MOP and GP models, MIP was used to model many complicating features such as quantity discounts, integration of inventory management and multiple item purchasing.</p><p>The experiments presented by Degraeve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> confirmed that multiple item models generate better results than single item models as well as the incorporation of inventory management. Nevertheless, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and highlighted by Tempelmeier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> and Basnet and Leung <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[128]</ref>, most of the works that have been done so far concentrate Stanley <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>, NBS on isolated aspects of the complete problem. Several assumptions are frequently set in order to reduce its complexity. Indeed, specialized solution algorithms are developed which cannot be applicable in other sourcing situations. Finally, given the rise in outsourcing, e-procurement, and the wide adoption of supplier relationship management modules as part of enterprise resource planning systems, thus facilitating the access to supplier related data, we expect that the demand for research in the area of supplier selection will only increase. Here we cite some of the major research venues that we think merit the attention of the operations research/management community:</p><p>• Development of efficient algorithms for complex lot sizing and supplier selection environments such as the case of multi-item multi-period models with different supplier-purchase coordination/incentive mechanisms. As is the case for the work of Tempelmeier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>, such algorithms would find direct application in supply chain execution software packages. • Incorporating the supplier selection decisions in a negotiation process where both of the buyer and seller points of view can be taken into account. Most of the existing literature focuses only on the buyer's side. • Although the theory of auctions has been mostly driven by research from economists (in fact most previous literature surveys on purchasing failed to review auction-based studies), the operations research community is becoming more active in this field. Research on combinatorial auctions where a buyer can choose a collection of items under different preferences and supplier conditions is a promising and challenging research area. • Given the increasing awareness of firms for the need to coordinate activities and processes beyond the boundary of their company, it would be interesting to investigate the role of coordination mechanisms on the selection of suppliers. The traditional cost-based models assumptions may not hold in such context as in a coordination framework nonminimum cost alternatives may be chosen by one supply chain partner in favor of maximizing the overall chain's profit.</p><p>• As precise and deterministic information is generally not available for designing and managing a supply chain, it is necessary to thus necessary to develop models which can consider the stochastic elements such as uncertainty in demand, probabilistic behaviors of the potential suppliers and unknown performances of potential new ones. • In these recent years, some artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches such as case-based-reasoning systems, neural networks and expert systems were developed for the prequalification and final selection of suppliers. Their ability to mimic the human judgment processes makes these techniques promising for possible applications in purchasing and negotiation management.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple objective techniques:</head><p>• Multi-objective programming method: Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[112]</ref>, Ghodsypour and O'Brien <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[115]</ref>, Liao and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[117]</ref>.</p><p>• Goal programming method: Buffa and Jackson <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[110]</ref>, Sharma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[106]</ref>, Chaudhry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[93]</ref>, Karpak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[126]</ref>.</p><p>• Other: Siying et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[135]</ref> who used neural networks.</p><p>All of the above mentioned single objective programming methods aim at minimizing costs. Depending on model's type, they mainly include: purchasing price, fixed cost of establishing a vendor, price breaks, and inventory costs for multi-period models. Some penalties related to poor quality, shortage or inefficient utilization of supplier capacities are also taken into account in some approaches. We should note that only Current and Weber <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[113]</ref>, which demonstrated that the vendor selection problem may be formulated within the mathematical constructs of facility location modeling, consider minimizing the number of suppliers used. We remark too that very little attention has been paid to transportation costs in the published works. For example, Kasilingam and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[124]</ref> had only incorporated the unit transportation cost from the vendor in the product unit price and Ding et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[136]</ref> consider the different transportation links between the supplier and the warehouse.</p><p>By its nature, in single objective models only one criterion is considered as objective function. The other relevant criteria such as quality and led-time are modeled as constraints. In this situation the criteria which are considered as constraints are weighted equally which rarely happens in practice because decision makers often prioritize their criteria differently. Moreover, as pointed out by Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[112]</ref>, the trade-off between conflicting criteria cannot be apparent. To overcome these limitations and provide a more robust method addressing the multi-criteria nature of the decision, some researches suggest the use of multi-objective programming and goal programming methods. As no one solution exists which is optimal for all of the objectives, such methods aim at minimizing deviations from each goal, in order of priority. Higher priority goals are satisfied at the expense of lower priority goals.</p><p>Many studies such as Weber's work in 1993 <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[112]</ref>, that was the first to introduce a multi-objective programming model for supplier selection, affirm that this alternative has several advantages over single objective analysis. The authors assert that it allows the various criteria to be evaluated in their natural units of measurement (e.g., cost per delivered unit, percent of nonconforming units, percent of units delivered on time) and therefore, eliminates the necessity</p></div>			</div>
