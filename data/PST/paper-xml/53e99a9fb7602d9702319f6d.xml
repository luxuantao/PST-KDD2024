<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction. The flow of an incompressible fluid is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">u t -νΔu + (u • ∇)u + ∇p = f in (0, T ] × Ω, ∇ • u = 0 in [0, T ] × Ω, u = 0 in [0, T ] × ∂Ω, u(0, x) = u 0 in Ω, Ω p dx = 0, in (0, T ]. (1.1)</formula><p>Here, Ω ⊂ R d , d ∈ {2, 3}, is a bounded domain with boundary ∂Ω, [0, T ] a finite time interval, u(t, x) the fluid velocity, and p(t, x) the fluid pressure. The parameters in <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref> are the viscosity ν &gt; 0, which is inverse proportional to the Reynolds number Re = O(ν -1 ), the prescribed body forces f (t, x), and the initial velocity field u 0 (x).</p><p>Turbulent flows are characterized by a high Reynolds number. Due to the richness of scales in such flows, it is not possible to simulate them by a direct discretization of (1.1), e.g., by a Galerkin finite element method. The use of a turbulence model becomes necessary.</p><p>A currently very popular approach of turbulence modeling is large eddy simulation (LES). In LES, one seeks to simulate only the large scales of a turbulent flow accurately. This makes sense in applications, e.g., the prediction of a hurricane requires above all an accurate prediction of the few large eddies and not of the millions of small eddies. In classical LES, the large scales are defined by an averaging in space. However, this definition leads to serious problems if the flow is given in a bounded domain, which is the most frequent case in applications. Already the first step of deriving equations for the large scales introduces additional terms, so-called commutation errors; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref> for analysis of two kinds of commutation errors. The commutation errors are simply neglected in applications. Consider, e.g., the commutation error studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>; its analysis shows that there are cases where it does not vanish asymptotically. A second serious problem of the classical LES in bounded domains is the definition of appropriate boundary conditions for the large scales. This problem is unresolved. In applications, often physically motivated wall laws are used. A possible remedy for this dilemma is the definition of the large scales in a different way, namely, by projection into appropriate spaces. This idea is the basis of variational multiscale methods (VMS); see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. VMS is part of a circle of ideas including the dynamic multilevel method by Dubois, Jauberteau, and Temam <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> and the additive turbulent decomposition; see <ref type="bibr">Hylin and McDonough [15]</ref>. These approaches are related in spirit and philosophy but each has its own unique features.</p><p>Following Collis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, the flow can be decomposed into three scales:</p><p>• (resolved) large scales,</p><p>• (resolved) small scales, and • unresolved scales. A VMS starts by writing the Navier-Stokes equations (1.1) as a coupled system of three equations for the three types of scales. Then, the equation for the unresolved scales is neglected and the equation for the resolved small scales will be modeled with a turbulence model; see section 3. In this way, the turbulence model acts directly only on the resolved small scales and it acts solely indirectly on the large scales by the coupling of the two remaining equations. One crucial point of a VMS is the definition of appropriate spaces which define the large scales and the resolved small scales. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, it is proposed to use a standard finite element space for the large scales and mesh cell bubbles for the resolved small scales. This resembles the idea of the residual free bubble approach for discretizing scalar convection-diffusion equations; e.g., see Brezzi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The advantage of this approach is that the equations for the resolved small scales can be solved mesh cell by mesh cell. However, using this approach in a VMS imposes the assumption that the resolved small scales exist only in the interior of mesh cells and they do not cross mesh cell faces. If the mesh is stationary, then the resolved scales are also stationary in some sense. They can change only within the mesh cells. It seems to be unlikely that this correctly reflects the behavior of the resolved small scales. An important feature of the VMS presented in this paper is that it does not have such an restriction. It allows the resolved small scales to move across faces of mesh cells.</p><p>In the VMS considered in this paper, a variationally consistent eddy viscosity turbulence model is introduced acting only on the discrete resolved small scales (fluctuations). This technique is inspired by Guermond <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and Layton <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. It can be also thought of as an extension of the spectral vanishing viscosity idea of Maday and Tadmor <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. The VMS studied in the present paper is an extension of an approach for scalar convection-diffusion equations which can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. It will be introduced in section 2. In contrast to the proposal in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, it starts with a pair of finite element spaces which represents all resolved scales. There is one term where the turbulence model acts on all resolved scales. Then, a large scale space is chosen and in a second term, the action of the turbulence model on the large scales is subtracted again. The connection of this VMS to the VMS proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> is given in section 3. Section 4 derives conditions on the large scale space under which the VMS can be implemented easily and efficiently into an existing finite element code for Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, section 5 presents numerical studies with the VMS. Downloaded 12/30/12 to 139.184.30.136. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php 2. The VMS method. Throughout this paper, standard notations for Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces are used; e.g., see Adams <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The inner product in (L</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2 (Ω)) d , d ∈ N, is denoted by (•, •). Let V = (H 1 0 (Ω)) d equipped with the norm v V = ∇v L 2 and Q = L 2 0 (Ω). A variational formulation of (1.1) reads as follows. Find u : [0, T ] → V , p : (0, T ] → Q satisfying (u t , v) + (2νD(u), D(v)) + b(u, u, v) -(p, ∇ • v) = (f , v) ∀v ∈ V, (q, ∇ • u) = 0 ∀q ∈ Q, (2.1)</formula><p>and u(0, x) = u 0 (x) ∈ V . Here, D(v) = (∇v + ∇v T )/2 is the velocity deformation tensor and b(u, v, w) = ((u • ∇)v, w). For the continuous problem, (2.1) is equivalent to a variational formulation where the viscous term has the form (ν∇u, ∇v).</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, a Galerkin finite element discretization of (2.1) is unstable in the case of small viscosity (or high Reynolds number). A stabilization becomes necessary, which can be done, e.g., by introducing a turbulence model in (2.1). We consider the extension of an approach which was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> for scalar convection-diffusion equations.</p><p>To keep the presentation concise, we will present the approach immediately for the semidiscrete problem. Let V h ⊂ V and Q h ⊂ Q be conforming finite element spaces which fulfill the inf-sup condition, i.e., there is a positive constant C independent of the mesh size parameter h such that inf</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q h ∈Q h sup v h ∈V h (∇ • v h , q h ) ∇v h L 2 q h L 2 ≥ C. (2.2) In addition, let L H ⊂ L = {L ∈ (L 2 (Ω)) d×d , L = L T } and ν T = ν T (t, x, u h , p h ) ≥ 0.</formula><p>The semidiscrete problem (continuous in time) which we consider reads as follows.</p><p>Find</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u h : [0, T ] → V h , p h : (0, T ] → Q h and G H : [0, T ] → L H satisfying (u h t , v h ) + ((2ν + ν T )D(u h ), D(v h )) + b(u h , u h , v h ) -(p h , ∇ • v h ) -(ν T G H , D(v h )) = (f , v h ) ∀v h ∈ V h , (q h , ∇ • u h ) = 0 ∀q h ∈ Q h , (G H -D(u h ), L H ) = 0 ∀L H ∈ L H , (<label>2.3)</label></formula><p>and u h (0, x) = u h 0 ∈ V h is a discretely divergence-free approximation to u 0 . Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P L H : L → L H , D(v) → P L H D(v) with (P L H D(v) -D(v), L H ) = 0 ∀L H ∈ L H (2.4) denote the L 2 -projection from L onto L H . Then G H = P L H D(u h ) in (2.3).</formula><p>The model within system (2.3) is determined by the choices of L H and ν T . The space L H can be thought of as representing the large scales of the flow. Then, the application of ν T in (2.3) can be interpreted as follows. In the viscous term (the second term in the first equation), the model (stabilization) is added to all scales, whereas in the last term of the left-hand side of the first equation, it is subtracted again for the large scales. Thus, the model, which is the only stabilization in the scheme, acts only on the small scales. This is exactly the main idea of the VMS of Hughes, Mazzei, and Jansen <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. In this sense, (2.3) is a VMS; see the following section for a discussion of the connection of (2.3) to the VMS proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p><p>A finite element error analysis of the VMS (2.3) for the case that ν T is a constant is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Downloaded 12/30/12 to 139.184.30.136. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. We consider the threelevel partitioning of the flow given in the introduction. This partitioning will now be described by appropriate chosen function spaces. Clearly, the continuous pair of spaces (V, Q) contains all scales. The finite element spaces (V h , Q h ) contain the large and the resolved small scales. Let V H ∈ (H 1 (Ω)) d be a discrete space such that L H = D(V H ). The space V H should be coarser than V h in the sense that the piecewise polynomial degree of V H is less than the piecewise polynomial degree of V h . The functions of V H may be defined on the same grid as the functions of V h or on a coarser grid. But in the definition of V H no boundary conditions, like noslip conditions, are incorporated. Thus, in general V H ⊂ V h . The large eddies of a turbulent flow generally do not fulfill no-slip boundary conditions, e.g., the large eddies of a hurricane move along the surface of the earth. Thus, it make sense not to incorporate such boundary conditions into the definition of V H . The pair of spaces for the large scales is given by (V H , Q H ), where Q H is chosen such that an inf-sup condition of type (2.2) is fulfilled for (V H , Q H ). The large scales P H u of the velocity are defined by an elliptic projection into V H and the large scales P H p of the pressure by the L 2 -projection into</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Aspects of the implementation.</head><p>This section describes some aspects of implementing (2.3) into a finite element code. One has two options for defining the large scale space L H . The first option is to define L H on a coarser grid than (V h , Q h ). Since, we will use higher order finite element spaces for (V h , Q h ), there is as second option to define L H on the same grid as (V h , Q h ) using lower order polynomials. We will use the second way. It will be shown that in this case an efficient implementation with only small modifications of an existing code for solving the Navier-Stokes equations is possible if L H is a discontinuous finite element space with a L 2 -orthogonal basis.

(4.6)</formula><p>For a nonorthogonal basis, one can use the approximation (diag(M )) -1 instead of M -1 or some other diagonal matrix which is derived from M , e.g., by adding all matrix entries in a row to the diagonal.</p><p>Second, the sparsity pattern of Ãαβ must not be larger than the sparsity pattern of A αβ . Then, the entries coming from terms like (4.6) can be simply added to A αβ . An entry (A αβ ) ij generally does not vanish if the intersection of the support of v h i and the support of v h j is at least one mesh cell K. If the support of l H m is only one mesh cell, then the numerator in (4.6) may be not equal to zero only if this mesh cell belongs also to the support of v h i and to the support of v h j . In this case, the sparsity pattern of G11 M -1 G 11 (and hence of Ã11 ) will be the same as of A 11 . The requirement on the support of l H m can be fulfilled if L H is a discontinuous finite element space. If the support of l H m consists of more than one mesh cell, the sparsity pattern of G11 M -1 G 11 will in general be larger than that of A 11 . In this case, one can use an approximation of G11 M -1 G 11 where all entries which do not belong to the sparsity pattern of A 11 are dropped (similar to the standard approach for an ILU decomposition).</p><p>Examples of spaces L H fulfilling both requirements are given in section 5.

However, the results of the different codes varied too much to define benchmark values. Some of the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> are given, for comparison to our results, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">5</ref>.2. ILLINOIS2 is a code by Wang and Vanka, and UKAHY2 is a code by Pourquie, Breuer, and Rodi. In addition, values from experiments which were used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> also for comparison are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">5</ref>.2. The evolution of the lift coefficient for the Smagorinsky model, the VMS with L H = P disc 0 , and the VMS with L H = P disc 1 is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.8. The periodicity of the flow can be observed. The amplitudes of the lift coefficient vary much more for both VMS than for the Smagorinsky model. This shows that the flows computed with the VMS are more irregular (turbulent). The characteristic values of the flow, averaged over 10 periods, are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">5</ref>.2. It can be seen that they are in the range of the values computed with the engineering codes. The most reliable value with respect to the variation of the computational results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> is the Strouhal number. In our computations, this number is predicted the worst by the Smagorinsky model, clearly better by the VMS with L H = P disc 0 , and by far the best by the VMS with L H = P disc 1 . This is with respect to both the results obtained with the other codes and the experimental values. The different length of the periods computed with the different methods can be seen clearly in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.8.

The assembling of the matrices for a VMS requires additional operations in comparison to the Smagorinsky model; see the description of our approach at the end of section 4. In this example, each assembling took approximately 111 s for the Smagorinsky model, 124 s for the VMS with P disc 0 , and 137 s for the Downloaded 12/30/12 to 139.184.30.136.

Because of the noise in the inflow, the Euclidean norm of the residual was always rather large (more than 1e6) at the beginning of each discrete time. The fixed point iteration for solving the nonlinearity was stopped after having reduced this norm below 1e-5. In general, five iterations were necessary to reach this goal, independent of the method. Also the number of iterations for solving the linear saddle point problems was the same for all methods. The average time which was needed by the solver for one discrete time step was 490 s. It can be deduced from these observations that, at least in this example, the conditioning of the matrices is not much different for the Smagorinsky model and the VMS with P disc k , k ∈ {0, 1}.
