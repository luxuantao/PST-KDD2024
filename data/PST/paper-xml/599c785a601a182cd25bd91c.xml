<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fog Computing (FC) and Internet of Everything (IoE) are two emerging technological paradigms that, up to date, have been considered standing-alone. However, due to their complementary features, we expect that their integration can foster a number of computing and network-intensive pervasive applications under the incoming realm of the Future Internet. Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this position paper is fivefold. First, we review the technological attributes and platforms proposed in the current literature for the standing-alone FC and IoE paradigms. Second, by leveraging some use cases as illustrative examples, we point out that the integration of the FC and IoE paradigms may give rise to opportunities for new applications in the realms of the Internet of Energy, Smart City, Industry 4.0 and Big Data Streaming, while, at the same time, introducing new open issues. Third, we propose a novel technological paradigm, the Fog of Everything (FoE) paradigm, that integrates FC and IoE, and, then, we detail the main building blocks and services of the corresponding technological platform and protocol stack. Fourth, as a proof-of-concept, we present the simulated energy-delay performance of a small-scale FoE prototype, namely, the V-FoE prototype. Afterwards, we compare the obtained performance with the corresponding one of a benchmark technological platform, e.g., the V-D2D one. It exploits only Device-to-Device (D2D) links, in order to establish inter-thing "ad hoc" communication. Lastly, we point out the position of the proposed FoE paradigm over a spectrum of seemingly related recent research projects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>limitations of the wireless domain, up to date, a system of this complexity was unfeasible. However, the incoming Future Internet era is introducing two new paradigms, namely, the Fog Computing (FC) and the Internet of Everything (IoE), that, in principle, could open the doors to a new Fog of Everything (FoE) paradigm.</p><p>Fog Computing is a quite novel computing paradigm that aims at moving the Cloud Computing (CC) facilities and services to the access network, in order to reduce the delays induced by service deployments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. By fact, augmentation and virtualization of resource-poor wireless/mobile smart heterogeneous things are opening the doors to novel context-aware crowd-sensing applications, that allow spatially distributed human/machine users to capture, analyze and share environmental local data of social interest. This is, in turn, the realm of the so-called IoE paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, in which context-aware things autonomously setup and manage self-organizing networks. Interestingly, these networks are no longer human networks empowered by the presence of things. On the contrary, IoE networks are self-orchestrating eco-systems, that aim at providing services to humans by empowering the performance of the underlying Internet of Things (IoT) physical infrastructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This is attained by improving the functions of thing discovery and service composition, while suitably self-managing the limited computing-plus-communication resources of the involved things. The final goal of the IoE networks is to autonomously attain right energy consumptionvs.-attained performance tradeoffs without any human supervision <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In order to implement the IoE vision, the technological paradigm of the FC is expected to provide the needed networking-plus-computing support by allowing the on-the-fly instantiation of software clones (e.g., virtual surrogates) of the physical things atop nearby resource-equipped cloudlets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This is, indeed, the Fog-over-IoE scenario considered by this position paper. At this regard, we point out that the Fog paradigm is giving rise to stimulating discussions about its expected benefits and costs. Without doubt, servers' underutilization in Cloud-based largescale remote data centers is a common phenomenon, mainly due to an over-provisioning of network and computing resources for handling workload peaks. As a consequence, electricity costs cover a large fraction of the overall operating costs of state-of-the-art Cloudbased data centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. From this point of view, the Fog and IoE paradigms promise to reduce energy consumptions and related operating costs by leveraging their native self-organizing and self-scaling capabilities, as well as their pervasive spatial deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivations, goals and organisation of the paper</head><p>In order to corroborate these considerations, we carried out a statistical search over the Google for the occurrence of the IoE and Fog keywords in research contributions published during the last six years. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) reports the (normalized) numbers of detected occurrences of the Fog and IoE keywords, while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b) plots the (absolute) numbers of occurrences of the joint Fog-plus-IoE keyword in the title and body of the searched papers.</p><p>An examination of plots of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> leads to two main insights. First, the research literature is beginning to shift towards an integration of the Fog and IoE paradigms. Second, up to date, no research and/or technical contributions have been still published on the actual integration of the Fog and IoE pillar paradigms.</p><p>The aforementioned considerations motivate the current work. Formally speaking, it is a position paper that cascades a first part of survey type (see Sections II and III) to a second part in which some fresh technical contributions are provided (see Sections IV and V). Its main focus is on the networked computing architectures, offered services, IoE-based supported applications and energy-efficient resource management of Fog-based technological platforms.</p><p>The main goals and organization of this paper is as follows. First, in Section II, the paper provides a synoptic review of the standing-alone Fog and IoE paradigms, in order to unveil the complementary nature of their native attributes. Second, in Section III, the paper outlines the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and related open challenges presented by some emerging applications that, in principle, could be promoted by a tight integration of the Fog and IoE pillar paradigms. For this purpose, the Internet of Energy, Smart City, Industry 4.0 and Big Data Streaming are considered as use cases. Third, motivated by these considerations, in Section IV, the paper proposes the FoE paradigm and details its technological platform and supporting protocol stack. Fourth, as a proof-of-concept, in Section V, a FoE-enabled case study is presented. Afterwards, the numerically evaluated energy-vs.-delay performance of a small-scale FoE prototype (e.g., the V-FoE prototype) is compared with the corresponding one of a benchmark technological platform (e.g., the V-D2D platform). This last relies only on "ad-hoc" Device-to-Device (D2D) WiFi-based links, in order to support inter-thing communication. Fifth, in Section VI, the paper discusses and poses under the right perspective the position of the proposed FoE paradigm over a spectrum of seemingly related research projects. Sixth, in the final Section VII, the paper summarizes the main presented results and outlines some directions for future research in the realm of the Future Internet. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OVERVIEW</head><p>The goal of this section is three-fold. First, we review and compare the native attributes of the standing-alone IoE, Fog and Cloud paradigms, in order to gain insight on their (possible) inter-play. Second, we perform a comparative review of two main technologies currently utilized for the virtualization of the computing and networking physical resources of data centers, namely, Virtual Machine (VM)-based and the CoNTainer (CNT)based virtualization technologies. Third, we review and compare the service models done available by the resulting virtualized IoE-Fog-Cloud ecosystem. We anticipate that the comparative review of this Section II provides the motivation for the introduction of the proposed FoE paradigm of Section IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Basic attributes and challenges of the IoE paradigm</head><p>The recent past years have been characterized by two seemingly contrasting technological trends.</p><p>The first one regarded the surging of the Cloud model as ubiquitous computing paradigm and the resulting shift of computing, control and data storage capabilities towards remote and large-size data centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Since these data centers are far away from the network edge, end-users connect them through the Internet backbone.</p><p>The second trend concerned the surging of a number of heterogeneous user-oriented access and sensor devices, like tablets, smartphones, smart home appliances, access points, edge routers, roadside-placed cabinets for the smart control of the vehicular traffic, connected vehicles, smart meters for power grids, smart control systems for Industry 4.0 factories, just to name a few. Additional smart edge devices, like industrial and home robots, computers on a stick, RFID-based frequency tuners, are currently gaining momentum. The common feature of all these devices is that they are things that operate at the network edge. This is, indeed, the realm of the so-called IoE paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Formally speaking, the IoE model refers to an ecosystem of (possibly heterogeneous) edge devices, that autonomously share and self-manage their limited resources, in order to attain a common systemwide goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The peculiar attributes of the IoE ecosystem are (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>): (i) pervasive spatial deployment at the network edge; (ii) contextawareness; (iii) self-management; (iv) self-organization; and, (v) inter-thing social relationships. As sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, goal of the IoE model is to provide a spatially distributed technological platform for the pervasive support of Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Peopleto-Machine (P2M) and People-to-People (P2P) services <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>It therefore becomes of interest to pose the following question: "How this plethora of resource-limited edge devices may be organized and managed, in order to provide the aforementioned services by leveraging the Internet as the interconnecting technology?"</p><p>This question points to a right tradeoff between the two contrasting targets of "concentrated resources and centralized resource management", and "pervasive resource placement and distributed resource management". Under this perspective, the IoE paradigm is still searching for system-wide architectural solutions for many emerging application scenarios, such as, cyberphysical systems and embedded sensor networks. This paradigm still needs to address basic questions ranging from where to compute and where to store data along the Thing-to-Cloud path to how to allow the things to pool and share their limited computing-plus-networking resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>From this point of view, the IoE paradigm introduces  a number of new challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by the Cloud and Host computing models alone. Some of such basic challenges are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> and discussed in the sequel.</p><p>Reduced communication delays -Industrial control systems (like manufacturing factories and smart grids) typically require sensor-to-controller communication delays of the order of milliseconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. IoT applications (like vehicle-to-vehicle communication, virtual reality applications, online games) may require service-deployment latencies below a few tens of milliseconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. All these latency requirements cannot be supported by the remote Cloud alone.</p><p>Wise usage of the Internet bandwidth -The quickly growing number of connected things is generating big data flows at an exponential rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Routing all data generated by the edge things to the remote Cloud would congest the Internet backbone. This requires, in turn, that the processing of the data generated by the edge things is carried out as much as possible within the access network.</p><p>Resource limitations of the IoE devices -Many IoE devices (like sensors, actuators, controllers and embedded systems) are both resource and energylimited. Therefore, they are not capable to rely solely on own capabilities, in order to fulfill their computing-communication tasks. However, due to the (aforementioned) constraints on the allowed delays and usage of the Internet bandwidth, offloading all tasks to the remote Cloud is not a feasible option <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Self-organizing ecosystems -In principle, the self-cooperation and self-organization of the IoE devices would provide a first solution to the mentioned latency-bandwidth-resource limitations. However, how to enforce device cooperation through the dynamic setup and self-management of suitable inter-thing "social" networks is still a big challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Intermittent network connectivity -In order to support device mobility, both Device-to-Cloud and Device-to-Device reliable network connections should be guaranteed. However, due to the multi-hop nature of the Internet backbone and the short-range capability of the network technologies currently envisioned for the support of inter-device communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, guaranteeing reliable network connections is a challenging task in the envisioned IoE realm <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>All these IoE challenges open, indeed, the doors to the FC paradigm of the next subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Basic attributes of the Fog Computing model</head><p>A synoptic review of the body of papers recently appeared on the Fog topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> points out that this model relies on the assumption that the computing tasks can be performed by nodes placed at the edge of the access network and in between the remote Cloud and the IoE devices. The final goal is to augment the computing-plus-bandwidth resources of the served devices without increasing too much the resulting service latencies. Under this perspective, the FC paradigm differs from the related Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) one <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, in which only edge nodes are employed for the device augmentation. Both the FC and MEC paradigms rely, indeed, on edge nodes, that are one-hop away from the served IoE devices; however, as sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the former paradigm integrates them with both the remote Cloud and the IoE devices, whereas the latter accounts only for the IoE devices. As a consequence, Fog Nodes (FNs) are virtualized networked data centers, which run atop (typically, wireless) Access Points (APs) at the edge of the access network, in order to give rise to a three-tier IoE-Fog-Cloud hierarchical architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>An examination of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> points out that the main attributes of the Fog paradigm are the following ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>:</p><p>• Edge location and location awareness -Being deployed in proximity of the served IoE devices, FNs may efficiently leverage the awareness of the states of the communication links (e.g., WiFi-based single-hop TCP/IP transport-layer connections) for the support of delay and delay-jitter sensitive applications, like video streaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>; • Pervasive spatial deployment -FNs support distributed applications, which demand for wide spatial deployments, like Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>; • Support for the mobility of the served devices -FNs may exploit Fog-to-Thing (F2T) and Thingto-Fog (T2F) single-hop WiFi links for data dissemination/aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>;</p><p>• Low energy consumption through adaptive resource scaling -Since Fog nodes are densely distributed over the spatial domain and connected to wireless access networks, they are typically equipped with capacity-limited batteries, that may be (hopefully) re-charged through renewable energy sources (like solar panels, wind turbines and/or micro-grids) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Hence, a main target of the Fog paradigm is the reduction of both the computing and networking energy consumptions through the adaptive horizontal (e.g., intra-Fog nodes) and vertical (e.g., inter-Fog nodes) scaling of the overall available resource pool; • Heterogeneity of the served devices -According to the IoE paradigm, FNs must be capable to serve a large spectrum of heterogeneous devices, that ranges from simple RFID tags to complex user smartphones, tablets and multimedia mobile sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>; • Dense virtualization -IoE devices are resourcelimited and densely deployed over the spatial domain. Hence, in order to provide device augmentation at minimum resource costs, Fog nodes must be capable to multiplex a large number of virtual clones with different resource demands onto a few number of physical servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>; • Device isolation -In order to guarantee trustworthiness to the served devices, the corresponding clones must run atop Fog servers as isolated virtual machines or containers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>The basic technological platform -According to the aforementioned attributes, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> reports the main blocks that compose a virtualized Fog node <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>These blocks operate at the Middleware layer of the underlying protocol stack and comprise (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>):</p><p>• the input and output buffers -They smooth the peaks of the workload to/from the served devices; • the physical resources -They comprise the physical servers, routers and physical channels that equip the Fog node;   The basic supported services -In principle, the Fog node of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> may serve the connected devices according to three general models, namely, the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, due to the stringent limitation of the hardware and software resources of the IoE devices, up to date, the SaaS model seems to be the most suitable one, in order to support IoE-based applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. According to this consideration, the state-of-the-art Fog Data Service (FDS) by Cisco <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> is an IoE-compliant SaaS-oriented software, that aims at mapping raw sensor data into actionable information. This is done by providing to the requiring devices a basic set of primitive functions, that include <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•</formula><p>• content-based data filtering;</p><p>• intelligent encryption of plaintext sensor data;</p><p>• remote reconfiguration of sensor devices through REST-based APIs; • time stamp-driven caching of sensor-acquired data;</p><p>• content correlation-based data fusion;</p><p>• dynamic management of intra-Fog databases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. On the Fog-Cloud complementarity</head><p>According to a commonly accepted definition provided by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Cloud Computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable networked computing resources (e.g., computing servers, network infrastructures, applications, and services), that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Hence, since both the FC and CC models provide computing resources to the served devices on an ondemand basis, they share the following attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>: (i) adaptive horizontal (e.g., intra-data center) scaling of the networking-plus-computing physical resources; and, (ii) maximization of the resource utilization through multiplexing of the physical resources and device virtualization.</p><p>However, passing to consider the Cloud-Fog complementarity, two main remarks are in order.</p><p>First, FNs are deployed in the access network, and the Device-Fog distance is typically limited up to one hop. Hence, the following attributes: (i) support for the device mobility; (ii) vertical (e.g., inter-data center) resource scaling; (iii) support for device heterogeneity; (iv) context-awareness; and, (v) communication latencies limited up to a few tens of milliseconds, are specific of the FC paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. However, these (positive) attributes are counterbalanced by the fact that: (i) FNs are small-size data centers with reduced fault-tolerance capability; and (ii) the Device-Fog communication typically relies on short-range WiFi/UWB/Bluetooth-based connections that are intermittent, interference-affected and failure-prone <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>Second, Cloud nodes are large-size data centers, that concentrate a huge number of networked computing servers and storage devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Furthermore, they are connected to national-wide Service Providers by Internet Wide Area Networks (WANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, so that Cloud-Device communication exploits ubiquitous 3G/4G cellular connections. Then, Cloud data centers offer: (i) measurable quality of the offered services for transparency and billing <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>; and, (ii) high degree of fault tolerance. However, they are context-unaware, and, furthermore, suffer from high service deployment latencies, that may be of the order of hundreds of milliseconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> recaps the reported considerations and presents a Cloud-vs.-Fog comparison under an IoEoriented perspective.</p><p>Overall, the emerging conclusion is that the FC model co-exists with the (more traditional) CC one.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. A comparison of virtualization technologies in the IoE realm</head><p>Virtualization is employed in Cloud and Fog-based data centers, in order to <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>: (i) dynamically multiplex the available physical computing, storage and networking resources over the spectrum of the served devices; (ii) provide homogeneous user interface atop (possibly) heterogeneous served devices; and, (iii) isolate the applications running atop the same physical servers, in order to provide trustworthiness. Roughly speaking, in virtualized data centers, each served physical device is mapped into a virtual clone that acts as a virtual processor and executes the programs on behalf of the cloned device <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. In principle, two main virtualization technologies could be used to attain device virtualization, namely, the (more traditional) Virtual Machine (VM)-based technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> and the (emerging) CoNTainer (CNT)-based technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</p><p>In a nutshell, their main architectural differences are that <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>: (i) the VM technology relies on a Middleware software layer (e.g., the so called Hypervisor) that statically performs hardware virtualization, while the CNT technology uses an Execution Engine, in order to dynamically carry out resource scaling and multiplexing; and, (ii) a VM is equipped with an own (typically, heavy-weight) Guest Operating System (GOS), while a container comprises only applicationrelated (typically, light-weight) libraries and shares with the other containers the Host Operating System (HOS) of the physical server. The resulting pros and cons of these two virtualization technologies are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>.</p><p>Shortly, the main pros of the CNT-based virtualization technology are that: (i) containers are light-weight and can be deployed significantly quicker than VMs; and, (ii) the physical resources required by a container can be scaled up/down in real-time by the corresponding Execution Engine, while, in general, physical resources are statically assigned to a VM during its bootstrapping.</p><p>However, since all containers running atop the same physical server share the same HOS, the main cons of the CNT-based virtualization technology are that: (i) the level of inter-application isolation (e.g., the level of trustworthiness) guaranteed by the container-based virtualization is typically below than the corresponding one offered by the VM-based technology; and, (ii) all the application libraries stored by the instantiated containers must be compliant with the HOS equipping the host physical server.</p><p>Overall, both virtualization technologies retain pros and cons. However, due to the expected large number of devices to be virtualized in IoE application environments, resorting to the CNT-based virtualization would allow to increase the number of virtual clones per physical server (e.g., the so-called virtualization density) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. We anticipate that this is the reason why the proposed FoE paradigm of Section IV relies on the container-based virtualization technology (see the Section IV.B for more details on this topic).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Feasible service models in the virtualized IoE-Fog-Cloud ecosystem</head><p>In computing systems that utilize only remote Cloud data centers, the IoE devices at the edge of the network may communicate with the Cloud servers by exploiting only Internet-based multi-hop WANs. In fact, under this scenario, all the computing and storage resources needed by the device augmentation are in the remote Clouds and IoE devices may access these remote resources by exploiting only the Server-Client model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The picture changes radically under the three-tier IoE-Fog-Cloud ecosystem of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. In this ecosystem, the physical resources needed by the device augmentation are no longer concentrated into the remote Cloud. In fact, FNs and inter-device cooperation allow to bring the computing and storage resources closer to the requiring devices. This leads, in turn, to two main benefits, namely, the contraction of the delays needed by service deployment and the reduction of the network traffic to be routed by the Internet WAN. These benefits arise from the fact that the ecosystem of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> makes available three basic service models for the workload execution, namely, the Offloading, Aggregation and Peer-to-Peer models.</p><p>Under the Offloading model, FNs act as switches, in order to offload the traffic from the devices to the remote Cloud (e.g., Up-offloading) and from the remote Cloud to the devices (e.g., Down-offloading). In both cases, FNs perform a (possibly, partial) processing of the switched workload, in order to reduce the communication latency and forward to the remote Cloud only the most computing-intensive tasks.  Under the Aggregation model, data streams generated by multiple devices are gathered (and, possibly, suitably fused) by a multiplexing node at the edge of the network, and, then, are routed to the remote Cloud through the Internet WAN for further processing. The multiplexing node is a gateway router. It is connected to a 3G/4G base station, and may be also equipped with (limited) processing capability.</p><p>Finally, under the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model, proximate devices make available their computing and storage capabilities, in order to share tasks and cooperate for workload execution. For this purpose, the cooperating devices build up D2D links, that typically rely on shortrange wireless communication technology, like UWB, WiFi or Bluetooth <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>The choice of the right service model is application and environment-depending, and may also depend on the level of context-awareness of the involved devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. At this regard, two main remarks are in order. First, the above three basic service models may be also composed into a number of Hybrid models, especially when heterogeneous tasks demand for different QoS requirements. Second, we anticipate that the proposed FoE paradigm of Section IV adopts a hybrid service model, that suitably combines the (aforementioned) Offloading and P2P basic ones of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>.</p></div>

RECENT WORK, EMERGING APPLICATION AREAS AND RELATED OPEN ISSUES: AN OVERVIEW</head><p>An overview of the current literature points out that recent work on Fog-based applications is aligned along two main research lines, deal with resource management issues. However, the first line focuses on the energy and information management, while the second one regards the orchestration of application-induced QoS requirements. The main characteristics of the proposed management approaches are summarized in Tables IV, V and VI. Specifically, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref> overviews some potential Fog-based applications for energy and information management. Roughly speaking, these applications aim at extending to the Fog realm some solving approaches previously deployed under the CC scenario. Table V reports some main findings on the energy efficiency of Fog and Cloud-based applications. They embrace Smart Grid (SG)-based applications that rely on the emerging smart-meter technology. Interestingly enough, since smart meters operate at the edge of the power grid, they constitute a real-world instance of "smart" IoE devices, that utilize the intermediate FNs as a bridge to the remote Cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>.</p><p>Overall, a synoptic examination of these tables points out that there are several open issues that must be still afforded in Fog-supported applications. They will be reviewed in the next subsections by leveraging four specific use cases as guidelines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.

An examination of these works corroborates the conclusion that, in principle, computing and networkingintensive applications that require real-time processing of spatially distributed environmental data may gain benefit from the integration of the pillar IoE and FoE paradigms. As detailed in the following subsections, these characteristics are retained, indeed, by four broad application areas of growing practical interest, namely, Internet of Energy, Smart City, Industry 4.0 and Big Data Streaming. We believe that, in the next future, these application areas could provide "killer" use cases for the proposed FoE paradigm of Section IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Internet of Energy:</head><p>The Internet of Energy represents the new frontier for the efficient management of the global and ever increasing electricity demand. By design, it relies on the integration of the power grid with actuators, smart meters and WSNs. The final goal is to to cope with the (traditional) unreliability suffered by the current electric grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref>.</p><p>A first application field envisioned for the Internet of Energy is represented by the (aforementioned) Smart Grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[92]</ref>. By design, it comprises power networks empowered by intelligent energy load balancers, that may run on edge devices (like smart meters) <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref>. The SG model allows the usage of various renewable energy sources (like solar energy, wind power, hydroelectric, radiant energy, geothermal energy and biomass), in order to supply heterogeneous IoE devices, such as, home appliances, micro-grids, sub-stations and sensor nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref>. The underlying networking infrastructure acts as glue: it allows the SG to perform remote metering by (possibly) exploiting the support of smart Energy Storage Devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[96]</ref>.</p><p>A second application field envisioned for the Internet of Energy is provided by the integration of Electric Aazam et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Context (user)</p><p>Gazis et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> Context (application)</p><p>Vehicles (EVs) with SGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[97]</ref>. This integration is motivated by the fact that EVs may also act as storage devices and feed power back to the grid. By doing so, they could be utilized for coping with the intermittent nature of the renewable energy sources by enabling the on-line matching of the energy generation times to the corresponding consuming times <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref>. It is expected that the resulting Vehicular-to-Grid (V2G) technological platform will provide new mechanisms for storing and supplying electric power, communicating with the grid and delivering electric energy to the grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[97]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> reports a reference architecture for the Internet of Energy.</p><p>According to the reported architecture, the Internet of Energy model relies on the vertical integration of four main sub-systems, namely, the Perception layer, the Network layer, the Fog layer and the Control layer. The final goal is to give rise to a customizable grid system, that is capable to perform a smart real-time scheduling of the energy demands. Specifically, according to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, we have that <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[92]</ref>:</p><p>(i) the Perception layer performs data gathering. It is composed by (possibly, heterogeneous) sensors, sensor gateways and actuators, that are used for acquiring information and performing thing control and identification. These devices must be capable to support D2D communication by exploiting the available Network layer; (ii) the Network layer comprises a set of (possibly, heterogeneous) network infrastructures, in order to support Device-to-SG communication. Since the IoE devices could be randomly distributed over the SG, it is expected that the Network layer relies on short/medium-range wireless transmission technologies, like WiFi, UWB and/or Bluetooth <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>; (iii) the Fog layer is responsible for the management of the massive volume of metered data. Since the FNs are equipped with both computing and networking capabilities and operate in the proximity of the edge devices, their role is to manage information and energy. They must guarantee a reliable flow of energy, in order to timely store the right amount of energy at the right locations. For this purpose, a final task of the FNs is to monitor in real-time the quality-of-energy, in order to quickly switch and route the energy flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[92]</ref>; (iv) the Control layer provides the interface between the services provided by the Internet of Energy platform and the end users. Since the data produced by Internet-of-Energy applications are large and heterogeneous, the Control layer may rely on the support of the remote Cloud, in order to perform offline data analytics.</p><p>2) Smart City: The keyword Smart City (SC) refers to the integration of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the IoE platform into the urban environment. The final goal is the "smart" management of the overall city asset <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98]</ref>. This aims at improving the human life through an optimized, balanced and integrated provision of utilities, vehicular transportation and smart lighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99]</ref>. Therefore, a new paradigm shift is at the basis of the SC model. It demands for the integration of service-oriented infrastructures, innovation services and communication infrastructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[100]</ref>. By doing so, it is expected that the SC model may foster and improve the social relations between citizens and government.</p><p>A quite general system architecture for the Smart City model is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99]</ref>.</p><p>By design, this architecture relies on the integration of four main layers, namely, the Physical Resource layer, the Network layer, the proximate Fog layer and the remote Supervision layer. According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>, these layers play the following roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[100]</ref>:</p><p>(i) the Physical Resource layer performs data acquisition. For this purpose, it is composed by a number of heterogeneous IoE devices, that gather information from different city scenarios, like vehicular mobility, smart buildings and smart energy generators. All these devices must be capable to support D2D communication by exploiting the infrastructure provided by the Network layer; (ii) the Network layer guarantees data transport between the edge devices and the overall SC infrastructure. Since edge devices may be randomly distributed over the SC area, it is expected that the Network layer relies on Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) communication technologies, like the 3G/4G cellular and/or WiMax ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>; (iii) task of the Fog layer is the real-time aggregation and orchestration of big volumes of gathered data, as well as their (possible) pre-processing through filtering and/or fusion. For this purpose, the Fog nodes may perform light-weight analytics; (iv) the Supervision layer makes possible the user-friendly interface of services offered by the Smart City ecosystem with userspecific queries/requirements. Since Smart City applications may produce huge sets of (possibly, noisy, heterogeneous and incomplete) meta-data, the Supervision layer may also include a remote centralized Cloud, in order to perform complex data analytics and deep learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[101]</ref>.  and Mobile Internet) into manufacturing factories. For this purpose, in 2014, the strategic initiative "Industrie 4.0" has been proposed by the German government and, then, similar initiatives were launched by USA and China <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[102]</ref>. The core of the resulting Industry 4.0 paradigm is the "smart" factory, whose main building blocks are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> [14], <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[103]</ref>.</p><p>By design, a "smart" factory requires a vertical integration of a four main subsystems, namely, the IoEbased Physical Resource layer, the Network layer, the proximate Fog layer and the remote Control layer. The final goal is to give rise to a reconfigurable manufacturing system, that may be used for the (possibly, simultaneous) production of heterogeneous products. Specifically, according to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>, we have that <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[104]</ref>:</p><p>(i) the Physical Resource layer is IoE-based and comprises smart things, like smart products, smart machines and smart conveyors. These things selfestablish Thing-to-Thing (T2T) communication links by exploiting the corresponding Network layer. By doing so, they are capable to selfcollaborate and self-organize, in order to attain a (pre-assigned) system-wide goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[105]</ref>; (ii) the Network layer provides, in turn, the communication services that are required by the underly-ing physical smart things, in order to implement the needed inter-thing negotiation mechanisms and communicate with the Fog layer. Due to the presence of mobile entities (like, automated guided vehicles and robots), the topology of a smart factory is expected to be highly time-varying. Hence, it is foreseen that the Network layer of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> will rely on short/medium-range wireless networking technologies, like WiFi, UWB and/or Bluetooth <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>; (iii) thank to the virtualization of the underlying manufacturing things, it is expected that the Fog layer of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> is capable to provide the scalable processing environment required by big data applications, in terms of computing, storage and networking resources. In fact, it is foreseen that, when operated, the smart manufacturing things at the Physical layer may produce massive streams of data, which require to be transferred to the Fog layer for further filtering and analytics; (iv) finally, the Control layer allows remote people to access to the smart factory through Web-based portals and Internet gateways. In principle, it may also comprise a remote Cloud layer, in order to perform offline complex analytics on massive semi-  4) Big Data Streaming: Big Data Streaming (BDS) mobile computing has been recently proposed as a paradigm that exploits the integration of the Big Data, Cloud-based stream processing and broadband mobile Internet Networking paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[107]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref>. Its specific target is the design and implementation of novel self-organizing spatially distributed networked computing platforms, in order to enable the real-time offloading and pervasive processing of environmental big data streams gathered by energy and bandwidthlimited wireless things (e.g., sensors, tablets, RFIDs, PDAs, smartphones). According to this target, the BDS paradigm relies on a "five Vs" formal characterization, that is, Value (huge value of gathered data that is scattered in massive data sets), Volume (huge amount of data to be processed), Velocity (fast rate of generation of new data), and Volatility (the gathered data must be communicated and processed in real time). The first four attributes are shared by all big data applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[109]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[110]</ref>, while the last one (e.g., the Volatility) characterizes the big data streaming applications. This is due to the fact that the information conveyed by a stream of data deeply depends on both its time and space co-ordinates, so that, after gathering, the information value vanishes when the networking-plus-computing latency is beyond a suitable application-depending threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[107]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> sketches the reference architecture of the BDS technological platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref>. In principle, it is composed by five main blocks, namely, the IoT layer, the radio access network, the proximate Fog layer, the Internet backbone and the remote Cloud layer.</p><p>According to the reported architecture, big data streams are: (i) gathered by a number of spatially heterogeneous mobile/wireless devices scattered over the environment of interest; (ii) forwarded to proximate FNs over (typically, single-hop) WiFi/Cellular connections for local pre-processing (like, data compressing, fusion and filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[111]</ref>); and, (iii) routed to Cloud-based remote data centers over (typically, multi-hop) Internet WANs for further post-processing.</p><p>By leveraging the reported architecture, it is expected that, in principle, the BDS paradigm may be capable to support three main classes of IoE-oriented applications, namely, Spatial Sensing (SS), Crowd-Sourcing (CS) and Data caching &amp; Nomadic computing (DN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref>.</p><p>Goal of the SS-type applications is to provide Internet access to a (possibly, very large) number of heterogeneous sensors (like, RFIDs and biosensors), in order to enable the real-time exchange of data about the monitored environment. This requires, in turn, that a huge number of simultaneous transport connections is sustained without inducing time-consuming traffic congestion phenomena.</p><p>Under the CS realm, populations of non-professional users acquire environmental (typically, video/audio) data streams through own smartphones, and, then, share them in real-time by building up P2P transport connections. Hence, a key feature of this type of application is the collective real-time processing of locally gathered streams for spatial monitoring and/or infotainment services.</p><p>Finally, the DN applications rely on context-aware services for data caching and personal computing onthe-go. The goal is to allow users to share information in real-time by leveraging Fog-assisted social network platforms (like, Dropbox, iCloud, Facebook or YouTube). These applications require massive sets of inter-stream cross-correlation analytics, in order to quickly detect the occurrence of new social trends and/or anomalies <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[101]</ref>.</p><p>To recap, since it is expected that the energysaving support of the applications described in this section demands for an accurate characterization of the corresponding per-service resource usages, Table VII presents a synoptic (gross) indication of the networking QoS requirements that are expected to stem from the considered application fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Emerging open issues</head><p>The envisioned application areas and the related QoS requirements of Table VII open the doors to a set of open issues that should be suitably characterized, in order to allow the migration of the IoE and FoE paradigms from the theory to the practice. According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>, we believe that the main foreseen open issues may be detailed as follows.</p><p>Main open issues on the Internet of Energy -The Internet of Energy paradigm of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> introduces some novel peculiar attributes with respect to the traditional power grid, namely, reliability, heterogeneous topologies, real-time management and energy-sustainability. Therefore, in the Internet of Energy realm, main open issues regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[112]</ref>: (i) the composition, deployment and management of distributed services over pervasive SGbased infrastructures; (ii) the design of efficient and user-friendly mechanisms, that allow end-users to be capable to control the services provided by the Internetof-Energy technological platform; (iii) the design of techniques for the dynamic allocation of the bandwidth, computing and storage resources available at the Physical layer of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, in order to effectively cope with the fluctuations of the energy demand; and, (iv) the design of "ad hoc" deep learning-based algorithms and protocols for the management of massive data generated by millions of smart meters <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[101]</ref>.</p><p>Main open issues on the Smart City -Smart cities will offer to the future citizens many non-traditional services, such as: (i) real-time traffic information; (ii) multi-agency coordination; (iii) generalized alerting services; (iv) quick responses to user's queries; (v) intelligent transportation and multi-modal ticketing services; and, (vi) dynamic interface with the public administration. As a consequence, we expect that, in the Smart City realm, main open issues may regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[100]</ref>: (i) the design of shared government strategies, in order to plan and coordinate the overall city assets; (ii) the design of user-friendly representations of the recorded environmental data, that account for spatial, temporal and contextual aspects; and, (iii) the design of scalable optimization tools for distributed data analytics.</p><p>Main open issues on the Industry 4.0 -In a nutshell, the novel technical features introduced by the smart factory paradigm of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> compared with the traditional factory model are <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>: (i) management of multiple heterogeneous small-lot products; (ii) dynamic routing of semi-worked products; (iii) convergence of the IoE, Fog and Cloud models; (iv) self-organization and self-managing of the working manufacturing machines; and, (v) generation, management and analysis of big data streams. As a consequence, in the Industry 4.0 realm, main open issues regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[104]</ref>: (i) the design Main open issues on the Big Data Streaming -The resource management of the technological infrastructures for the support of Big Data Streaming applications typically requires the real-time offloading of data and/or code to proximate and/or remote data centers through the available wireless access-plus-Internet networks, together with the corresponding real-time reconfiguration of the intra-data center computing-plus-networking resources. The ultimate goal of these actions would be the minimization of the overall inter/intra-data center computing-plus-networking energy consumptions under the QoS requirements of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">VII</ref>. This is the target of some recent management frameworks, such as S4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[113]</ref> and D-Streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[114]</ref>. However, these frameworks do not provide self-tuning of the employed networkingplus-computing resources to the time fluctuations of the input streams to be processed. Although the more recent Time Stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref> and PLAstiCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[116]</ref> management tools provide dynamic tuning of the intra-data center computing resources to the time-varying arrival rate of the input workload, they do not still consider the simultaneous scaling of the intra-data center network resources, and, furthermore, do not guarantee upper bounds on the resulting computing-plus-communication latencies. To recap, in the Big Data Streaming application scenario of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>, a still open issue is the design of integrated management tools that allow the adaptive and energy-efficient real-time reconfiguration of the computing-plus-networking virtual resources at the proximate/remote data centers and IoE devices.</p><p>Overall, all these reviewed open issues provide the motivation for the proposal of the FoE paradigm of Section IV.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The envisioned FoE technological platform and the supported service models</head><p>By design, the FoE paradigm aims at implementing the Fog-IoE integration fostered by Table VIII, in order to provide the technological support to the applications previously described in Sections III-A1, III-A2, III-A3 and III-A4. At this regard, we observe that all the (application-specific) technological platforms of Figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10 retain three common features. First, they rely on three-tier Device-Proximate Fog-Remote Cloud architectures. Second, they exploit single-hop WLANs and multi-hop WANs, in order to implement Device-Fog and Fog-Cloud connectivity, respectively. Third, in the case in which there are multiple proximate Fog nodes, these platforms are typically equipped with (possibly, wireless) backbones, in order to provide inter-Fog communication.</p><p>By accounting for these shared features, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> reports the basic architecture of the virtualized technological platform for the support of the proposed FoE paradigm. Roughly speaking, the proposed FoE architecture is composed by the integration of the following six main building blocks:</p><p>• the IoE layer, where a number of (possibly, heterogeneous) things operate over multiple spatial </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fog attributes Fog support to IoE</head><p>Deployment in the proximity of the devices Operating at the network edge, Fog nodes may provide infrastructure-based support to IoE applications that demand for spatially distributed device deployment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context-awareness</head><p>Being located near to the served devices, Fog nodes may acquire context awareness in real-time, and exploit it for the support of latency and latency-jitter sensitive services, like interactive and/or monitoring services.</p><p>Support to the device mobility Fog nodes may be arranged into spatial clusters, in order to serve mobile devices through single-hop links.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Container-based dense virtualization</head><p>Virtual clones of the served devices may be dynamically packed into Fog servers as lightweight containers. The goal is to provide device augmentation on an on-demand basis, in order to dynamically support the resource-limited IoE devices. clusters. According to the IoE jargon, a thing is a resource-limited user device, that needs of resource augmentation, in order to execute its workload. A thing may be fixed, nomadic or even mobile (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>); • the wireless (possibly, mobile) access network, that supports Fog-to-Thing (F2T) and Thing-to-Fog (T2F) communication through TCP/IP connections running atop IEEE802.11/15 single-hop links; • a set of inter-connected FNs, that act as virtualized cluster headers; • the (possibly, wireless) inter-Fog backbone, that provides inter-Fog connectivity and makes feasible inter-Fog resource pooling; • the Virtualization layer, that allows each thing to augment its limited resources by exploiting the computing capability of a corresponding virtual clone. This last runs atop a physical server of the FN that currently serves the cloned thing; • the resulting overlay inter-clone virtual network, that allows P2P inter-clone communication by relying on TCP/IP end-to-end transport connections. Passing to describe the interplay of the aforementioned building blocks of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, we observe that the remote Cloud is interconnected by a (multi-hop) Internet WAN to a set of virtualized FNs, that are spatially distributed over a wireless access network. Each FN is equipped with a (limited) number of virtualized physical servers, that are inter-connected by an intra-Fog (typically, Ethernet type) wired network. A FN covers a spatial area of diameter Da (m) and serves a cluster of things. Being resource limited, each thing is augmented by a software clone, that runs in the serving FN and acts as a virtual server.</p><p>The role of the (typically, wireless and multi-antenna <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[117]</ref>) inter-Fog backbone of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> is two-fold. First, it makes feasible the (aforementioned) horizontal dynamic scaling and pooling of the computing-pluscommunication resources of the FNs (see the first row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>). Second, it allows each clone to migrate from a FN to another by tracking the spatial trajectory of the corresponding mobile thing.</p><p>The overall set of clones running atop all Fog servers constitutes an overlay P2P virtual network, that is composed by Clone-to-Clone (C2C) TCP/IP connections. For this purpose, intra-Fog wired Ethernet links and backbone-supported inter-Fog wireless links are used. Specifically, the former (resp., the latter) are used to sustain end-to-end transport connections among clones that run atop a same FN (resp., stop different FNs).</p><p>Passing to consider the service models supported by the FoE platform, two main remarks are in order. First, since the FNs of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> may play the two-fold role of offloading and aggregating points for the traffic generated by the underlying things, the FoE paradigm is capable to support, by design, all the Up/Down Offloading, Aggregation and P2P service models of Section II-E. Second, we stress that a main peculiar feature of the proposed FoE paradigm is that the overlay network of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> allows to move the implementation of the interthing links from the device-based physical bottom layer to the clone-based virtual upper layer of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>. This feature makes, in turn, feasible to replace unreliable, intermittent and mobility-affected D2D-based inter-thing physical links with reliable, static and TCP/IP-based inter-clone virtual transport connections. We anticipate that the numerical tests and performance comparisons of the next Section V support the actual effectiveness of this feature of the FoE platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The container-based virtualization of the IoE devices</head><p>Light-weight and fine-grain dynamic resource scaling is the key feature that makes appealing to resort to the container-based technology of Section II-D, in order to perform the virtualization of the FoE technological platform of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by this consideration, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>(a), we report the main functional blocks of the virtualized architecture of the physical servers at the FNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p><p>At this regard, four main explicative remarks are in order.</p><p>First, each server hosts a number: N CN T ≥ 1 of containers. All these containers share: (i) the server's Host Operating System (HOS); and, (ii) the pool of computing (e.g., CPU cycles) and networking (e.g., I/O bandwidth) physical resources done available by the CPU and Network Interface Card (NIC) that equip the host server. Task of the Container Engine of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(a</ref>) is to dynamically allocate to the requiring containers the bandwidth and computing resources done available by the host server. For this purpose, the so-called Weighted Processor Sharing (WPS) scheduling discipline is typically implemented by the Container Engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p><p>Second, each container plays the role of virtual clone for the associated physical thing. Hence, the container acts as a virtual processor and executes the tasks offloaded by the thing on behalf of it. For this purpose, each container is equipped with a Multi-core Virtual Processor (MVP). This last comprises (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(b</ref>)): (i) a buffer, that stores the currently processed application tasks; and, (ii) a number n ≥ 1 of (typically, homogeneous) Virtual Cores (VCs), that run at the processing frequency f dictated by the Container Engine. Therefore, goal of the Task Manager of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(a</ref>) is to allocate the pending application tasks over the set of virtual cores of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(b</ref>) in a balanced and dynamic way. This is still done according to the aforementioned WPS scheduling discipline, so that the average frequency f i at which is processed the i-th task equates <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f i = ϕ i ( j∈T ϕ j ) × n × f.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>), we have that (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(b</ref>)): (i) n and f are the per-container number of virtual cores and the corresponding per-core processing frequency, respectively; (ii) T is the (typically, time-varying) set of tasks which are currently processed by the container; and, (iii) ϕ i (resp., ϕ j ) is a positive coefficient, which fixes the relative priority of the i-th (resp., j-th) processed task. Hence, according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>), the Task Manager may increase the frequency f i the i-th task by increasing the corresponding weight ϕ i and/or by decreasing the number of the simultaneously served tasks (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(b)</ref>). Finally, without loss of generality, we assume that the per-core and per-task processing frequencies f and f i in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>) are measured in bit-per-second (e.g., (b/s)), while the task sizes are measured in bit. However, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[118]</ref>, the corresponding numbers s and s i of CPU cycles per second may be directly computed as in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s = δ × f, and s i = δ × f i .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>), δ (measured in CPU cycles-per-bit, e.g., (CP U cycles/b)) is the so-called processing density of the running application. It fixes the (average) number of CPU cycles per processed bit, so that its value increases with the computing intensity of the considered application. For illustrative purpose, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">IX</ref> lists the (numerically evaluated) range of values of the processing density of some test applications of practical interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[118]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Management of the virtualized FoE technological platform: protocol stack and implemented QoS services</head><p>In order to suitably orchestrate the overall technological FoE platform of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, we have designed and implemented in software the FoE protocol stack of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">X</ref>. It relies on the suitable integration of some QoS resource managers, that have been recently proposed in the literature for the distributed self-management of multi-tier virtualized networked computing platforms. Specifically, Table X overviews: (i) the layered architecture of the FoE protocol stack; (ii) the services offered by each protocol layer; and, (iii) the corresponding adopted solutions. These last have been implemented in software under the umbrella of the GAUChO research project <ref type="bibr">[119]</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, according to the FoE platform of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, the corresponding protocol stack of Table X comprises the following four hierarchically organized layers:</p><p>• IoE layer -It provides both: (a) T2F access; and: (b) F2T broadcast services. (a) The T2F access service is implemented by resorting to the reservation-based access protocol developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>. It exploits a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) approach, in order to provide collision-free access to the things served by a same FN. For this purpose, the implemented protocol dynamically allocates access time-windows and access rates to the requiring things on the basis of: (i) the volume of data to be uploaded, (ii) the per-thing available energy; and, (iii) the per-connection fading level. (b) The F2T broadcast service is implemented according to the solution presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.

(a) In order to accomplish the first task, the integrated resource manager developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> is implemented. It jointly performs traffic admission control, load balancing, flow control and dynamic CPU speed scaling. The pursued objective is the minimization of the overall energy consumed by each FN, under hard upper limits on the resulting per-task processing delays. (b) The context-aware scheduler developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> is implemented, in order to control the bidirectional inter-Fog traffic over the wireless backbone of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>. The scheduler operates on a Time Division Duplex way and resorts to a cognitive data-fusion approach, in order to maximize the utilization of the backbone bandwidth under hard constraints on the perconnection packet collision rates. • Overlay layer -It supports the overlay inter-clone P2P network of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> by: (a) sustaining the inter-Fog clone migration; and, (b) dynamically managing the required migration bandwidth. (a) Clone migration is supported by the implementation of the so-called Follow-Me-Cloud framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>. It comprises the signaling protocol and the associated logic, in order to allow "live" inter-Fog clone migration in response to the thing mobility. (b) The dynamic management of the required migration bandwidth is accomplished by implementing the bandwidth manager deployed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>.</p><p>It minimizes the energy consumed by clone migrations under hard bounds on the corresponding migration times and service downtimes. Cloud layer -It orchestrates the overall Cloud-Fog-IoE platform of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> on the basis of the specific features and QoS requirements of the running applications. Hence, the solutions to be implemented at this layer must be "ad hoc" tailored on the expected attributes of the supported applications. The tested FoE prototype implements the VTube services detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>. They provide a set of YouTube-like service primitives for the real-time P2P sharing of streaming contents (like video clips, games and interactive multimedia books) over Fog-supported mobile content delivery networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>.</p><p>The next Section V the actual effectiveness of the adopted solutions for the implementation of the protocol stack of Table X by presenting the tested performance of a FoE-based prototype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT CASE STUDY: THE V-FOE TESTBED</head><p>Roughly speaking, the overall FoE technological platform is composed by two distinct (although interconnected) sub-systems. The first one comprises the virtualized networked computing technological platform that equips each FN, e.g., the intra-Fog platform sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>. The second sub-system covers the three-tier IoE-Fog-Cloud infrastructure, e.g., the inter-Fog platform sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>. Besides the IoE devices, FNs and remote Cloud, this sub-system comprises also the underlying networking infrastructure, that is, the mobile access network, the inter-Fog wireless backbone, the overlay inter-clone virtual network and the Internet WAN.</p><p>The energy and delay-efficient management of the intra-Fog platform has been the specific focus of a number of quite recent contributions by the authors (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>). These contributions explore various solutions for the adaptive orchestration of the intra-Fog virtualized resources, under a number of computing and networking setups. Hence, in the sequel of this section, we focus on the performance tests and comparisons of the inter-Fog sub-system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, in order to check the actual effectiveness of the FC paradigm in supporting resource-limited wireless/mobile IoE devices.</p><p>For this purpose, the remaining part of this Section V: (i) discusses the motivations for the performed tests and presents the considered testing scenario; (ii) describes the main features of a small-scale FoE prototype (e.g., the V-FoE prototype), that has been implemented under the umbrella of the (currently on-going) GAUChO research project [119]; (iii) tests the energy and delay performance of the V-FoE prototype under various mobility scenarios; and, (iv) finally, compares the obtained V-FoE performances against the corresponding ones of a benchmark platform, that does not exploit Fog and/or Cloud infrastructures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivations and goals of the performed tests and comparisons</head><p>In principle, inter-thing communication could be implemented by entirely relying on the P2P service model of Section II-E. For this purpose, D2D single-hop physical links among the communicating things may be built up at the IoE layer by exploiting short-range IEEE802.11/15 transmission technologies, like WiFi, UWB and Bluetooth <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>. These physical links operate in the "ad hoc" mode, and, then, do not require the support of Fog and/or Cloud infrastructures (see the bottom part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). However, we note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>: (i) due to fading and path-loss, the energy consumption of D2D links increases with the inter-thing distance in an (at least) cubic way; (ii) due to thing mobility, D2D mobile links are intermittent, and their average failure rates typically increase with the average thing speeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>; and, (iii) under the D2D model, the initiator thing needs, at first, to discover proximate things, and, then, must perform task distribution, thing synchronization and task retrieval. These operations may induce large service delays, especially when, due to the intermittent nature of the D2D connections, they abort several times before completing.</p><p>As anticipated at the end of Section IV-A, in principle, the inter-clone overlay network of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> may be used, in order to cope with the aforementioned limitations of the D2D "ad hoc" communication model. This overlay network allows to move the implementation of the inter-thing links from the unreliable, D2D-based and energy-hungry IoE physical layer up to the reliable, TCP/IP-based and energy-efficient virtual overlay layer. By doing so, since the overlay C2C communication platform replaces the corresponding underlay D2D one, we expect that, in principle, the following two may benefits are attained:</p><p>• the mitigation of the aforementioned limitations of the "ad hoc" D2D communication platform through the utilization of stable (e.g., not intermittent) and energy-efficient (e.g., no mobility affected) intra-Fog Ethernet and inter-Fog backbone links; and, • the reduction of the delays for the service discovery and setup.</p><p>B. Modeling the simulated framework: the V-FoE test-Being the Fog paradigm still in its infancy, large-scale real-world Fog infrastructures are not currently available for test purposes. Hence, in order to corroborate the aforementioned expectations, we have emulated in software a small-scale FoE prototype, namely, the Vehicular FoE (V-FoE) test-bed. It provides a proof-of-concept of the proposed FoE protocol stack by implementing (in software) the resource orchestration and management solutions in the last column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">X</ref>.</p><p>Utilized simulation toolkit -For this purpose, we have adopted the (recently deployed) iFogSim toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>. As shortly described in the sequel, it natively retains three main features that allow a (quite direct) integration of the FoE protocol stack.</p><p>First, the iFogSim toolkit allows the simulation of FNs and IoE devices by tuning their computing, communication and storage capabilities, such as: (i) the number of computing cores and their CPU speed-vs.-computing power profiles; (ii) the bandwidths of their NICs and the corresponding transmission rate-vs.-communication power profiles; and, (iii) the available RAM for task storage.</p><p>Third, under the so-called Edge-ward placement mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>, the iFogSim toolkit allows to implement and tune various resource orchestration policies, in order to attain the most energy-efficient allocation of the workload over the overall spectrum of the available IoE devices, FNs and remote Clouds.</p><p>Test scenario -The considered test scenario refers to a crowd-sourcing application, that involves end-users on board of vehicles. Specifically, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>, this scenario considers the real-time sharing of environmental video sequences. They are acquired on-the-fly by non-professional users, which are equipped with smartphones and move on board of vehicles over urban areas. The smartphones are assumed to be equipped with VTube-type APIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>, so that they may launch P2P video streaming sessions when the vehicles come in contact. In the simulated scenario, by design, we have that: (i) two vehicles come in contact when they move over the same cluster (e.g., they are served by the same FN; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>); (ii) after becoming in contact, two vehicles may establish a new P2P session with probability 0.5, provided that they are not already involved in other on-going P2P sessions; and, (iii) the time is slotted, and T SLT (s) is the slot time.</p><p>After the launching, a session goes on, even while the involved vehicles move away to different clusters. The SEssion Duration T SED and the Inter-Session time Interval T ISI are randomly distributed over the time intervals: 600 T SLT -1000 T SLT , and: 1100 T SLT -1400 T SLT , respectively.</p><p>The maximum vehicle speed is v M AX = 50 (Km/h), and the considered average speeds are v = 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 (Km/h). The total number of simulated vehicles is N (T OT )</p><p>V HC = 260. They are evenly distributed over N CLS = 13 exaghonal spatial clusters of diameter Da = 650 (m), which are arranged over concentric spatial rings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>, vehicle mobility is simulated according to the so-called Markovian random walk with random positioning. According to this model, at the beginning of the time slots, each vehicle moves to a randomly selected neighborhood target cluster with probability or stays in the current cluster with probability (1 -α). After the selection of the target cluster, a point inside it is randomly chosen and the vehicle moves to it. By doing so, we have numerically ascertained that, in each time slot, one half of the simulated inter-thing (e.g., inter-vehicle) TCP/IP connections involves vehicles that are traveling over different clusters. Furthermore, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>, the inter-cluster transition probability α and the per-cluster average number of vehicle N V HC may be accurately approximated by the following formulas:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulated mobility model -As in</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">α = v/v M AX ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">N V HC = 1 2 × A JAM × (1 -α) × Su,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where Su (m 2 ) is the cluster area, and A JAM (vehicle/m 2 ) is the per-cluster maximum spatial density of vehicles when vehicular congestion phenomena occur.</p><p>Power profiles of the simulated computing nodes According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, each spatial cluster is served by a FN. This last comprises N SER = 7 homogeneous quadcore Dell PowerEdge-type physical servers, which are equipped with 3.06 GHz Intel Xeon CPU and 8 GB of RAM. The per-server maximum and static (e.g., idle) power consumptions are <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>: P Dockertype containers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> of size: S CN T = 30 (M b). Each container clones a user smartphone (e.g., a thing) and, according to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>(b), it is equipped with a virtual processor with n COR homogeneous virtual cores. Hence, according to the general model reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> for the power consumption of (possibly, virtualized) multi-core processors, the average computing power P (SER) CM P (W ) wasted by a multi-core container may be modeled as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (SER) CM P = P (ST AT IC) SER N (M AX) CN T + (1 -ρ (SER) COR )× (P (M AX) SER -P (ST AT IC) SER ) N (M AX) CN T × n COR × f SER f (M AX) SER γ .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>), we have that: (i) f SER (bit/s) (resp., f (M AX) SER (bit/s)) is the per-virtual core average (resp., maximum) processing frequency; (ii) γ ∼ = 3 is a dimension-less power exponent; and, (iii) ρ  so-called power reduction factor. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>, it is formally defined as the fraction of the total consumed power that is shared by the processing cores for common target operations. As illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">XI</ref>, this fraction depends on both the power features of the considered multi-core processor and the number n COR of processing cores. Its typical values fall into the range 6%-30%, and tend to somewhat increase with the number n COR of utilized cores. Before proceeding, we point out that, in principle, the same power model of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) may be also used for the evaluation of the computing power: P (M OB) CM P (W ) consumed by each mobile user device. However, since the most part of the current IoE devices is still singlecore and not virtualized, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) simplifies to <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P (M OB) CM P = P (ST AT IC) M OB + + P (M AX) M OB -P (ST AT IC) M OB × f M OB f (M AX) M OB γ .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>From a formal point of view, Eq.

The Rice factor of the mobile Vehicle-to-Fog and Fog-to-Vehicle channels is 7.4 (dB), while the Rice factor of the static inter-Fog wireless backbone is 17 (dB). Furthermore, we assume that all the resulting wireless/wired end-to-end transport-layer connections of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> implement the TCP NewReno protocol, in order to guarantee reliability, even in the presence of fading/mobility/traffic congestion-induced connection failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>. Therefore, according to the results of the power analysis reported, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref>, the average power P N ET (W ) consumed by a TCP connection is related to the corresponding average transport through-R N ET (b/s) as in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P N ET = Λ × (R N ET × RT T ) η + P (SET U P ) N ET .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Eq.

Table XII points out that the actual values of Λ, RT T , η, and P (SET U P ) N ET depend on the power-delay features of the utilized wireless/wired transmission technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>Energy wasted by the live migration of clones -By definition, the average energy E (M IG) CLON E (J) consumed by the inter-Fog migration of a clone over the wireless backbone of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> equates the product: (network power) by (migration time). Therefore, by leveraging Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>), we have that <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">E (M IG) CLON E def = P N ET × T M IG = = P N ET × S CN T × (1 + OV H) R N ET ×(1+F N CON ),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where: (i) the (dimension-less and positive) coefficient: OV H accounts for the migration-induced traffic overhead <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>; and, (ii) the (non-negative) factor: F N CON is the per-connection average number of failures, e.g., the average number of times that an on-going connection fails before completing. We anticipate that F N CON depends on the power-delay profiles of the considered wireless/wired transmission technologies, as well as on the considered service and mobility models (see the next Section V-C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance results and comparisons</head><p>The numerical results of the simulated V-FoE test-bed report the per-connection average consumed energies and the resulting round-trip-times of the P2P inter-clone overlay virtual network of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>. Specifically, the reported energy values account for: (i) the support of the instantiated Vehicle-to-Fog, Fog-to-Vehicle and Cloneto-Clone wireless/wired links; (ii) the processing of the workload by all involved mobile/fixed computing nodes; and, (iii) the support of the inter-Fog mobility-induced clone migrations.</p><p>Reference benchmark -For comparison purpose, we have also implemented in software and simulated a benchmark testbed, e.g., the Vehicular D2D (V-D2D) testbed. It operates under the same vehicular scenario previously described for the V-FoE test-bed, but, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref>, it utilizes only "ad-hoc" D2D IEEE802.11b single-hop links for the support of Vehicle-to-Vehicle TCP/IP transport connections.</p><p>At this regard, four main remarks are in order.  First, the (general) power-vs.-rate model of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>) applies also to WiFi-supported D2D transport connections. However, in this case, the resulting perconnection round-trip-time RT T becomes quite sensitive on the corresponding (generally, time-varying) inter-vehicle distance d (m) and tends to scale up/down proportionally to it, that is <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">RT T ∝ d.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Second, the CPU power consumed by a device engaged into a D2D connection may be still evaluated through Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>).</p><p>Third, in order to carry out fair performance comparisons, the traffic flows conveyed by all the simulated TCP/IP connections are randomly scaled and cyclically delayed versions of the mother traffic trace in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14</ref>. It reports the normalized I/O traffic flow actually measured from four RAID volumes of an enterprise data center in Microsoft <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>. In the carried out tests, the actual peak traffic values are set to 80% of the maximum throughput R (M AX) N ET of the corresponding TCP/IP connections. Fourth, in the FoE paradigm, T2F access is managed by the context-aware reservation-based protocol proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>, that, by design, guarantees collisionfree access (see Table X and the related text). Hence, in order to perform fair comparisons, the simulation of the WiFi-supported V-D2D benchmark testbed has been carried out under the assumption that the utilized Carrier Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol guarantees collision-Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14</ref>: Normalized sample trace of an I/O traffic flow from an enterprise data center in Microsoft <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>.</p><p>free (e.g., multiple access interference-free) communication. Although this assumption may be somewhat optimistic and may tend, indeed, to over-estimate the actual performance of the benchmark V-D2D testbed, we anticipate that the numerical plots of Figs. <ref type="bibr">15 18</ref> corroborate the performance superiority of the proposed V-FoE platform.</p><p>Obtained numerical results -An examination of the V-FoE energy curves of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">15</ref> gives rise to two remarks. First, since the per-Fog number of the turned ON physical servers decreases for growing val- (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>)), all the V-FoE energy plots of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">15</ref> decrease with N (M AX) CN T at fixed average vehicle speed v. Therefore, since the virtualization density of the container-based virtualization technology is higher than the corresponding one of the VM-based technology (see Section II-D), a first conclusion is that the former technology is more energy-efficient than the latter one. Second, we have numerically ascertained that, in the simulated scenario, the average number of performed clone migrations increases of about 4.2 times by passing from v = 5 (Km/h) to v = 45 (Km/h). This is the reason why the V-FoE energy curves of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">15</ref> scale up of about 21% for increasing values of the average speed of the simulated vehicles.</p><p>Passing to consider V-FoE -vs.-V-D2D performance comparison, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">16</ref> points out that: (i) the V-D2D test-bed exhibits values of the average number of the per-connection failures that are higher than corresponding ones of V-FoE platform; and, (ii) a similar conclusion holds for the rates of the increment of the average numbers of the per-connection failures with the vehicle speed. Specifically, an examination of the bar plots of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">16</ref> shows that the average number of the per-connection failures of the V-D2D (resp., V-FoE) testbed increases of about 3 times (resp., 1.5 times) by passing from v = 5 (Km/h) to v = 45 (Km/h). Therefore, the carried out tests lead to two main conclusions. First, due to the presence of the Fog infrastructure, the connection failures suffered by the V-FoE testbed are mainly due to (sporadic) traffic congestion phenomena in the access network. Second, due to its "ad hoc" (e.g., infrastructure-free) nature, the benchmark V-D2D testbed is very sensitive on: (i) the fading and path-loss impairments; and, (ii) the mobility-induced increments of the average distances of the sustained D2D connections.</p><p>This performance trend is confirmed by the bar plots of Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">17</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">18</ref>, that open, in turn, the doors to three additional considerations.</p><p>First, the V-FoE testbed is more energy efficient of the benchmark V-D2D one, and the measured perconnection average energy gaps are around 20%, 24%, 26.7%, 29.9%, and 33% at v = 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 (Km/h), respectively (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">17</ref>).</p><p>Second, the increment of the energy consumed by the V-FoE connections is almost entirely induced by the corresponding increment of the average number of clone migrations. This last, in turn, is induced by the increment of the average vehicle speed.</p><p>Third, since live migrations of clones entail, by design, very limited service interruptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>, the corresponding average-round-trip times of the V-FoE connections are almost insensitive on the vehicle speed and remain around 22 (ms) -23 (ms) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">18</ref>). On the contrary, due to the increasing propagation delays and failure-induced TCP re-transmissions, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">18</ref> shows that the corresponding average round-triptime of the V-D2D connections quickly scales up with the values of the average vehicle speed, and it passes from 26.5 (ms) at v = 5 (Km/h) to 78.5 (ms) at v = 45 (Km/h).</p><p>Overall, the reported comparative performance results confirm the (aforementioned) expectation about the improved delay and energy efficiencies of the of proposed FoE technological platform of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. ONGOING RESEARCH PROJECTS ON FOE-RELATED TOPICS</head><p>FoE is a new paradigm, so that, at the best of the authors' knowledge, the number of research projects specifically tailored on this model is still vanishing. Hence, in this section, we describe some ongoing projects and research initiatives that, in our opinion, are mainly related to some main topics featured by the FoE paradigm.</p><p>The PRIN2015 project: "A Green Adaptive Fog Computing and Networking Architecture (GAUChO)" [119] aims at designing a novel distributed and heterogeneous architecture, that is capable to functionally integrate and jointly optimize FC and network functions onto a same platform. In addition, the development of suitable analytic methods and the definition of appropriate techniques enable extra relevant characteristics of the GAUChO platform, including ubiquity, decentralized management, cooperation, proximity to the users, dense geographical distribution, efficient support for mobility and real-time applications.</p><p>The "Vehicular Fog energy-efficient QoS mining and dissemination of multimedia Big Data streams (V-Fog)" project by Sapienza University of Rome <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref> is a Fog-related project that aims at defining, designing and validating integrated resource-management and datamining distributed adaptive algorithms for vehicular networks. The V-Fog final goal is the energy-efficient support of real-time BDS applications, such as multimedia human activity recognition and infotainment interactive services. Moreover, the actual (still unexplored) transport capabilities promised by the novel paradigm of multipath-TCP is investigated, while a cognitive approach is pursued for the integrated design of the V-Fog architecture.</p><p>The project: "TROPIC: Distributed computing, storage and radio resource allocation over cooperative femtocells" <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref> proposes a communication paradigm for the ever-increasing ubiquitous wireless access traffic demands. CC services queried by smarphones could be moved from remote server farms to FNs, so to improve user experience, latency, and download/upload speed.</p><p>As previously remarked, a goal of the FoE paradigm is to develop Fog-aided IoE architectures that enable interoperability between applications and different sensor technologies. This is also a target of some recent (in some still ongoing) research projects, namely, EBBITIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>, IoT.est <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>, NEBULA <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>, BETaaS <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>, iCORE <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>, BUTLER <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>, MobilityFirst <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>, and COMPOSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>. They address the interoperability issues under the more traditional realm of IoT. Specifically, the common main target of EBBITIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>, IoT.est <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>, NEBULA <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref> and BETaaS <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref> is to develop business services and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based Cloud-aided architectures, in order to semantically integrate WEB 2.0 services into IoT. Furthermore, the main goal of BUTLER <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref> and MobilityFirst <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref> is to design distributed networked computing architectures for the support of real-time context-aware services, while a main common goal of iCORE <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref> and COMPOSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref> is to deploy unified networked computing architectures that exploit things' virtualization, in order to encompass the technological heterogeneity of current IoT sensors.</p><p>A set of ongoing IoT-inspired projects (namely, GAMBAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>, IoTService <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>, CALIPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>) focuses on the design of cross-layer networked com-puting architectures. Their common goal is to improve the energy efficiency of the overall resulting Cloudaided IoT system, which is also a target of the FoE paradigm. Toward this end, GAMBAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> and IoT-Service <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref> operate at the Middleware layer. In particular, GAMBAS focuses on an adaptive Middleware for enabling dissemination of context-aware services, while IoTService aims at deploying a Middleware platform for the self-composition of smart IoT services. Conversely, CALIPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> adopts a cross-layer approach that embraces the Application, Middleware and Network layers. It aims at increasing the lifetime of the underlying IoT infrastructure by improving the cross-layer energy efficiency.</p><p>The Mobile &amp; Cloud Computing Laboratory (Mobile &amp; Cloud Lab) of the University of Tartu (Estonia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref> is running another project, named "Service-Oriented Fog Computing with the Interconnected Mobile Edge of Things". It aims at addressing the integration-related challenges involved in applying the FC model at the edge network of the IoT systems, and addresses numerous challenges, such as: discoverability, limited computational power and storage of IoT devices, management, The Eclipse ioFog [153] project focuses on the deployment of an open platform comprised by extensible frameworks, tools and runtimes. The Eclipse ioFog set of technologies is a FC layer, that can be installed on any hardware running Linux. Once installed, it provides a common runtime for microservices to be run at the edge network. In addition to this common runtime, ioFog also provides a set of useful services, including a message bus, a dynamic configuration of the micro-services and a remote debugging. An automated interconnection of ioFog instances is, then, provided by the ComSat component. All system components are available in distributed format by January, 2017. This includes ioFog, ComSat, ioAuthoring and the Fabric Controller.</p><p>Goal of the EU-funded OpenIoT project <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref> is to develop a Middleware platform for gathering and pruning (e.g., filtering) messages, while guaranteeing that suitable events are generated for the interested user applications. Interestingly, as in the FoE paradigm, a major focus of OpenIoT is on the energy-efficient gathering and timely transmission of data streams generated by mobile things to proximate FNs. The ultimate goal is to design and develop a SW platform, which is capable to acquire and manage data streams generated from heterogeneous sensors, in order to provide pay-as-yougo based IoT services.</p><p>Like the FoE paradigm, a target of the IoTCloud project <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[155]</ref> is the integration of smart things (like tablets, smart phones and automata) with the surrounding environment, in order to properly manage sensorgenerated messages and provide API to the interested user applications. It is foreseen that the resulting IoT-Cloud technological platform is equipped with IP cameras and integrated atop the FutureGrid Cloud testbed.</p><p>IoTToolkit is a USA project <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[156]</ref>, that aims at developing SW toolkits, in order to actually enable the interaction between IoT and Fog through the integration of different protocols already available for the management of the IoT and Fog infrastructures.</p><p>[157] is a research project jointly deployed by industry, academia and city administrations from Europe and Japan. Like the FoE paradigm, ClouT aims at developing services and applications for municipalities and their users, in order to build up user-centric applications that rely on the symbiotic integration of the IoT and Cloud paradigms. Running under the um-  brella of "Smart Cities", the targeted by the ClouT project cover green public transportation, safety and emergency management, as well as city event monitoring.</p><p>Finally, IoT6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[158]</ref> is an EU-funded project, that aims at exploiting the new capabilities offered by IPv6 under the umbrella of the Future Internet of Things. As the FoE paradigm, a main objective of the IoT6 project is the design and deployment of a scalable IPv6based SOA, which is capable to dispatch the computing power offered by FNs among nearby heterogeneous smart things.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS</head><p>A main lesson stemming from the results reported in this paper is that a key challenge for coping with the unpredictable large volume of data generated by IoE-based applications is the design of a spectrum of hierarchically-organized networked computing nodes, namely, proximate Fog and remote Cloud data centers. The final goal is the adaptive energy-efficient reconfiguration and orchestration of the virtualized computingplus-communication resources available at the computing nodes and thing devices under real-time constraints on the allowed computing-plus-communication delay and service latency.</p><p>In order to attain this goal, the performance results of the Section V suggest that three main research directions could be further pursued under the FoE realm. The first one stems from the consideration that, in the next years, IoE devices will be equipped with multiple (possibly, heterogeneous) wireless network interface cards. This opens the doors to the design of energy-efficient transport protocols, that rely on the emerging Multipath TCP paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[159]</ref>. The target should be the increment of the per-connection throughput, while limiting the energy overhead induced by the parallel utilization of multiple radio interfaces. A second research direction is motivated by the consideration that the native self-organizing feature of the IoE model induces hierarchical relationships among the involved things <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This should require the design of new Network-layer communication primitives for IoE-based ecosystems, in order to implement suitable forms of selective multicast that account for the relative roles of the involved IoE devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Finally, a third research direction relies on the consideration that the proposed FoE architecture is inherently multitier and distributed (see Section IV-A), and exploits the inter-networking of local (e.g., IoE devices), proximate (e.g., FNs) and remote (e.g., Cloud nodes) computing entities. On the basis of this consideration, the design of distributed and adaptive resource orchestrators that jointly perform the energy and delay-efficient allocation and scheduling of the offered workload over the full spatial spectrum of the available computing nodes is a still challenging research issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we point out that, since the FoE model stems from two emerging paradigms, e.g., FC and IoE, it is in the infancy and, then, is continuously evolving. In this position paper, we have provided an outlook on some main research areas and challenges that are mainly related to the required computing networked architectures and energy efficiency. However, several other related and/or tangential research fields, that have been not covered by this paper, can be identified. For example, since FoE relies on distributed networked computing architectures by design, it is expected that innovative solutions tackling distributed security, trust worthy and thing authentication will be needed, in order to allow the migration of the FoE paradigm from the theory to the practice. This opens the doors to further work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Research trends on the Fog, IoE and Fog-plus-IoE paradigms over the 2011-2016 time-window.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,86.03,72.00,219.95,144.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
