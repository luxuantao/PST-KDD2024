<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Learning shape models from examples, using them to recognize new instances of the same class of shapes, are fascinating problems that have attracted the attention of many scientists for many years. Central to this problem is the notion of a random shape which in itself has occupied researchers for decades. Fréchet <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> is probably one of the first mathematicians to develop some interest in the analysis of random shapes, i.e., curves. He was followed by Matheron <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> who founded, with Serra, the French School of Mathematical Morphology and by D. Kendall <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> and his colleagues, e.g., Small <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. In addition, and independently, a rich body of theory and practice for the statistical analysis of shapes has been developed by Bookstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, Dryden and Mardia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, Carne <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, and Cootes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Except for the mostly theoretical work of Fréchet and Matheron, the tools developed by these authors are very much tied to the point-wise representation of the shapes they study: objects are represented by a finite number of salient points or landmarks. This is an important difference with our work which deals explicitly with curves as such, independently of their sampling or even parametrization.</p><p>In effect, our work bears more resemblance to that of several other authors. As in Grenander's theory of patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, we consider shapes as points of an infinite-dimensional manifold, but we do not model the variations of the shapes by the action of Lie groups on this manifold, except in the case of such finite-dimensional Lie groups as rigid displacements (translation and rotation) or affine transformations (including scaling). For infinite-dimensional groups, such as diffeomorphisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> which smoothly change the objects' shapes, previous authors have been dependent upon the choice of parametrizations and origins of coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. For them, warping a shape onto another requires the construction of families of diffeomorphisms that use these parametrizations. Our approach, based upon the use of the distance functions, does Approximations of Shape Metrics and Application to Shape Warping OF3 not require the arbitrary choice of parametrizations and origins. From our viewpoint this is already very suitable in two dimensions but becomes even more suitable in three dimensions and higher, where finding parametrizations and tracking origins of coordinates can be a real problem: this is not required in our case. Another piece of related work is that of Soatto and Yezzi <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> who tackle the problem of jointly extracting and characterizing the motion of a shape and its deformation. In order to do this they find inspiration in the above work on the use of diffeomorphisms and propose the use of a distance between shapes (based on the set-symmetric difference described in Section 2.2). This distance poses a number of problems that we address in the same section, where we propose two other distances which we believe to be more suitable. They also use a signed distance score but it is nonsymmetric with respect to the two regions and is not an approximation to a distance.</p><p>Some of these authors have also tried to build a Riemannian structure on the set of shapes, i.e., to go from an infinitesimal metric structure to a global one. The infinitesimal structure is defined by an inner product in the tangent space (the set of normal deformation fields) and has to vary continuously from point to point, i.e., from shape to shape. The Riemannian metric is then used to compute geodesic curves between two shapes: these geodesics define a way of warping either shape onto the other. This is dealt with in the work of Trouvé and Younes <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> and, more recently, in the work of Klassen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, again at the cost of working with parametrizations. The problem with these approaches, beside that of having to deal with parametrizations of the shapes, is that there exist global metric structures on the set of shapes (see Section 2.2) which are useful and relevant to the problem of the comparison of shapes but that do not derive from an infinitesimal structure. Our approach can be seen as taking the problem from exactly the opposite viewpoint from the previous one: we start with a global metric on the set of shapes and build smooth functions (in effect smooth approximations of these metrics) that are dissimilarity measures, or energy functions; we then minimize these functions using techniques of the calculus of variation by computing their gradient and performing infinitesimal gradient descent: this minimization defines another way of warping either shape onto the other. In this endeavor we build on the seminal work of Delfour and Zolésio who have introduced new families of sets, complete metric topologies, and compactness theorems. This work is now available in book form <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The book provides a fairly broad coverage and a synthetic treatment of the field along with many new important results, examples, and constructions which have not been published elsewhere. Its full impact on image processing and robotics has yet to be fully assessed.</p><p>In this paper we also revisit the problem of computing empirical statistics on sets of two-dimensional shapes and propose a new approach by combining several notions such as topologies on sets of shapes, calculus of variations, and some measure theory. Section 2 sets the stage and introduces some notations and tools. In particular, in Section 2.2 we discuss three of the main topologies that can be defined on sets of shapes and motivate the choice of two of them. In Section 3 OF4 G. Charpiat, O. Faugeras, and R. Keriven we introduce the particular set of shapes we work with in this paper, show that it has nice compactness properties and that the three topologies defined in the previous section are in fact equivalent on this set of shapes. In Section 4 we introduce one of the basic tools we use for computing shape statistics, i.e., given a measure of the dissimilarity between two shapes, the curve gradient flow that is used to deform a shape into another. Having motivated the introduction of the measures of dissimilarity, we proceed in Section 5 with the construction of classes of such measures which are based on the idea of approximating some of the shape distances that have been presented in Section 2.2; we also prove the continuity of our approximations with respect to these distances and compute the corresponding curve gradient flows. This being settled, we are in a position to warp any given shape onto another by solving the partial differential equation (PDE) attached to the particular curve gradient flow. This problem is studied in <ref type="bibr">Section 6</ref> where examples are also presented. In Section 7.1 we use all these tools to define a meanshape and to provide algorithms for computing it from sample shape examples. In Section 7.2 we extend the notion of the covariance matrix of a set of samples to that of a covariance operator of a set of sample shape examples from which the notion of principal modes of variation follows naturally. We discuss some details of our implementation of these algorithms in Section 8 and conclude in Section 9. This paper is a bit expository in nature in order to make it self-contained. The reader who is familiar with shape topologies can skip Section 2 and go straight to Section 3.1 to read about the definition of our set of shapes from where he/she can jump to Section 4 and the following sections that contain the core of our contributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Shapes and Shape Topologies</head><p>To define fully the notion of a shape is beyond the scope of this paper in which we use a limited, i.e., purely geometric, definition. It could be argued that the perceptual shape of an object also depends upon the distribution of illumination, the reflectance and texture of its surface; these aspects are not discussed in this paper. In our context we define a shape to be a measurable subset of R 2 . Since we are driven by image applications we also assume that all our shapes are contained in a hold-all open bounded subset of R 2 which we denote by D. The reader can think of D as the "image."</p><p>In the next section we will restrict our interest to a more limited set of shapes but, presently, this is sufficient to allow us to introduce some methods for representing shapes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Characteristic Functions.</head><p>The similarity measure we are about to define is based upon the characteristic functions of the two shapes we want to compare. We denote by X (D) the set of characteristic functions of measurable subsets of D.</p><p>Given two such sets 1 and 2 , we define their distance</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ρ 2 ( 1 , 2 ) = χ 1 -χ 2 L 2 = D (χ 1 (x) -χ 2 (x)) 2 dx 1/2 .</formula><p>This definition also shows that this measure does not "see" differences between two shapes that are of measure 0 (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> adapted from [11, Chap. 3, Fig. </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">= C ∪ C .</formula><p>The proof that this defines a distance follows from the fact that the L 2 norm defines a distance over the set of equivalence classes of square integrable functions (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>). This is nice and one has even more [11, Chap. 3, Theorem 2.1]: the set X (D) is closed and bounded in L 2 (D), and ρ 2 (•, •) defines a complete metric structure on the set of equivalence classes of measurable subsets of D.

Unfortunately, in applications, not all sequences are Cauchy sequences, for example, the minimizing sequences of the energy functions defined in Section 5, and one often requires more, i.e., that any sequence of characteristic functions contains a subsequence that converges to a characteristic function. This stronger property, called compactness, is not satisfied by X (D) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap. 3]</ref>).</p><p>2.2.2. Distance Functions. We therefore turn our attention toward a different similarity measure which is based upon the distance function to a shape. As in the case of characteristic functions, we define equivalent sets and say that two subsets 1 and 2 of D are equivalent iff 1 = 2 . We note by [ ] d the corresponding equivalence class of . Let T (D) be the set of these equivalence classes. The application</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">[ ] d → d : T (D) → C d (D) ⊂ C(D)</formula><p>is injective according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. We can therefore identify the set C d (D) of distance functions to sets of D with the just-defined set of equivalence classes of sets.</p><p>Since C d (D) is a subset of the set C(D) of continuous functions on D, a Banach space <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> when endowed with the norm</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">f C(D) = sup x∈D | f (x)|,</formula><p>it can be shown (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>) that the similarity measure</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ρ([ 1 ] d , [ 2 ] d ) = d 1 -d 2 C(D) = sup x∈D |d 1 (x) -d 2 (x)| (3)</formula><p>is a distance on the set of equivalence classes of sets which induces on this set a complete metric. Moreover, because we have assumed D bounded, the corresponding topology is identical to the one induced by the well-known Hausdorff metric (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ρ H ([ 1 ] d , [ 2 ] d ) = max sup x∈ 2 d 1 (x), sup x∈ 1 d 2 (x) .<label>( 4)</label></formula><p>In fact, we have even more than the identity of the two topologies, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap. 4</ref> An important improvement with respect to the situation in the previous section is (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap. 4</ref> In particular, from any sequence {d n } of distance functions to sets n , one can extract a sequence converging toward the distance function d to a subset of D.</p><p>It would appear that we have reached an interesting stage and that the Hausdorff distance is what we want to measure shape similarities. Unfortunately, this is not so because the convergence of areas and perimeters is lost in the Hausdorff metric, as shown in the following example taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap. 4</ref>  concludes that it is square integrable on D. Hence the distance functions and their gradients are square-integrable, they belong to the Sobolev space W 1,2 (D), a Banach space for the vector norm</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">f -g W 1,2 (D) = f -g L 2 (D) + ∇ f -∇g L 2 (D) ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">L 2 (D) = L 2 (D) × L 2 (D)</formula><p>. This defines a similarity measure for two shapes</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">ρ D ([ 1 ] d , [ 2 ] d ) = d 1 -d 2 W 1,2 (D) ,</formula><p>which turns out to define a complete metric structure on T (D). The corresponding topology is called the W 1,2 -topology. For this metric, the set C d (D) of distance functions is closed in W 1,2 (D), and the mapping</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">d → χ = 1 -|∇d | : C d (D) ⊂ W 1,2 (D) → L 2 (D)</formula><p>is "Lipschitz continuous":</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">χ 1 -χ 2 L 2 (D) ≤ ∇d 1 -∇d 2 L 2 (D) ≤ d 1 -d 2 W 1,2 (D) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>which indeed shows that areas are continuous for the W </p></div>

The reasons for this will become clearer in the sequel. Let us just mention here that it can be seen as an instance of the warping problem: given two shapes 1 and 2 , how do we deform 1 onto 2 ? The applications in the field of medical image processing and analysis are immense (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>). It can also be seen as an instance of the famous (in computer vision) correspondence problem: given two shapes 1 and 2 , how do we find the corresponding point P 2 in 2 of a given point P 1 in 1 ? Note that a solution of the warping problem provides a solution of the correspondence problem if we can track the evolution of any given point during the smooth deformation of the first shape onto the second.</p><p>In order to make things more quantitative, we assume that we are given a function E : C 0 × C 0 → R + , called the energy, which is continuous on S × S for one of the shape topologies of interest. This energy can also be thought of as a measure of the dissimilarity between the two shapes. By smooth, we mean that it is continuous with respect to this topology and that its derivatives are well-defined in a sense we now make more precise.</p><p>We first need the notion of a normal deformation flow of a curve in S.

The resulting shape is noted + β, where β = βn. There is no guarantee that +β is still a shape in S in general but if β is C 0 and ε is small enough, +β is in C 0 . Given two shapes and 0 , the corresponding energy E( , 0 ), and a normal deformation flow β of , the energy E( + εβ, 0 ) is now well-defined for ε sufficiently small.

In our implementation we have used the value of 2. The parameters α and β control the accuracy with which we approximate the sup and inf operators that appear in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">4</ref>). The higher they are, the better the approximation, but the better the approximation, the higher the numerical difficulties due to the "stiffness" of the function which is of course due the nondifferentiability of the Hausdorff distance. As explained in Section 6.1, the values of α and β, together with the function ϕ, can be ultimately related to the coarseness with which one analyzes the values of the distance function of one curve at points on the other curve, see Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref> and<ref type="figure">9</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Closed Curves: The Level Set Method</head><p>The key idea of the level set method is to represent the curve (t) implicitly, i.e., as the zero level of some function u(x, t) defined for x ∈ D. Usually, u is negative inside and positive outside.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OF49</head><p>An important issue is that β is only defined on curve in the PDE t = βn. In many cases, β has a natural extension everywhere in domain D, so that equation u t + β|∇u| = 0 is defined. For instance, when β(x) is the curvature of at point x ∈ , one could choose, at each point x ∈ D, β(x) equal to the curvature of the level set of u going through x. In some other cases, like ours, β can only be computed on and some extension procedure has to be used to get β everywhere in D. This is now classical <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</p><p>It should be noted that the zero level set of function u(•, t) is only extracted to visualize (t), usually with the Marching Cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> which interpolates its position and gives a nice polygonal approximation of it (a triangulated mesh in three dimensions). For obvious speed and accuracy reasons, it is important not to rely on this approximation to compute the velocity β. Useful quantities can generally be computed directly from u. So it is for the normal and the curvature:</p><formula xml:id="formula_165">n = ∇u/|∇u|, κ = -∇ • (∇u/|∇u|),</formula><p>and for the integral of some quantity f (x) over :</p><formula xml:id="formula_166">f (x) d (x) = D f (x)δ(u(x))|∇u| dx,</formula><p>where δ(•) is a one-dimensional Dirac function. Our β also involves the distance function to the curve which has to be known without extracting the zero level set of function u. Usually, one takes the signed distance to the initial curve (0) as an initial value of u. Thus, u(•, 0) can be used to compute β at time t = 0. Yet, u(•, t) has no reason to maintain the distance to (t) . . . except in some implementations where β is extended in such a way that the distance function is preserved during the evolution of u (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>): this is exactly what we need. And what we use! In conclusion, in the case of closed curves, the Hausdorff warping (Section 6) and the shape statistics (Section 7) are implemented with a level set method with: (i) velocity extension; (ii) distance function preserving; and (iii) no need to extract the zero level set (except for visualization).</p><p>The minimization of the W 1,2 norm (Section 5.6 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">18</ref>) is also implemented with the level set method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Further Comparison with Other Approaches and Conclusion</head><p>We have presented in Section 1 the similarities and dissimilarities of our work with that of others. We would like to add to this presentation the fact that ours is an attempt to generalize to a nonlinear setting the work that has been done in a linear setting by such scientists as Cootes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> and by Leventon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> who, like us, proposed to use distance functions to represent shapes in a statistical framework but used a first-order approximation by assuming that the set of distance functions was a linear manifold <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> which, of course, it is not. Our work shows that dropping the incorrect linearity assumption is possible at reasonable costs, both theoretical and computational. Comparison of results obtained in the two frameworks is a matter of future work.</p><p>In this respect we would also like to emphasize that in our framework the process of linear averaging shape representations has been more or less replaced by the linear averaging of the normal deformation fields which are tangent vectors to the manifold of all shapes (see the definition of the covariance operator in Section 7.2) and by solving a PDE based on these normal deformation fields (see the definition of a mean in Section 7.1 and of the deformation modes in Section 7.2).</p><p>It is also interesting to recall the fact that our approach can be seen as the opposite of that consisting of first building a Riemannian structure on the set of shapes, i.e., going from an infinitesimal metric structure to a global one. The infinitesimal structure is defined by an inner product in the tangent space (the set of normal deformation fields) and has to vary continuously from point to point, i.e., from shape to shape. As mentioned before, this is mostly dealt with in the work of Miller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. The problem with these approaches, beside that of having to deal with parametrizations of the shapes, is that there exist global metric structures on the set of shapes (see Section 2.2) which are useful and relevant to the problem of the comparison of shapes but that do not arise from an infinitesimal structure.</p><p>Our approach can be seen as taking the problem from exactly the opposite viewpoint from the previous one: we start with a global metric on the set of shapes (ρ H or the W 1,2 metric) and build smooth functions (in effect smooth approximations of these metrics) that we use as dissimilarity measures or energy functions and minimize using techniques of the calculus of variations by computing their gradient and performing infinitesimal gradient descent. We have seen that in order to compute the gradients we need to define an inner-product of normal deformation flows and the choice of this inner-product may influence the way our algorithms evolve from one shape to another. This last point is related to, but different from, the choice of the Riemaniann metric in the first approach. Its investigation is also a topic of future work.</p><p>The question of local minima is, as always, important. We have mentioned that we have found, when computing the mean of a number of shapes, that our warping was sometimes prone to local minima. This is of course not in contradiction with the fact that our energy is defined globally rather than locally. Given n shapes there Approximations of Shape Metrics and Application to Shape Warping OF51 are in general many shapes that minimize the function defined in Definition 36 and the larger n the larger the number of such shapes, in general. This is not counterintuitive. In fact one may argue, as we do above, that the result of the process of learning an average shape by being shown samples of their distribution should depend upon the order of presentation of the examples. The problem of comparing the behavior of our approach with others, using locally defined metrics, is interesting and important, and another topic of future work.</p><p>Another advantage of our viewpoint is that it apparently extends graciously to higher dimensions thanks to the fact that we do not rely on parametrizations of the shapes and work intrinsically with their distance functions (or approximations thereof). This is clearly also worth pursuing in future work.</p><p>where we have used, in particular, the fact that</p><formula xml:id="formula_167">∇ d (x) = 1 ϕ ( d (x)) ϕ • d(x, •) x -• d(x, •) .</formula><p>We also define </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>note by C d (D) the set of distance functions of nonempty sets of D.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Note that there may exist several means. We know from Proposition 35 that there exists at least one. An algorithm for computing approximations to an empirical mean of N shapes readily follows from the previous section: start from an initial shape 0 and solve the PDE, t = -∇µ( , 1 , . . . , N )n, (0, •) = 0 (•). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref> We show some examples of means computed by this algorithm in Figure <ref type="figure">19</ref>.</p><p>When the number of shapes grows larger, the question of the local minima of µ becomes a problem (see Figure <ref type="figure">20</ref>) and the choice of 0 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref> is an important issue. We have not explored these questions in great detail but observed that the following heuristics led to "visually satisfying" results.</p><p>Suppose that the example shapes are given in some order, according to the way they are indexed from 1 to N . Initialize ˆ (1) to 1 , solve</p><p>and choose ˆ (i+1) = (i+1) at convergence, for i = 1, . . . , N -1. Of course, there is no guarantee that either the result will be independent of the order of presentation (this may or may not be important, depending on the application) or that it will indeed be a local minimum of µ( , 1 , . . . , N ). Another alternative is to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref> by choosing 0 to be one of the given shapes.</p><p>We show the result of computing the mean of nine hands with this method in Figure <ref type="figure">21</ref>.

There remains to show that they generate the whole of A( ). In order to see this, we consider the element β = N i=1 α i (β i -β) of A( ) and look for the coefficients µ k , k = 1, . . . , p, such that</p><p>We take the Hilbert product of both sides of this equation with β j -β to obtain</p><p>We then use <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>, replace v k with</p><p>and obtain</p><p>Faugeras, and R.

By definition</p><p>We replace, in the right-hand side of this equation, v j by its expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>, use Proposition 40, and obtain the desired result.</p><p>The velocities v k , k = 1, . . . , p, can be interpreted as modes of variation of the shape and the σ 2 k 's as variances for these modes. Looking at how the mean shape varies with respect to the kth mode is equivalent to solving the following PDEs:</p><p>with initial conditions (0, •) = ˆ (•). Note that v k is a function of through which has to be reevaluated at each time t. One usually solves these PDEs until the distance to ˆ becomes equal to σ k . An example of this evolution for the case of the fingers is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">23</ref>. Another interesting case, drawn from the example of the eight fish of Figure <ref type="figure">22</ref>, is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">24</ref> where the first four principal modes of the covariance operator corresponding to those eight sample shapes are displayed.</p></div>
