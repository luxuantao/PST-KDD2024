<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Differential Evolution (DE) is a state-of-the art global optimization technique. Considerable research effort has been made to improve this algorithm and apply it to a variety of practical problems. Nevertheless, analytical studies concerning DE are rather rare. This paper surveys the theoretical results obtained so far for DE. A discussion of genetic operators characteristic of DE is coupled with an overview of the population diversity and dynamics models. A comprehensive view on the current-day understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DE is complemented by a list of promising research directions.</p></div>

The top plot in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the citation count of this paper retrieved from the Scopus database. For comparison, the bottom plot shows the relative increase in the number of articles about evolutionary algorithms (EA) indexed in the database.

The rest offer modifications and improvements of the algorithm. Despite this massive amount of research, very few papers concern the theoretical foundations of DE. These studies lead to a better understanding of the algorithm and also provide tips for tuning parameters and further modifications. Only single sections in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref> are devoted to discussing the most prominent analytical results about the algorithm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Differential Mutation</head><p>The differential mutation operator has a few basic variants which are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>. The most common one, denoted as DE/rand/1, consists of randomly choosing three individuals from the population and adding to the first of them x 𝑟 1 (known as the base vector) a scaled difference between two others x 𝑟 2 and x 𝑟 3</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u 𝑖 ← x 𝑟 1 + 𝐹 • (x 𝑟 2 -x 𝑟 3 ). (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>Parameter 𝐹 is called a scaling factor, as it shrinks the length of the difference vector (x 𝑟 2 -x 𝑟 3 ) appearing in equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1)</ref>. The indices that are the realizations of a random variable are denoted by 𝑟, whereas the indices that are deterministic are represented by other symbols such as 𝑖 or 𝑗. The indices of individuals used by the mutation operator are often required to be pairwise distinct, however this assumption is usually not taken into account in theoretical analyses; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>. Skipping this condition causes independence of the location of the mutant u 𝑖 from the location of its parent</p><p>x 𝑖 . Keeping it would introduce only a weak dependence, especially for large populations, and would not hinder the optimization performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>Price and Storn also defined the DE/rand/𝑘 variant which uses a larger number of difference vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u 𝑖 ← x 𝑟 1 + 𝐹 1 • (x 𝑟 2 -x 𝑟 3 ) + ... + 𝐹 𝑘 • (x 𝑟 2𝑘 -x 𝑟 2𝑘+1 ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the scaling factors are usually assumed to be equal 𝐹 1 = 𝐹 2 = ... = 𝐹 𝑘 = 𝐹 . In practice, the most frequently encountered mutation operators have one or two difference vectors.</p><p>Replacing a random base vector x 𝑟 1 with the best vector x best from the population gives another important variant of DE, denoted as DE/best/1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">u 𝑖 ← x best + 𝐹 • (x 𝑟 1 -x 𝑟 2 ).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The majority of differential mutation operators can be represented as special cases of a generalized formula which uses a sum of 𝑘 scaled difference vectors and a weighted mean between the best individual and a randomly selected one:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">u 𝑖 ← 𝜆x best + (1 -𝜆)x 𝑟 1 + 𝑘 ∑︁ 𝑗=1 𝐹 𝑗 • (x 𝑟 2𝑗 -x 𝑟 2𝑗+1 ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝜆 is a scalar taking values in the range from 0 to 1. In particular, formula A weighted mean between the best individual and current individual (rather than a random one) is used in the DE/current-to-best/𝑘 operator:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">u 𝑖 ← 𝜆x best + (1 -𝜆)x 𝑖 + 𝑘 ∑︁ 𝑗=1 𝐹 𝑗 • (x 𝑟 2𝑗-1 -x 𝑟 2𝑗 ).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The most complex of the proposed mutation variants is DE/either-or <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>, in which with probability 𝑝 f , mutants are generated according to scheme DE/rand/1, and with probability 1 -𝑝 f , according to a modified relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">u 𝑖 ← {︃ x 𝑟 1 + 𝐹 • (x 𝑟 2 -x 𝑟 3 ) if rand(0, 1) &lt; 𝑝 f , x 𝑟 1 + 𝐾 • (x 𝑟 2 + x 𝑟 3 -2x 𝑟 1 ) otherwise,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where 𝐾 = 𝐹 +1 2 . This operator replaces both differential mutation and crossover operators, ensuring rotational invariance of the resulting algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Crossover</head><p>In DE, the crossover operator is based on exchanging elements between vectors encoding the parent and the mutant. It is introduced to promote the population diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. In 𝑛-dimensional space, an offspring o 𝑖 = [𝑜 1 , ..., 𝑜 𝑛 ] 𝑇 is created through exchanging elements of vectors that represent its parent x 𝑖 = [𝑥 1 , ..., 𝑥 𝑛 ] 𝑇 and the mutant u 𝑖 = [𝑢 1 , ..., 𝑢 𝑛 ] 𝑇 . The most common variant is binomial crossover, denoted as DE/𝑋/𝑌 /bin. The offspring is created by randomly choosing elements either from the parent or from the mutant:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝑜 𝑗 = {︃ 𝑢 𝑗 if rand(0, 1) ≤ 𝐶 r 𝑥 𝑗 otherwise for 𝑗 = 1, ..., 𝑛.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The number of elements inherited from the mutant is described using binomial distribution with 𝑛 independent repeats and success probability 𝐶 r . The offspring is also required to contain at least one element from the mutant, however this assumption is often neglected in theoretical studies;</p><p>cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>. Under unit crossover rate 𝐶 r = 1, the offspring is equal to the</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">mutant o 𝑖 = u 𝑖 .</formula><p>In exponential crossover DE/𝑋/𝑌 /exp, two numbers are randomly drawn. The first one is the index 𝑘 which is uniformly distributed in the range from 1 to 𝑛, and the second is the length 𝑙, which is sampled from a censored geometric distribution with success probability 𝐶 r . The offspring is a clone of its parent, in which elements from 𝑘 to 𝑘 + 𝑙 (modulo search space dimension 𝑛) come from the mutant:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">𝑜 𝑗 = {︃ 𝑢 𝑗 if 𝑗 -1 ∈ {𝑘 (mod 𝑛), ..., 𝑘 + 𝑙 (mod 𝑛)} 𝑥 𝑗 otherwise for 𝑗 = 1, ..., 𝑛.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The continuous equivalent of the geometric distribution is the exponential distribution, which explains the symbol DE/𝑋/𝑌 /exp.</p></div>

However, the effect of guiding the popu- Selection consists of comparing an offspring with its parent. Only the better of them is chosen for the next generation. The greediness of this mechanism induces elitism, but it operates locally, which promotes the maintenance of the population spread. This approach is distinct from population-based methods of proportional and rank reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Selection in DE can be implemented either after the completion of the whole population of mutants or in a steady-state manner through immediately replacing the losing vector. Most of the theoretical studies address the former approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Generalizations of DE</head><p>A large number of modifications to the original DE algorithm have been proposed so far. These include:</p><p>1. Parameter and strategy adaptation in DE <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, e.g. randomization and self-adaptation of parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>, adaptation of the population size <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>, strategy adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</p><p>2. Modification of the differential mutation operator, e.g. by choosing the individuals based on their mutual distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> or fitness values <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</p><p>3. Enhancing DE with new mechanisms such as population archive <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>,</p><p>genotypic topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, opposition-based initialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> etc.</p><p>4. Hybridization. For instance, algorithm AM-DEGL <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> uses global and local neighbourhoods from paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, self-adaptation of parameters inspired by article <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and local optimization based on the approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> and conducted with a classical optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</p><p>These and many more algorithms are surveyed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>. The theoretical analyses are typically done for classical DE. Sometimes, the obtained results can be easily generalized to describe more cases. However, the introduction of new evolutionary mechanisms makes this task more challenging and creates a need for tailored theoretical studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Minimalistic variants of DE</head><p>Obtaining analytical results is difficult for complex DE frameworks. On the other hand, simple methods lead to clear, interpretable models with low</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D</formula><p>ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT computational overhead. Such a bottom-up approach towards algorithmic design does not necessarily hinder the performance of the algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>.</p><p>A minimalistic variant of DE was recently introduced by Price <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. The Black-Box Differential Evolution (BBDE) algorithm consists only of differential mutation and local selection. The current individual x 𝑖 is used as the base vector and generates an offspring through the addition of a randomly scaled difference vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">o 𝑖 ← x 𝑖 + 𝐹 𝑟 • (x 𝑟 1 -x 𝑟 2 ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where 𝐹 𝑟 is sampled from a log-normal distribution. Next, the offspring competes with its parent for survival to the following generation.</p><p>Scrapping all non-essential elements of DE was done in an attempt to introduce possibly many invariances to the search algorithm in order to improve its robustness. This approach seems to be inspired by Hansen's work on another state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm, CMA-ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Convergence and invariances</head><p>There is a large body of papers on the theoretical foundations of classical evolutionary algorithms. Numerous studies concern individual aspects of these algorithms, such as the encoding of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, adaptation mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> or constraint handling techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. Many papers address individual algorithms -their description can be found e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. The usefulness of these studies is limited by strong assumptions and significant differences between particular algorithms.</p><p>In the following sections, we indicate the main areas of theoretical studies of evolutionary algorithms to present the analyses conducted for DE in a wider context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Computational complexity</head><p>Evolutionary algorithms generally lack theoretically justified stopping criteria. Usually, the algorithm is stopped after exceeding a maximum number of iterations 𝐺 max . Stopping conditions could also be based on monitoring the population diversity, the required value of the objective function or the frequency of improvements of the best individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. Parallel and distributed processing poses new conceptual challenges towards measuring complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>For serially processed DE, computational complexity is driven by the number of calls to genetic operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. Their execution time is proportional to the search space dimension 𝑛. Consequently, the number of elementary operations is proportional to the maximal iteration number 𝐺 max (the outer loop in Pseudocode 1) and the population size 𝑁 p (the inner loop):</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">𝒪(𝑛 • 𝑁 p • 𝐺 max ).<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> implicitly assumes that the computational complexity of the objective function evaluation 𝑐(𝑛) is at most linearly dependent on the search space dimension 𝑛. Otherwise, the complexity of DE is not driven by the execution of genetic operators but rather by the number of objective function evaluations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">𝒪(𝑐(𝑛) • 𝑁 p • 𝐺 max ).<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The termination of computations does not necessarily coincide with finding the global minimum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Convergence proofs</head><p>Rudolph <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> provided a sufficient condition for a weak convergence of a continuous optimization method to the global optimum. An algorithm, after initialization at any feasible point, must with non-zero probability generate a finite series of points finishing in a non-zero measure neighbourhood of any other feasible point. Consequently, weak convergence happens if the whole feasible set is sufficiently densely sampled. This allows one to check which optimization methods cannot guarantee global convergence. Classical DE is one of such methods. When the whole population is initialized within a sufficiently large attraction basin of a single local optimum, the population cannot leave this basin because of elitist selection. Formal proof of this statement is given by Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> using drift analysis for a specially created "deceptive" function.</p><p>Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> show that convergence with probability 1 can be obtained after softening the selection in DE and adding a mutation strategy that samples from the whole feasible set. Another way to introduce the global optimization property to DE is to re-initialize the population, or its part, every 𝑘 tol iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. Although the global convergence property is desirable for evolutionary algorithms, its practical usefulness is typically limited by the prohibitively long time necessary to ensure that the optimum is reached. For instance, DE behaves in exactly the same way for the quadratic function</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">𝑓 (x) = x 𝑇</formula><p>x as for all radial functions, whose values depend solely on the distance from the origin and are strictly increasing. DE uses only the order between individuals and operates in an ordinal rather than interval scale.</p><p>This property might be useful in the rare cases when it is possible to compare two solutions, but it is not feasible to quantify the objective function, e.g.</p><p>when comparing preference towards certain market baskets.</p><p>Classical DE is not rotationally invariant. An angle-preserving transformation of the search space changes the offspring distribution. This is a result of crossover operators which exchange elements along the axes of the coordinate system. This problem is addressed by rotationally invariant crossover operators. In DE/either-or <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, arithmetic recombination is built into the differential mutation. As an alternative solution, Guo and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> proposed crossover along the eigenvectors of the population rather than the axes of the coordinate system. This approach makes use of the experimentally observed adaptation of the population to the local shape of the objective function, which is known as "contour fitting".</p><p>Price <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> analysed both classical DE and DE/either-or. He showed that these algorithms suffer from mutation bias, i.e. a situation in which the mutants are not centre-symmetrically distributed around the current vector.</p><p>The requirement of central symmetry is stronger than the coincidence of the expectation of the mutant distribution with the current vector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>Price <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> also underlined the presence of selection bias, i.e. a situation in which trial vectors are not symmetric around the current individual but shifted towards the population midpoint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">x mean = 1 𝑁 p 𝑁p ∑︁ 𝑖=1 x 𝑖 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Selection bias disappears if the current individual x 𝑖 is used as the base vector. These ideas have led to a drift-free DE, in which "each operation has a unique function: mutation explores, recombination homogenizes and selection improves" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Price elaborated this approach further in the BBDE algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> presented in section 2.4.</p></div>

It shows that in a finite search space for any non-repeating optimization algorithm and any performance measure, obtaining above-average performance for one class of problems correlates with below-average performance for another class. There are some discussions about the assumptions necessary to generalize the no free lunch theorem to continuous domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.

Consequently, the no free lunch theorem does not undermine the sense of developing new optimizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.

These results were further The above theoretical result seems to contradict experimentally observed cases in which DE does not find the global minimum but converges to a local one. Ghosh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref> use an important additional assumption of an infinite population initialized in an area containing the global minimum.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">DE and Markov Chain Monte Carlo</head><p>Ter Braak <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref> introduced DE into a framework of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The goal was to draw samples with a density proportional to the objective function values rather than perform standard optimization.</p><p>The objective function was assumed to be the density of some continuous probability distribution, i.e. a non-negative function with a unit integral.</p><p>The DE-MC algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref> differs from classical DE in two respects. First, differential mutation uses the parent as the base vector and adds a realization of a normal random variable:</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">u 𝑖 ← x 𝑖 + 𝐹 • (x 𝑟 1 -x 𝑟 2 ) + e, where e ∼ 𝒩 (0, 𝑏 • I), (<label>52</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_76">)</formula><p>where 𝑏 is a small positive scalar and I is an identity matrix.</p><p>Second, greedy selection between the parent x 𝑖 and offspring o 𝑖 = u 𝑖 is replaced with the Metropolis acceptance rule.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>The DE-MC algorithm yields a Markov chain, which has a unique stationary distribution with density 𝑓 . In the proof, Ter Braak first shows that the resulting chain is reversible and therefore the stationary distribution is proportional to 𝑓 . To derive the uniqueness of the chain, the unboundedness of the support of e is necessary, so that the population can move between all of the local optima by means of macromutation.</p><p>From the Bayesian point of view, the significance of Ter Braak's results consists of the fact that the DE-MC algorithm adapts the direction and range of the sampling distribution and effectively accommodates heavy-tailed and multimodal target distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>. There is still a gap between the results obtained on a theoretical basis and their practical use. However, it is worth mentioning approaches which have successfully bridged these two areas. Among the results that have influenced applications is Zaharie's analysis of critical values for the scaling factor and crossover rate. The developments of DE/either-or and BBDE by Price were also motivated by theoretical considerations. Recently, Arabas and Biedrzycki improved the efficiency of various EAs, including several types of DE, through the analysis of the midpoint dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>. 3. Population size 𝑁 p has gained the least attention of all the control parameters of DE. In theoretical studies it is usually bypassed by analysing infinite population size. This assumption is sometimes implicitly introduced as a consequence of replacing the particular population characteristics with their expectations. The infinite size assumption is however poorly fulfilled in cases of small or dynamic populations, which often lead to improved performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. It would be interesting to generalize the population diversity and dynamics models to explicitly handle the population size.</p><p>4. Over consecutive iterations, population distribution in DE adapts to the local shape of the optimized function. This phenomenon is known as "contour fitting" and plays a significant role in the optimization of highly-conditioned functions. Despite common empirical evidence, "contour fitting" is still waiting for theoretical grounding. Algorithmic simplicity does not necessarily hinder performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>.</p><p>The search for a general, synthetic framework may concern not only whole algorithms but also their elements, such as genetic operators. 7. It would be useful to characterize the properties of optimization problem classes that would be particularly easy, or particularly hard, to be solved by DE. The existence of such classes of tasks is a consequence of the no free lunch theorem. Although some guidelines in this area are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref>, they are of experimental origin and have a general, descriptive character. These guidelines would benefit from being grounded in mathematical derivation. However, it is not clear to what extent it is feasible to formalize non-trivial features such as deceptiveness or a lack of clear structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>. Apart from the algorithm as a whole, guidelines could also address the use of particular elements of DE, for instance the choice of appropriate mutation operators.</p></div>

This allows empirical and theoretical results to be generalized. The incorporation of invariances is argued to be a fundamental design criterion for the development of search algorithms<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. Classical DE is characterized by scale and translation invariance. DE behaves in the same way for an objective function 𝑓 : R 𝑛 → R and its transform 𝑓 1 (x) = 𝑓 (𝑎x + b) if the initial population is scaled accordingly, where 𝑎 ̸ = 0 is a scalar and b ∈ R 𝑛 a translation vector. DE is also invariant to order-preserving transformations. The selection mechanism of DE requires only an indication of which of the two solutions is preferable. Therefore, DE behaves in the same way for an objective function 𝑓 and its order-preserving transformations, such as shifting 𝑓 2 (x) = 𝑎 + 𝑓 (x), scaling by a positive number 𝑎 &gt; 0, 𝑓 3 (x) = 𝑎 • 𝑓 (x), or composition with a strictly increasing function 𝑠 : R → R, 𝑓 4 (x) = 𝑠(𝑓 (x)). Consequently, results obtained for simple models generalize to the whole classes of problems.</figDesc></figure>

Instead, they used it to derive a non-constructive proof of the convergence of DE.

Next, they showed that this function equals zero in the global minimum and is positive for all other arguments. Its changes between consecutive iterations, which are an approximation of a time derivative, decrease during the execution of the algorithm.

This model adequately describes the dynamics of large populations in which the empirical distribution is close to the expected distribution. Based on a simulation study, Zhang and Sanderson [13] conjectured that after a certain time, the rate of change of parameters of the Gaussian distribution stabilizes. The results from Zhang and Sanderson allow practitioners to compute the critical value of the scaling factor 𝐹 , below which the undesirable phenomenon of premature convergence occurs. Far away from the minimum, the quadratic objective function locally resembles a hyperplane and the critical value is 𝐹 = √︀ 1/(𝜋 -1) ≈ 0.683, whereas in the neighbourhood of the minimum it drops to 𝐹 = 0.48.</figDesc></figure>

This is clear from bibliometric analysis, which indicates huge disproportion between theory-oriented and experimental studies. Despite several valuable results obtained from previous studies, there are still many open issues within theoretical analyses of DE. Below we unfold some of the promising research directions. M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 1. The two features distinguishing DE from classical evolutionary algorithms are differential mutation and local, greedy selection. Although the former has been the focus of several studies, the latter seems largely unexplored. Direct modelling of selection in DE is a difficult task due to its elitist, local character and dependence on the objective function. Nevertheless, the impact of the selection mechanism on search dynamics is profound. Investigations into this issue could clarify whether DE resembles an adaptive swarm optimizer or rather a group of loosely related hill-climbers. 2. Population dynamics models for DE need further development. The ones currently available provide little operational advice. Moreover, the models are much more mathematically complicated than the original DE algorithm. Consequently, conclusions are less straightforward, which hinders their translation into new algorithmic developments. Population dynamics models are a possible way to compute statistics such as the expected first hitting time, i.e. the average time necessary to find an optimal solution.</figDesc></figure>
