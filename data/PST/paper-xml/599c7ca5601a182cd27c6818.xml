<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As clouds move to the network edge to facilitate mobile applications, edge cloud providers are facing new challenges on resource allocation. As users may move and resource prices may vary arbitrarily, resources in edge clouds must be allocated and adapted continuously in order to accommodate such dynamics. In this paper, we first formulate this problem with a comprehensive model that captures the key challenges, then introduce a gap-preserving transformation of the problem, and propose a novel online algorithm that optimally solves a series of subproblems with a carefully designed logarithmic objective, finally producing feasible solutions for edge cloud resource allocation over time. We further prove via rigorous analysis that our online algorithm can provide a parameterized competitive ratio, without requiring any a priori knowledge on either the resource price or the user mobility. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic data, we further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal results with an empirical competitive ratio of about 1.1, reduces the total cost by up to 4× compared to static approaches, and outperforms the online greedy one-shot optimizations by up to 70%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Pushing the cloud frontier to the Internet edge has attracted tremendous interest not only from cloud operators of the IT service/software industry but also from cellular carriers of the telecom industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Connected by dedicated networks or the Internet, edge clouds may not have a huge amount of resources, but they are in close proximity to end users at various locations such as metropolitan centers, residential neighborhoods, cellular base stations, and WiFi access points <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Serving end users from edge clouds has many advantages such as lower or even bounded delay, reduced wide-area traffic, dedicated security or reliability, etc.</p><p>A core problem in such an edge cloud computing paradigm is the dynamic resource allocation for the services operated in edge clouds for serving mobile users, which often involves multiple challenges: First, resource allocation for individual users may not be a single-location transaction in terms of both cost and performance. When a user accesses the service in an edge cloud, she may eventually have resources allocated for her in multiple nearby and heterogeneous edge clouds as a result of cost optimization or capacity constraints, as long as her service quality can be guaranteed. The user's perceived service quality in terms of the total access delay may include the network delay between the user and the edge cloud she connects to and also between this edge cloud and all the other related edge clouds that hold her workload.</p><p>Further, resource allocation is not a one-time operation and needs to be continuously adapted to accommodate user movements, incurring the "adaptation cost" over time. Every user can move arbitrarily in the system, and, from a timeslotted view, a user may connect to one edge cloud in one time slot and switch to another in the next. Each time slot may have its own optimal resource allocation, which may, however, become suboptimal if the adaptation cost during time-slot transition is considered. The adaptation cost refers to hardware wear-and-tear (such as switching on/off a server) or the resource leading time (such as booting up or shutting down a virtual machine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; it can also account for the bandwidth cost in the case of workload migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, resource allocation needs to be performed on the fly, without any knowledge about future resource price and user location dynamics. It is usually hard or even impossible to predict how the resource price at each edge cloud will vary <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and how each user will move over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Without such prediction, it is difficult to make an informed and good decision of resource allocation at each time slot; it is even more difficult to make decisions that are competitive, with guaranteed approximation towards the best decisions that can ever be made when assuming perfect knowledge about the future, which, however, is under our consideration.</p><p>Despite the extensive existing research on resource allocation in the cloud context in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, only a few have studied online resource allocation in edge clouds, falling short in addressing the three aforementioned challenges. Most of them often assume statistical knowledge about user mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, or rely on prediction of future costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In addition, the resource adaptation cost has not been well considered until recently in the cloud in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and in edge clouds in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; nevertheless, none of them consider user mobility or its influence on resource allocation and adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the online and user-mobility-driven optimization of the costs of allocation, reconfiguration, service quality, and migration altogether in edge clouds, under unpredictable resource prices and user movements. We make three contributions:</p><p>We build a comprehensive model to capture the optimization problem of online resource allocation in edge clouds. Our model focuses on four types of costs, but can capture a wide range of different types of costs in general. The first two are static costs associated with every independent time slot: the allocation cost which captures the usage of cloud resources such as severs, virtual machines, and energy, and the service quality cost which captures the total access delay between users and clouds and between clouds themselves. The other two are dynamic costs related to every pair of consecutive time slots: the reconfiguration cost which reflects the changes of the amount of allocated resources, and the migration cost which reflects the movements of users' workloads. The static costs adopt affine models; the reconfiguration cost accounts for adding resources only, as removing resources is often fast and incurs negligible cost; the migration cost accounts for both incoming and outgoing migrations for each edge cloud due to user mobility. We pursue the optimization of the total cost over time while serving each user's workload and respecting the capacity limit of each edge cloud.</p><p>We transform our problem and propose an efficient online algorithm, for which, via rigorous competitive analysis, we prove a parameterized competitive ratio. We first apply a transformation to the migration cost in our originally formulated problem to make it easier to work with, while guaranteeing that any online algorithm for the resulting problem with a certain competitive ratio would provide the same competitive ratio for the original problem. Then, our major contribution is the design of an online algorithm based on the regularization technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which decouples our original problem into a series of subproblems that are solvable in each independent time slot, only using the solution obtained for the previous time slot as input. The series of solutions generated in each time slot thus constitute a feasible solution to our original problem. Our online algorithm assumes no priori knowledge on either the user mobility or the resource price, thus allowing for arbitrary dynamics on them. By relaxation and primaldual properties, we are able to demonstrate that our algorithm always outputs resource allocation decisions for each mobile user in each time slot, with a provable competitive gunrantee even for the worst-case inputs.</p><p>We carry out extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed online algorithm. We first test it with the real-world data, where we select 15 metro stations from the Rome metro system as the locations of edge clouds and we use the Rome taxi dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to emulate user mobility. The results show that up to 4× reduction on the total cost can be achieved compared to the static approaches which are typically employed in edge clouds. Moreover, our algorithm produces near-optimal results with an empirical competitive ratio around 1.1 and outperforms the online greedy approach by up to 60%. We also test the algorithm with synthetic data and the results are consistent with that in the real-world data case, proving the effectiveness and generality of our algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MODEL FORMULATION</head><p>We describe our model for each of the components in an edge cloud system, based on which we formulate the resource allocation problem in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Edge Cloud System</head><p>We consider a time-slotted system over T time slots that are denoted by the set T = {1, 2, ..., T }. We envisage I edge clouds, denoted by the set I = {1, 2, ..., I}, in the system. An edge cloud is defined as a pool of virtualized computing resources, which is usually collocated with a cellular base station or a WiFi access point. Each edge cloud is equipped with a certain number of servers and the maximum capacity of an edge cloud i is defined as C i . All the edge clouds are connected to one another via dedicated carrier networks and the network delay between two edge clouds i and i , i.e., the inter-cloud delay, is given by d(i, i ), where we define d(i, i) = 0, ∀i ∈ I. Each edge cloud is supposed to cover a small geographical area and any area will only receive coverage from a single edge cloud.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Users and Workload</head><p>We assume a set J = {1, 2, ..., J} of J users with mobile devices that are moving around in the system. In a certain time slot t ∈ T , a user j ∈ J connects to an edge cloud l j,t ∈ I that covers the vicinity of the user and accesses the service or offloads computation tasks, incurring a total amount λ j of workload in the system. For the purpose of cost reduction by taking advantage of the heterogeneity of the edge clouds, the edge cloud operator may distribute the workload from each user to any of the edge clouds given that the service quality is guaranteed and workload redistribution is carried out in the form of workload migration. We denote by x i,j,t the amount of resources that will be allocated for user j in edge cloud i at time t and we enforce i∈I x i,j,t ≥ λ j in order to successfully meet the demand from the user. The delay between the user and the connected edge cloud, i.e., the access delay, is denoted by d(j, l j,t ). As users are moving, l j,t and d(j, l j,t ) can vary across time slots. To stay generic, we make no assumption on the mobility pattern of the users, i.e., the movement of each user is arbitrary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Costs</head><p>We consider four aspects of costs for the edge cloud system: the operation cost, the service quality cost, the reconfiguration cost, and the migration cost, where the former two fall into the category of static cost that are independent in each time slot while the latter two belong to the category of dynamic cost that is accounted across time slots. These costs are able to represent the most prominent expenditure from the perspective of the cloud operator.</p><p>1) The operation cost: This cost refers to server or virtual machine usage, regular hardware or service maintenance, energy consumption, and even carbon emission, all of which can be captured by the following function in general:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Cost op = t i j a i,t x i,j,t ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a i,t denotes the "operation price" (i.e., the unit cost) in time slot t. Note that we allow arbitrary variations on the operation price over time, and such variations can be heterogeneous for different edge clouds due to different hardware or software specifications and energy prices.</p><p>2) The reconfiguration cost: This cost is charged in proportion to the amount of workload that has been increased across any two consecutive time slots in each edge cloud. As users move, the operator may redistribute the workload from each user, which results in adapting the amount of resources allocated in each edge cloud. Such adaptation involves powering up a physical server or booting a virtual machine on an active server, which would incur some inevitable delay for preparing the resources and would also bring wear-and-tear to the hardware. We assume that virtual machines are the smallest resource segment in the edge clouds. The reconfiguration price (i.e., the cost for increasing unit resource) is denoted by c i for edge cloud i. By defining function (x) + = max{x, 0} for all x ∈ R, the total reconfiguration cost is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Cost rc = t i c i ⎛ ⎝ j x i,j,t - j x i,j,t-1 ⎞ ⎠ + ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where j x i,j,tj x i,j,t-1</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">+</formula><p>captures the increase of the workload at edge cloud i when transitioning from time slot (t-1) to time slot t. The cost associated with reducing the amount of resources is omitted as usually that can be completed very fast and the cost is usually negligible.</p><p>3) The service quality cost: This cost is defined in proportion to the network delay experienced by each user. From the operator's view, the workload from each user may be distributed to any of the edge clouds in the system for cost optimization. However, the quality of service has to be guaranteed. For a given edge cloud i and a user j, the service quality cost is calculated as the sum of the access delay and the weighted inter-cloud delay, i.e., d(j, l j,t ) + i x i,j,t d(l j,t , i)/λ j . Straightforwardly, the total service quality cost is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Cost sq = t j d(j, l j,t ) + i x i,j,t λ j d(l j,t , i) . (3)</formula><p>4) The migration cost: This cost represents the "price" being paid when we migrate some workload from one edge cloud to another due to the bandwidth cost associated with data movement. Such cost is dynamic and is usually counted at both ends of a migration. We denote by b out i and b in i the unit migration cost associated with data moving out of and into edge cloud i, respectively. Denoting by z out i,t and z in i,t the amount of workload being migrated out of and into edge cloud i at time t, respectively, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">z out i,t = j (x i,j,t-1 -x i,j,t ) + , z in i,t = j (x i,j,t -x i,j,t-1 ) + .</formula><p>The total migration cost Cost mg can be captured by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Cost mg = t i b out i z out i,t + b in i z in i,t .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Note that the reconfiguration cost is dictated by the change of the collective workload of all the users at the same edge cloud, while the migration cost is only related to the workload change of every individual user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Problem Formulation</head><p>Our goal is to design an online optimizer which takes the user's workload and location as input and continuously decides where to distribute the workload for each user and allocate resources at each edge cloud accordingly such that the total cost is minimized over time. The total cost is the weighted sum of all the aforementioned costs, as given by Cost op + Cost rc + Cost sq + Cost mg . For the simplicity of expression, we omit the weights here but we will keep them during our evaluation. In each time slot t ∈ T , the resource allocation decision x i,j,t-1 for the previous time slot (t -1) might become suboptimal due to the variation of a i,t and the change of l j,t as a result of user movement. Therefore, the optimizer will need to redistribute the workload among all the edge clouds in order to maintain optimal cost efficiency. However, the redistribution of workload comes with additional costs, i.e., Cost rc for reconfiguring the edge clouds and Cost mg for migrating the workload. Ideally, the optimizer would make the best tradeoff between the static and the dynamic costs.</p><p>Having all the aforementioned notations, the resource allocation problem can further be formalized into the following linear program, denoted as P 0 .</p><p>min</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P 0 = static Cost op + Cost sq + dynamic Cost rc + Cost mg s.t. i x i,j,t ≥ λ j , ∀j, ∀t, (6a) j x i,j,t ≤ C i , ∀i, ∀t,<label>(6b)</label></formula><p>x i,j,t ≥ 0, ∀i, ∀j, ∀t. (</p><p>Constraint (6a) ensures sufficient resources are allocated at each edge cloud; constraint (6b) guarantees the capacity limit of each edge cloud. Note that all the costs have time-varying factors corresponding to the uncertainties or dependencies across consecutive time slots. As a result, there is no once-forall solution for the problem in each separate time slot from an online perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Example</head><p>We observe that the problem can be easily solved by directly applying a linear program solver (e.g., GLPK) if we are given all the input data including the operation prices and the user mobility patterns in all time slots. However, this is impossible in the online setting, where the input data is revealed step by step over time. Without any a priori knowledge, a nature solution would be greedily adopting the best decision in each independent time slot. However, we show by examples that this online greedy approach is suboptimal in many cases. We first consider the example in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a), where we have a system with two edge clouds and one user is moving around them. The four types of prices are given in the figure and the user is assumed to have one unit of workload. We consider three time slots where in the first time slot the user is connected to edge cloud A and then, it moves to B in the second time slot and moves back to A in the third time slot. We now show that greedy can be too aggressive. Following the greedy approach, the user workload would be migrated from A to B in the second time slot (as 2.1+1+1.5 &gt; 1+1+1+1.5) and then will be migrated back to A in the third time slot (as 2.1+1+1.5 &gt; 1+1+1+1.5). The total cost is then calculated as (1+1.5)+(1+1+1+1.5)+(1+1+1+1.5) = 11.5, where both migration and reconfiguration costs are incurred in the last two time slots while the service quality cost is minimized as the workload is following the user all the time. However, with a holistic view on all the time slots, the optimal solution would keep the user workload in A throughout the three time slots, resulting in a total cost of (1 + 1.5) + (2.1 + 1 + 1.5) + (1+1.5) = 9.6. The second example in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(b) shows that greedy can also be too conservative, where greedy would keep the workload all the time at A (as 1.9+1+1.5 &lt; 1+1+1+1.5) with a total cost of 11.3, while the optimal solution would migrate the workload to B in the second time slot and brings a total cost of only 9.5.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">workload migration price = 1 operation price reconfiguration price = 1 A B [1, 2.1, 1] [1, 1, 2.1] A B [1, 1.9, 1.9] [1, 1, 1]</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ONLINE ALGORITHM DESIGN</head><p>We discuss the design of an online algorithm for resource allocation in edge clouds in this section. Before presenting the algorithm, we first carry out a gap-preserving transformation to simplify the original problem. The proposed algorithm is then based on solving in each time slot a subproblem with a carefully designed logarithmic objective over time, and the solutions for all the subprograms will finally constitute a feasible solution for the original resource allocation problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Transformation</head><p>We notice that the migration cost in P 0 is counted bidirectionally, which is too complicated to handle. To simplify this expression, we first make a transformation on the migration cost in the objective of P 0 , from which we generate the following new program P 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">min P 1 = Cost op + Cost rc + Cost sq + t i b i z in i,t s.t. (6a), (6b), (<label>6c</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where we define b i b out i + b in i . The intuition behind this transformation is to combine the migration costs counted in both directions into a single direction. The transformation is gap-preserving while improving the tractability of the problem. More specifically, by following similar techniques used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, we are able to show that Lemma 1. Any r-competitive online algorithm that solves P 1 also yields a r-competitive online algorithm for P 0 .</p><p>Proof. For each edge cloud i ∈ I, we have that the accumulative workload x i during the whole time period [1, T ] is bounded by the capacity C i of the edge cloud, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">x i = | t z in i,t - t z out i,t | ≤ C i .</formula><p>Consequently, the following result can be derived.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P 0 = t i (b out i z out i,t + b in i z in i,t ) = t i b out i t z in i,t ± x i + i b in i z in i,t ≥ t i (b out i + b in i )z in i,t - i b out i C i ≥ P 1 - i b out i C i Define σ = i b out i C i</formula><p>as a constant and we have P 1 ≤ P 0 + σ, which indicates that P 1 is upper bounded by P 0 plus a constant σ. This completes the proof as any online algorithm that produces a solution with objective value bounded by r times the optimal of P 1 will also be a solution that is bounded by r times the optimal of P 0 within a constant rσ.</p><p>The above result provides us the convenience to consider only the problem P 1 hereafter. We also observe that the migration cost can be decomposed for individual users. By introducing auxiliary variables z i,j,t where z i,j,t = (x i,j,tx i,j,t-1 ) + and z in i,t = j z i,j,t , we rewrite the objective function of P 1 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">P 1 = Cost op + Cost rc + Cost sq + t i j b i z i,j,t . (9)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Online Algorithm</head><p>We now present the design of an online algorithm for resource allocation. In the online setting, competitive ratio is defined as the ratio of the objective of an online algorithm for a given online optimization problem where the input is revealed over time and the optimal objective obtained assuming all the input for the problem is pre-given, i.e., offline optimal. The competitive ratio is used to quantify the quality of the solutions produced by an online algorithm. To simplify the presentation, we denote by x i,t the total amount of resources allocated in edge cloud i at time t, i.e., x i,t = j x i,j,t .</p><p>Our online algorithm is based on regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, i.e., solving a series of regularized versions of P 1 . At the beginning of each time slot t ∈ T , observing l j,t and taking x * i,j,t-1 (x * i,j,0 0) which is the workload assignment decision made in time slot (t -1) as input, we solve the following problem P 2 and obtain the resource allocation decisions x * i,j,t for the current time slot.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">min P 2 (t) = i j a i,t x i,j,t + j d(j, l j,t ) + i x i,j,t λ j d(l j,t , i) + i c i η i (x i,t + ε 1 ) ln x i,t + ε 1 x * i,t-1 + ε 1 -x i,t + i j b i τ i,j (x i,j,t + ε 2 ) ln x i,j,t + ε 2 x * i,j,t-1 + ε 2 -x i,j,t s.t. i x i,j,t ≥ λ j ∀j, (<label>10a</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">) k∈I\i j x k,j,t ≥ j λ j -C i , ∀i, (<label>10b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">x i,j,t ≥ 0, ∀i, ∀j,<label>(10c)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">η i = ln (1 + C i /ε 1 ), τ i,j = ln(1 + λ j /ε 2 )</formula><p>, and ε 1 &gt; 0, ε 2 &gt; 0 are parameters. Note that the objective function P 2 (t) is convex and the constraints are all linear. As a result, P 2 can be optimally solved by any solver for convex programming.</p><p>Combining the optimal solution to P 2 in every time slot, denoted by x * i,j,t , we construct an approximate solution to the original problem P 1 by simply following exactly the same resource allocation decisions. We show in the following that the produced solution is feasible to P 1 inherently.</p><p>Theorem 1 (Feasibility). The optimal solution x * i,j,t to P 2 in every time slot constitutes a feasible solution to P 1 over time.</p><p>Proof. The proof is conducted by showing that the optimal solution obtained for P 2 also satisfies the constraints (6a), (6b), and (6c) in P 1 . It can be easily checked that (6a) and (6c) are satisfied by the fact that (10a) and (10c) are enforced in the optimal solution to P 2 over time. To prove the validity of the constraint (6b), we first show that P 2 (t) increases monotonically with</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">x i,j,t in [x * i,j,t-1 , +∞) due to that ∂P 2 (t) ∂x i,j,t =a i,t + d(l j,t , i) λ j + c i η i ln x i,t + ε 1 x * i,t-1 + ε 1 + b i τ i,j ln x i,j,t + ε 2 x * i,j,t-1 + ε 2 &gt; 0,</formula><p>where x * i,j,t ≥ x * i,j,t-1 for any i ∈ I, j ∈ J , and t ∈ T . Since we have x i,j,0 = 0, as well as x * i,0 = j x * i,j,0 = 0, if we assume the optimal solution satisfies x * i,j,1 &gt; C i or x * i,1 &gt; C i , we can always find another solution where we let x * i,j,1 = C i and x * i,1 = C i . The new solution provides a smaller value for the objective P 2 (t) and consequently, a contradiction is reached as there exists no solution that performs better than the optimal solution. Similarly, the same result can be applies to any 2 ≤ t ≤ T by induction, which completes the proof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we carry out rigorous analysis on the performance of the proposed online resource allocation algo-rithm. Particularly, we prove that our algorithm has guaranteed performance by achieving a parameterized competitive ratio. We first present a sketch for the proof, followed by the detailed derivations step by step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sketch</head><p>The competitive analysis will follow three high-level steps: i) We first relax the program P 1 by linearizing the objective function via introducing auxiliary variables u i,t and v i,j,t , from which we obtain a linear program P 3 . ii) We then derive the dual problem of P 3 to obtain a program D. iii) We finally construct a feasible solution for D from the optimal solution x * i,j,t generated by optimally solving P 2 . The rationale of adopting the regularization-based approach is that the optimal solution for P 2 shares some common properties with the solution we constructed for D, which can be exploited by deriving the KKT conditions for P 2 and compare them with the constraints in D. Therefore, a connection between the optimal solution to P 2 and the constructed solution to D is established. More formally, we aim to derive the following inequalities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">P 1 ≥ P 3 ≥ D ≥ 1 r P 2 , (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where the first inequality follows by the fact that P 3 is relaxed from P 1 , as a result of which it produces the optimal solution no larger than that of P 1 . The second inequality is obtained by applying the Weak Duality Theorem, and the third inequality follows by comparing the solutions to D with that to P 2 . Those inequalities directly lead to the result that the proposed online algorithm is r-competitive, where r will be determined later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Auxiliary Programs</head><p>Following the above sketch, we first provide the formulation for the relaxed program P 3 . As already mentioned, we introduce auxiliary variables u i,t and v i,j,t to reformulate the nonlinear terms in the objective function of P 2 . We also enforce lower bounds on the new variables in the constraints. The formal formulation of P 3 is given below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">min P 3 (t) = t i j a i,t x i,j,t + t j d(j, l j,t ) + i x i,j,t λ j d(l j,t , i) + t i c i u i,t + t i j b i v i,j,t s.t. u i,t ≥ j x i,j,t - j x i,j,t-1 , ∀i, ∀t, (13a) v i,j,t ≥ x i,j,t -x i,j,t-1 , ∀i, ∀j, ∀t, (<label>13b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">) k∈I\i j x k,j,t ≥ ⎛ ⎝ j λ j -C i ⎞ ⎠ + , ∀i, ∀t, (13c)</formula><p>u i,t ≥ 0, ∀i, ∀t, (13d) v i,j,t ≥ 0, ∀i, ∀j, ∀t, (13e) (6a), (6c), where function (x) + can be applied to the right-hand term of (13c) due to the fact that x i,j,t ≥ 0. We now derive the Lagrange dual of P 3 to generate program D. To this end, we introduce dual variables for each of the constraints in P 3 : let α i,t , β i,j,t , ρ i,t , and θ j,t be the dual variables associated with (13a), (13b), (13c), and (6a), respectively. The dual program D can be derived as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">max D = t j λ j θ j,t + t i ⎛ ⎝ j λ j -C i ⎞ ⎠ + ρ i,t s.t. -a i,t - d(l j,t , i) λ j + α i,t+1 -α i,t + β i,j,t+1 -β i,j,t + k∈I\i ρ k,t + θ j,t ≤ 0, ∀i, ∀j, ∀t, (<label>14a</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">-c i + α i,t ≤ 0, ∀i, ∀t, (14b) -b i + β i,j,t ≤ 0, ∀i, ∀j, ∀t (14c) α i,t ≥ 0, ρ i,t ≥ 0 ∀i, ∀t, (14d) β i,j,t ≥ 0, θ j,t ≥ 0, ∀i, ∀j, ∀t,<label>(14e)</label></formula><p>On the other hand, we derive the KKT conditions of the program P 2 . We associate dual variables θ j,t , ρ i,t , and δ i,j,t to constraints (10a), (10b), and (10c), respectively. Consequently, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">a i,t + d(l j,t , i) λ j + c i η i ln x i,t + ε 1 x * i,t-1 + ε 1 + b i τ i,j ln x i,j,t + ε 2 x * i,j,t-1 + ε 2 -θ j,t - k∈I\i ρ k,t -δ i,j,t = 0, ∀i, ∀j,<label>(15a)</label></formula><p>θ j,t (λ ji x i,j,t ) = 0, ∀j, (15b)</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">ρ i,t ⎛ ⎝ j λ j -C i - k∈I\i j x k,j,t ⎞ ⎠ = 0, ∀i<label>(15c)</label></formula><p>x i,j,t δ i,j,t = 0, ∀i, ∀j, (15d)</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">θ j,t ≥ 0, ρ i,t ≥ 0, ∀i, ∀j,<label>(15e)</label></formula><p>where equation (15a) is the optimality condition, while equation (15b), (15c), and (15d) are due to complementary slackness. Using the optimal solutions obtained from solving P 3 (t) in time slot t, i.e., x * i,j,t and the dual variables θ j,t and ρ i,t , we construct a solution S D for program D by following the mappings shown below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">α i,t = c i η i ln C i + ε 1 x * i,t-1 + ε 1 , β i,j,t = b i τ i,j ln C i + ε 2 x * i,j,t-1 + ε 2 θ j,t = θ j,t , ρ i,t = ρ i,t .</formula><p>We are able to show that Lemma 2. The solution S D is feasible for program D.</p><p>Proof. The proof is conducted by showing that when substituted in D, S D satisfies all the constraints. To this end, we first derive some preliminaries. For α i,t we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">α i,t+1 -α t = c i η i ln C i + ε 1 x * i,t + ε 1 - c i η i ln C i + ε 1 x * i,t-1 + ε 1 = c i η i ln x * i,t-1 + ε 1 x * i,t + ε 1 .</formula><p>Similarly, for β i,j,t we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">β i,j,t+1 -β i,j,t = b i τ i,j ln x * i,j,t-1 + ε 2 x * i,j,t + ε 2 .</formula><p>Based on the above equations, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">-α i,t - d(l j,t , i) λ j + α i,t+1 -α i,t + β i,j,t+1 -β i,j,t + k∈I\i ρ k,t + θ j,t = -α i,t - d(l j,t , i) λ j - c i η i ln x * i,t + ε 1 x * i,t-1 + ε 1 - b i τ i,j ln x * i,j,t + ε 2 x * i,j,t-1 + ε 2 + k∈I\i ρ k,t + θ j,t ≤ 0,</formula><p>where the inequality in the last line follows from equation (15a). The above inequality indicates that the constraint (14a) is satisfied by the solution S D . Constraint (14b) is satisfied by the following inequality.</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">α i,t = c i η i ln C i + ε 1 x * i,t-1 + ε 1 = c i ln(1 + C i /ε 1 ) ln(1 + C i /ε) -ln 1 + x * i,t /ε 1 = c i 1 - ln(1 + x * i,t /ε 1 ) ln(1 + C i /ε 1 ) ≤ c i ,</formula><p>where the inequality in the last line follows by x * i,t ≥ 0 as x * i,j,t ≥ 0 given in constraint (10c). Analogously, to prove constraint (14c) we verify that β i,j,t ≤ b i . Combining with the fact that constraints in (14d) and (14e) follow naturally by definition, we complete the proof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Competitive Ratio</head><p>We now focus on the last inequality in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and derive the competitive ratio r.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EVALUATION</head><p>We built a discrete-time simulator in Python to validate the performance of the proposed online resource allocation algorithm. We conducted experiments using both real-world and synthetic data and we report the experimental results in this section. All the measurements were performed on a Linux server equipped with Intel Xeon CPU E5-2687W (3.0GHz) and 512 GB of RAM. We modeled the linear and convex programs by Pyomo and solved them by invoking IPOPT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Experimental Settings</head><p>The major dataset we use for the real-world case is the Roma taxi trajectory traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We envision an edge cloud system deployed in the center area of Roma city with 15 edge clouds deployed that are located at 15 selected metro stations. The edge clouds in the system will be used by the customers (termed as users hereafter) in the taxis, whose movement records are provided by the traces. The number of users varies from hour to hour but is generally around 300. Operation price. We generate the operation price following the process: For each edge cloud, we first determine its base operation price reversely proportional to its capacity. This is reasonable due to the economy-of-scale effect on both energy and maintenance. The real-time operation price for each edge cloud follows Gaussian distributions, where we set the the mean value as the base price we just generated and the standard deviation as half of the base price <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Network delay. The network delay is used to calculate the service quality cost and for each user it can be partitioned into two parts: the delay between the user and the access point and the weighted average delay between the access point and the recruited edge clouds by the user. The delay in our model is measured by the geographical distance between any two entities based on their GPS locations. The GPS location data for the taxis are provided by the dataset and we collect the GPS locations for the 15 edge clouds (i.e., metro stations) manually on Google Maps. The service quality price is set to be proportional to the measured delay. Bandwidth price. The migration cost is associated with the bandwidth price and the bandwidth usage during the migration. In our model the bandwidth price is not assumed to be timevarying. However, different edge clouds may connect to the Internet via different Internet providers. We categorize all the edge clouds in three clusters, each of which is subscribed to one of the three Internet providers: Tiscali Italia, Vodafone Italia, and Infostrada-Wind. The per-month flat rate prices averaged for 1Mbps connection are 2.49 euro, 4.86 euro, and 1.25 euro, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We will use this relative ratios between them to set the bandwidth prices for the three categories of edge clouds. Reconfiguration price. The reconfiguration price is assumed to be static over time and it varies among different edge clouds. We generate the reconfiguration prices following a Gauss distribution with the negative tail cutted. User workload. To understand the impact of the distribution of user workload on the effectiveness of our algorithm, we use three different distributions: power, uniform, and normal. the power distribution represents highly screwed workload, which can be typically seen in online social network services, e.g., the number of friends of each user on the social network satisfies the power law. Capacity. The total capacity of the edge clouds is assumed to be slightly larger than the total workload in the system by design. More specifically, we assume that the utilization of the system keeps at the level of 80%. Consequently, the total capacity is set to be 1.25 times the total workload. The capacity will be distributed to all the edge clouds proportionally to the frequency of users being attached to them, i.e., the total number of direct user connection in all the relevant time slots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Measuring the Competitive Ratio</head><p>The theoretical analysis has already provided an upper bound on the competitive ratio for the online algorithm. We now validate how the algorithm would perform in reality. We carry out experiments using the above settings and we compare the results of our algorithm with the two groups of algorithms: atomistic and holistic. Atomistic algorithms only consider the static part in the total cost and they include: experiments are repeated independently for five times and the plots show the mean values as well as the standard deviations.</p><p>As we can see from the figure that the algorithms from the atomistic group perform poorly as expected. Among them, the perf-opt performs the best, thanks to the reduced frequency of workload migration because of the moderate mobility in the Roma taxi dataset. The online-greedy algorithm in the holistic group performs better than any of the atomistic algorithms. However, we still notice a considerable gap to the offline optimal, which is mainly due to the reasons we already discussed at the end of Section II. In contrast, our online algorithm (denoted as online-approx) can produce near-optimal results, achieving an improvement of up to 60% compared to the online greedy algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Identifying the Impact of Parameters</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> illustrates the performance of our algorithm under different workload scenarios, where we generate the user workload using uniform and normal distributions in addition to the power distribution. As we can see that our algorithm preserves similar properties, i.e., producing near-optimal solution and up to 70% improvement compared to online-greedy, under any of the workload distributions and our algorithm performs even slightly better under uniform workloads.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the impact of the parameters ε 1 and ε 2 on the performance of our algorithm, we set ε 1 = ε 2 = ε &gt; 0 and we vary ε from 10 -3 to 10 3 in a logarithmic scale in all the above test cases. It is interesting to notice that with the increase of ε, the empirical competitive ratio of our algorithm declines slightly at the beginning and then increases to a stable level. We report also in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> the impact of the ratio between the weight of the dynamic cost and the weight of the static cost (denoted as μ) in the objective by varying its value from 10 -3 to 10 3 in a logarithmic scale. We observe that when μ is small, i.e., the static cost is negligible, our algorithm can roughly achieve optimal results. When the dynamic cost is dominant, our algorithm can still achieve a stable yet reasonably good competitive ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Testing with Synthetic Mobility Patterns</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> illustrates the experimental results with synthetic mobility data under various numbers of users, which validates the generality of our algorithm. The synthesis mobility data is generated following a random walk process: We assume each user starts from an arbitrary metro station equipped with an edge cloud and is traveling with the metro. In each time slot, each user determiners its location for the next time slot by choosing randomly from the neighbor stations with an edge cloud equipped or just staying at the same metro station. Assume in a certain time slot the user is at a location with three neighbors so the probably of moving to any of the three neighbors, as well as of staying at the same location, in the next time slot, would be 25%. Following the above process we generate the movement traces of the users. We vary the number of users from 40 to 1000 and we compare our algorithm with the offline-opt and online-greedy.</p><p>We observe that our algorithm performs in a similar way as in the real-world mobility scenario, i.e., the empirical competitive ratio is around 1.1, which is very close to the optimal, while the online-greedy has empirical competitive ratios up to 1.8. In addition, our algorithm performs stably regardless of the number of users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. RELATED WORK</head><p>The concept of edge computing was initially inspired by the idea of deploying computing facilities at the network edge to enhance the performance of mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. While numerous novel architectures for edge computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have been proposed, the resource allocation problem in such systems remains as a critical challenge.</p><p>A bundle of existing research in this area are on allocating edge cloud resources to computational tasks offloaded from mobile devices. COSMOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is a system that efficiently manages cloud resources for offloading requests to both improve the mobile performance and reduce the provider's monetary cost. Deng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> study online scheduling policies to maximize data offloading under unpredictable user mobility patterns. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> focus on game-theoretical mechanisms for offloading decision making in the presence of multiple users, taking into account the energy consumption and the delay. Hou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> study the reconfiguration in edge clouds and propose an efficient online algorithm for configuration updating. However, all of them are focused on resource allocation in a single edge cloud environment.</p><p>On the other hand, attentions have been paid very recently on resource management in an edge cloud computing system with multiple edge clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Jia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> study the optimal placement of cloudlets in wireless Metropolitan Area Networks and design an algorithm for user to cloudlet allocation. In a follow-up work, they further propose an efficient algorithm for load balancing among multiple edge clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Mukherjee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proposed an optimal cloudlet selection strategy to reduce power and latency in multi-cloudlet environments. Tong et al. advocate a hierarchical architecture for edge clouds and develop workload placement algorithms for minimized delay. The most relevant works to ours are from Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Urgaonkar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where they propose stochastic frameworks for dynamic workload migration based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. However, all of them either require statistics information on user mobility or assumes a Markov chain model for user movement, which is not necessary in our model.</p><p>There are also research on workload distribution and resource allocation in geo-distributed data centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. While sharing some common objectives with our problem, they are intrinsically different from edge cloud environments as neither delay sensitivity nor user mobility is considered. In contrast, our research addresses the challenge of the allocation and the continuous adaptation of resources in edge clouds, accommodating arbitrary resource price and user mobility dynamics. Our model captures multiple types of important costs, including static and dynamic ones; our online algorithm, without any knowledge on the future, makes resource allocation decisions on the fly while guaranteeing a parameterized competitive ratio for the worst-case inputs.</p></div>
