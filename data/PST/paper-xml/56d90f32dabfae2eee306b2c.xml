<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The performance of the fuzzy controllers depends highly on the proper selection of some design parameters which is usually tuned iteratively via a trial and error process based primarily on engineering intuition. With the recent developments in the area of global optimization, it has been made possible to obtain the optimal values of the design parameters systematically. Nevertheless, it is well known that unless a priori knowledge is available about the optimization search-domain, most of the available time-domain objective functions may result in undesirable solutions. It is consequently important to provide guidelines on how these parameters affect the closedloop behavior. As a result, some alternative objective functions are presented for the time-domain optimization of the fuzzy controllers, and the design parameters of a PID-type fuzzy controller are tuned by using the proposed time-domain objective functions. Finally, the real-time application of the optimal PID-type fuzzy controller is investigated on the robust stabilization of a laboratory active magnetic bearing system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems have attracted the attention of researchers as a suitable replacement for conventional mechanical and hydro-static bearings. AMBs can provide contactless suspension of the rotor by no means other than electromagnetic forces. AMBs have numerous advantages over their mechanical and hydro-static counterparts. The absence of mechanical contacts allows efficient operation of AMBs for extremely high-speed applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. AMBs can be utilized in several industrial applications where precise operations are desired such as energy storage flywheels, artificial hearts, turbo-molecular vacuum pumps, and jet engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. With the growing interest in the applications of fast and precise AMB systems, there is a demand on developing high-performance controllers that can handle a wide range of operating conditions, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Recently, robust controllers such as H 1 optimized controllers have been developed with the aim of achieving robust performance for systems subject to modeling uncertainties and external disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The main difficulty with the robust controllers is that an accurate model of the system is required at the control design stage. As an alternative to these model-based controllers, the ''model-free'' controllers such as fuzzy controllers have emerged in which only a rough model of the system is required at the control design stage. Since fuzzy controllers are developed to imitate the human knowledge in the form of linguistic rules, they have become very successful in the areas where the exact model of the system being controlled is not available. The PD-type fuzzy controllers (PD-FLC) and the PI-type fuzzy controllers (PI-FLC) are the most commonly reported methods in the literature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>, a PD-FLC is designed for the stabilization of an open-loop unstable AMB system. The results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref> show that in comparison with the conventional lead compensator, the designed PD-FLC improves the transient response of the system. However, large steadystate errors remain when the PD-FLC is employed on the system. Although the PI-FLC is known to be more practical than the PD-FLC because it results in zero steady-state error to a step input, its transient performance is poor due to the phase-lag introduced by the integral action. In order to achieve a PID-type fuzzy controller, a parallel structure is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> by combining a PI-type and a PD-type fuzzy controller. Consequently, the required scaling factors are formulated based on the linear PID controller gains. However, it is not always straightforward to design a linear PID controller in order to obtain the required tuning parameters of the fuzzy controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</p><p>This paper aims to provide a simple but effective PID-FLC structure that can be generalized for control of linear and nonlinear systems where an approximate model of the system is available. The controller design parameters are optimized using several meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. It is shown by a simulation example that the performance of the meta-heuristic algorithms depends highly on the optimization search-domain and the optimization objective function. The problem with most of the timedomain objective functions is that a priori information is necessary about the optimization search-domain. Otherwise, the algorithm converges to undesirables solutions which may lead to actuator saturation. To alleviate this problem, some alternative objective functions are proposed for the time-domain optimization of control system design. It is shown via a simulation study that by employing the presented objective functions, regardless of the size of optimization search-domain, the algorithm converges to a relatively similar result. Several meta-heuristic algorithms are employed to ensure that the optimal values of the design parameters are obtained. Ultimately, the same procedure is used to design optimal PID-type fuzzy controllers for the robust stabilization of the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) active magnetic bearing system. The designed optimal controllers are coded in C for real-time implementation on the system, and the performance of the system is investigated while the system is operating at various speeds. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the common structures of the PID-type fuzzy logic controllers, and an alternative structure is presented that is more efficient for the real-time implementation. A brief review of the optimization algorithms that are used in this paper is given in Sect. 3. Section 4 studies the difficulties with the common objective functions for the time-domain optimization of the fuzzy controllers using meta-heuristic algorithms. Subsequently, a practical objective function is presented, and its effectiveness is verified by simulation studies. The focus of Sect. 5 is on the optimal design of the PID-type fuzzy controllers for the robust stabilization of the AMB system under study. The performance of the system using the designed PIDtype fuzzy controllers is compared with the linear on-board controllers in Sect. 6. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in Sect. 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PID-type fuzzy logic controllers</head><p>Several forms of fuzzy controllers can be found in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. It should be clear to the readers that the focus of this paper is on so-called direct action fuzzy controller. This structure will be called PID-type fuzzy controller or PID-FLC in short throughout this paper. On the other hand, the name fuzzy PID controller (or FLC-PID) refers to the so-called gain scheduling-type PID controllers where the fuzzy logic is used to produce the required K P , K I , and K D gains of the linear PID controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>, and it is not studied in this paper. The PID-type fuzzy controllers are usually classified based on the number of inputs to the controller. Generally, two-and three-input fuzzy controllers are the most common structures, in which a nonlinear PID-like performance is expected from the controller. Some of the most commonly used structures are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It should be noted that the input/output variables of the fuzzy controllers are normalized within the range of ½À1; 1. Therefore, six scaling factors are required to be properly chosen for the first two structures (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), whereas four scaling factors are required for the last two structures (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</p><p>An alternative structure is employed throughout this paper, and it is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The advantage of the presented structure over those of in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is that it consists of a single two-input fuzzy controller that makes it computationally more efficient for real-time implementation. As two inputs are supplied to the fuzzy controller, less number of rule-base is required to be designed compared to the three-input structures.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that the processing time of the Sugeno-type fuzzy controllers is much faster than their Mamdani-type counterparts, as the area of the output membership functions is not required to be calculated in the Sugeno-type controllers. This makes the Sugeno-type fuzzy controllers more reliable for real-time implementation. Therefore, this study is restricted to the Sugeno-type fuzzy controllers. We first define a simple structure for the fuzzy controller with twenty-five rules (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Next, different optimization methods are used to tune the design parameters in two levels. It is clear from Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> that the parameters ðT 1;2;3;4 Þ are the scaling factors to transform the input/output variables into the range of ½À1; 1. Therefore, in the first level of tuning, the optimal value of the scaling factors ðT 1;2;3;4 Þ is obtained. In the second level of tuning, the distribution of the input/output membership functions is altered by varying the base and centroid locations ðS 1;2;...;11 Þ of the membership functions.</p><p>The inputs/outputs of the fuzzy controller are transformed into five linguistic variables, namely NB (negative big), NS (negative small), Z (zero), PS (positive small), and PB (positive big). The total number of twenty-five rules is required to complete the fuzzy rule-base. The rule-base table can be designed based on the expected response of the system to a particular input to the system. For instance, the grey cells in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> represent the required magnitude of the control signals in the transient stage of the system response to a unit-step input. Furthermore, the red cells show the required magnitude of the control signals in the settling stage, and the expected magnitude of the control signals in the steady-state stage is represented in white.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Review of optimization algorithms</head><p>In recent years, various meta-heuristic optimization algorithms have been proposed, and some have shown promising performances on the optimization of multidimensional mathematical problems. However, according to ''no free lunch'' theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, it is impossible to find an algorithm that works the best on all optimization problems. Consequently, several optimization algorithms are employed in this paper to analyze the sensitivity of the PID-type fuzzy controller to the design parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Genetic algorithm (GA)</head><p>Genetic algorithm (GA) is a well-known meta-heuristic algorithm based on the genetic evolution of the population. GA has been extensively used in the past and current research works for optimization of single-and multi-objective problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. GA starts the optimization process with a set of randomly generated solutions (population). In each iteration, the best individuals are selected to be the ''parents,'' and the next generation (''children'') is produced by crossover and mutation of the parents. Over an evolutionary algorithm, a better generation is produced from the past generation, and the solutions evolve toward the optimal value. A simple pseudo-code for GA is given below:   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</head><p>Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another well-known global optimization algorithm inspired by the flocking behavior of birds <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>. The algorithm starts by randomly generated particles within the search space. In each iteration, particles fly around the search space with their assigned velocities in hope to find the best solution. The velocity of each particle updates based on the current velocity of the particle, the particle's individual best solution, and the global best solution that have been obtained so far. Then, the location of the particles updates iteratively based on the new velocities, until the stopping criteria are reached. The equations that emulate the described characteristics are given in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v tþ1 i ¼ w Â v t i þ c 1 Â r 1 Â ðp i;d À x t i;d Þ þ c 2 Â r 2 Â ðp g;d À x t i;d Þ<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">x tþ1 i;d ¼ x t i;d þ v tþ1 i<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>In Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), x t i;d and x tþ1 i;d are the current and the future positions of the ith particle. The parameter v t i is the current velocity of the particle, and w is a weighting function to control the effect of the particle's current velocity on its future velocity. The variable p i;d represents the best solution of the particle i at iteration t, and p g;d is the best global solution so far. The two weighting factors c 1 and c 2 determine the importance of the current local and global best solutions. Finally, r 1 and r 2 are two random numbers within the range of [0, 1] to further encourage the stochastic exploration of the particles throughout the search space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Grey wolf optimization (GWO)</head><p>Grey wolf optimization (GWO) is a recent meta-heuristic algorithm based on the natural hunting behavior of grey wolves <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>. The solution candidates are made up of four different types of wolves (a, b, d and x). The wolves a, b and d can be considered as the first, second, and third best solutions. There is only one candidate within each of a, b and d dimensions; however, the x can consist of multiple candidates. The algorithm starts with randomly generated solutions. All candidates are considered as x at the start of the algorithm. Upon the end of the first iteration, the three wolves (a, b, and d) are assigned to the best three solutions. The optimizer then continues to move the candidates toward the best scoring solution ðaÞ, as well as a random placement of some candidates throughout the search space to promote exploration. The optimizer continues with an ''encircling prey'' algorithm which focuses on the surrounding of the prospective best solution. The encircling algorithm can be formulated as in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D ! ¼ j C !

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>), r 1 and r 2 are random set of vectors between [0, 1]. The parameter a is used to mathematically model the attacking stage when the prey stops moving. In fact, a decreases linearly from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations. GWO continues the algorithm by storing the best three solutions and updating their positions according to Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>), and the iteration continues until the stopping criteria are reached. Imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) is another recent meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the social behavior of imperialist countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>. The algorithm starts with a randomly generated solutions (countries). Some of the best individuals are selected to be the initial imperialists, while the rest of candidates are possessed by the imperialists as their colonies. The number of colonies under the control of each imperialist depends on the power of the corresponding imperialist (power is calculated as the reciprocal of the fitness value). To ensure the normal distribution of the colonies among the imperialists, the normalized cost of each imperialist is defined as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">10</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">D a ! ¼ j C 1 ! : X a ! À X ! j; D b ! ¼ j C 2 ! : X b !

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">13</ref>), d is the distance between the colony and its corresponding imperialist, b [ 1 ensures that the colonies move toward the imperialist from all directions. V 1 is a vector that its starting point is the previous location of the colony, and its direction is toward the imperialist. During the movement transition, if there exists a colony that is more powerful (lower cost value) than its imperialist, that colony becomes the new imperialist. In the imperialist competition stage, the power of each empire is calculated as the total power of each imperialist plus a percentage of the average power of its colonies. During the competition, the weakest empires that cannot increase their power will be eliminated from the imperialist competition. The ideal result of the optimization is achieved when only one empire is left, and all its colonies have the same power as the imperialist. A simple pseudo-code for ICA can be written as follows:</p><p>1. create a random initial population (countries); 2. evaluate the fitness values of each country and select the best n individuals as the imperialists, and the rest of candidates as their colonies (number of countries, imperialists, and colonies are initialized before the optimization starts); 3. move the colonies toward their corresponding imperialist (assimilating algorithm); 4. evaluate the fitness value of each individual in the empires, and if there exists a colony with higher power than its imperialist, exchange the position of the colony and the imperialist; 5. the empire that has the most likelihood to possess a colony can acquire the weakest colony from the weakest empire (imperialistic competition); 6. the weakest empires get eliminated; 7. iteration continues until only one empire is left, or other stopping criteria are reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Choice of an objective function</head><p>In order to design an optimal controller, both time-and frequency-domain characteristics can be utilized for the closed-loop system analysis. However, the time-domain analysis is only available for the design of nonlinear fuzzy controllers. Several objective functions can be utilized for the time-domain optimization of fuzzy controllers using meta-heuristic algorithms. For instance, mean absolute of error (MAE), integral absolute of error (IAE), mean square of error (MSE), integral square of error (ISE), and integral time absolute of error (ITAE) are the most common objective functions. The time-domain characteristics of the system, such as the settling time and the percent overshoot of the system to a unit-step input, can also be used in conjunction with other time-domain objective functions. In the next example, it is shown that unless there is enough information about the lower/upper bounds of the search-domain, the common time-domain objective functions may result in undesirable ''optimal'' solutions. Subsequently, an alternative objective function is presented, and its effectiveness is verified by simulation and experimental studies.</p><p>4.1 Example: stabilization of a time-varying system using the PID-type fuzzy controller Suppose a standard PID-type fuzzy controller is to be designed for the time-varying system in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">14</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. A Sugeno-type two-input PID-type fuzzy controller is first designed as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>. In the first level of tuning, the membership functions are uniformly distributed, and the scaling factors T 1;2;3;4 need to be tuned using the meta-heuristic algorithms. At this stage, PSO is used to find the optimal scaling factors ðT 1;2;3;4 Þ. The optimization process is carried out several times with different objective functions, and the optimization searchdomain is kept unchanged in the range of <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. This implies that the input/output membership functions can vary within the range of ½À10; 10. Several common timedomain objective functions, namely mean absolute of error (MAE), integral absolute of error (IAE), mean square of error (MSE), integral square of error (ISE), and integral time absolute of error (ITAE) are utilized to be minimized via the optimization algorithm. The optimal scaling factors using these time-domain objective functions are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. The step response of the time-varying system using the tuned PID-type fuzzy controllers, along with the required control signals, is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">_ x 1 ðtÞ ¼ x 2 ðtÞ _ x 2 ðtÞ ¼ Àe À0:2t x 2 ðtÞ À e À5t sinð2t þ 6Þx 1 ðtÞ þ uðtÞ<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>It can be deduced from Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> that relatively similar behaviors are expected from these objective functions, as long as similar range of search-domain is chosen for the optimization process. Nevertheless, ITAE shows a slightly better performance in terms of the percent overshoot and the settling time, and hence, it is preferred in the remaining of this paper. In the sequel, only ITAE is used as the optimization objective function, while the optimization search-domain is altered. The resulting ''optimal'' scaling factors ðT 1;2;3;4 Þ are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. The resulting step responses of the system and the control signals are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, respectively. It is clear from the results that the bound on the search-domain has a critical impact on the final ''optimal'' solution. This implies that unless an accurate knowledge is available about the size of search-domain, the common time-domain objective functions could result in a controller with excessively large control output signals and it could lead to actuators saturation.</p><p>This problem can be alleviated by taking into account the magnitude of the control signal in the objective function. Since relatively similar results are expected from most of the time-domain objective functions, combining the magnitude of the control signal to the common time-domain objective functions should result in a relatively similar results as well. To the best of our knowledge, the following three objective functions result in satisfactory closed-loop behaviors: Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Closed-loop step responses of the system using different objective functions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">J ¼ minimize Z 1 0 QjeðtÞjtdt þ Z 1 0 RjuðtÞjtdt<label>ð15Þ</label></formula><p>or:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">J ¼ mininize Z 1 0 QeðtÞ 2 dt þ Z 1 0 RuðtÞ 2 dt<label>ð16Þ</label></formula><p>or:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">J ¼ minimize Z 1 0 QjeðtÞjdt þ Z 1 0 RjuðtÞjdt<label>ð17Þ</label></formula><p>where Q and R in Eqs.

In order to examine the performance of the PID-type fuzzy controller on partially known systems, it is assumed that only a rough model of the system is available, and hence, the controller is designed on the basis of a reduced-order model of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Description of active magnetic bearing system</head><p>The laboratory experimental AMB system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>. The system includes a rotor shaft, four pairs of horseshoe electromagnets (two pairs at each end), an air turbine driven by compressed air, four hall-effect sensors, four linear current amplifiers, and four analog on-board controllers. The rotor is levitated with magnetic forces provided by the electromagnets, and the rotational speed of the rotor shaft can reach up to 10,000 rpm. The rotor shaft has four degrees of freedom (4DOF) which are labeled as channels Y 1 À Y 4 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>. Channels 1 and 2 correspond to the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotor at one end, whereas channels 3 and 4 correspond to the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotor at the other end of the system, respectively. A digital signal processing card (DS1104) is used for the data acquisition and real-time implementation of the control algorithms. The system parameters are described in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.</p><p>As AMBs are inherently open-loop unstable, closedloop system identification must be performed instead of more common open-loop system identification techniques.

Initial frequency, target time and the frequency at the target time of the chirp signals are chosen in such a way that the frequency does not increase too fast, so that the system has enough time to obtain its steady-state response. Due to the presence of resonant frequencies, different amplitudes of inputs are necessary to obtain accurate results. This problem can be solved by taking several sets of measurements, each one with different range of amplitudes and frequencies and combining them in MATLAB. The time-domain response of the system is collected using the dSPACE ControlDesk software package and then exported to MATLAB for discrete Fourier transform (DFT) analysis. The MIMO frequency response of the system is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>. Each of the diagonal terms in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref> represents the frequency response of the input and the output of the same channel.

Next, different optimization algorithms are employed to find the scaling factors ðT 1;2;3;4 Þ that minimize the objective function given in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. It should be noted that the values of Q and R in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">15</ref>) are assigned to be 0.5 throughout the optimization process to ensure that large control signals are not produced. The simulations are executed for 0.2 seconds, and a unit-step disturbance is The obtained scaling factors ðT 1;2;3;4 Þ using different optimization algorithms are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. The resulting closed-loop step responses of the system are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11</ref>. It is clear from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11</ref> that the step response of the system using GA is not satisfactory. On the other hand, the system shows similar performance in terms of the percent overshoot and the settling time by using the parameters obtained by PSO and GWO algorithms. To strive for a better performance, the distribution of the input/output membership functions is varied in the second level of tuning. It should be noted that the tuning of the membership functions distribution is much more challenging than the tuning of the scaling factors. This is due to the fact that the membership functions can be arbitrarily placed at any location in the universe of discourse. However, as it is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, some assumptions are made to reduce the number of design parameters and hence simplify the optimization process. As it is desired to have a smooth transition between the rules when they are fired up, the distribution of the input/output membership functions is expected to vary arbitrarily while keeping a symmetrical partitioning of the input/output universe of discourse about the origin. Hence, eleven variables ðS 1;2...;11 Þ are chosen to alter the distribution of the membership functions using the optimization algorithms. Note that some linear inequalities need to be satisfied during the optimization process in order for MATLAB to successfully construct the FLC structure. For instance, ðS 2 \ S 3 \ S 4 Þ, and ðS 7 \ S 8 \ S 9 Þ which imply that the left side of each triangle has to be less than its centroid and less than its right side. An additional inequality of 0 S 1;2;...;11 1 is also required to ensure that the membership functions are within the range of ½À1; 1. After some simulations, the best objective function values and the optimization run times using different optimization algorithms are obtained and listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>. It should be noted that the lowest objective value is obtained by employing the PSO algorithms, and the optimal distributions of the membership functions using PSO are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>. Furthermore, the closed-loop step responses of the system using different optimization algorithms are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12d</ref>. The results from the second level of tuning are also compared with the results obtained from the first level of tuning (uniformly distributed membership functions) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12d</ref>. It is clear from the results that the first level of tuning (tuning the scaling factors) has a significant impact on the closed-loop behavior of the system. Nevertheless, the performance of the system can be slightly improved by altering the distribution of the membership functions.</p><p>6 Real-time implementation of the optimal PIDtype fuzzy controller on AMB system</p><p>This section is devoted to the real-time implementation of the designed PID-type fuzzy controller on the laboratory AMB system. After obtaining the optimal scaling factors and the membership functions distributions, the designed PID-type fuzzy controllers are coded in C. The input and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11</ref> Closed-loop step responses of the system using different scaling factors T 1;2;3;4 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>)</p><p>Neural   should be noted that the model of other three channels is slightly different from the model of the first channel and hence final fine-tunings are required before the successful implementation of the fuzzy controllers on the other three channels. After the system is stabilized by the designed PID-type fuzzy controllers, the performance of the closedloop system is further investigated by rotating the shaft with the help of an attached air turbine to one end of the rotor. As the speed of the rotor increases over time, the displacements of the geometrical centers of the rotor at both ends are recorded. The data are taken for 120 s to ensure that the steady-state speed of the rotor achieved, and the obtained results are depicted in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">14</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">15</ref>.</p><p>For the completion of study, the results obtained from the PID-type fuzzy controllers are compared with those of PDtype fuzzy controllers and the analog on-board controllers.</p><p>It is clear from the results that the performance of the PIDtype fuzzy controllers are certainly better than those of PDtype fuzzy controllers and the analog on-board controllers. More interestingly, the control signals required at each channel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16</ref> reveal that lower profiles of control signals are retained by the PID-type fuzzy controllers than the analog on-board controllers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>A practical objective function was presented for the timedomain optimization of the fuzzy logic controllers to secure an optimal trade-off between conflicting performance measures such as the time-domain characteristics of the system and the magnitude of control output signal. Next, several meta-heuristic algorithms, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), were utilized to find the optimal design parameters of the PID-type fuzzy controller in two levels. Interestingly, PSO and GWO showed the best performance compared to the other two algorithms. Moreover, several runs were required for GA and ICA, as these two Neural Comput &amp; Applic algorithms failed to find the optimal values on the first attempt. Ultimately, an optimal PID-type fuzzy controller was designed and successfully implemented on a multiinput multi-output active magnetic bearing system. The experimental results were compared with those of the PDtype fuzzy controllers and the analog on-board controllers while the system was operating at different rotational speeds. In comparison with the linear controllers, the presented PID-type fuzzy controllers showed remarkably superior performances while retaining lower profiles of control signals.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1Common PID-type fuzzy logic controllers<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> </figDesc></figure>
