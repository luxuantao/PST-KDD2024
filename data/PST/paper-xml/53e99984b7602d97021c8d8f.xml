<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The idea of integrating logic and continuous dynamics in the control of complex systems is not new but only in the last 15 years has the theoretical analysis of hybrid systems (i.e., systems with both continuous dynamics and discrete logic) been pursued in a systematic fashion. A fair amount of research has been done on the modeling of hybrid systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, but most of this work concentrated on deterministic systems.</p><p>Instances of stochastic hybrid systems can be found in the work on stochastic impulse control. For example Bensoussan and Lion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, considered the problem of optimally choosing impulse times and intensities for a given stochastic differential equation. In more recent hybrid systems terminology, this would amount to optimally selecting reset times and the values to which the state is reset. One specific example is the classic optimal stopping time problem, where one wants to determine an optimal time instant at which the evolution of a differential equation is to be "frozen." Interestingly enough, Bensoussan and Lion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> also considered the case of integer-valued states.</p><p>One of the more general formal models for stochastic hybrid systems was proposed by Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, where the deterministic differential equations for the continuous flows are replaced by their stochastic counterparts, and the reset maps are generalized to (state-dependent) distributions that define the probability density of the state after a discrete transition. However, in this model transitions are always triggered by deterministic conditions (guards) on the state.</p><p>In the model proposed in this paper for SHSs, transitions between modes are triggered by stochastic events, much like the transitions between states of a continuous-time Markov chains. However, the probability that a transition occurs in a given interval of time depends both on the continuous and discrete components of the current SHS's state. The state of the SHS so defined is a Piecewise-Deterministic Markov Process (PDP) in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Based on this observation, we provide a formula for the extended generator of the SHS, which can be used to compute expectations and probability distributions/densities of its discrete/continuous states.</p><p>The basic model proposed is (i) limited to a deterministic evolution of the continuous state inside each discrete mode and (ii) it does not allow for transitions triggered by deterministic conditions on the state (e.g., guards being crossed). The first restriction is only introduced for simplicity of presentation and it is shown how the model can be generalized to allow for continuous evolutions driven by stochastic differential equations. The rationale for disallowing transitions triggered by guard-crossings is that this allows us to exclude Zeno phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. However, we show how one can approximate systems with guards (and potentially prone to Zeno phenomena) by a sequence of Zeno-free SHSs.</p><p>The model proposed is inspired by piecewise deterministic jump systems (PDJSs), where the evolution of the continuous state in each mode is modeled by a deterministic differential equation and transitions between modes are governed by a continuous-time Markov process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. In general, the transitions rates in PDJSs are assumed independent of the continuous state, which is too restrictive for our applications. The work of Filar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is a notable exception but requires a time-scale separation between the (purely deterministic) continuous dynamics and the discrete jump dynamics. In switched diffusion processes (SDPs), as defined by Ghosh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the evolution of the continuous state in each mode is modeled by a stochastic differential equation and transitions between modes are controlled by a continuous-time Markov process. The transition rates of the Markov process can depend on the state but transitions do not generate jumps on the continuous state (i.e., no resets). The reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> for a comparison of the models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. The SHSs considered here can be viewed as special cases of general jump-diffusion processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In fact, Theorem 1 can be viewed as an Itô rule for SHSs. However, in the application of interest, we are faced with the technical difficulty that jump-intensities are not bounded and moreover the jump-distributions do not have compact support.</p><p>Our SHS model was inspired by the need to obtain accurate models for TCP congestion control in communication networks. The use of hybrid models to characterize the behavior of congestion control was proposed by Hespanha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and further pursued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. In these models, packet drops trigger transitions between different "modes" for the evolution of TCP's congestion window size. The drop models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> were completely deterministic but, as noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, their use is limited to simple network topologies.</p><p>There is an extensive literature on models that describe the behavior of TCP congestion control for longlived flows, i.e., flows that have an infinite amount of data to transmit. A great deal of effort has been placed in characterizing the steady-state behavior of these flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. In particular, in studying the relationship between the average transmission rate µ, the average round-trip time RT T , and the per-packet drop rate p drop for a single TCP flow. In most of this work, µ and p drop should be understood as time-averages for a single TCP flow. This type of approach was also pursued in <ref type="bibr">[25-28, 38, 41]</ref> to derive dynamic models for the congestion avoidance stage of long-lived TCP flows. However, these single-flow models are only valid over time scales much longer than the round-trip time for one packet. To avoid averaging over long time intervals, Misra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> utilized ensemble averages to construct models for the dynamics of long-lived flows. Shakkottai and Srikant <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> also used stochastic aggregation to reduce the time-scales over which a single-flow model is valid. They showed that when n single-flow models are aggregated, the average model becomes valid over time scales n times smaller than those of the original single-flow models. Interestingly, aside from the different interpretation of the quantities involved, the ensemble-average models for long-lived flows do not differ significantly from the time-average ones.</p><p>We pursue here a stochastic analysis of the hybrid models proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> time averaging is done over intervals of roughly one round-trip time to obtain continuously varying sending rates, and we then investigate the dynamics of ensemble averages. However, here we consider ensembles of on-off TCP flows. The off-periods are assumed exponentially distributed whereas the on-periods are determined by the amount of data being transfered. We take as given the probability distribution of the transfer-sizes, which implicitly determines the distribution for the on-periods. The model takes into account the correlation between the (variable) sending rate and the duration of the (also variable) on-periods. Not surprisingly, the ensemble behavior of on-off TCP flows varies very significantly with the probability distribution of the transfer sizes. By feeding our models with realistic distributions reported in the literature, we conclude that the dynamics of the sending rate is dominated by high-order statistics, exhibiting much larger standard deviations than the average value. Moreover, the packet drop rate seems to have a surprisingly small effect on the average drop rate but provides a strong control on its standard deviation. This has significant implications for the design of congestion control mechanisms.</p><p>To reach a wide audience we placed a great deal of effort in keeping technicalities to a minimum and relegated the most technical arguments to Sect. 3.3, which can be skipped without loss of continuity. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the basic stochastic hybrid model is introduced in Sect. 2 and several possible generalizations are discussed. Sect. 3 discusses the basic theoretical tools to analyze SHSs. In Sect. 4, we utilize SHSs to model TCP congestion control and illustrate how the tools derived in Sect. 3 can be used to analyze the resulting system. Sect. 5 contains some conclusions and directions for future research. The proofs of a few technical results are included in Appendix. A subset of the results in this paper were presented at the 2004 Workshop on Hybrid Systems : Computation and Control.</p><p>Notation. By a piecewise continuous signal it is meant a function x : [0, ∞) → R n that is right-continuous and has left-limit at every point. We denote by x -(t) the left-limit of x(τ ) as τ ↑ t. A signal x is called piecewise constant if it is piece-continuous and it is constant on every interval where it is continuous. Given a measurable space (Ω, F) and probability measure P : F → [0, 1], vector-valued random variables α : Ω → R n and stochastic processes x : Ω × [0, ∞) → X ⊂ R n are denoted in boldface. A stochastic process with piecewise constant sample paths is called a jump process. When a jump process takes values on the set N of nonnegative integers it is called a stochastic counter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Stochastic Hybrid Systems</head><p>A stochastic hybrid system (SHS) is defined by a differential equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ẋ =f (q, x, t), f : Q × R n × [0, ∞) → R n ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>a family of m discrete transition/reset maps</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(q, x) =φ (q -, x -, t), φ : Q × R n × [0, ∞) → Q × R n , ∈ {1, . . . , m},<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and a family of m transition intensities</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">λ (q, x, t), λ : Q × R n × [0, ∞) → [0, ∞), ∈ {1, . . . , m},<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where Q denotes a (typically finite) set with no particular topological structure.

Each transition counter N counts the number of times that the corresponding discrete transition/reset map φ is "activated." The frequency at which this occurs is determined by the transition intensities (3). In particular, the probability that the counter N will increment and therefore that the corresponding transition takes place in an "elementary interval" (t, t + dt] is given by λ (q(t), x(t), t)dt. In practice, one can think of the intensity of a transition as the instantaneous rate at which that transition occurs. We will shortly make these statements mathematically precise.</p><p>It is often convenient to represent SHSs by a directed graph as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where each vertex corresponds to a discrete mode and each edge to a transition between discrete modes. The vertices are labeled with the corresponding discrete mode and the vector fields that determines the evolution of the continuous state in that particular mode.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Construction of the stochastic processes</head><p>We now provide the formal procedure to construct the sample paths of the discrete state, continuous state, and transition counters and show that it is indeed consistent with the intuition given above. Aside from its theoretical interest, this construction is useful to run Monte Carlo simulations of SHSs. It is inspired by the one used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 2]</ref> to define Piecewise-Deterministic Markov Processes (PDPs). The following regularity assumption on the vector field f is required for the SHS to be well defined: Assumption 1. For every (q 0 , x 0 , t 0 ) ∈ Q × R n × [0, ∞) there exists a unique global solution ϕ(•; t 0 , q 0 , x 0 ) : [t 0 , ∞) → R n to (1) with initial condition x(t 0 ) = x 0 and q(t 0 ) = q 0 . In what follows, the µ k , ∈ {1, . . . , m}, k ∈ N denote independent random variables all uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1]. We will call these transition triggers. Consider an initial condition (q 0 , x 0 , t 0 ) ∈ Q × R n × [0, ∞). For a given ω ∈ Ω, the sample paths of q(ω, •)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">: [t 0 , ∞) → Q, x(ω, •) : [t 0 , ∞) → R n ,</formula><p>and all the N (ω, •) : [t 0 , ∞) → N can be constructed as follows:</p><p>1. Set t 0 (ω) = t 0 , q(ω, 0) = q 0 , x(ω, 0) = x 0 , N (ω, 0) = 0, ∀ . 2. Let t 1 (ω) be the largest time on (t 0 (ω), ∞] for which e -R t t 0 (ω) λ (q(ω,t0(ω)),ϕ(s;t0(ω),q(ω,t0(ω)),x(ω,t0(ω))),s)ds &gt; µ 0 (ω),</p><p>∀t ∈ [t 0 (ω), t 1 (ω)), ∈ {1, . . . , m}. 3. On the interval [t 0 (ω), t 1 (ω)), the sample paths of q(ω, •) and all the counters N (ω, •) remain constant, whereas the sample path of x(ω, •) equals ϕ(• ; t 0 (ω), q(ω, t 0 (ω)), x(ω, t 0 (ω))). 4. Denoting by 1 (ω) ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} the index for which (4) is violated<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> at time t = t 1 (ω), the counter N 1 (ω) (ω) is incremented by one and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">q(ω, t 1 (ω)), x(ω, t 1 (ω)) = φ 1 (ω) q -(ω, t 1 (ω)), x -(ω, t 1 ), t 1 (ω) .</formula><p>5. In case t 1 (ω) &lt; ∞, repeat the construction from the step 2 above with t 0 (ω), µ 0 (ω), t 1 (ω), 1 (ω) replaced by t k (ω), µ k (ω), t k+1 (ω), k+1 (ω), respectively, for k = 1, 2, . . . The random variables t k defined by (4) are called transition times.</p><p>The stochastic processes so defined depend on the initial condition for the SHS. To emphasize this dependence we sometimes use P z0 and E z0 to denote the probability measure and expected value corresponding to the initial condition z 0 := (q 0 , x 0 , t 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">) ∈ Q × R n × [0, ∞).</formula><p>Step 1 provides the initialization for all the stochastic processes.</p><p>Step 3 guarantees that the discrete state remains constant and the continuous state flows according to (1) between transitions. Step 4 enforces that the continuous and discrete states are reset according to (2) at transition times. The frequency at which these occur is determined by Step 2. In fact, one can derive from (4) (cf. Appendix) that</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">lim dt↓0 P N (t + dt) &gt; N (t) dt = lim dt↓0 E 1 dt t+dt t λ (q(t), ϕ(s; t, q(t), x(t)), s)ds ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>which shows that the probability P N (t + dt) &gt; N (t) that the transition φ will occur in an (arbitrarily) small interval (t, t + dt] is proportional to the length of the interval with the proportionality constant given by the right-hand-side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>). This equation specifies the precise meaning of the observation made above to the extent that "the probability that the counter N will increment in an elementary interval (t, t + dt] is given by λ (q(t), x(t), t)dt." Note that when λ is continuous, the right-hand-side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>) is precisely equal to E[λ (q(t), x(t), t)].</p><p>The above construction guarantees that the sample-paths are indeed right-continuous and have left-limits at every point with probability one. However, without further assumptions there is no guarantee that the sample path are defined globally on [0, ∞). We will return to this issue later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Generalizations</head><p>The model for stochastic hybrid systems presented above is more general than it may appear at first. We discuss next some of the generalizations possible. We will return to these in Sect. 3.1 to study their implication on the results in Sect. 3.</p><p>The model allows for transitions where the next state is chosen according to a given distribution. For example, suppose one would like the intensity λ(q, x, t) to trigger transitions to the discrete-states q 1 or q 2 with probabilities p 1 or 1 -p 1 , respectively. This could be achieved by considering two transitions with intensities p 1 λ(q, x, t) and (1 -p 1 )λ(q, x, t), respectively, and reset maps φ 1 (q, x, t) = (q 1 , ϕ 1 (x, t), t) and φ 2 (q, x, t) = (q 2 , ϕ 2 (x, t), t), respectively, where the ϕ i denote (possibly distinct) continuous-state resets.</p><p>The above model does not directly consider differential equations driven by stochastic processes. However, many important classes of stochastic processes can be obtained as the limit of jump processes that can be modeled by SHSs. For example, the stochastic differential equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ẋ = ax + b ẇ (6)</formula><p>where w denotes Brownian motion, can be regarded as the limit as ↓ 0 of the jump system with continuous dynamics ẋ = ax and resets x → x + b √ and x → x -b √ both triggered with fixed intensity 1 2 . We can therefore model continuous evolutions of the form (6) as limits to a sequences of SHSs.</p><p>The basic model also does not directly consider discrete transitions triggered by deterministic conditions of the state, e.g., a guard being crossed. However, this behavior can also be obtained as the limiting solution to a sequence of SHSs. Consider for example the well known bouncing-ball single-mode deterministic hybrid system with dynamics ẍ = -g, g &gt; 0 and state reset (x, ẋ) → (0, -c ẋ), c ∈ (0, 1) triggered by the condition ẋ &lt; 0 and x ≤ 0. We could approximate this system by a sequence of SHSs for which the resets are triggered with intensities given by a "barrier function" of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">λ (x, ẋ) := e -x/ ẋ &lt; 0 0 ẋ &gt; 0, , &gt; 0. (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>As ↓ 0, transitions will occur in a small neighborhood of x = 0 with increasingly higher probability. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows confidence intervals for the sample-paths of three SHSs that approximate with increased accuracy the deterministic bouncing-ball. It is important to emphasize that, for any &gt; 0, the sample paths of the SHSs are globally defined with probability one. This approach may in fact be a promising technique to overcome difficulties posed by the Zeno phenomena that occur for the deterministic bouncing-ball system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. 95% confidence intervals for the x sample paths of three SHS that approximate the bouncing-ball deterministic system with Zeno time equal to 10. The transition intensities of the SHSs are given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">7</ref>) with = 10 -2 , 10 -3 , 10 -4 from left to right. These results were obtained via Monte Carlo simulations.</p></div>

Although this is a mild requirement, it may be difficult to verify directly. The following lemma (proved in the Appendix) provides a condition that is more restrictive but easily checkable:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Lemma 1. Let φ x : Q × R n × [0, ∞) → R n , ∈ {1, . . . , m} denote the projection of φ into R n [i.e., φ x (q, x, t) = x where (q, x) = φ (q, x, t)]. Assumptions 2(ii) holds, if there exists a continuous function γ f : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) and constants c f , c φ such that f (q, x, t) ≤ max{γ f (t) x , c f }, φ x (q, x, t) ≤ max{ x , c φ }, ∀q ∈ Q, x ∈ R n , t ≥ 0, ∈ {1, . . . , m}.</formula><p>This lemma essentially requires f and the φ to have linear growth in x over R n . Moreover, the growth constant of the φ must not be larger than one. This is a strong requirement and one might be tempted to think that it could be replaced by a local condition if one would restrict one's attention to a finite time interval [0, T ], T &lt; ∞. It turns out that in general this is not true. Consider for example a SHS with a single discrete mode and scalar state x ∈ R that evolves according to ẋ = 0, between transitions, and that undergoes a nonlocally Lipschitz reset x → x p , p &gt; 1 at transition times. For simplicity, we consider a constant intensity µ for the transition. Given two time instants t ≥ τ &gt; 0, it is straightforward to conclude that x(t) = x p N (t) 0 and therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">E x0 x(t) = ∞ n=0 x p n 0 µ n t n n! e -µt .</formula><p>It turns out that when x 0 &gt; 1 the above series does not converge for any t &gt; 0 and a "solution" to the SHS is not defined on any interval of positive length. Problems may still arise when the reset maps have linear growth but with a growth constant larger than one. For example, considering instead the globally Lipschitz reset map x → px, p &gt; 1 and transition intensity λ(x, t) = x, it is possible to show that E x0 x(t) would explode in finite time.</p></div>

The (log 2) term compensates for the error introduced by approximating the discrete increments by a continuous increase. Indeed, without delayed ACKs we have n ack = 1 and this model leads to the usual doubling of w every RT T . With delayed ACKs, typically n ack = 2 and this model leads to a multiplication of the w by √ 2 every RT T . This is consistent with the analysis by Sikdar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, which shows that for n ack = 2 the number of packets sent in the nth round-trip time of slow-start is approximately equal to (1</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">+ √ 2 2 ) √ 2 n .</formula><p>This formula is matched exactly by the fluid model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> when one sets w = 1.428 at the beginning of ss.

This matches the fluid model by making w = .693 at the beginning of ss. 3. The ca mode corresponds to TCP's congestion-avoidance.

For example, it has been observed that heavy-tail models are more fitting to experimental data (cf., e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>). An alternative that turns out to be computationally attractive and still fits reasonably well with experimental data is a mixture of exponentials. According to this model, transfer-sizes are sampled from a family of M exponential random variables s i , i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M } by selecting a sample from the ith random variable s i with probability p i . Each s i corresponds to a distinct mean transfer-size k i . To model this as a SHS, we consider M alternative {ss i , ca i : i = 1, 2, . . . , M } modes, each corresponding to a specific exponential distribution for the transfer-sizes. The transition from the inactive mode off to the slow-start mode ss i corresponding to a mean transfer-size of k i occurs with probability p i and are associated with intensities and reset maps given by λ i (q, w, s, t) := pi τ off q = off 0 otherwise φ i (q, w, s, t) := (ss i , w 0 , 0) q = off (q, w, s) otherwise, which replace the λ start and φ start in the previous model.

The dynamics of TCP are completely dominated by second order moments. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, the standard deviation is 5 to 20 times larger than the average sending rate, which is very accurately predicted by the reduced model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presents a new model for SHSs where transitions between discrete modes are triggered by stochastic events, which occur at rates that are allowed to depend on both the continuous and the discrete states of the SHS. Based on results available for Piecewise-Deterministic Markov Process (PDPs), we provide a formula for the extended generator of the SHS.</p><p>As an illustration, we presented a SHS model for on-off TCP flows that considers both slow-start and congestion avoidance. One important observation that stems from this work is that for realistic transfer-size distributions high-order statistical moments seem to dominate the dynamics of TCP. Also, the probability of drop appears to have a much larger effect on the standard deviation of the sending rate than on its mean value. We are currently investigating the impact of this observation on the stability and performance of congestion control mechanisms. This work opens several avenues for future research. We would like to determine conditions under which Assumption 2(ii) holds, milder than those required by Lemma 1. It is also worth to investigate how solutions to deterministic hybrid systems that exist only in a finite interval due to Zeno phenomena can be globally extended using SHSs. Finally, one needs to develop general tools to approximate the dynamics of SHSs by finite-dimensional systems of ODEs, as was done for the TCP example. total slow-start congestion-avoidance small "mice" transfers mid-size "elephant" transfers mid-size "mammoth" transfers Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.
