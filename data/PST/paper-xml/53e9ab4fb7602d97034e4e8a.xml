<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When the joint processing technique is applied in the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) downlink transmission, the user data for each mobile station needs to be shared among multiple base stations (BSs) via backhaul. If the number of users is large, this data exchange can lead to a huge backhaul signaling overhead. In this paper, we consider a multi-cell CoMP network with multi-antenna BSs and single antenna users. The problem that involves the joint design of transmit beamformers and user data allocation at BSs to minimize the backhaul user data transfer is addressed, which is subject to given quality-ofservice and per-BS power constraints. We show that this problem can be cast into an 0-norm minimization problem, which is NP-hard. Inspired by recent results in compressive sensing, we propose two algorithms to tackle it. The first algorithm is based on reweighted 1-norm minimization, which solves a series of convex 1-norm minimization problems. In the second algorithm, we first solve the 2-norm relaxation of the joint clustering and beamforming problem and then iteratively remove the links that correspond to the smallest transmit power. The second algorithm enjoys a faster solution speed and can also be implemented in a semi-distributed manner under certain assumptions. Simulations show that both algorithms can significantly reduce the user data transfer in the backhaul.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>C OORDINATED multipoint (CoMP) transmission has been incorporated into the latest 3GPP LTE-Advanced Releases for combating the inter-cell interference (ICI) in cellular wireless systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The idea is to aggregate neighboring base stations (BSs) and form the CoMP cooperating set. Transmission strategies for the BSs within this set are coordinated to effectively mitigate the interference at the mobile stations (MSs). Two major approaches are available in CoMP: coordinated beamforming (CB) and joint processing (JP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The difference is that the data stream for each MS is only available at and transmitted from a single BS in CB, while the data for each MS in JP is distributed among multiple cooperating BSs and can be simultaneously transmitted.</p><p>In terms of system throughput improvement, the JP approach is attractive since it simply forms a virtual large antenna array for each MS at the expense of high signaling overhead through the backhaul. This high signaling overhead is incurred by distributing each user's data to multiple BSs in the cooperating set. In a low-mobility environment, the amount of user data to be transported in the backhaul significantly outweighs that of the channel state information (CSI). In order to alleviate the backhaul requirement, it is desirable to distribute the user data only to a subset of the cooperating BSs. This is termed BS clustering.</p><p>Different distributed beamformer design methods for the CB approach under various performance criteria have been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> discusses coordinated beamformer design to minimize the maximum BS antenna power without user data exchange between BSs. A decentralized method to minimize the sum transmit power under given qualityof-service (QoS) requirements has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for both CB and JP approaches. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, each BS maximizes the rate for intra-cell users and cancels inter-cell interference in a decentralized manner. Fast iterative algorithms to maximize the minimum user rate have been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The optimal assignment of one BS for each user has been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The JP approach has been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> considers fully synchronous transmission from cooperating BSs. Forming clusters in multi-cell networks and performing inter-cluster coordination have been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to mitigate interference to cluster edge users. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a zeroforcing scheme has been proposed, which requires all the users' data to be distributed on all the BSs. BS clustering has been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> using heuristic methods. All those works assign the BSs to each MS in a predefined manner.</p><p>Weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) in multi-cell CoMP networks has been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> has designed distributed WSRM algorithms that iteratively update the transmit power and the user assignment at each BS using local information and limited BS data exchange. Algorithms with co-channel user selection and power allocation across tones have been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for WSRM in multi-cell multi-carrier networks. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> assume no user data exchange between BSs. Centralized and distributed WSRM algorithms can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for multi-cell networks, where all the users data are available at all the transmitting BSs.</p><p>A number of recent research efforts have considered CoMP networks with finite-capacity backhaul <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The information-theoretic analysis for uplink CoMP cellular net-1536-1276/13$31.00 c 2013 IEEE This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.</p><p>works using a linear Wyner-type cellular model with no fading has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, where cooperative decoding at the BSs is enabled by local and finite-capacity backhaul links. This work has been extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to consider Rayleighfading channels, where a joint decoding scheme based on distributed Wyner-Ziv compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is compared with a partial local decoding scheme at the BSs. An analysis of various uplink CoMP schemes under a constrained backhaul infrastructure and imperfect CSI has been performed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The optimal training length impacted by the finite backhaul capacity in an uplink CoMP network has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> using large system analysis. A two-cell downlink CoMP transmission scenario with a finite-capacity backhaul has been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where a rate-splitting approach has been proposed, i.e., the data symbols transmitted at each BS are composed of private messages that are only available to the BS itself and shared messages that are available at both BSs. A corresponding achievable rate region with respect to the backhaul constraints has been characterized. Those works <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> focus on the derivation and analysis of achievable rate regions for cellular CoMP networks under finite-capacity backhaul constraints.</p><p>In this paper, we address the following problem for the JP approach: which BSs should be assigned with which MS's data and how to design the corresponding beamformers in order to minimize the user data transfer from the data center to the BSs in the backhaul? Specifically, we formulate the problem of minimizing backhaul user data transfer, which jointly determines the optimal BS clustering and the transmit beamformers, into an 0 -norm minimization problem. Unfortunately, this problem is NP-hard. Inspired by recent developments in compressive sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we propose two algorithms to tackle the problem. The first algorithm is based on the 1relaxation and the reweighted 1 -norm minimization, which requires to solve a series of convex 1 -norm minimization problems using, e.g., the interior-point method. The second algorithm is based on iterative link removal. The idea is that we first solve the 2 -norm relaxation of the joint clustering and beamforming problem and then iteratively remove the links that correspond to the smallest link transmit power. This algorithm utilizes the uplink-downlink duality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> in multi-cell systems and it employs projected subgradient algorithm with fast iterative function evaluation to find the results in each intermediate step. Furthermore, this algorithm can also be implemented in a semi-distributed manner under certain assumptions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the user data transfer in the backhaul, as well as design the transmit beamformers to satisfy the per-BS power constraints at the BSs and the QoS requirements at the MSs. To the best of our knowledge, formalized discussions and solutions on how to minimize the backhaul data exchange between BSs under given QoS constraints cannot be found in existing literature. Our main contributions are therefore two-fold: one is the generic formulation of the problem and the other is the proposal of analytical near-optimum solution algorithms.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we introduce the system model and formulate our joint clustering and beamforming problem into an 0 -norm minimization problem. The reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method is presented in Section III. The iterative link removal based method is presented in Section IV. Section V provides the convergence behavior and the simulation results in a multi-cell scenario. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VI.</p><p>Notation: we use bold uppercase letters to denote matrices and bold lowercase letters to denote vectors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Model</head><p>We consider the CoMP downlink transmission as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. There are B BSs cooperating to transmit to K MSs using the same time and frequency channel. Here x i ∈ C denotes the complex data symbol for the ith MS, where i ∈ {1, • • • , K}, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E |x i | 2 = 1.</formula><p>The data center has access to the data of all the MSs. The backhaul is the channel connecting the data center to the BSs, which can be optical fiber or outof-band microwave links. The control information and user data at each BS is obtained directly from the data center via the backhaul <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We assume that each BS is equipped with M transmit antennas and each MS has a single receive antenna, where w ij ∈ C M denotes the transmit beamformer for the ith MS on the jth BS, such that j ∈ {1, • • • , B} and the transmit power constraint at the jth BS is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">K i=1 w H ij w ij ≤ P j .</formula><p>The channel from the jth BS to the ith MS is denoted as h H ij , where h ij ∈ C M . The received signal y i at the ith MS can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y i = B j=1 h H ij w ij x i + K k =i B j=1 h H ij w kj x k + n i . (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>The first term on the right-hand side of (1) represents the received useful signal, the second term represents the interference, and n i ∼ CN (0, σ 2 ) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the ith MS. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the ith MS can then be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">SINR i = B j=1 h H ij w ij 2 σ 2 + K k =i B j=1 h H ij w kj 2 . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>The SINR is an important QoS metric. SINR requirements have to be satisfied for the successful transmission of data. We denote the SINR requirement for the ith MS as γ i . For ease of discussion, we only consider fixed and feasible target SINR requirements. In a commercial cellular network, the actual transmission rate will usually be adjusted with dynamic link adaptation.</p><p>To minimize the signaling overhead in the backhaul, we want to distribute the user data only to the minimum number of cooperating BSs, while satisfying the SINR constraint of each MS. We denote the set of BS indices that the user data x i is distributed to as B i , where B i ⊆ {1, • • • , B}. We assume the data rate to transfer the data x i , ∀i ∈ {1, • • • , K}, through the backhaul to each of the BS in B i to be equal and denote it as R. Thus, the sum of user data rate R sum transferred from the data center through the backhaul is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">R sum = R • K i=1 |B i |<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where |B i | denotes the cardinality of the set B i . For the given SINR requirement, we obtain that minimizing R sum is equivalent to minimizing K i=1 |B i |.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem Formulation</head><p>We define a data routing matrix P ∈ R K×B + to capture the data transfer in the backhaul, where the (i, j)-th element of P is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">[P] ij = w H ij w ij (4)</formula><p>and it represents the power allocated at the jth BS for the data x i . The matrix P also shows which MS's data are routed from the data center to each of the BSs. When [P] ij = 0, the data x i is not routed to BS j. When [P] ij &gt; 0, we say there exists a link between the jth BS and the ith MS, and the data center needs to distribute x i to the BSs with [P] ij &gt; 0 before the BSs transmit to the MSs. Therefore, B i corresponds to the indices of the nonzero elements of the ith row in P and K i=1 |B i | is equivalent to counting the number of nonzero elements in P. Since the size of P is fixed and equals K × B, minimizing K i=1 |B i | is equivalent to maximizing the number of zero elements, i.e., the sparsity, in P. We can mathematically formulate the R sum minimization problem in (3) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">min {wij } vec (P) 0 subject to SINR i ≥ γ i , ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , K} K i=1 w H ij w ij ≤ P j , ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , B}<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where • 0 represents the 0 -norm, which denotes the number of nonzero elements of a vector. Note that the optimization problem (5) needs to jointly determine the BS subsets for the routing of each user's data, as well as to design the transmit beamformers at the BSs. Remark 1: The problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>) is a combinatorial optimization problem and is NP-hard.</p><p>The proof for a related problem where all the constraints are linear can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Using similar arguments as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the problem (5) is NP-hard. A brute-force solution to a combinatorial optimization problem like <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> is by exhaustive search. That is, for each number S ∈ Z, where 0 ≤ S ≤ KB, we must check all the KB S possible assignments of zero elements in P. For each assignment, we must search for the {w ij } satisfying the constraints of (5). In the end, we pick out the maximum S with feasible {w ij }. However, the complexity of exhaustive search grows exponentially with the size of P, which is not applicable in real-world applications.</p><p>The difficulty to solve (5) lies in the combinatorial nonconvex objective function involving the 0 -norm. One approach to obtain approximate solutions for non-convex optimization problems is convex relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, i.e., replacing the non-convex objective function with its convex envelop. The convex envelope of the 0 -norm is the 1 -norm. Optimization based on the 1 -norm has been shown to exactly recover sparse signals in 0 -norm problems and closely approximate compressible signals with high probability using relatively few measurements if certain property is satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This is known as basis pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> that conveniently reduces a sparse estimation problem to a linear program in signal detection, which is the essence of compressive sensing. However, simply substituting the objective function of (5) by vec (P) 1 does not produce sparse solutions in general and such a relaxation is not useful at first glance. Therefore, we provide in the next section an equivalent formulation of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>), where sparse solutions can be obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. REWEIGHTED 1 -NORM MINIMIZATION BASED METHOD</head><p>We observe that [P] ij &gt; 0 or = 0 is equivalent to w ij 2 &gt; 0 or = 0, respectively. By introducing slack variables s ij , the problem (5) can be equivalently reformulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">min {wij },{sij } vec (S) 0 subject to SINR i ≥ γ i , ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , K} w ij 2 ≤ s ij , ∀i, j K i=1 s 2 ij ≤ P j , ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , B}<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where [S] ij = s ij . The first and second constraints are secondorder cone (SOC) constraints, the third constraint is a sumof-squares constraint, and all those constraints are convex. The problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>) is equivalent to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Applying the 1 -norm relaxation to (6), we obtain min {wij },{sij } i,j s ij subject to Constraints of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Now the objective function becomes linear and the problem ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is a convex optimization problem. Furthermore, sparse solutions of {s ij } can be obtained. Note only this formulation of the 1 -relaxation directly produces sparse solutions and other types of convex relaxations do not produce sparse solutions in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The following proposition states which s ij is obtained with zero value solution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>Proposition 1: The solutions of {s ij } in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is obtained at</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">s * ij = 0 if ρ ij &lt; 1, where ρ ij is the dual variable associated with the constraint " w ij 2 ≤ s ij " in (7), ∀i ∈ {1, • • • , K} and j ∈ {1, • • • , B}.</formula><p>Proof: See Appendix A. The solutions obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> are suboptimal solutions of (6) due to convex relaxation. Improved solutions can be obtained by applying a weighting factor on each s ij in the objective function of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. This is called reweighted 1 -norm minimization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, originally proposed to enhance the data acquisition in compressive sensing. The weighting factors should be chosen such that the solutions with large s ij values are penalized. A good choice of the weighting factor</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">β ij in the (n + 1)-th iteration is β (n+1) ij = 1/ δ + s (n) ij , where s (n)</formula><p>ij is the solution of s ij in the nth iteration, and δ is a small nonnegative parameter to ensure numerical stability. Applying this method to our problem, the resulting sparsity of {s ij } typically converges within 10 iterations and the largest improvement in sparsity is obtained in the first few iterations. Although still suboptimal, this algorithm produces a better approximate solution of the original problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>) and it is summarized in Algorithm 1.</p><p>Algorithm 1 Reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method 1: Set the iteration counter n = 0 and β</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(0) ij = 1, ∀i ∈ {1, • • • , K} and j ∈ {1, • • • , B}. 2: Solve the weighted 1 -norm minimization problem w (n+1) ij , s (n+1) ij = arg min i,j β (n) ij s ij ,</formula><p>subject to: Constraints of (6).</p><p>3: Update the weighting factor:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">β (n+1) ij = 1 δ + s (n) ij</formula><p>, ∀i, j.</p><p>4: Calculate the relative error:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">r = vec S (n) -S (n-1) 2 vec S (n) 2 . Terminate if r &lt; ε or n ≥ N max ,</formula><p>where ε is a predefined threshold and N max is the specified maximum number of iterations. Otherwise, set n = n + 1 and go to step 2.</p><p>Furthermore, we have the following proposition for Algorithm 1.</p><p>Proposition 2: Algorithm 1 converges to a local optimal solution.</p><p>Proof: See Appendix B. The reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method achieves better sparsity results than <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> because although the 1 -norm is the best convex relaxation of the 0 -norm, some concave functions can offer tighter approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>In the proof, the choice of the weighting factors is explained using the log-sum surrogate function of the 0 -norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Because the log-sum penalty function is concave, the global minimum solution may not always be attained. Choosing a suitable starting point is important for the final result. It is suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to initialize the algorithm by the solution of the unweighted 1 -norm minimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ITERATIVE LINK REMOVAL BASED METHOD</head><p>The reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method needs to solve a series of convex optimization problems using, e.g., interior-point methods, which can be computationally intensive. In this section, we propose another approach. The basic idea is that we first solve the 2 -norm relaxation of the joint clustering and beamforming problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and then iteratively remove the links that correspond to the smallest link transmit power. Methods employing fixed-point iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> are utilized to find the solution in each intermediate step, which enjoy low complexity and are usually faster than the interior-point methods. We show that the iterative link removal based method can also be implemented in a semi-distributed manner with a lightweight central controller under certain assumptions. The computational complexity analysis will be presented at the end of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. 2 -Norm Relaxation of Joint Clustering and Beamforming</head><p>We first consider the 2 -norm relaxation of the joint clustering and beamforming problem (6) subject to SINR and per-BS power constraints, which can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">min {wij } i,j w H ij w ij subject to SINR i ≥ γ i , ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , K} i w H ij w ij ≤ P j , ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , B} .

The problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) is different from the min-max BS antenna power problem considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, where the per-BS transmit power constraints are variables to be optimized. The problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) is a SOC programming problem that is convex and it can be solved using the interior-point methods.

Implementation Issues</head><p>Similar to the reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method, the iterative link removal based method can be implemented at a centralized controller that performs all the computations. However, if the cross-covariance terms between the channel vectors of different BSs are small for each user compared to the auto-covariance terms and thus can be neglected, i.e., h kj h H kj ≈ 0, ∀j = j , which is usually valid for multi-cell networks due to the distance between different BSs, the iterative link removal based method can also be implemented in a semi-distributed manner in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode, where the downlink channels can be estimated from the uplink transmission.</p><p>Consider the calculation of Σ i in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.

That means, the matrix Σ i becomes block-diagonal. Moreover, the jth component block, i.e., the covariance matrix Σ ij , only involves the channel vector h kj and thus it can be estimated locally at the jth BS. Therefore, the calculation of ŵi in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) can be divided into the calculation of ŵij at the jth BS, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">ŵij ≈ Σ -1 ij h ij , ∀j = 1, • • • , B.

Full knowledge of the channel vectors are not required therein. Moreover, the central controller only performs simple calculations like summation, scalar division and sorting. Most of the computation loads, e.g., the matrix inversion, are distributed among the BSs. Therefore, the central controller can be "lightweight". The drawback of the semi-distributed implementation may be the delay induced in the iterations, which also depends on the convergence speed of the subgradient updates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Convergence Behavior</head><p>We consider the case that the number of BSs and the number of MSs are B = K = 5. Each BS has M = 3 transmit antennas and each MS has a single receive antenna. The SINR requirement for each MS receiver is set to γ i = 6.02dB, ∀i ∈ {1, • • • , K}. The noise variances at the MSs are normalized to 1, i.e., σ 2 = 1. Furthermore, the per-BS transmit </p><formula xml:id="formula_54">γ i = 6.02dB, ∀i ∈ {1, • • • , K}.</formula><p>power constraint P j is set according to P j /σ 2 = 10dB, ∀j ∈ {1, • • • , B}. A randomly generated channel is used to simulate the convergence results.</p><p>The convergence behavior for the reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method, i.e., Algorithm 1, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, where the parameter δ is set to be 10 -2 , 10 -3 and 10 -4 , respectively. The number of active links corresponds to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows that it decreases with the number of iterations. The first several iterations lead to the biggest improvement. As iterations go on, there is no further improvement after the tenth iteration. In the first iteration, i.e., in the unweighted case <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, twenty links are required to be active. That means KB -20 = 5 entries in the data routing matrix P are zeros, which shows a sparse solution is obtained. In the final iteration, only six links are required to be active. Compared to full cooperation, which requires all the links to be active, we save 1 -6/25 = 76% of the user data transfer in the backhaul. In general, a smaller δ leads to better convergence behavior. This is because a small δ approximates the 0 -norm better. However, the convergence for the different δ values does not differ much in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. When δ = 10 -2 , only one more active link is required at the sixth iteration compared to the cases of δ = 10 -3 and 10 -4 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">K i=1 |B i | in</formula><p>When the iterative link removal based method, i.e., Algorithm 2, is applied to the considered system, the stopping term is chosen to be = 10 -4 and the maximum number of subgradient updates is set to be N m = 80. The bisection method is not applied here to better show the convergence results. Only one active link is removed here in each iteration. We choose the step size t n in (23) to be t n = 0.01, 0.1 and 1, respectively. Starting from KB = 25 links, seventeen links are removed and only eight links remain active in the end for the considered choices of the step size t n . This result is slightly worse than the final result obtained by Algorithm 1. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows that the required number of subgradient updates is sensitive to the choice of the step size t n . A smaller step size will lead to a larger number of updates. If the step size is chosen to be 0.01, more than twelve updates are required for each iteration. However, when we choose the step size to be 0.1 or 1, only two to three iterations are required per iteration. On the other hand, the step size t n cannot be chosen to be too big because a large t n will affect the accuracy of the results. We find it advisable to set 0.1 &lt; t n &lt; 1 in our simulations to achieve a good balance in the accuracy and program speed.</p></div>

The users are randomly and uniformly distributed within a disk of 100m radius at the center of the triangle formed by the three BSs. We perform 50 channel realizations for each user location and 20 different user locations are chosen in each simulation. Only those channel realizations that can support the required SINR requirement are admitted.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">I</ref> shows a summary of the above simulation parameters. Five methods are compared: the reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method ("Algo1"), the iterative link removal based method ("Algo2"), the channel strength based clustering (CSBC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, full cooperation, and exhaustive search ("ExSearch"). CSBC is similar to Algo2, but it removes the links according to the channel strength. Full cooperation distributes all the user data to all the BSs. ExSearch has been discussed in Section II-B, which produces the optimum solution in minimizing the backhaul data transfer but requires enormous computations. We set the maximum number of iterations N max for Algorithm 1 to be 20 and the relative error threshold ε to be 10 -4 . The step size t n for the dual uplink noise variance update in Algorithm 2 is set to be 0.5 and the stopping term = 10 -4 . The maximum number of subgradient updates is set to be N m = 80. The SINR requirements for different MSs are the same, i.e., γ i = γ, ∀i ∈ {1, • • • , K}. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>-Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> show the average number of active links and their corresponding average sum transmission power with respect to the number of antennas M at each BS. The number of MSs that are simultaneously served by those BSs is K = 6. The SINR requirement for each MS is set to be γ = 10.3dB, which is the reference SINR for 16QAM transmission with spectral efficiency of 2.41bps/Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The average number of active links is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5(a)</ref>. Full cooperation requires all the KB = 18 links to be active irrespective of M . This induces a large backhaul signaling overhead. For the other four methods, the required active links decreases dramatically with the increase of M . When M = 2, Algo1 and Algo2 achieve almost the same results for the average active links, which is about 16.5. CSBC and ExSearch require one more and one less link on average, respectively. When M = 3, the required links for the four methods decrease to only 11, 12, 13 and 10.5, respectively. When M ≥ 6, the number of required links for the three methods all reduces to about 6. That is the minimum required number of active links, which equals K. Compared to full cooperation, the proposed methods save about 1 -6/18 = 66.7% of the backhaul user data transfer. This is due to the fact that more antennas at the BSs provides more spatial degrees of freedom and proper choice of beamformers reduces the inter-user interference. The same trend can be observed for the average sum transmit power in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. The sum transmit power decreases with the increase of M . Full cooperation serves as a lower bound for the sum transmit power because all the other three methods perform partial cooperation. To our surprise, Algo1 requires both fewer active links in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>(a) and lower sum transmit power in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> compared to Algo2 and CSBC when 3 ≤ M ≤ 8. This shows that the sparsity pattern in the data routing matrix also affects the required sum transmit power. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>-Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> show the results when the number of antennas per BS is fixed to M = 4 and the SINR requirement is set to γ = 10.3dB. This system can serve roughly up to BM = 12 single-antenna MSs. Due to the huge complexity of ExSearch, the simulation for ExSearch is only performed up to K = 6 users. Full cooperation shows a linear curve according to BK in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(a). When K ≤ 4, it is far below the system's serving capacity and the average number of active links all approximately equals K for Algo1, Algo2, CSBC and ExSearch. The number of required active links increases with K. When K = 8, the first three methods require about 15, 16 and 17 active links, respectively. In this case, Algo1 saves about 1 -15/24 = 37.5% of the backhaul user data transfer compared to full cooperation. When K = 10, the system capacity is almost reached. Algo1 and Algo2 require about 26 active links and CSBC requires 28 active links. About 13.3% of the backhaul user data transfer can be saved by Algo1. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, the curves of average sum power for Algo2 and CSBC are quite similar. Algo1 shows lower sum power especially when 4 ≤ K ≤ 8.</p><p>The simulation results for a system of K = 4 users and each BS with M = 4 antennas is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>-Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>. The SINR requirement is shown as the x-axis. When the SINR requirement γ ≤ 8.1dB, the number of active links for Algo1, Algo2, CSBC and ExSearch in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>(a) are all about 4, which equals K. As γ increases, the performance gaps between different methods become obvious. The gap between Algo2 and CSBC remains about 0.6 when 14.1dB ≤ γ ≤ 18.7dB. Algo1 remains very close to ExSearch in the whole SINR range. When γ = 18.7dB, Algo1 requires about 8 active links, which is about 1.4 below that of Algo2. In this case, Algo1 saves about 33.3% of the backhaul user data transfer compared to full cooperation. The required sum transmit power for Algo1 is slightly below those of Algo2 and CSBC when γ ≤ 11.7dB in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>. However, when γ ≥ 14.1dB, the sum transmit power for Algo1 surpass those of the other two methods. The difference is about 0.3W when γ = 18.7dB. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>We considered the problem of minimizing the user data transmission in the backhaul subject to QoS and per-BS power constraints in the CoMP downlink transmission scenario. We showed that it can be formulated into an 0 -norm minimization problem. However, such a problem is combinatorial and NPhard. Furthermore, the solution of such a problem needs to jointly determine the BS choice for user data and the BS beamformers. Inspired by recent results in compressive sensing, we first proposed an approach that solves the problem using the 1 -relaxation and the reweighted 1 -norm minimization, which requires to solve a series of convex 1 -norm minimization problems. Then, we proposed an iterative link removal based approach employing the projected subgradient updates and iterative fixed-point algorithms. We also showed that this method can be implemented in a semi-distributed manner under certain assumptions and analyzed the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms. Simulations showed that both the proposed methods can significantly reduce the user data distribution to BSs in the backhaul. In terms of backhaul user data transfer, the reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method achieved near-optimum results in our simulations, which saves the backhaul user data transfer by 13%-67%. The iterative link removal based method is also an attractive choice due to its good performance, which is only slightly worse than the reweighted 1 -norm minimization based method, and its low implementation complexity.</p></div>
