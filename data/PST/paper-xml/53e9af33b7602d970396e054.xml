Although "visual motion estimation" is an old problem (the first formulations date back to the beginning of the century), only recently have tools from nonlinear systems estimation theory hinted at acceptable solutions.</p><p>In this paper we formulate the visual motion estimation lproblem in terms of identification of nonlinear implicit systems with parameters on a topological manifold and propose a dynamic solution either in the local coordinates or in the embedding space of the parameter manifold. Such a formulation has structural advantages over previous recursive schemes, since the estimation of motion is decoupled from the estimation of the structure of the object being viewed, and therefore it is possible to handle occlusions in a principled way.</p></div>

The goal is far from being reached and, indeed, it opens a new and exciting avenue of research in nonlinear systems theory.</p><p>Although the first formulations of the visual motion estimation problem date back to the beginning of the century <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[77]</ref>, only within recent years have tools from control and estimation theory been applied 131, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[291, [351, 1521, [56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[66]</ref> with rather encouraging results in traditionally difficult applications, such as autonomous vehicle navigation [18]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[20]</ref>, vision-based tracking and servo <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, 1211, 1421, [44], vision-based manipulation [SI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[42]</ref>, docking [ 191, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[37]</ref>, vision-based planning [ 141, and active sensing <ref type="bibr">[69]</ref>.</p><p>As the reliability and the performance of the algorithms improves, vision starts being acknowledged in the automatic control community as a powerful and versatile sensor to measure motion, position, and structure of the environment, and the appropriate tools from nonlinear estimationhdentification theory start being exploited <ref type="bibr">[161, [301, 1-59</ref>], [601. The implementation of sophisticated vision algorithms running in real time is not too far from becoming reality and, due also to the evolution of computer hardware, vision will be soon included "in the loop" of many control systems.</p><p>"Vision in the loop" raises new and interesting problems of system theoretic flavor, ranging from distributed filtering and processing of large amounts of sensory data to the analysis and control of new classes of dynamical systems. Crucial issues in the use of vision as a sensor in control systems are, for example, nonlinear observability and identifiability in a projective geometric framework as well as estimation and control on peculiar topological manifolds.</p><p>In this paper we will be mainly concerned with the "visual motion estimation" problem: Given a sequence of images taken from a moving camera, reconstruct the relative threedimensional <ref type="bibr">(3-D)</ref> motion between the camera and the environment (or scene).</p><p>Since our goal is that of posing the visual motion estimation problem within a system-theoretical framework, we nced to specify a "description" of the environment and of the motion of the viewer. We will restrict our attention to "static" scenes or, equivalently, to portions of it which are moving rigidly relative to the viewer.</p><p>The existing methods for motion estimation may be classified, depending on the scene descriptors employed, as pointbased, line-based, curve-based, or model-based. We will focus on the simplest case when the scene is described by a number of point-features in the Euclidean 3-D space. For line-based schemes, see <ref type="bibr">[72]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[81]</ref> and the references therein. The curve-based approach has been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[71]</ref>.</p><p>The point-based methods may be further classified in terms of the camera model in question. The simplest cases assume either parallel projection [581, [73]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[75]</ref> or ideal perspective projection (pinhole model, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[23]</ref>). More articulated camera models in terms of projective transformations allow parallel and perspective projection as a subcase <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, 1251, [61], [701. We will be concerned mainly with the classical pinhole model; however, our schemes generalize to other camera representations and may estimate the camera model along with visual motion (camera self-calibration, see 1251 and <ref type="bibr">[611)</ref>. Other schemes recover projective, nonmetric structure, independent of the camera parameters [221, [541, [W.</p><p>Motion reconstruction methods may be further classified in terms of the data processing technique as two-frames schemes (see for example [38], [49], and <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[78]</ref>), multiframebatch methods [70], [75], or recursive algorithms.</p><p>In the last decade, a variety of schemes has been proposed for recursively reconstructing structure for known motion [521, 0018-9286/96$05.00 0 1996 IEEE motion for known structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[29]</ref>, or both structure and motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[35]</ref>, [%I, <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[66]</ref>. In general, given either the relative motion or the shape of the object being viewed, the other can be recovered easily since the problem can be reduced to a linear estimation task. When neither the motion nor the shape of the scene is known, the problem of estimating both of them from visual information becomes a remarkably difficult one. We find that a crucial step in tackling such an estimation task consists in being able to decouple the estimation of motion from the estimation of structure. This decoupling has dramatic consequences also from the practical standpoint, since it allows integrating motion information in the presence of occlusions in the image plane, whereas previous structure and motion estimation schemes could integrate motion information only to the extent in which all initial feature points were still visible (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[361)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we present a framework for estimating rigid motion independent of the structure (shape) of the scene. The estimates of motion can later be fed to any recursive "structure from known motion" module to estimate scene structure [52], [56l, [661.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organization of the Paper</head><p>The next section of this paper has introductory purpose: we establish the notation and review some basic concepts in the representation of rigid motion. Section II-B describes an alternative representation based upon the so-called "essential matrices" which were introduced in [49]. In Section 111, we introduce a novel nonlinear implicit dynamical model with motion coded as a vector of parameters constrained onto the space of essential matrices.</p><p>We show in Section IV how to carry out the identification of the model introduced. There we propose two methods, one based upon a dynamic model in the local coordinates of the parameter manifold and the other based upon a dynamic model in its embedding space, projected onto the parameter manifold. The formulation makes use of the results contained in the appendixes. An alternative iteration for identifying the model in local coordinates is described in Appendix A and tested in the experimental Section VI. There we discuss benchmark experiments that highlight the peculiarity of each scheme. Extensive experiments in real-world scenes have been conducted by the authors as well as by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and show consistent performance in situations where previously proposed techniques fail.</p><p>The methods introduced have some degree of generality, as a number of other problems in computational vision may be cast in the same framework, as discussed in Section V.</p><p>Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Representation of Rigid Motion</head><p>A transformation g: IR3 -IR3 of the 3-D Euclidean space is a rigid motion if it preserves the Euclidean distance between points p , and the cross product between vectors q, [68], <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[76]</ref>. We write the action of a rigid motion on IR3 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">g = ( T , R ) with T E R3 and R E S 0 ( 3 ) , such that<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The set of rigid motions has the structure of a Lie group of dimension six and is called S E ( 3 ) (special Euclidean transformations of R3). It is sometimes useful to embed SE(3) in the linear group GC(4) (the general linear group of nonsingular 4 x 4 matrices) using homogeneous coordinates</p><p>x [X* 1IT E IR4. Each rigid motion g is then represented as a matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">g ( X ) = R X + T . G = [o R T I ] 17' E Et3, R E SO(3).</formula><p>We will use the notation g ( t ) A ( T ( t ) , R ( t ) )</p><p>when emphasizing the time-dependence of g . The group ophations in SE(3) coincide with the group operations of GL(4), so that the composition of rigid motions may be represented as a matrix multiplication: g1 o g2 = GlG2. The price we pay for such a simplification is that we have to embed S E <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">( 3 )</ref> , which is a six-dimensional manifold, into which has dimension 16. The tangent space at the origin of SE <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> has the structure of a Lie algebra and is called se <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Elements of se(3) are called "twists" in the robotics literature <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref> and may be represented in so-called "Plucker coordinates" as where V E R3 and 1-wz w1 0 1</p><p>belongs to the Lie algebra of the skew-symmetric matrices</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">so(3) = {SIST = -S} which is isomorphic to R3 via R A H R = [wl w2 w3IT E R3.</formula><p>We will use the same symbol v for an element of se <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> and its Plucker coordinates. The reader interested in a complete treatment of the concepts sketched here may consult for instance [61, <ref type="bibr">[41, E451, 1551</ref>, and [681.</p><p>The reason why the representation introduced above is appealing is that all (compact) one-parameter subgroups of a matrix Lie group can be characterized using the exponential map. For instance, VI J E se(3),g(t) = e(wA)t is a oneparameter subgroup of SE <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. An explicit expression for the exponential map on S E ( 3 ) is given by RA v</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ : : : ] = -p ( 0 0 ) where (2) T 7 ( R ) V<label>( 3 ) (4)</label></formula><p>The exponential map may be inverted locally for computing V and R from R and T , since the matrix 7 ( R ) is invertible when IlRll E (0,w). In the case llRll = 0, the exponential map is defined simply by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R &amp; e ( f l A ) 1 7(n) A -[(I -e(OA))(RA) + ROT]. llflll R -I T = V</formula><p>Note that the exponential map, together with the isomorphism of so <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d ( t ) = j ( t ) p ( t o ) = W g -l ( t ) g ( t ) P ( t o ) = 4 t &gt; A P ( t ) X ( t ) = R ( t ) A X ( t ) + V ( t )</formula><p>and, in coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where V and R represent the translational and rotational velocities of the viewer's moving frame <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The "Essential Manifold"</head><p>A rigid motion may be represented as a point in the Lie group SE(3) which can be embedded in the linear space GL(4) (and hence exploit the matrix product as composition rule) and is in local correspondence with Et6 via the exponential coordinates and the isomorphism between so(3) and R3, as seen in the previous section. We now discuss an alternative matrix representation of rigid motion which is more "compact" in the sense that it can be embedded in a space of smaller dimensions. Such a representation is derived from the so-called "essential matrices" introduced by Longuet-Higgins <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref>. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) is a skew-symmetric matrix. Now define the space of "essential matrices" as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Consider a point g = ( T , R) E SE(3), then T A E so(</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">E {SRIR E S 0 ( 3 ) , S = ( T A ) E so(3)) C (8)</formula><p>Clearly the essential space does not inherit the group structure from the sum of matrices in since Q1, Q2 E E does not imply Q1 + Q2 E E . One possible way of imposing the group structure is by forcing a group morphism with S E ( 3 ) , for which it is necessary to "unfold" T , R from Q = ( T A ) R E E , perform the group operation on SE(3), and then collapse the result into E . We will see later in this section a way of unfolding an essential matrix into its rotation and translation components.</p><p>The essential space has many interesting geometrical properties: it is an algebraic variety 1531 and a topological manifold of dimension six. Later on we will provide a characterization of a local coordinate chart. The essential space may also be identified with T S 0 ( 3 ) , the tangent bundle of the rotation group, defined as TSO(3) A URESO(3) T ~s o <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">( 3 )</ref> 1631. The following theorem, due to Huang and Faugeras and reported by Maybank 1531, gives a simple characterizing property of the space of essential matrices.</p><p>Theorem 2.1 (Huang and <ref type="bibr">Faugeras, 1989)</ref>: Let Q = UC VT be the singular value decomposition (SVD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[32]</ref> of a matrix in</p><p>Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Q E E U C = CO = diag{X X 0)lX E RS Pro03 (+) let Q = SRIR E S 0 ( 3 ) , S E so(S);n(Q), the set of singular values of Q , is such that o ( Q ) = d a . Next observe that QQT = SST = -S2.</formula><p>Also  Q.E.D. Remark 2.1: Note that, since Q A UCVT E E U C = diag{X X O}, there is one degree-of-freedom in defining the basis components of the subspaces (V.3)' and which corresponds to rotating the orthogonal bases (V.1, V.2) and (U.1, U.2) about their orthogonal complements. However, the effects cancel out in the multiplications when defining R and S as in the proof above.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">VS E so(3)3!T E R31S = ( T A ) ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Local Coordinates of the Essential Manifold</head><p>For any given rigid motion (T, R) E S E ( 3 ) , there exists an essential matrix Q defined by Q = ( T A ) R . We are interested now in the inverse problem: Given an essential matrix Q , can we extract its rotational and translational components? Is the correspondence Q ++ ( T , R ) unique?</p><p>Consider the following map, defined locally between E and R6</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">@: E t IR3 x SO(3) -+ Et3 x lR3</formula><p>where U , V are defined by the SVD 1321 of Q = U C V T ; U. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> denotes the third column of U , and R~(7rl2) is a rotation of 7r/2 about the axis [0 0 1]*. Note that the map Q, defines the local coordinates of the essential manifold modulo two signs; therefore, the map associates to each element of the essential space four distinct points in local coordinates. This ambiguity may be resolved in the context of the visual motion estimation problem by imposing the "positive depth constraint" which means that each visible point lies in front of the viewer. In a case like this, we will be able to identify a unique local coordinates homeomorphism, as discussed in Section III-C. The inverse map is simply cp-l: IR3 x IR3 -+E D. Projection Onto the Essential Manifold Theorem 2.1 suggests a simple "projection" of a generic 3 x 3 matrix onto the essential manifold: Let us define p T ( E ) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">-+ E M U diag{/\, A, O } V ~ (10)</formula><p>where U , V are defined by the SVD of M = U diag{ 01, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">STRUCTURE-INDEPENDENT MOTION ESTIMA~ON MODELED AS THE RECURSIVE IDENTIFICATION</head><p>OF NONLINEAR IMPLICIT SYSTEMS In this section we begin with the constraints of rigid motion and perspective projection which define a "natural" nonlinear dynamical model for the 3-D coordinates of each visible feature point (structure). Motion is an unknown parameter of the model which is constrained on SE <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. If we represent motion on the essential manifold, instead, it is possible to remove the 3-D structure of the scene from the model, ending up with a nonlinear and implicit dynamical model for the (measured) projective coordinates of the visible features with motion as an unknown parameter constrained on E . This allows us to decouple the estimation of motion from the 3-D structure of the scene, which has many advantages, for it allows dealing with occlusions of feature points and crossing regions of motion-space which render the "natural" model unobservable <ref type="bibr">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Consider the position of a rigid set of feature points in 3-D space. We call X = [X Y ZIT E R3 the coordinates of a generic point with respect to an orthonormal reference frame centered in the center of projection with 2 along the optical axis and X , Y , parallel to the image plane and arranged to form a right-handed frame (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>The relative motion between the camera and the object (or scene) is described by a rigid motion</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">g ( t ) = ( T ( t ) , R ( t ) ) E SE(3) which induces an instantaneous velocity ( V ( t ) , R(t))</formula><p>such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">X ( t ) = O ( t ) A X ( t ) + V(t&gt;.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The "Essential Filter"</head><p>Since the essential constraint is a homogeneous equation, and hence defined only up to a scale factor, we may restrict Q to belong to Ss instead of Etg. It is customary to set the norm of translation to be unitary; this can be done without loss of generality as long as translation is not zero. The zeronorm translation case can be dealt with separately, and we discuss it in Section 111-E. For simplicity, we now assume</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">11Q112 = llTll = 1.

Choosing the Local Coordinates for the Essential Manifold</head><p>The map @ introduced in (9) defines the local coordinates of the essential space modulo a sign in the direction of translation and in the rotation angle of Rz.

Propagating Scale Information</head><p>It is well known [49] that from visual information it is only possible to recover the structure and the motion modulo a scale factor multiplying the translational velocity and the depth of the visible points. In fact, we cannot distinguish between a car moving on a street and a car which is "twice as big, twice as far, and moving twice as fast." Such a scale ambiguity is captured by the homogeneous nature of the essential constraint (16). However, as soon as we are given some scaling information about the scene at one time instant-for example the size of the car-we can rescale the scene and the estimated velocity to its appropriate values.</p><p>Suppose we are given the distance between two visible "reference" points in space IIXT1-XT211 = p .

In fact, the estimation scheme will estimate some direction of translation T such that (IT11 = 1 regardless the scale of T , so that the correct rotational component of the local coordinates can be computed. In the experimental section we will show an experiment in which the system crosses a region in the parameter space where T = 0 and Q # 0.

In general, we observe that the first method solves a strongly nonlinear problem with techniques which are based upon the linearization of the system about the current reference trajectory so that the linearization error may be relevant. The second method does not involve any linearization, whereas it imposes the constraint of belonging to the essential manifold in a weaker way. Note that each method produces, together with the motion estimates, the variance of the estimation error which is to be used by the subsequent modules of the structure from motion estimation scheme [66].</p></div>

EXPERIMENTS</head><p>In this section we describe two experiments on real image sequences and one simulation experiment to reveal the different features of each scheme and their behavior when close to singular configurations in the motion space (e.g., pure rotation about the projection center).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulation Experiments</head><p>We have generated a cloud of 20 feature points at random within a cubic volume of side 1 m, placed 1.5 m ahead of the viewer. The scene was viewed under perspective projection onto an image plane of 500 x 500 pixels with a focal length of one, corresponding to a visual field of approximately 50". Gaussian noise with 1 pixel std was added to the measured projections according to the performance of the most current feature-tracking schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The viewer was then made to navigate around the cloud with constant velocity for 50 time instants (frames), after which the viewer stopped translating and only rotated about its center of projection for 25 frames, inverting the direction after 15 of them. Finally, the viewer resumed its roto-translational motion to return to the initial configuration.</p><p>This experiment is interesting from many extents: first of all, for part of the sequence the model is in a singular configuration, since the translational velocity is zero. Indeed, as we have discussed in Section 111-E, the schemes proposed still recover some normalized direction of translation and the correct rotational velocity. Once the appropriate scaling information has been inserted, full translation is correctly estimated. Second, in the first and the last part of the experiment, the motion is designed such that the effects of translation and rotation produce the same variation, up to first order, in the Note also that wch spikes do not affect convergence, since they do not occur in the estimation process, but while transferring to local coordinates. The switching can be avoided by a higher level control on the continuity of the singular values of the estimated state. There is a significant error in the local coordinates near frame 260, when the translation is zero and the direction of rotation is inverted. The smoothness imposed by the dynamics of the parameters is responsible for the transient in the estimates of the rotation which propagates onto the estimate of translation, causing a visible spike with a significant transient. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. spikes due to the local coordinate transformation. Note also that there is no transient to recover since they do not occur in the estimation process.</p><p>Components of rotational velocity as estimated by the local coordinate estimator (radframe). The ground truth is shown in dotted lines. Note the derivative of the observations. This is a well-known ambiguous stimulus in which it is difficult to distinguish locally the effects of rotation from those of translation.</p><p>We have systematically varied the conditions of the experiments, by changing the distance in space from the cloud of dots between 1 m and 5 m, the initial conditions between 0% and 1000% off the true value, the level of measurement noise between 0 and 2 pixels, and the number of visible points between 1 and 100.</p><p>It is interesting to notice that, while previous schemes based upon the essential matrix needed at least eight <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref> or five <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[38]</ref> visible points at each time instant, here we can allow any number of points even below the threshold of five, since we integrate over time the motion information.</p><p>The behavior of the different filters was consistent with a graceful degradation of the estimates as the noise level increases and a need for more precise initial conditions as the noise increases and the number of visible points diminishes. The performance of the filter saturates as the number of visible points increases beyond 20. The performance also degrades as the points move far away from the viewer and as the structure approaches a plane. Under these conditions, in fact, the matrix x approaches rank six rather than its normal rank of eight</p><p>We have tested the essential filter in local coordinates, both implemented using the IEKF and the two-dimensional (2-D) iteration described in Appendix A and the essential filter in the embedding space. We now comment on the performance of 1241, ~6 1 . each filter on the reference simulation experiment, highlighting some of the features peculiar to each scheme. The performance of the filters is compared in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Local Coordinate Estimator</head><p>In Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref> we show the six components of translational and rotational velocity as estimated by the local coordinates estimator. Ground truth is plotted in dotted lines. Convergence is reached in less than 20 steps from an initial condition within 20% the true state. Initialization is performed using one step of the traditional Longuet-Higgins' algorithm [49]. Tuning of the filter has been performed, as with the other schemes, within an order of magnitude. It must be pointed out that we have observed a better behavior by increasing the variance of the pseudo-innovation. This is due to the fact that the EKF relies :E TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL, VOL. 41, NO. 3, MARCH 1996 on the hypothesis that the measurement noise is white and the linearization error is negligible, while this is often not the case. An increase in the variance of the measurement noise accounts for the residual of the linearization. The computational cost of one iteration is of about 100 Kflops for 20 points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Estimator in the Embedding Space</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref> we show the nine components of the essential matrix as estimated by the essential estimator in the embedding space. Since convergence is about four times slower than the local coordinate version and each step requires four times less computation, we have sampled the measurements four times faster, ending up with a 400 frames-long sequence.</p><p>Note first that between the frames 200 and 300, the true value of the state is zero. The estimates of the filter drift off to nonzero values, since the essential matrices are defined as to have unit norm. Such nonzero values are those that allow estimating correctly the rotational velocity and a dummy direction of translation even in the case of pure rotation about the optical axis, as discussed in Section 111-E. By transforming the state into local coordinates and inserting the appropriate scale, it is possible to recover the correct rotational and translational components of motion, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref>. defined in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) may have singularities due to noise when the last eigenspace is exchanged with one of the other two. In fact, due to the presence of noise, the third singular value of the estimated essential matrix is nonzero, and occasionally may even become bigger than the other two. Since the SVD sorts the singular values in decreasing order, the eigenvectors-which encode the motion information-may be interchanged. This causes the spikes observed in the estimates of motion. However, there is no transient to recover, since the errors do not occur in the estimation step but only in transferring to local coordinates. The switching can be avoided by a higher level control on the continuity of the singular values. The only significant error in the local coordinates occurs at around frame 260, when the translation is zero and the direction of rotation is inverted. The smoothness imposed by the dynamics of the parameters is responsible for the transient in the estimates of the rotation which propagates onto the estimates of translation, causing a visible spike with a significant transient. Note that a much less relevant spike was also present in the estimate of the filter in local coordinates (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p><p>The computational cost of our current implementation of the filter in the embedding space amounts to circa 41 Kflops per each step for 20 points. Initialization was performed within 20%, as in the previous case, using one step of the algorithm of Longuet-Higgins [491.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The 2 -0 Iteration</head><p>The essential filter in local coordinates has been implemented using the double iteration described in Appendix A. The results are reported in Figs. 10 and 11. This scheme reaches similar accuracy to the local filter after proper initialization, even though the error analysis used for calculating the variance of the estimates at each fixed time was only  approximate. Speed may be adjusted by varying the number of iterations at each fixed time. We have noticed that a number of steps between three and seven is sufficient. The cost of the scheme for seven iterations and 20 points is 100 Kflops. The simulations reported were performed using a constant variance of the error of the kiteration.</p><p>We summarize the performance of the three schemes in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>: mean (M) and standard deviation (Std) of the estimation error are computed in steady state between frame 30 and 50 for the local coordinate scheme and the 2-D iteration while between time 180 and 260 for the estimator in the embedding space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Experiments on Real Image Sequences</head><p>In the first experiment, we have tested our schemes on a sequence of 10 images taken at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">12</ref>). There are 22 feature points visible; ground truth and feature tracking have been provided. Due to the limited length of the sequence, we have run it on the local coordinates estimator which has a transient of about 10-20 steps to converge from arbitrary initial condition. Hence we have run the local estimator on the 10 images starting from zero initial condition, and we have used the final estimate as initial condition for a new run whose results we report in Figs. 13-15. We did not perform any ad hoc tuning, and the setting was the same used in the simulations described in the previous paragraphs. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref> we report the six motion components as estimated by the local coordinate estimator and the corresponding ground truth (in dotted lines). The estimation error is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">14</ref>. As it can be seen, the estimates are within a 5% error, and the final estimate is less than 1% off the true motion. Finally, in Fig. <ref type="figure">15</ref> we display the norm of the pseudo-innovation of the filter which converges to a value of about in less than 10 + 5 steps. In this experiment, we have used the true given norm of translation as the scale factor.</p><p>In a second experiment we have taken a box, attached some texture to it, and generated a sequence of images by rotating the box on top of a revolving chair placed in front of the camera. We have selected and tracked automatically feature points using a multiscale implementation of a standard scheme proposed by <ref type="bibr">Lucas and Kanade [51]</ref> which gave us a number of good features as well as a number of spurious one (like the "T"-junctions between the chair and the horizontal lines in the background wall) and points in the background (Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref> top). A simple on-line statistical analysis on the innovation process of the filter allows us to easily reject these points as outliers <ref type="bibr">[64]</ref>. The motion components of the remaining points, the ones attached to either the box or the chair, are estimated and plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>  Benchmark experiments on the scheme's performance on real-life situations have been conducted also by other researchers. For instance, Bouguet [7j considered a sequence of over 4000 frames taken from a camera mounted on a cart which moved inside a building, eventually returning to its initial position. The aim of the experiment was to assess how accurate the reconstruction of the trajectory was by integrating over time the v'elocity (or relative instantaneous configuration) through the sequence. Individual features, tracked using standard feature tracking schemes [4j, have a relatively short lifetime (on the order of 10 frames for that particular experiment). Therefore, traditional motion estimation schemes, having structure encoded in the state of the filter, would have discontinuities in the states corresponding to the structure parameters whenever a feature appears or disappears which affects the estimates of motion through the coupling present in the model ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>). On the contrary, the velocity of the cart is of course continuous, and only by decoupling motion from the estimation of structure it is possible to integrate information throughout the sequence without having to deal with a variable number of discontinuous states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The problem of estimating 3-D motion from a sequence of images can be naturally set in the framework of dynamic estimation and identification. Under the assumption of a static scene, the rigid motion constraint and the perspective projection map define in a natural way a nonlinear dynamical model, and estimating motion is equivalent to a mixed estimatiodidentification task.</p><p>Motivated by the structural limitations of the natural model (see [59j), we have proposed a new formulation for structureindependent motion estimation based upon the representation of motion via the "essential matrices," introduced by Longuet-Higgins <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref>. Motion estimation is equivalent to the identification of a nonlinear implicit model with parameters on the essential manifold. Other problems in computer vision may be cast as the identification of a nonlinear implicit model, as for example dynamic self-calibration, subspace motion factorization, and partial motion reconstruction €rom weak perspective.</p><p>We have proposed an algorithm which solves the identification task by estimating the state of a model defined on the parameter manifold. We perform the estimation either in the local coordinates or in the embedding space of the parameter manifold.</p><p>We are now in the process of implementing the proposed schemes on real-time hardware. We believe that the simplicity and robustness of the methods proposed, along with the power of modem architectures, will soon allow us to insert them into the control loop of mechanical systems. The flexibility of vision as a sensor, once brought to real-time operation, opens up a number of applications ranging from visuallyguided navigation, manipulation, surveillance, active sensing, and recognition.

Suppose we are able to measure n: up to some white, zero-mean Gaussian noise y(t) = 5 ( t ) + n(t) n E N(0, Rn).</p><p>We are interested in identifying the parameters a recursively from the measurements {y(t)} based on the minimization of some cost function of the prediction error (for a classical treatment of prediction error methods (PEM) for linear explicit models, see for example, [67], [48j, and [47]).</p><p>A common paradigm for PEM identification consists in forcing a Kalman filter to work as a parameter estimator. The state of the filter is augmented with the unknown parameters which are described using a random walk model. In this section we will extend this paradigm to nonlinear implicit dynamics and parameters living on a topological manifold. We will restrict our attention to discrete time dynamics, although the same analysis may be carried out for continuous time models. First we proceed in analogy with the linear-explicit case: we describe the local coordinates of the parameters as first-order random walk and use the dynamic constraint as an implicit measurement constraint a(t + 1) = a(t) + n,(t) a(0) =a0</p></div>

We assume n,, the noise driving the random walk, to be white, zero-mean and Gaussian; its variance R, may be regarded as a tuning parameter. The noise process {n(t)} induces a residual in the measurement equation: If we approximate x ( t ) with y ( t ) , in general we will observe h[y(t), y(tl), a] = fi # 0, where iz depends on { n } , {y} and U . This residual-as we will see-is the prediction error (or pseudo-innovation) when choosing a least-squares criterion in the PEM.</p><p>Let us collect the measurements into a vector g ( t ) = [yT(t) yT(tl)lT and, similarly, with n ( t ) = [nT(t) nT(t -1)IT.

The derivation is based on the simple fact that the variational model about the current trajectory is linear and explicit, so that the a pseudo-innovation process may be defined analogously to the explicit case.</p><p>The derivation of the IEKF in Appendix B does not address the fact that the noise 5, is correlated (see point 2) above). The residual of the measurement equation fi, which is in fact the pseudo-innovation of the filter, is characterized in terms of E , provided that the last is white, zero-mean, and uncorrelated with n,. In the following section, we will show how to whiten and therefore reduce the problem to a form suitable for using the IEKF as derived in Appendix B. Later on we will see how the problem simplifies by assuming that E is white.</p></div>
