<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION 1.1 Motivation</head><p>The Information Era has witnessed not only a huge volume of data, but also a huge number of sources or data feeds from websites, Twitter, blogs, online social networks, collaborative annotations, social bookmarking, data markets, and so on. The abundance of useful information surrounding us and the advantage of easy data sharing have made it possible for data warehousing and integration systems to improve the quality of the integrated data. For example, with more sources, we can increase the coverage of the integrated data; in the presence of inconsistency, we can improve correctness of the integrated data by leveraging the collective wisdom. Such quality improvement allows for more advanced data analysis and can bring a big gain. However, we also need to bear in mind that data collection and integration come with a cost. First, many data sources, such as GeoLytics for demographic data <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , WDT for weather data <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , GeoEye for satellite imagery <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , American Business Database for business listings <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , charge for their data. Second, even for sources that are free, integration requires spending resources on mapping heterogeneous data items, resolving conflicts, cleaning the data, and so on. Such costs can also be huge. Actually, the cost of integrating some sources may not be worthwhile if the gain is limited, especially in the presence of redundant data and lowquality data. We next use a real-world example to illustrate this. EXAMPLE 1.1. We consider a data set obtained from an online bookstore aggregator, AbeBooks.com <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . We wish to collect data on CS books. There are 894 bookstores (each corresponding to a data provider), together providing 1265 CS books. They identify a book by its ISBN and provide the same attributes. We focus on coverage (i.e., the number of provided books) and define it as the gain.</p><p>We processed the sources in decreasing order of their coverage (note that this may not be the best ordering if we consider in addition overlaps between the sources) and reported the total number of retrieved books after probing each new source. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> plots for the first 100 sources. We observe that the largest source already provides 1096 books (86%), and the largest two sources together provide 1213 books (96%). We obtained information for 1250 books, 1260 books and all 1265 books after integrating data from 10, 35 and 537 sources respectively. In other words, after integrating the first 537 sources, the rest of the sources do not bring any new gain. Now assume we quantify the cost of integrating each source as 1. Then, integrating the 11th to 537th sources has an extra cost of 537 -10 = 527 but an additional gain of only 1265 -1250 = 15. Thus, if we are willing to tolerate a slightly lower coverage, it is even not worthwhile to integrate all of the first 537 sources.</p><p>2</p><p>This example shows that integrating new sources may bring some gain, but with a higher extra cost. Even worse, some low-quality sources may even hurt the quality of the integrated data and bring a negative gain, as we illustrate next. EXAMPLE 1.2. Continue with the same data set. We observed that different sources can provide quite different titles and author lists for the included books. Take author lists as an example. Even after we normalized the author lists to a standard format and ignored middle names, each book has 1 to 23 different provided author lists and the number is 4 on average. Mistakes include missing authors, additional authors, mis-ordering of the authors, misspelling, incomplete names, etc. For evaluation purpose, we man- ually checked the book title page for 100 randomly selected books to obtain the correct author lists as the gold standard.</p><p>Ideally, we would like to find the correct author list from conflicting values. We did this in two ways. First, VOTE applies the voting strategy and chooses the author list provided by the largest number of sources. Second, ACCU considers in addition the accuracy of the sources: it takes the accuracy of each source as input (computed by the percentage of correctly provided values for the books inside the gold standard), assigns a higher vote to a source with a higher accuracy, and chooses the author list with the highest sum of the votes (details in Section 3).</p><p>We considered the sources in decreasing order of their accuracy (this is just for illustration purpose and we discuss ordering of sources in Section 1.3). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref> plots the gain, defined as the number of correctly returned author lists for these 100 books, as we added each new source. We observed that we obtained all 100 books after processing 548 sources (see the line for #(Returned books)). The number of correct author lists increased at the beginning for both methods; then, VOTE hits the highest number, 93, after integrating 583 sources, and ACCU hits the highest number after integrating 579 sources; after that the numbers decreased for both methods and dropped to 78 and 80 respectively for VOTE and ACCU. In other words, integrating the 584th to 894th sources has a negative gain for VOTE and similar for ACCU.</p><p>2</p><p>This example shows that for data, "the more the better" does not necessarily hold and sometimes "less is more". As the research community for data integration has been focusing on improving various integration techniques, which is important without a doubt, we argue that it is also worthwhile to ask the question whether integrating all available data is the best thing to do. Indeed, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref> shows that although in general the more advanced method, ACCU, is better than the naive method, VOTE, the result of ACCU on all sources is not as good as that of VOTE on the first 583 sources. This question is especially relevant in the big data environment: not only do we have larger volume of data, but also we have larger number of sources and more heterogeneity, so we wish to spend the computing resources in a wise way. This paper studies how we can select sources wisely before real integration or aggregation such that we can balance the gain and the cost. Source selection can be important in many scenarios, ranging from Web data providers that aggregate data from multiple sources, to enterprises that purchase data from third parties, and to individual information users who shop for data from data markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Source selection by Marginalism</head><p>Source selection in the planning phase falls in the category of resource optimization. There are two standard ways to formalize the problem: finding the subset of sources that maximizes the result quality under a given budget, or finding the subset that minimizes the cost while satisfying a minimal requirement of quality. However, neither of them may be ideal in our context, as shown next. EXAMPLE 1.3. Consider ACCU in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>. Assume only for simplicity that the applied order is the best for exploring the sources. Suppose the budget allows integrating at most 300 sources; then we may select all of the first 300 sources and obtain 17 correct author lists. However, if we select only the first 200 sources, we can cut the cost by 1/3, while obtaining only 3 fewer correct author lists (17.6% fewer); arguably, the latter selection is better. On the other hand, suppose we require at least 65 correct author lists; then we may select the first 520 sources, obtaining 65 correct lists. However, if we instead select 526 sources, we introduce 1% more cost but can obtain 81 correct lists (improving by 25%); arguably, spending the few extra resources is worthwhile.</p><p>2</p><p>We propose a solution inspired by the Marginalism principle in economic theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Assuming we can measure gain and cost using the same unit (many enterprises do predict revenue and expense from integration in dollars according to some business models), we wish to stop selecting a new source when the marginal gain is less than the marginal cost. Here, the marginal gain is the difference between the gain after and before integrating the new source and similar for marginal cost. In our example, if the gain of finding one correct author list is 1 while the cost of integrating one source is .1, the 548th source is such one marginal point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Challenges for data integration</head><p>Source selection falls outside the scope of traditional integration tasks, such as mapping schemas, linking records that refer to the same real-world entity, and resolving conflicts. On the one hand, it is a prelude for data integration. On the other hand, how we select the sources would be closely related to the integration techniques we apply. Applying the Marginalism principle to source selection for data integration faces many challenges.</p><p>First, in economic theory the Law of Diminishing Returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (i.e., keeping adding resources will gradually yield lower per-unit returns) often holds and so we can keep adding resources until the marginal cost exceeds the marginal gain for the next unit of resource. However, the Law of Diminishing Returns does not necessarily hold in data integration, so there can be multiple marginal points. In our example (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>), after we integrate 71 sources by ACCU, the gain curve flattens out and the marginal gain is much less than the marginal cost; however, starting from the 381st source, there is a sharp growth for the gain. Indeed, there are four marginal points on the curve: the 35th, 71st, 489th, and 548th sources (marked by vertical lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>). We thus need to find all marginal points before we stop investigation.</p><p>Second, the data sources are different, providing data with different coverage and quality, so integrating the sources in different orders can lead to different quality curves (so gain curves). Each curve has its own marginal points, so we need to be able to compare all marginal points in some way and choose one as the best.</p><p>Third, applying Marginalism requires estimation of integration cost and gain. The gain is often associated with quality of the integrated data and so can be hard to estimate, as we do not know integration quality before we purchase data and apply real integration. There can be multiple quality measures (e.g., coverage, accuracy, freshness, consistency, redundancy) and they can be affected by many aspects of integration, including the specific models applied for schema mapping, entity resolution, and conflict resolution, heterogeneity between the sources, and certainly also quality of the sources. We need a way to estimate integration quality, either by sampling, or by applying analysis on profiles of the sources. However, estimation on sampled data would require coordination between the sources, such as sampling on the same instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Our contributions in the fusion context</head><p>As a first step towards source selection, this paper focuses on the data fusion aspect; that is, resolving conflicts from different sources for offline data integration, as we illustrated in Ex.1.2. In particular, we make the following contributions.</p><p>First, we formalize several optimization goals for source selection, including the one that follows the Marginalism principle. Since each marginal point intuitively implies a locally maximum profit (i.e., difference between gain and cost), we set the goal as to select a subset of sources that brings the highest profit. Since accuracy is the main measure for fusion quality, we define the gain as a function of fusion accuracy (Section 2).</p><p>Second, we identify several properties that can affect source selection, where the most important is monotonicity-adding a source should never decrease fusion accuracy. We revisit various fusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, showing that none is monotonic, and propose a new model that satisfies monotonicity (Section 3).</p><p>Third, we show that for most fusion models, we are able to estimate resulting accuracy based purely on the accuracy of the input sources. We propose efficient estimation algorithms (Section 4).</p><p>Fourth, we show that in the context of data fusion source selection can be very tricky and a greedy algorithm can generate an arbitrarily bad solution. We show NP-completeness of the problems and propose a heuristic randomized approach that can efficiently approximate the optimal selection (Section 5). For our example in Section 1.2, our algorithm decided in a few minutes that the best solution is to select 26 sources that are estimated to output 97 correct author lists in the gold standard, so the profit is 97-.1 * 26 = 94.4, higher than the highest profit from marginal points for the particular order in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref> (87 -548 * .1 = 32.2)</p><p>Finally, we conduct experiments showing that 1) when the cost is zero, we are able to find the best subset of sources that maximizes the accuracy of fusion; 2) otherwise, we can efficiently find nearly the best set of sources for fusion (Section 7).</p><p>Our results apply when data inconsistency is the major issue, such as for AbeBooks data; in presence of schema and instance heterogeneity, we can also apply our methods by considering mistakes in schema mapping or entity resolution as wrongly provided data. In general, there are a lot of open problems, such as considering quality measures other than accuracy, resolving heterogeneity at the schema level and the instance level, and applying the techniques in various environments for warehousing and data integration. We describe one particular extension regarding coverage of the results in Section 6, and discuss the many open directions and lay out a research agenda in Section 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PROBLEM DEFINITION</head><p>This section first formally defines the source-selection problem and then instantiates it for the data fusion task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Source selection</head><p>We consider integration from a set of data sources S. We assume the data integration systems have provided functions that measure the cost and gain of integration. The cost is related to the expense of purchasing data from a particular source, the resources required for integration, cleaning, manual checking, etc., or any other foreseeable expense for data integration. The gain is typically decided by the quality of the integration results such as the coverage or the accuracy of the integrated data. Many enterprises apply business models to predict cost and gain in monetary units (e.g., US Dollars) respectively as the expense of integration and the revenue from integrated data with a certain quality; for example, one may estimate that obtaining data of 50% coverage can bring a gain (revenue) of $1M while obtaining data of 90% coverage attract more users and bring a gain of $100M . The cost and gain can be different when we apply different integration models; we thus denote by CF ( S) and GF ( S) the cost and gain of integrating sources in S ⊆ S by model F respectively. Here, F can be one or a set of integration models including schema-mapping models, entity-resolution models, datafusion models, and so on. We assume that the cost is monotonic; that is, if S ⊂ S , CF ( S) ≤ CF ( S ) for any F ; however, as we have shown in our motivating example, the gain is not necessarily monotonic as the resulting quality may not increase monotonically.</p><p>Ideally, we wish to maximize the gain while minimizing the cost; however, achieving both goals at the same time is typically impossible. A traditional approach is to set a constraint on one goal while optimizing the other. Accordingly, we can define the following two constrained optimization problems. DEFINITION 2.1. Let S be a set of sources, F be an integration model, and τc be a budget on cost.</p><p>• The MAXGLIMITC problem finds a subset S ⊆ S that maximizes GF ( S) under constraint CF ( S) ≤ τc. • The MINCLIMITG problem finds a subset S ⊆ S that minimizes CF ( S) under constraint GF ( S) ≥ τg. 2</p><p>As our analysis in Ex.1.3 shows, neither of these two constrained optimization goals is ideal. Inspired by the Marginalism principle, we wish to stop integrating a new source when the marginal gain is less than the marginal cost; accordingly, we look for a set of sources whose profit (i.e., gain-cost) is the largest, assuming the same unit is used for cost and gain. If investing infinitely is unrealistic, we can also apply a budget constraint, but unlike in MAXGLIMITC, the budget constraint is not required for balancing gain and cost. We thus define another source-selection goal as follows. DEFINITION 2.2 (PROBLEM MARGINALISM). Let S be a set of sources, F be an integration model, and τc be a budget on cost. The MARGINALISM problem finds a subset S ⊆ S that maximizes GF ( S) -CF ( S) under constraint CF ( S) ≤ τc. 2 EXAMPLE 2.3. Consider a set S of 15 sources, among which one, denoted by S0, has a high quality and the others have the same lower quality. Consider two integration models F1 and F2, under which each source has a unit cost. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows the gain of applying each model first on S0 and then in addition on other sources.</p><p>If we set τc = 15, MAXGLIMITC would select all sources on both models, with profit 99.98 -15 = 84.98. If we set τg = 90, MINCLIMITG would select S0 on both models, with profit 90-1 = 89. Instead, MARGINALISM selects S0 and 4 other sources on model F1 and obtains a profit of 98.5 -5 = 93.5; it selects S0 and 3 others on model F2 and obtains a profit of 97.8 -4 = 93.8. Obviously, MARGINALISM can obtain higher profit than the other two approaches.</p><p>2</p><p>Solving any of these problems requires efficiently estimating the cost and gain. For cost, we assume that CF ( S) = S∈ S C(S) for any F ; it is monotonic and typically holds in practice. The gain depends on the quality measure. In this paper we instantiate it as a function of the accuracy in data fusion, which we review next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data fusion and accuracy estimation</head><p>Data fusion: We consider a set of data items D, each of which describes a particular aspect of a real-world entity in a domain, such as the name of a book or a director of a movie. A data item can be considered as an attribute of a record, or a cell in a relational table. We assume that each item is associated with a single true value that reflects the real world. Also, we consider a set of data sources S, each providing data for a subset of items in D. We consider only "good" sources, which are more likely to provide a true value than a particular false value. We assume we have mapped schemas and linked records for the same real-world entity by applying existing techniques. However, different sources may still provide different values for the same data item. Data fusion aims at resolving such conflicts and finding the true value for each data item.</p><p>There are many fusion models. A basic one, called VOTE, takes the value provided by the largest number of sources. Advanced methods consider source trustworthiness and give higher weights to votes from more trustworthy ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. In this paper we focus on fusion methods that select a single true value for each provided data item. We denote a particular fusion method by F and its result on a set of sources S by F ( S) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> .</p><p>We measure fusion accuracy by the percentage of correctly returned values over all returned values and denote it by A(F ( S)). An important property that can affect source selection is monotonicity, requiring that adding a source at least will not deteriorate the quality of the fusion result. We formally define it next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEFINITION 2.4 (MONOTONICITY).</head><p>A fusion model F is monotonic if for any S ⊂ S ⊆ S, we have A(F ( S)) ≤ A(F ( S )). 2 EXAMPLE 2.5. Consider data items stating gender of people. Consider three independent sources S1, S2, S3 with accuracy .9, .6, and .6, respectively. Obviously, when we integrate only S1, the accuracy of the result is that of S1's accuracy, .9.</p><p>Now consider applying VOTE on all of the three sources to decide the gender of each person. We obtain the correct gender in two cases: 1) all sources provide the correct gender (the probability is .9 * .6 * .6 = .324); 2) two of the sources provide the correct gender (the probability is .9 * .6 * .4 + .9 * .4 * .6 + .1 * .6 * .6 = .468). Thus, the accuracy of the result is .324 + .468 = .792 &lt; .9, lower than that of integrating only S1. So VOTE is not monotonic.</p><p>2</p><p>Gain function: We define the gain of integrating S based on the accuracy of fusing sources in S; in the rest of the paper we abuse notation and denote by G(A) the gain of obtaining fusion accuracy A, and by G(A(F ( S))) the gain of fusing S by model F . We require the gain to be monotonic with respect to fusion accuracy; that is, if</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A &lt; A , G(A) ≤ G(A ).</formula><p>Note however that if we apply a fusion model that is not monotonic, the gain does not increase monotonically as we add more sources; both Ex.1.2 and Ex.2.5 are examples of reducing gain. When C(S) = 0 for each S ∈ S, the MARGINALISM problem reduces to finding the set of sources that maximizes fusion accuracy, which is interesting in its own right.</p><p>Accuracy estimation: According to the gain function, source selection requires estimating fusion accuracy without knowing (all) real data. In fact, we can estimate it purely from source accuracy and the distribution of false values (we explain in Section 4 the information we need for the distribution); both of them can be sampled on a small subset of data according to manually decided gold standard. The advantage of such estimation over measuring fusion accuracy directly on sampled data is that the latter would require much more co-ordination between sources in sampling, as we stated in Section 1.3. We formally define the problem as follows.</p><p>DEFINITION 2.6 (ACCURACY ESTIMATION). Let S be a set of sources, A(S) denote the accuracy of S ∈ S, pop be the distribution of false values, and F be a fusion model. Accuracy estimation estimates the accuracy of F ( S), denoted by Â(F ( S)).</p><p>2</p><p>This paper assumes independence of sources and that the data items are not distinguishable in terms of error rate and false-value distribution. We begin with considering only full-coverage sources (Section 3-5) and then extend our work by considering coverage of the sources (Section 6). Experimental results show effectiveness of our techniques in general even when the assumptions do not hold (Section 7), and we leave a more extensive study in the presence of source dependency for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PROPERTIES OF FUSION MODELS</head><p>This section starts with reviewing the models presented in recent work, showing that none of them is monotonic in general. We then propose a model that considers both the accuracy of the sources and the distribution of the provided values, and show that it is monotonic for independent sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Existing fusion models</head><p>VOTE chooses among conflicting values the one that is provided by the most sources. As shown in Ex.2.5, it is not monotonic. THEOREM 3.1. VOTE is not monotonic. 2</p><p>VOTE is not monotonic because it can be biased by values provided by less accurate sources.

We next review the model presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, named ACCU; other works follow the same spirit and have similar properties.</p><p>ACCU applies Bayesian analysis. If we denote the value provided by S on data item D by ΨD(S) and the vector of values from S by ΨD( S), ACCU computes P r(v true|ΨD( S)) for each value in the domain and chooses the one with the highest probability as true. According to the Bayes rule, it only needs to compare the inverse probability P r(ΨD( S)|v true) for each provided value.</p><p>ACCU assumes that (1) there are n false values for a data item in its domain and (2) these false values are equally likely to be provided by a source. Now consider the probability that source S provides ΨD(S) on D. If ΨD(S) is the correct value, the probability is A(S); otherwise, the probability becomes 1-A(S) n . If we denote by S(v) the providers of v, under the independence assumption,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P r(Ψ D ( S)|v true) = Π S∈ S(v) A(S) • Π S∈ S\ S(v) 1 -A(S) n (1) = Π S∈ S(v) nA(S) 1 -A(S) • Π S∈ S 1 -A(S) n .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In this equation, Π S∈ S 1-A(S) n</p><p>is the same for all values. Thus, we compute the accuracy score of S as α(S) = ln nA(S)</p><p>1-A(S) and compare the confidence of each value, computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C(v) = S∈ S(v) α(S).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>ACCU improves over VOTE in that it gives a less accurate source a lower vote count. However, its monotonicity is tied to the two assumptions it makes (all proofs are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). THEOREM 3.2.

Note however, this is hard when we do not know which value is the correct value; we thus compute the popularity of a value with respect to each other value being true. We denote by P op(v|vt) the popularity of v among all false values conditioned on vt being true. Then, the probability that source S provides the correct value (i.e., ΨD(S) = vt) remains A(S), but the probability that S provides a particular incorrect value becomes (1-A(S))P op(ΨD(S)|vt).

Consider the following distribution of false values for each data item: the i-th most popular false value has popularity (.2) i-1 -(.2) i (so the maximum popularity is .8). Consider three sources: S1 has accuracy .9 and provides value v1, S2 and S3 have accuracy .6 and both provide value v2. Obviously, VOTE would output v2. Assuming there are 100 false values, ACCU computes accuracy scores for the sources as ln 100 * . 9  1-.9 = 6.8, ln 100 * . 6  1-.6 = 5, 5, respectively; thus, v1 has confidence 6.8 and v2 has confidence 10, so it selects v2. POPACCU computes source accuracy scores as ln . 9  1-.9 = 2.2, ln .6 1-.6 = .4, .4, respectively; the popularity scores of both values are 1 ln 1 + 2 ln 2 = 1.4. Thus, v1 has confidence 2.2 -1.4 = .8 and v2 has confidence .8 -1.4 = -.6, so POPACCU selects v1.</p><p>Note that according to our knowledge of source accuracy and distribution of false values, the probability that S1 provides the correct value while S2 and S3 provide the same false value (so v1 is true) is .9 * .4 2 * (.8 2 + .16 2 + ...) = .1, and the probability that S1 provides a false value while S2 and S3 provide the correct one (so v2 is true) is .1 * .6 2 = .036 &lt; .1. Therefore, v1 is more likely to be true and POPACCU makes a wiser decision.</p><p>Finally, we randomly generated synthetic data for 20 sources with accuracy .9, .6, .6, . . . on 10000 data items. We started with the first source and gradually added the others; for each data set, we conducted fusion and computed the accuracy of the results (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). We observed that (1) the ranking of the result accuracy is always POPACCU, ACCU and VOTE; and (2) POPACCU is monotonic but ACCU and VOTE are not. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">QUALITY ESTIMATION</head><p>A fundamental problem in source selection is gain estimation; in the fusion context this relies on estimating accuracy of fusion results.

Specifically, we can enumerate all possible worlds of the provided values and </p><p>Estimating fusion accuracy is hard because the accuracy improvement from an additional source depends not only on the accuracy of the fusion results over previous sources, but also on the accuracy of each individual source, illustrated next. EXAMPLE 4.1. Suppose S1 contains one source with accuracy .9, S2 contains 41 sources with accuracy .6, and S0 contains 5 sources with accuracy .6. Assume there is a single false value. Fusing S1 and fusing S2 by POPACCU reach the same accuracy .9; however, adding S0 to S2 increases the accuracy to .915, while adding it to S1 does not increase the accuracy at all since even the total vote counts of S0 is much lower than that of S1.</p><p>2</p><p>The hardness of accuracy estimation remains an open problem even for VOTE, whereas we can prove #P-hardness <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> for a similar estimation problem (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>).

Thus, we focus on the difference between the vote counts of vt and v1, denoted by d, and consider three cases: (1) no false value is provided; (2) some false value but not v1 is provided; and (3) v1 is provided.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SOURCE SELECTION</head><p>The MARGINALISM problem can be very challenging when the gain is associated with fusion accuracy, illustrated as follows. EXAMPLE 5.1. Consider 11 sources, where the first one S has accuracy .8 and cost 10, while the rest of sources each has accuracy .7 and cost 1. Consider the gain function where G(A) = 100A when A &lt; .9, G(A) = 150 + 200(A -.9) when .9 ≤ A &lt; .95, and G(A) = 250 + 500(A -.95) when A ≥ .95. Consider POPACCU and assume the most popular false value has popularity .5. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> plots gain versus cost for two orderings of the sources.</p><p>Consider a naive strategy that greedily selects the next source that leads to the highest profit (gain-cost). According to the Law of Diminishing Returns, we would stop when the marginal gain from the next source is less than the marginal cost. However, in our context the marginal gain does not necessarily decrease monotonically; in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> for both orderings, the second source has a lower marginal gain than some later ones (this can be true even for a continuous gain model, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). If we follow this strategy, in our example we would select only S with profit 80-10 = 70, but selecting all sources would obtain a much higher profit 270 -20 = 250.</p><p>Even if we keep trying till we exhaust all sources and select the subset with the highest profit, this greedy strategy can still fall short because the best marginal points for different sequences of sources can be different, and the one for the greedily generated sequence may not be optimal globally. In our example, the greedy algorithm would probe S first as 80 -10 &gt; 70 -1; accordingly, the selection is at best to select all sources. However, excluding S from the selection would obtain a higher profit 266.5 -10 = 256.5 &gt; 250.</p><p>In fact, as we show shortly, this greedy scheme can result in an arbitrarily bad solution.</p><p>2</p><p>This section considers two cost models: the constant cost model assumes that all sources have the same cost and so the overall cost is decided by the number of sources; the arbitrary cost model assumes that each source has an arbitrary cost and so the overall cost is the sum of the costs. When the sources are free and we focus on data-processing time decided mainly by the number of input sources, we can apply the former; when we need to purchase data and different sources ask for different prices, we can apply the latter. Sec.5.1 shows that the various source-selection problems are in PTIME under the constant cost model but intractable under the arbitrary cost model. Sec.5.2 describes a randomized algorithm for the MARGINALISM problem.</p></div>

We solve the other two problems in a similar way.</p><p>Applying a monotonic fusion model can simplify source selection. First, MAXGLIMITC can simply choose the first M sources. Second, in the special case where all sources have cost 0 so essentially the goal is to maximize fusion accuracy, we can simply choose all sources (recall that we consider only "good" sources). THEOREM 5.3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Solving MARGINALISM</head><p>As illustrated in Example 5.1, a greedy strategy is insufficient for solving the MARGINALISM problem. Indeed, the next theorem shows that it can get arbitrarily bad results. THEOREM 5.5. Let dopt be the optimal profit for a given MARGINAL-ISM problem and d be that from the set of sources selected greedily by maximizing the profit in each step. For any θ &gt; 0, there exists an input set of sources and a gain such that d d opt &lt; θ. 2</p><p>We next present an algorithm that applies the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to solve the MARGINALISM problems; the same idea applies to the other two problems too. GRASP solves the problems of the greedy approach in two ways. First, instead of making the greedy decision every time, in each step it randomly chooses from the top-k candidates in terms of resulting profit, and chooses the best selection from r repetitions. Second, in each repetition, after generating the initial solution, it performs local search in a hill-climbing fashion. Both components are critical in avoiding exploring the sources in a fixed order and so make it possible to reach the optimal selection.</p><p>Algorithm 1 shows the framework of the GRASP approach. It performs r iterations (Ln.2). In each iteration, the construction phase builds a feasible solution S (Ln.3), and then the local-search phase investigates the neighborhood of S in a hill-climbing fashion until reaching the local optimal solution (Ln.4). It then returns the best solution from all iterations (Ln.5-7).</p><p>The construction phase (Algorithm 2) starts with the given subset of sources (empty initially) and iteratively adds a set of sources in a greedy randomized fashion. In each iteration (Ln.2-18), Ln.5 first checks for each remaining source whether beating the current best solution is possible by reaching the maximum possible gain (i.e., G(1)), and skips the source if not. Ln.6 estimates the difference between the marginal gain and marginal cost of adding the source. Then, Ln.7-12 maintains the top-k candidates; Ln.13-16 randomly selects one of them to add next. Finally, Ln.17-19 chooses the prefix subset with the highest profit. S: already selected sources; g: gain for S; c: cost for S; k: finding top-k candidates Output : &lt; Sopt, g, c &gt;: the newly selected sources and their gain and cost Sopt ← S; fopt ← g -c; // Initialize the best solution as the input </p><formula xml:id="formula_22">1 foreach i ∈ [1, |S| -| S|] do 2 // Find top-k candidates BEST ← ∅; F ← ∅; // Store the top-k candidates 3 foreach S ∈ S \ S do 4 if G(1) -c -C(S) &gt; fopt then 5 f ← G( Â(F ( S ∪ {S}))) -g -C(S); 6 k ← rank of f in F ; 7 if k ≤ k then 8 BEST ← BEST ∪ {S}; F ← F ∪ {f }; 9 if | F | &gt; k</formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">16 if f 0 &gt; fopt then 17 fopt ← f 0 ; Sopt ← S; 18 return &lt; Sopt, fopt + C( Sopt), C( Sopt) &gt;; 19</formula><p>The local-search phase (Algorithm 3) takes the initial solution as input and iteratively explores its neighborhood for a better solution. In each iteration (Ln.2-10), it examines each of the already selected sources S (Ln.4), and compares the current solution with (1) the solution of removing S (Ln.5-6), and (2) the solution of replacing S with a subset of the remaining sources, selected by invoking CONSTRUCTION (Ln.7). It terminates when examining any selected source cannot improve the solution (Ln.2, Ln.8-10). Since the profit cannot grow infinitely, the local search will converge.</p><p>Note that when k = 1, all iterations of GRASP will generate the same result and the algorithm regresses to a hill-climbing algorithm. When k = |S|, the construction phase can generate any ordering of the sources and a high r leads to an algorithm that essentially enumerates all possible source orderings. We are not aware of any approximation guarantee for GRASP in the literature. Our experiments show that with a continuous gain model, setting k = 5 and r = 20 can obtain the optimal solution most of the time for more than 200 sources, but with a non-continuous gain model, we need to set much higher k and r. EXAMPLE 5.6. Consider 8 sources: the first, S, has accuracy .8 and cost 5; and each of the rest has accuracy .7 and cost 1. Consider POPACCU and gain function G(A) = 100A. Assume k = 1, so the algorithm regresses to a hill-climbing algorithm.</p><p>The construction phase first selects S as its profit is higher than the others (80 -5 &gt; 70 -1). It then selects 5 other sources, reaching a profit of 96.2 -10 = 86.2. The local-search phase examines S and finds that (1) removing S obtains a profit of 93.2 -5 = 88.2; and (2) replacing S with the 2 remaining sources obtains a profit of 96.2 -7 = 89.2. Thus, it selects the 7 less accurate sources. It cannot further improve this solution and terminates. 2 We next extend our results for sources without full coverage. We define the coverage of source S as the percentage of its provided data items over D, denoted by V (S). First, considering coverage would affect accuracy estimation. We need to revise Eq.(9-11) by considering the possibility that the k-th source does not provide the data item at all.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Experiment setup</head><p>Data: We experimented on two data sets. The Book data set contains 894 data sources that were registered at AbeBooks.com and provided information on computer science books in 2007 (see Ex.1.1-1.2). In total they provided 24364 listings for 1265 books on ISBN, name, and authors; each source provides .1% (1 book) to 86% (1088 books) of the books. By default, we set the coverage and accuracy of the sources according to a gold standard containing the author lists from the book cover on 100 randomly selected books. In quality estimation we set the maximum popularity p as the largest popularity of false values among all data items.</p><p>The Flight data set contains 38 Deep Web sources among top-200 results by Google for keyword search "flight status". We collected data on 1200 flights for their flight number and departing airport code (serving as identifier), scheduled/actual departure/arrival time, and departure/arrival gate on 12/8/2011 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for details of data collection). In total they provided 27469 records; each source provides 1.6% to 100% of the flights. We used a gold standard containing data provided by the airline websites AA, UA, and Continental on 100 randomly selected flights. We sampled source quality both for overall data and for each attribute.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows distribution of recall (coverage * accuracy) of the sources in the two data sets. For both data sets we observe a few highrecall data sources (3 Book sources and 8 Flight sources with a recall above .5), some medium-recall sources (11 Book sources and 3 Flight sources with a recall in [.25, .5)), and a large number of "tail" sources with low recall; however, the "tail" recall is mainly due to low coverage in Book but due to low accuracy in Flight. We observed very similar results on these two data sets; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> also describes experiments on synthetic data. Implementation: We implemented three fusion models VOTE, ACCU, and POPACCU. We handled ties by randomly choosing a value with highest votes.</p><p>We considered three optimization goals: MAXGLIMITC with τc = G (1)  2 (G(1) corresponds to the maximum gain), MINCLIMITG with τg = G(.8), and MARGINALISM with τc = ∞. We implemented GRASP for each goal; by default we set r = 20, k = 5. For MARGINALISM, we in addition implemented the GREEDY algorithm, which essentially invokes CONSTRUCTION with k = 1.</p><p>We tried different cost and gain models to study their effect on source selection. We used three gain models: LINEARGAIN assumes that the gain grows linearly with recall of fusion results, denoted by R, and sets G(R) = 100R; QUADGAIN assumes that the gain grows quadratically with recall and sets G(R) = 100R 2 ; STEPGAIN assumes that reaching some "milestone" of recall would significantly increase gain and so sets</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">G(R) =         </formula></div>

We implemented in Java and experimented on a Linux server with 2.26 GHz Intel Xeon Processor X7560 and 24M Cache. Measures: For fusion results, we compared the returned results with the gold standard and reported the recall. For quality estimation, we reported the absolute and relative difference between the estimated recall and the fusion recall. For source selection we compared the selected sources by profit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Maximizing fusion quality</head><p>We first considered maximizing fusion quality; this is equivalent to solving the MARGINALISM problem with zero-cost sources.</p><p>Among the 894 sources in the Book data set, 228 provide books in the gold standard; among them MARGINALISM selects 165 (72.4%) for POPACCU. Actually, since POPACCU is monotonic (under the independence assumption), MARGINALISM selects all "good" sources. Also, MARGINALISM selects the same sources for VOTE and ACCU. All 38 sources in the Flight data set provide flights in the gold standard; among them Marginalism selects 18 sources (47%) for POPACCU, and 15 sources (39.5%) for VOTE and ACCU.</p><p>We ordered the sources such that the selected sources are ordered before the unselected ones, and the selected (resp. unselected) sources are in decreasing order of their recall. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows the recall by each fusion model as we gradually added the sources in this order. We made three observations. (1) the recall of POPACCU indeed is the highest (.96 for Book and .95 for Flight) on the selected sources and gradually decreases after fusing unselected sources, showing effectiveness of the selection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> The recall of POPACCU increases most of the time when processing the selected sources. Even though the assumptions that the data items are indistinguishable and the sources are independent do not hold on either data set, there are very few decreases for POPACCU at the beginning of the curve for each domain. (3) On average POPACCU improves over VOTE by 7.5% and over ACCU by 2.8% on Book, and by 13.7% and 7.8% respectively on Flight.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> compares the estimated recall with the real one. The difference is quite small and is the smallest for POPACCU. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> shows quality-estimation time on Flight (note that for each subset of sources we estimate quality for each attribute and then take the weighted average). POPACCU finished in 37 seconds on all sources, taking considerably longer time (3 orders of magnitude) than ACCU, which in turn took 1 order of magnitude longer time than VOTE. Thus, although POPACCU over-performs other models for fusion, it takes longer time to estimate its quality. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Source selection</head><p>We next took cost into account for source selection and conducted five experiments.</p><p>I. Selection-goal comparison: Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> compares different sourceselection goals when we applied VOTE, LINEARGAIN, and various cost models on Book data (we observed the same pattern for other fusion and gain models). First, MARGINALISM has the highest profit most of the time; on average it beats MAXGLIMITC by 72% as the latter always incurs a big cost, and beats MINCLIMITG by 15% as the latter always stops with a fairly low gain (depending on the thresholds). This difference is even more pronounced for the other gain models. Second, with more expensive sources, we tend to select fewer sources, so obtain a higher cost and a lower gain and thus a lower profit. In particular, under cost model CON-STCOST with C(S) = 1, MARGINALISM selects 7 sources and obtains an estimated gain of 90.5 (profit 90.5 -7 = 83.5); recall from Section 1 that with C(S) = .1, MARGINALISM selects 26 sources with profit 97 -2.6 = 94.4.</p><p>We have similar observations on Flight data: MARGINALISM beats MAXGLIMITC by 55% and beats MINCLIMITG by 4.9%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Algorithm comparison:</head><p>We applied GREEDY and GRASP with k ∈ [1, 80] and r ∈ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">320]</ref> in solving the MARGINAL-ISM problem. We repeated the experiment 10 times on Book, each time on randomly selected 150 sources with books in the gold standard. On each data set we compared the selections by various algorithms and chose the one with the highest profit as the best. For each method we reported the percentage of times that the best selection is returned and for returned sub-optimal selections we reported the average difference on profit from the best selection. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the results for VOTE with RANDOMCOST or LINEAR-QUALCOST; we have similar observations for other cost models. We observed that (1) GREEDY has the worst performance, and the profit difference can be as high as 19.7%; (2) for LINEARGAIN and QUADGAIN, even GRASP with k = r = 1, which essentially is hill climbing, can usually obtain the best solution; and (3) the per-  formance of various methods for STEPGAIN, where the gain can be noncontinuous with fusion quality, is much worse; GRASP with k = 10, r = 320 often obtains the best selection; even when the solution is not the best, the profit difference is very low. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> shows the percentage of finding the best selection, the difference of profit, and the execution time for various combinations of r and k with VOTE, STEPGAIN, and RANDOMCOST on Book data. We have three observations. First, not surprisingly, repeating more times takes longer but can often lead to better Second, k 10 often has the highest percentage to obtain the best and very low profit setting k too low may not the best solution, while setting k too high is close to random selection and can actually lower the result quality. Third, the execution time increased when k was increased from 5 to 20, but then decreased when k went over 20, because when k is large, it is less likely to find a better solution in the random search and so there were fewer iterations in each local search. In the rest of the experiments, we set r = 200, k = 10 for STEPGAIN.</p><p>Source selection on Flight data (we randomly chose 15 sources each time) turns out to be easy. Even GREEDY obtains the optimal results for LINEARGAIN and QUADGAIN, and GRASP with k = 5, r = 10 obtains the optimal results for STEPGAIN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fusion-model comparison:</head><p>We compared various fusion models and observed quite similar selections on both data sets. For LIN-EARGAIN and various cost models, on Book the profit of VOTE is only 2.7% less than that of POPACCU on average and that of ACCU is only .3% less. In addition, we applied POPACCU on the sources selected by each fusion model, finding that the profit on selections by VOTE and ACCU is only .3% and 1% respectively less than that on selections by POPACCU. On the Flight data the four percentages are 1.6%, .1%, 1% and .1% respectively. This is not surprising because no matter which fusion model we apply, our algorithm tends to select sources with high quality and low cost.</p><p>IV. Robustness: We studied the effect of using less accurate quality measures on source selection. In particular, we used the overall coverage and the accuracy computed by applying iterative fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> on source selection. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the average profit difference over various cost models from using the precise measures. We observed that (1) for LINEARGAIN and QUADGAIN, the difference is very small, showing robustness of selection; and (2) for STEPGAIN, the difference is quite large when we use overall coverage on Book and estimated accuracy on Flight. STEPGAIN can be much more sensitive because the gain is not continuous with fusion quality; we did not observe a big difference for non-continuous cost models (RANDOMCOST and STEPCOST) though. V. Scalability: For scalability test, we gradually added non-zerocoverage sources in three orders: increasing order of recall, decreasing order, and random order. Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> plots the execution time for LINEARGAIN and LINEARQUALCOST and we have similar observations for other cost and gain models. First, our algorithm is fast: it took 12 minutes for POPACCU on Book data, less than 1 minute for any other fusion model and data, and less than 1 hour for synthetic data with up to a million sources of various quality distributions. This is quite acceptable since source selection is conducted offline and only once a while. Second, the execution time increases slowly after reaching a certain number of sources and may even drop: in random order when we increased the number of Book sources from 50 to 228 (3.56 times more), the execution time increased by 1.57 times for VOTE, by 3.32 times for ACCU, but decreased by 35% for POPACCU. This slow growth is because with presence of high-quality and low-cost sources, source selection often starts with those sources and spends very little time on other sources, whose number thus does not affect execution time much. Third, source selection reasons about only quality of data, so the execution time depends not on data size but on data quality: source selection took the longest time with a large number of sources with small-to-medium recall because of more hill-climbing steps (see the peak with in increasing order). Fourth, source selection is the slowest for POPACCU and fastest for VOTE, consistent with our observation on quality-estimation time reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>.</p><p>Recommendations: We have the following recommendations according to the experimental results.</p><p>• MARGINALISM is effective for source selection as far as we can measure cost and gain in the same unit. • For continuous gain functions, even local search performs quite well and setting k = 5 and r = 20 seems to be sufficient for GRASP; source selection is quite robust with respect to (sampled) source accuracy and coverage. Source selection is much more sensitive for StepGain, but setting k = 10 and r = 200 typically obtains good enough results.</p><p>On the other hand, different cost models do not seem to make a big difference. • POPACCU is preferred for real fusion, but can be expensive for quality estimation. Using VOTE in source selection can save a lot of time and generate a set of sources nearly as good as using POPACCU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">RELATED WORK</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, there has been very little work towards source selection for offline data aggregation. For online data integration, there has been a lot of work on source identification for the hidden Web (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for a survey), but they focus on finding sources relevant to a given query or domain and do not take quality into consideration. There has also been a fair amount of work focused on turning data-quality criteria into optimization goals for query-planning decisions in various contexts (collaborative information system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, P2P systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>). In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a data model for source quality and studied how to efficiently query such information; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> proposed incorporating quality requirements in queries; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed ranking returned answers according to source quality. None of them studies automatic source selection with cost in consideration and they optimize for each individual query. Naumann and Freytag <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> applied the data envelope analysis and measured the "efficiency" of each source by maximizing the weighted sum of quality (including intrinsic quality, accessibility, contextual quality) minus the weighted sum of cost (including response time, price). They did not discuss source selection according to the efficiency and did not consider the marginal quality gain a source can contribute regarding the rest of the sources. Data fusion has received a lot of recent interest (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> for surveys and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> for recent works). We showed that none of the existing fusion models is monotonic, and proposed a monotonic model. We are unaware of any work that estimates quality for any particular fusion model or for other integration tasks based purely on quality measures of the sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">CONCLUSIONS AND RESEARCH AGENDA</head><p>This paper studies source selection with respect to data fusion. We proposed algorithms that can efficiently estimate fusion accuracy and select the set of sources that maximizes the profit. In addition, we proposed a monotonic data-fusion model and show how monotonicity can simplify source selection. Experimental results show effectiveness and scalability of our algorithms.</p><p>There are many opportunities to extend this work for full-fledged source selection for data integration. We next lay out a research agenda by describing several future research directions.</p><p>Other quality measures: We can consider other quality measures, such as freshness, consistency, redundancy of data. We can also consider relationships between the sources, such as copying relationship, correlation between provided data items, etc. Future work includes efficiently estimating quality of the integrated data and selecting sources given these new measures.</p><p>Complex cost and gain models: When we have multi-dimensional quality measures, the gain model can be much more complex. Also, the cost model can be more complex according to some sophisticated pricing strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Future work includes providing declarative ways for cost and gain specification and studying their effect on source selection.</p><p>Using subsets of data: Different slices of data from the same source can have different quality; for example, a source may provide high-quality data for novels but low-quality data for books of other categories. Research directions include source selection with use of a subset of data from each source.</p><p>Other components of data integration: So far we incorporate mistakes in resolving schema and instance heterogeneity in source accuracy. Future work includes treating schema-mapping and entityresolution as first-class citizens in the picture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :F2Figure 3 :</head><label>123</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Coverage of results.</figDesc></figure>
