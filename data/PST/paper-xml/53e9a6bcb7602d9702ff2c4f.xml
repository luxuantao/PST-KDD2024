However, unlike (l + k)-CDE, in the constraint-handling mechanism of the infeasible situation, the hierarchical nondominated individual selection scheme is utilized, and an individual archiving technique is proposed to maintain the diversity of the population. Furthermore, in the constraint-handling mechanism of the semi-infeasible situation, the feasibility proportion of the combined population consisting of the parent population and the offspring population is used to convert the objective function of each individual. It is noteworthy that ICDE adopts a fixed tolerance value for the equality constraints.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the fields of science and engineering, there exist a large number of constrained optimization problems (COPs). In general, COPs with single-objective in minimization sense can be formulated as follows: minimize f ðxÞ subject to g j ðxÞ 6 0; j ¼ 1; . . . ; l h j ðxÞ ¼ 0; j ¼ l þ 1; . . . ; p where x ¼ ðx 1 ; x 2 ; . . . ; x n Þ 2 X # S is an n-dimensional decision vector, f ðxÞ is the objective function, g j ðxÞ is the jth inequality constraint, h j ðxÞ is the jth equality constraint, X is the feasible region defined by the l inequality constraints and the (p-l) equality constraints, and S is an n-dimensional rectangular search space in R n defined by the boundary constraints:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L i 6 x i 6 U i ; 1 6 i 6 n<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where L i and U i are the lower and upper bounds of the ith decision variable x i , respectively.</p><p>For COPs, if x 2 X; x is called a feasible solution; otherwise, x is called an infeasible solution. An inequality constraint g j ðxÞ ðj 2 f1; . . . ; lgÞ is considered active at a solution x 2 X if g j ðxÞ ¼ 0 at x. All equality constraints h j ðxÞ ðj ¼ l þ 1; . . . ; pÞ are considered active at all solutions of X.</p><p>When solving COPs, the equality constraints are usually transformed into the following inequality constraints:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">jh j ðxÞj À d 6 0<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where j = l + 1, . . . ,p and d is the tolerance value for the equality constraints.</p><p>In addition, the degree of constraint violation of a solution x on the jth constraint is calculated as follows:</p><p>G j ðxÞ ¼ maxf0; g j ðxÞg; 1 6 j 6 l maxf0; jh j ðxÞj À dg; l þ 1 6 j 6 p (</p><p>Due to the presence of different kinds of constraints, multi-modal objective function, and concave feasible region, COPs are usually very difficult to be solved. Traditional optimization methods may either get stuck in a local optimum easily or need expensive computational cost when solving COPs. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), inspired by nature, have turned out to be a very powerful optimization tool that requires little specific domain knowledge and is easy to implement. Because of the above advantages, EAs have gained much attention and have been broadly applied to solve COPs during the past decade. Meanwhile, various constraint-handling techniques have also been developed. By combining the constraint-handling techniques with EAs, a lot of constrained optimization evolutionary algorithms (COEAs) have been proposed.</p><p>As pointed out by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, COEAs need to achieve two goals. The first goal is to approach or enter the feasible region promptly, and the second goal is to find the feasible optimal solution. Thus, in order to obtain competitive performance, a COEA should contain effective constraint-handling technique and powerful search algorithm. The existing constraint-handling techniques can be mainly classified into three groups: methods based on penalty functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, methods based on preference of feasible solutions over infeasible solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, and methods based on multiobjective optimization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. In addition, the current popular search algorithms involve evolution strategy (ES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, differential evolution (DE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, particle swarm optimization (PSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, etc.</p><p>Recently, a (l + k)-constrained differential evolution ((l + k)-CDE) has been proposed by Wang and Cai <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> to solve COPs. (l + k)-CDE mainly consists of a (l + k)-differential evolution ((l + k)-DE) and an improved adaptive tradeoff model (IATM). According to the experimental results on 24 well-known benchmark test functions collected for the special session on constrained real-parameter optimization of IEEE CEC2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, (l + k)-CDE is an effective method for solving COPs. However, the tolerance value d for the equality constraints in (l + k)-CDE has to be changed dynamically according to the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d tþ1 ¼ dt d 0 if d t &gt; 0:0001 0:0001 otherwise (<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where t is the generation number, the initial value of d (i.e., d 0 ) is set to n log 10(max i=1,. . .,n (U i À L i )), and the change rate of d (i.e., d 0 ) is equal to 1.015.</p><p>Although Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) is adopted by Wang and Cai <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> to deal with different COPs, based on our experiments, both the initial value d 0 and the change rate d 0 of the tolerance value d in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) are problem-dependent. That is, when (l + k)-CDE is used to solve a new COP rather than the 24 test functions in Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Eq. (4) might not be an effective way for setting the tolerance value d. For example, we revise the upper bound of the first variable (i.e., x 1 ) of test function g21 in Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and obtain the following test function (called g25) to further investigate the effectiveness of Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. It is necessary to emphasize that other parts of test functions g21 are not changed and the global optimum of test function g25 is the same as that of test function g21. minimize f ðxÞ subject to g 1 ðxÞ ¼ Àx 1 þ 35x 0: 6  2 þ 35x 0:6 3 6 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h 1 ðxÞ ¼ À300x 3 þ 7500x 5 À 7500x 6 À 25x 4 x 5 þ 25x 4 x 6 þ x 3 x 4 ¼ 0 h 2 ðxÞ ¼ 100x 2 þ 155:365x 4 þ 2500x 7 À x 2 x 4 À 25x 4 x 7 À 15536:5 ¼ 0 h 3 ðxÞ ¼ Àx 5 þ lnðÀx 4 þ 900Þ ¼ 0 h 4 ðxÞ ¼ Àx 6 þ lnðx 4 þ 300Þ ¼ 0 h 5 ðxÞ ¼ Àx 7 þ lnðÀ2x 4 þ 700Þ ¼ 0</formula><p>where n = 7, 0 6 x 1 6 245, 0 6 x 2 , x 3 6 40, 100 6 x 4 6 300, 6.3 6 x 5 6 6.7, 5.9 6 x 6 6 6.4, and 4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref>  According to the experimental results over 25 independent runs, both the feasible rate and the success rate of (l + k)-CDE are only 68% for test function g25, compared with 100% for test function g21.</p><p>In order to overcome the drawbacks of the dynamic setting for the tolerance value d, a fixed value (e.g., 0.0001) is usually suggested for d <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, we find that if d is fixed to 0.0001 in (l + k)-CDE, both the feasible rate and the success rate will significantly decrease when solving the 24 benchmark test functions.</p><p>Motivated by the above considerations, this paper proposes an improved version of (l + k)-CDE, termed ICDE. ICDE employs an improved (l + k)-differential evolution (IDE) as the search engine and an archiving-based adaptive tradeoff model (ArATM) as the constraint-handling technique to solve COPs. Instead of dynamically changing the tolerance value d, ICDE assigns a constant (i.e., 0.0001) suggested by Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for the tolerance value d. In IDE, several mutation strategies and the binomial crossover of DE are adopted to generate the offspring population. Moreover, a novel mutation strategy named ''current-to-rand/best/1'' is proposed in IDE. Subsequently, the parent population and the offspring population are combined to obtain a combined population, and ArATM is used to select some potential individuals from the combined population for the next generation. Since during the evolution a population may inevitably experience three situations (i.e., the infeasible situation, the semi-feasible situation, and the feasible situation), ArATM designs three different constraint-handling mechanisms for the three situations respectively. In the infeasible situation, ArATM adopts the hierarchical nondominated individual selection scheme developed in ATMES <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Furthermore, an individual archiving technique is proposed to maintain the diversity of the population. In the semi-feasible situation, ArATM employs the feasibility proportion of the combined population, rather than the feasibility proportion of the last population used by (l + k)-CDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, to adjust the tradeoff between the objective function and the degree of constraint violations. By combining IDE with ArATM, ICDE shows strong search ability and can handle various kinds of constraints effectively. This paper utilizes the 24 well-known benchmark test functions collected for the special session on constrained real-parameter optimization of IEEE CEC2006 to measure the performance of ICDE. The experimental results show that ICDE overcomes the main drawbacks of (l + k)-CDE. Furthermore, ICDE is very competitive with or superior to other state-of-the-art COEAs.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 introduce some basic ideas of multiobjective optimization and DE, respectively. In Section 4, the related work is briefly reviewed. Section 5 presents a detailed description of ICDE. In Section 6, ICDE is tested on the 24 well-known benchmark test functions, and the performance of ICDE is compared with that of several state-of-the-art COEAs. Section 7 discusses the effectiveness of some mechanisms and the rationality of the parameter settings in ICDE. Finally, Section 8 concludes this paper.</p></div>

DE is a simple yet efficient EA, which has been widely applied to solve continuous optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>DE starts the search with an initial population containing NP individuals, which are randomly sampled from the search space. Then, one individual called the target vector in the population is used to generate a mutant vector by the mutation operation. So far, more than six mutation strategies have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, and four of them employed in ICDE are introduced as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">''rand/1'': ṽi ¼ xr1 þ F Â ðx r2 À xr3 Þ<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">''rand/2'': ṽi ¼ xr1 þ F Â ðx r2 À xr3 Þ þ F Â ðx r4 À xr5 Þ<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">''current-to-rand/1'': ṽi ¼ xi þ F Â ðx r1 À xi Þ þ F Â ðx r2 À xr3 Þ<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">''current-to-best/1'': ṽi ¼ xi þ F Â ðx best À xi Þ þ F Â ðx r1 À xr2 Þ<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>where r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , r 4 , and r 5 are integers randomly selected from {1, 2, . . . , NP} and satisfy r 1 -r 2 -r 3 -r 4 -r 5 -i, the scaling factor F is usually a real number between 0 and 1, xi is the current individual in the population, xbest is the best individual in the population, and ṽi is the mutant vector.</p><p>After mutation, all the components of the mutant vector are checked whether they violate the boundary constraints. If the jth component v i,j of the mutant vector ṽi violates the boundary constraint, v i,j is reflected back from the violated boundary constraint as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">v i;j ¼ 2L j À v i;j if v i;j &lt; L j 2U j À v i;j if v i;j &gt; U j v i;j otherwise 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; :<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>Subsequently, the crossover operation is implemented on the mutant vector and the target vector to generate a trial vector ũi . Two commonly used crossover operations are the binomial crossover and the exponential crossover.

Finally, the target vector xi is compared with the trial vector ũi in terms of the objective function value and the better one survives into the next generation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">xi ¼ ũi if f ðũ i Þ 6 f ðx i Þ xi otherwise<label>ð14Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The related work</head><p>During the past decade, DE has been widely applied to solve COPs and a lot of DE-based methods have been proposed. Storn <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> proposed a DE-based constraint adaptation named CADE. This method first relaxes all original constraints to make all individuals in the population feasible, and then reaches the original constraints by tightening the constraints step-bystep. Lampinen and Zelinka <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> combined DE with a penalty technique to solve mixed discrete-integer-continuous optimization problems. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> developed a hybrid DE including a multiplier updating. Moreover, an adaptive scheme for penalty parameters is incorporated. Lampinen <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> presented an extended DE for handling nonlinear constraint functions, which uses a new replacement criterion to deal with the constraint functions. Based on ES and DE, Runarsson and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed an improved stochastic ranking. The differential variation proposed in this method is a variant of the mutation operator of DE. Mezura-Montes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed a DE-based method. In this method, a diversity mechanism is introduced which allows the infeasible individuals with promising objective function values to survive into the next population. In addition, each parent is used to generate more than one offspring. Qin and Suganthan <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed a self-adaptive DE called SaDE, in which the learning strategies and the parameters settings are self-adapted during the evolution and a local search operator is added to speed up the convergence. For solving COPs, Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> generalized SaDE by incorporating the constraint-handling technique proposed by Deb <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Takahama and Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> applied the e constrained method to a DE and presented eDE, in which gradient-based mutation and feasible elite preserving strategy are proposed. Tasgetiren and Suganthan <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> presented a multi-populated DE called MDE. In MDE, the population is divided into several subpopulations which conduct the search in parallel. Moreover, MDE introduces a regrouping schedule periodically for information exchange among the subpopulations. Kukkonen and Lampinen <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> introduced the generalized DE (GDE). In GDE, the trial vector replaces its target vector if it weakly dominates its target vector. Brest et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposed jDE-2, in which three DE mutation strategies are used and two control parameters (i.e., F and CR) are self-adapted. Mezura-Montes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> allowed each individual to generate more than one offspring, and designed a new mutation strategy by combining information of both the best individual and the current parent individual to find new search directions. Becerra and Coello Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> proposed a DE-based culture algorithm, in which different knowledge sources are used to influence the variation operator of DE. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> presented a coevolution DE approach named CDE, which incorporates a coevolution model into DE and uses two kinds of populations to evolve solutions and penalty factors, respectively. Mezura-Montes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> summarized the most recent advances in nature-inspired methods for solving COPs. Takahama and Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proposed an improved eDE. To solve problems with many equality constraints and find feasible solutions stably, the improved eDE uses faster reduction of the relaxation of equality constraints and high gradient-based mutation rate. Brest <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> presented a self-adaptive DE named ej DE, in which the e constrained method is used to handle constraints. Moreover, this method employs several mutation strategies and reduces the population size during the evolution. Additionally, two control parameters (i.e., F and CR) are self-adapted. Mezura-Montes and Palomeque-Ortiz <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed an adaptive diversity DE named A-DDE, which self-adapts three parameters and controls the fourth one by a decreasing function.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Methods to compute the degree of constraint violation</head><p>Since the violations of different constraints may have different scales for COPs, ICDE uses two criteria to compute the degree of constraint violation of each individual in the population as (l + k)-CDE, according to the difference among the violations of different constraints.</p><p>In the initial population P 0 , the constraint violations of all the individuals are calculated at first. Then, the difference (denoted as diff) among the violations of all the constraints is measured by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">15</ref>): diff ¼ max j¼1;...;p ðmax i¼1;...;l G j ðx i ÞÞ À min j¼1;...;p ðmax i¼1;...;l G j ðx i ÞÞ ð15Þ</p><p>If diff is less than a user-defined parameter g which means that the difference among the violations of all the constraints is not significant, the first criterion described by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">16</ref>) is employed to compute the degree of constraint violation of each individual, with the aim of emphasizing the difference among the violations of different constraints:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Gðx i Þ ¼ X p j¼1 G j ðx i Þ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; l<label>ð16Þ</label></formula><p>On the contrary, if diff is bigger than g which means that the difference among the violations of all the constraints is significant, the second criterion is used to allot equal importance to all constraints as follows. Firstly, the constraint violations of all the individuals are normalized by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">17</ref>) for each constraint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">G 0 j ðx i Þ ¼ G j ðx i Þ max k¼1;...;l G j ðx k Þ ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; l; j ¼ 1; . . . ; p<label>ð17Þ</label></formula><p>Thereafter, the mean of the normalized constraint violations of each individual is calculated for all constraints by Eq.

Subsequently, the criterion, which is employed to compute the degree of constraint violation of each individual in the population, will be determined by comparing diff with g. If diff &lt; g, the first criterion will be used; otherwise, the second criterion will be used. Note that once the criterion is determined, it will be fixed during the evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Improved (l + k)-differential evolution (IDE)</head><p>IDE serves as the search engine in ICDE, and is designed by improving (l + k)-DE used in (l + k)-CDE. Note that (l + k)-DE is similar to (l + k)-ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Compared with the classic DE, IDE also includes the mutation and crossover operations yet the selection operation is not applied. In IDE, the population P t (i.e., the parent population) with l individuals generates a new population Q t (i.e., the offspring population) with k individuals by performing the following procedure:</p><p>Step (1) Set Q t = U;</p><p>Step (2) For each individual xi ði ¼ 1; . . . ; lÞ in P t ;</p><p>Step (3) Generate the first offspring ỹ1 by implementing the ''rand/1'' strategy and the binomial crossover of DE;</p><p>Step (4) Generate the second offspring ỹ2 by implementing the ''rand/2'' strategy and the binomial crossover of DE;</p><p>Step (5) Generate the third offspring ỹ3 by implementing a new mutation strategy (named ''current-to-rand/best/1'') proposed in this paper and the improved breeder genetic algorithm (BGA) mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>;</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Step (6) Q t ¼ Q t [ ỹ1 [ ỹ2 [ ỹ3 ; Step (7) End</formula><p>In Step (5), the ''current-to-rand/best/1'' strategy proposed in this paper is constructed by combining the ''current-torand/1'' strategy with the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy, according to the current generation number. The ''current-to-rand/ best/1'' strategy is implemented as follows. At first, the current generation number (denoted as current_gen) is compared with a threshold generation number threshold_gen, which is equal to the total generation number total_gen multiplied by a factor k (i.e., threshold_gen = k Â total_gen). If current_gen &gt; threshold_gen, the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy is used to generate the mutant vector ṽi for xi . Afterward, the improved BGA mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> described by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">19</ref>) is applied to the mutant vector ṽi with a probability p m for producing the offspring ỹ3 ¼ fy 3;1 ; y 3;2;...; y 3;n g, with the aim of increasing the diversity of the population:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">y 3;j ¼ v i;j AE rang i Â P 15 s¼0 a s 2 Às rand &lt; 1=n v i;j otherwise ; j ¼ 1; . . . ; n 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; :<label>ð19Þ</label></formula><p>where rand is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1, rang i defines the mutation range and is set to</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(U i À L i ) Â (1 À current_gen/total_gen) 6</formula><p>, the sign + or À is chosen with a probability of 0.5, and a s 2 {0, 1} is randomly generated with the probability p r (a s = 1) = 1/16. In addition, if current_gen 6 threshold_gen, the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy is used to generate the mutant vector ṽi and the improved BGA mutation is not implemented (i.e., in this case ỹ3 ¼ ṽi Þ.</p><p>In order to further explain the implementation of the ''current-to-rand/best/1'' strategy, we draw a schematic diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the whole evolutionary process is divided into two phases. Generally speaking, if we briefly divide the evolutionary process into three stages (i.e., the early stage, the middle stage, and the later stage), we expect that the first phase includes the early stage and some part of the middle stage of evolution, while the second phase includes the remaining part of the middle stage and the later stage of evolution. Next, the motivation to design the ''current-to-rand/best/1'' strategy is explained.</p><p>In the first phase, in order to prevent the population from getting stuck in a local optimum, it is very important to enhance the global search ability of the population. Since in the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy the individuals learn the information from other individuals randomly chosen from the population, this strategy is able to enhance the global search ability of the population. Thus, the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy is used in the first phase. Note that to further improve the global search ability of the population in the first phase, the first scaling factor of the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy is randomly chosen between 0 and 1. In addition, it is necessary to accelerate the convergence of the population and guide the population toward the global optimum in the second phase. Since the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy exploits the information of the best individual in the current population, the convergence velocity of the population is very fast when implementing this strategy. Therefore, this strategy is well suited for the second phase.</p><p>Based on the above analysis, the ''current-to-rand/best/1'' strategy has the capability to maintain a good balance between the diversity and convergence of the population to some extent, by combining the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy with the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Archiving-based adaptive tradeoff model (ArATM)</head><p>By combining the parent population P t with the offspring population Q t , a combined population H t is obtained. Note that for constrained optimization, the combined population H t may inevitably experience three situations (i.e., the infeasible situation, the semi-feasible situation, and the feasible situation). In the infeasible situation, all the individuals in H t are infeasible; in the semi-feasible situation, H t consists of both feasible and infeasible individuals; and in the feasible situation, all the individuals in H t are feasible.</p><p>As pointed out by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, a good COEA should not only handle constraints effectively but also optimize the objective function successfully. Consequently, it is critical for a COEA to make a suitable tradeoff between the objective function and the degree of constraint violation. Based on the above consideration, a novel archiving-based adaptive tradeoff model (ArATM) is proposed in ICDE, and in ArATM three different constraint-handling mechanisms are designed for the above three situations, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1.">The infeasible situation</head><p>In the infeasible situation, the combined population H t contains infeasible individuals only. At the early stage of evolution, H t is usually in the infeasible situation, especially when solving the highly COPs (i.e., the COPs have very small feasible region). Thus, the population should firstly enter the feasible region promptly. Meanwhile, the diversity of the population should be maintained.</p><p>To achieve the above purpose, a constraint-handling mechanism is designed in ArATM for the infeasible situation. This mechanism treats the objective function f ðxÞ and the degree of constraint violation GðxÞ as two objectives, and deals with them simultaneously. As a result, the original COP is transformed into a bi-objective optimization problem.</p><p>In the infeasible situation, ArATM is executed as follows:</p><p>Step (1) If archive A is not empty, randsize individuals are randomly selected from A and put into the combined population H t , where randsize is an integer randomly generated between 0 and jAj;</p><p>Step (2) Set A = U; Step (3) Set P t+1 = U;</p><p>Step (4) While jP t+1 j &lt; l /⁄ the hierarchical nondominated individual selection scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>⁄/;</p><p>Step (5)</p><p>The nondominated individuals in H t are identified based on Pareto dominance;</p><p>Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> The nondominated individuals are sorted in ascending order based on their degree of constraint violations; Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> The first half of the nondominated individuals are selected and stored into the population P t+1 ;</p><p>Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> These selected nondominated individuals are removed from H t ; Step (9) End</p><p>Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> If jP t+1 j &gt; l, delete the last (jP t+1 j À l) individuals in P t+1 and store them into H t ;</p><p>Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> All the individuals in H t are stored into A.</p><p>In Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> and Step (4), jAj and jP t+1 j denote the number of individuals in A and P t+1 , respectively. In the above procedure, the hierarchical nondominated individual selection scheme is used to motivate the population toward the feasible region and to maintain a good diversity of the population simultaneously. However, due to the limitation of the population size, in this selection scheme some good individuals (i.e., individuals with some important information) cannot win in the competition and, as a result, cannot enter the next population P t+1 , which results in the loss of the diversity of the population. To further enhance the diversity of the population, in Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> an individual archiving technique is proposed. In the individual archiving technique, the individuals, which cannot survive into the next population, are stored into the archive A and offered an opportunity to compete with individuals in the next combined population H t+1 again (Step (1)). Thus, some good individuals in A might win in the next competition, which plays a very important role in enhancing the diversity of the population throughout the evolution. By combining the hierarchical nondominated individual selection scheme with the individual archiving technique, the constraint-handling mechanism is very effective for the infeasible situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2.">The semi-feasible situation</head><p>In the semi-feasible situation, the combined population H t contains both infeasible and feasible individuals. For constrained optimization, how to deal with the infeasible individuals in the population is a very important issue. Since some information carried by certain infeasible individuals might be crucial to find the optimal solution, it is not reasonable to eliminate all infeasible individuals in the semi-feasible situation. Based on the above consideration, an adaptive fitness transformation scheme is designed in the semi-feasible situation, which selects not only some feasible individuals with small objective function values but also some infeasible individuals with both small degree of constraint violations and small objective function values for the next generation. The adaptive fitness transformation scheme is executed as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>At first, the feasible individuals and the infeasible individuals in H t are identified and their subscripts are recorded into two sets Z 1 and Z 2 , respectively.

Therefore, all the individuals are compared with each other based only on their objective function values, and l individuals with the least objective function values in H t are selected to constitute the population P t+1 for the next generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Differences between ICDE and (l + k)-CDE</head><p>Since ICDE is an improved version of (l + k)-CDE, both (l + k)-CDE and ICDE mainly consist of a search engine (i.e., (l + k)-DE and IDE, respectively) and a constraint-handling technique (i.e., IATM and ArATM, respectively). However, some differences between (l + k)-CDE and ICDE still exist and are summarized as follows:</p><p>In both (l + k)-DE and IDE, one parent generates three offspring by using three mutation strategies. Moreover, the first offspring and the second offspring are generated by the ''rand/1'' strategy and the ''rand/2'' strategy, respectively. In (l + k)-DE, the third offspring is generated by an improved ''current-to-best/1'' strategy based on the feasibility proportion of the last population. However, IDE designs a new mutation strategy named ''current-to-rand/best/1'' to generate the third offspring according to the current generation number. For the infeasible situation, IATM and ArATM design different constraint-handling mechanisms to handle constraints. Compared with IATM, ArATM randomly selects randsize individuals from a predefined archive A where randsize is an integer randomly generated between 0 and the size of A, and then puts them into the combined population H t to enhance the diversity of the population. After that, ArATM employs the hierarchical nondominated individual selection scheme developed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> to select the potential individuals for the next generation. Moreover, the archive A is used to store the individuals of H t which cannot survive into the next population. For the semi-feasible situation, IATM and ArATM use different ways to convert the objective function. In IATM, the objective function is converted based on the feasibility proportion of the last population. However, the conversion of the objective function in ArATM is based on the feasibility proportion of the combined population H t , the aim of which is to achieve a good balance between the diversity and the convergence of the population. In (l + k)-CDE, the tolerance value d for the equality constraints should be changed dynamically. Moreover, the initial value and the change rate of the tolerance value d are problem-dependent in (l + k)-CDE. However, in ICDE a fixed tolerance value d (i.e., 0.0001) is set for the equality constraints during the evolution, which eliminates some extra parameters for ICDE.</p></div>

For the sake of clarity, a histogram is drawn in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>  To the best of our knowledge, for g22 ICDE obtains the minimum mean function error value (i.e., 22.9) among the existing methods by using 5 Â 10 5 FES. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> records the FES required in each run for obtaining a solution satisfying the following success condition suggested by Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>: f ðxÞ À f ðx Ã Þ 6 0:0001 and x is a feasible solution. For test function g20, the objective function values of individuals in the population are smaller than that of the best known solution when the population is very close to the feasible region. Therefore, a changed success condition (i.e.,jf ðxÞ À f ðx Ã Þj 6 0:0001Þ is used in this paper. Moreover, the feasible rate (rate of runs where at least one feasible solution is found), the success rate (rate of runs where at least one solution satisfying the success condition is found), and the success performance (the mean FES for successful runs multiplied by the number of total runs and divided by the number of successful runs) are also presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>, ICDE obtains 100% feasible rate for all the 24 test functions except for g20. On the other hand, ICDE obtains 100% success rate for all the 24 test functions except for g22. As far as the success performance is concerned, to satisfy the success condition, ICDE requires less than 5 Â 10 3 FES for three test functions, less than 5 Â 10 4 FES for 11 test functions, less than 2 Â 10 5 FES for 16 test functions, less than 3 Â 10 5 FES for 18 test functions, and less than 4 Â 10 5 FES for all the test functions except for g22.</p><p>Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref>show the convergence graphs of logðf ðxÞ À f ðx Ã ÞÞ over FES at the median run for each test function with the termination of 5 Â 10 5 FES, where x is the best solution found.

Since ICDE cannot find feasible solutions for g20 and all solutions obtained by ICDE for g22 cannot achieve the success condition, the convergence graphs of these two test functions are not included in Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref>.</p><p>From Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref>, it can be seen that a fast convergence (less than 2 Â 10 5 FES) can be achieved for all the test functions except for six test functions (i.e., g02, g03, g10, g19, g21, and g23). For g03, about 2.5 Â 10 5 FES are needed. Moreover, for four other test functions (i.e., g02, g10, g19, and g21), the target accuracy level can be reached by using about 3 Â 10 5 FES. In addition, by using about 4 Â 10 5 FES, the convergence is achieved for g23. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that ICDE has a quite fast convergence speed for most of these 22 test functions.</p></div>

Note that, DE is used by all these six methods. Moreover, all these methods run 25 times independently for all the 24 test functions.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref> summarizes the experimental results for the above six methods. In this table, results for MPDE, GDE, jDE-2, MDE, and (l + k)-CDE are directly taken from the original references respectively. Due to space limitation, the results of those test functions for which all the six methods can achieve both 100% feasible rate and 100% success rate are omitted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref>, the mean feasible rate of ICDE (i.e., 95.83%) is superior to that of the other five methods. For MPDE, GDE, jDE-2, MDE, (l + k)-CDE, and ICDE, the corresponding number of test functions for which the feasible solutions cannot be found in all runs is 4, 9, 2, 2, 2, and 1, respectively. For ICDE, g20 is only the test function with less than 100% feasible rate. Note that, although g22 is a highly constrained problem, ICDE can achieve 100% feasible rate, compared with 16% provided by (l + k)-CDE and 0% provided by the other four methods. On the other hand, in terms of the mean success rate, the performance of ICDE also surpasses that of the five competitors. For MPDE, GDE, jDE-2, MDE, (l + k)-CDE, and ICDE, the corresponding number of test functions which cannot be successfully solved in all runs is 8, 13, 11, 4, 3, and 1, respectively. For ICDE, g22 is only the test function that cannot be successfully solved in any run. All the other five methods also fail to solve this test function. It is necessary to emphasize that for g20, (l + k)-CDE and ICDE are capable of obtaining 100% success rate.</p><p>In addition, the Friedman test <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is also used to compare these six methods. Firstly, these six methods are ranked in terms of their feasible rates and success rates on each test function, respectively, in which the best method is ranked 1 and the worst one is ranked 6. If some methods have the same feasible rate or success rate, the average rank is assigned. Afterward, the average rank of each method on all the test functions is computed. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref> shows the average ranks of these six methods. It can be seen that ICDE has the smallest average ranks (i.e., 3.2917 and 2.8021, respectively) on all the 24 test functions among the six methods compared, in terms of both the feasible rate and the success rate.</p><p>Note that MPDE, GDE, jDE-2, MDE, and ICDE assign a constant value (i.e., 0.0001) to the tolerance values d. However, (l + k)-CDE changes the tolerance value d dynamically during the evolution. Moreover, the settings of both the initial value  and the change rate of the tolerance value d are problem-dependent. The readers may be interested in the performance of (l + k)-CDE with d = 0.0001 (denoted as (l + k)-CDE-1) on the 24 test functions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref> summarizes the experimental results of ICDE and (l + k)-CDE-1 on eight test functions (i.e., g02, g05, g13, g15, g17, g21, g22, and g23). Note that, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref> we omit the results of those test functions for which ICDE and (l + k)-CDE-1 achieve the same feasible and success rates. According to the best, median, worse, mean, and standard deviation of the objective function values of the resulting solutions in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>, ICDE performs significantly better than (l + k)-CDE-1. Moreover, both the feasible and success rates of ICDE are 95.83% and much better than those of (l + k)-CDE-1 (91.67% and 81.83%, respectively). In addition, ICDE also performs better than (l + k)-CDE. The above discussion verifies our motivation to propose ICDE. Based on the above discussion, we can conclude that ICDE not only overcomes the drawbacks of (l + k)-CDE but also performs significantly better than the five state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">0 1 2<label>3 4 5 x 10 5 -12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Effectiveness of the individual archiving technique</head><p>In ICDE, an individual archiving technique is proposed in the constraint-handling mechanism of the infeasible situation. To verify the effectiveness of this technique, this subsection performs another experiment for ICDE without the individual archiving technique (denoted as ICDE-1). In ICDE-1, the archive A is not used during the evolution. The experimental results of ICDE and ICDE-1 for test functions g13 and g22 are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>, it can be seen that ICDE performs significantly better than ICDE-1 on g13 and g22, according to the performance indicators and the Mann-Whitney test.</p><p>Test function g13 is a highly constrained problem since it contains three nonlinear equality constraints. Even if these nonlinear equality constraints have been relaxed by the tolerance value 0.0001, the solution of g13 is still very difficult. It is very important for an algorithm to maintain a good diversity of the population throughout the evolution when solving g13. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>, the success rate of ICDE-1 is only 76%. However, 100% success rate is achieved by ICDE. This is because by the individual archiving technique, ICDE is able to maintain a better diversity of the population than ICDE-1.</p><p>Among the 24 test functions, g22 is one of the most highly constrained problems.

From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>, it can be seen that although the success rates of both ICDE and ICDE-1 are 0%, the feasible rate of ICDE is 100% and the feasible rate of ICDE-1 is only 64%. The above results verify the effectiveness of the individual archiving technique again. Note that ICDE is the first pure EA that is able to solve g22 with 100% feasible rate, according to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>From the above discussion, it can be concluded that for ICDE the individual archiving technique plays a very important role in maintaining the diversity of the population, especially when solving test functions g13 and g22.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Effectiveness of the ''current-to-rand/best/1'' strategy</head><p>In ICDE, a new mutation strategy (named the ''current-to-rand/best/1'' strategy) is proposed to generate the offspring. To confirm the effectiveness of this mutation strategy, another algorithm (denoted as ICDE-2) is constructed by replacing this mutation strategy with the improved ''current-to-best/1'' strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> in ICDE.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">10</ref> summarizes the experimental results of ICDE and ICDE-2 for six test functions (i.e., g10, g13, g17, g21, g22, and g23). From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">10</ref>, it can be seen that ICDE is significantly better than ICDE-2 on the above six test functions according to the performance indicators and the Mann-Whitney test.</p><p>Test function g10 contains eight decision variables and six inequality constraints. Moreover, the estimated feasibility ratio of g10 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> is only 0.001%. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">10</ref>, it can be seen that ICDE-2 provides only 4% success rate for g10. According to our observation to the evolutionary process of ICDE-2, in the improved ''current-to-best/1'' strategy, the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy is frequently used and the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy is rarely used in the infeasible situation. However, in the semi-infeasible and feasible situations, the phenomenon of using these two mutation strategies is just opposite. Actually, the frequency of using the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy is about 99 times of that of using the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy. Since the use of the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy will slow down the convergence velocity, in ICDE-2 the population converges too slowly to the optimal solution in 24 out 25 runs for g10. In contrast, ICDE achieves 100% success rate. This is because ICDE firstly uses the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy, and then switches to the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy according to the current generation number. After doing this, ICDE keeps a good balance between the diversity and convergence of the population. Test function g13 contains three nonlinear equality constraints. To find the optimal solution of g13, it is vital to maintain a good diversity of the population, especially in the early stage of evolution. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">10</ref>, ICDE-2 provides only 72% success rate. This is because the frequent use of the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy in the early stage results in the loss of the diversity of the population. Thus, the population converges to the current best individual promptly and ICDE-2 fails to find the optimal solution in 7 out of 25 runs. In contrast, ICDE puts emphasis on maintaining the diversity of the population by consistently using the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy in the early stage of evolution and, consequently, ICDE obtains 100% success rate.</p><p>Both test functions g17 and g21 are highly constrained problems. Test function g17 contains four nonlinear equality constraints and test function g21 contains five nonlinear equality constraints. To solve these two test functions, the population should have a good diversity in the early stage while a fast convergence is required in the later stage of evolution. Due to the improved ''current-to-best/1'' strategy, ICDE-2 cannot maintain a good diversity of the population in the early stage and the population converges very slowly in the later stage of evolution. As a result, ICDE-2 provides only 84% and 76% success rates for g17 and g21, respectively. However, by making use of the ''current-to-rand/best/1'' strategy, ICDE obtains a very good diversity and a fast convergence of the population in the early and later stages of evolution, respectively. Therefore, ICDE achieves 100% success rate. The above analysis can be further verified by the results of g22 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">10</ref>. Although g22 is also a highly constrained problem, the feasible rate of ICDE is 100%. However, ICDE-2 can only attain 44% feasible rate.</p><p>Test function g23 contains six constraints (two nonlinear inequality constraints, three linear equality constraints, and one nonlinear equality constraint). Since ICDE-2 frequently uses the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy in the later stage of evolution, the population converges very slowly and finally fails to converge to the optimal solution in all runs. ICDE uses the ''currentto-best/1'' strategy in the later stage of evolution, so the population can converge to the optimal solution promptly. As a result, 100% success rate is obtained by ICDE.</p><p>From the above discussion, it can be seen that the ''current-to-rand/best/1'' strategy has the capability to maintain a good diversity of the population in the early stage of evolution and accelerate the convergence of the population in the later stage of evolution. In summary, ICDE is able to effectively balance the diversity and the convergence of the population during the evolution.</p></div>

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">24</ref>), instead of using the feasible proportion of the last population as in (l + k)-CDE, ICDE uses the feasibility proportion of the combined population H t to convert the objective function of each individual in the combined population H t . To verify the effectiveness of the above improvement, this subsection tests a new algorithm (denoted as ICDE-3) by replacing the feasibility proportion of the combined population H t with the feasibility proportion of the last population in ICDE.

According to our observation, for this test function, the feasibility proportion of the last population is much larger than that of the combined population H t . After using the feasibility proportion of the last population, ICDE-3 makes a wrong choice, that is, more infeasible individuals are selected while some good feasible individuals are eliminated. As a result, the convergence of the population is decelerated and ICDE-3 fails to converge to the optimal solution in 19 out of 25 runs. In contrast, ICDE can succeed in solving g23 in all runs.</p><p>The above comparison demonstrates that it is more appropriate and effective for ICDE to adopt the feasibility proportion of the combined population H t in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.">The rationality of k</head><p>In ICDE, the factor k plays a very important role in keeping a good balance between the diversity and convergence of the population throughout the evolution. If k is too small, the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy will be used very frequently. As a result, the convergence of the population may be very fast while the diversity of the population may become poor. Thus, premature convergence might occur. However, if k is too big, the ''current-to-rand/1'' strategy will be used very frequently. As a result, the diversity of the population may be very good while the convergence of the population may become slow. Ultimately, incomplete convergence might occur. Therefore, a proper value of k is vital for the performance of ICDE.</p><p>In this subsection, the factor k is tested with five different values (i.e., 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8) and the experimental results for three test functions (i.e., g02, g20, and g22) are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">12</ref>.</p><p>Test function g02 includes 20 decision variables and a nonlinear objective function. Moreover, the estimated feasibility ratio of g02 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> is very large (i.e., 99.9971%). Therefore, to find the global optimum, the population should have strong global search ability. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">12</ref>, it can be seen that the results become better with the increase of k from 0.4 to 0.8. This is because a bigger value of k enhances the diversity of the population, and thus, ICDE can obtain better results for g02. The above results also suggest that a suitable value of k is between 0.6 and 0.8 for g02.</p><p>Test function g20 is one of the most difficult constrained problems among these 24 test functions, which contains 20 constraints (six nonlinear inequality constraints, two linear equality constraints, and 12 nonlinear equality constraints). So far, no feasible solution has been found by the pure EAs for g20. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">12</ref>, the performance of the algorithms gradually decreases with the increase of k from 0.4 to 0.8. This is because with the increase of k, the ''current-to-best/1'' strategy is used less and less, and thus, the convergence of the population becomes slower and slower. As a result, incomplete convergence frequently occurs. The success rates of ICDE with k = 0.7 and 0.8 are 92% and 60%, respectively, while all the other three algorithms (i.e., ICDE with k = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6) obtain 100% success rate. Additionally, the results of ICDE with k = 0.6 are statistically better than that of ICDE with k = 0.8, according to the Mann-Whitney test. Therefore, a value between 0.4 and 0.6 is suitable for k especially when solving g20.</p><p>Test function g22 is also a very highly constrained problem. So far, no EAs have found the optimal solution for this test function. Moreover, finding feasible solutions for g22 is also considerably difficult. As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">12</ref>, ICDE with k = 0.6 obtains the best feasible rate (i.e., 100%) among the five algorithms. Moreover, with the decrease of k from 0.6 to 0.4, the feasible rates also gradually decrease. The reason is that in these cases the convergence velocity becomes faster while the diversity of the population becomes worse. As a result, no feasible solution can be found in some trials. On the other hand, the feasible rates gradually decrease with the increase of k from 0.6 to 0.8. This is because with the increase of k, the diversity of the population becomes better however the convergence of the population becomes slower. As a result, the convergence velocity of the population might be too slow to enter the feasible region in some trials. Therefore, ICDE with k = 0.6 can keep a good balance between the diversity and the convergence of the population, especially for g22.</p><p>From the above discussion, it is obvious that ICDE with k = 0.6 can keep the best balance between the diversity and the convergence of the population and obtain the best overall performance on the 24 test functions. Therefore, k = 0.6 is recommended for ICDE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion and future work</head><p>Very recently, Wang and Cai <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> proposed (l + k)-constrained differential evolution ((l + k)-CDE) for constrained optimization problems (COPs). However, (l + k)-CDE has to dynamically change the tolerance value for the equality constraints. a means that the corresponding result is significantly worse than that of ICDE with k = 0.6.</p><p>Moreover, both the initial value and the change rate of the tolerance value are problem-dependent. Recognizing the above drawbacks of (l + k)-CDE, we propose an improved version of (l + k)-CDE, named ICDE. ICDE is mainly composed of an improved (l + k)-differential evolution (IDE) and an archiving-based adaptive tradeoff model (ArATM). Note that the former serves as the search engine and the latter is used to handle the constraints. Moreover, ICDE uses two criteria to compute the degree of constraint violation of each individual in the population, according to the difference among the violations of different constraints. Compared with (l + k)-CDE, ICDE has four main differences: (1) a new mutation strategy named ''current-to-rand/best/1'' is designed in ICDE to replace the improved ''current-to-best/1'' strategy in (l + k)-CDE for producing the offspring; (2) ICDE uses the hierarchical nondominated individual selection scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and proposes an individual archiving technique in the constraint-handling mechanism of the infeasible situation; (3) in the constraint-handling mechanism of the semi-infeasible situation, instead of using the feasibility proportion of the last population as in (l + k)-CDE, the feasibility proportion of the combined population H t is employed by ICDE to convert the objective function of each individual; and 4) instead of dynamically changing the tolerance value for the equality constraint as in (l + k)-CDE, a fixed tolerance value for the equality constraints is adopted in ICDE.</p><p>The performance of ICDE is tested on 24 benchmark test functions collected for the special session on constrained real parameter optimization of IEEE CEC2006. The experimental results show that ICDE not only overcomes the main drawbacks of (l + k)-CDE but also obtains very competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods for COPs in the community of constrained evolutionary optimization. ICDE can achieve both 100% feasible rate and 100% success rate for all these 24 test functions except for two highly constrained test functions (i.e., g20 and g22). For test function g20, ICDE obtains 100% success rate. Moreover, the feasible rate of ICDE is 100% for g22. Note that ICDE is the first pure EA that provides 100% feasible rate for g22, to the best of our knowledge. Both the mean feasible and success rates derived from ICDE are 95.83%. In addition, the effectiveness of some mechanisms proposed in ICDE is verified empirically. Furthermore, the rationality of the setting for the factor k is also studied by experiments.</p><p>In future studies, we will introduce some other search algorithms and constraint-handling techniques to further improve the performance of ICDE. Moreover, we are considering the possibility of extending ICDE to deal with constrained combinational optimization problems and constrained multiobjective optimization problems. Finally, the application of ICDE to solve real-world optimization problems is also our future work.</p><p>The source code of ICDE is available upon request from the corresponding author.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Definition 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(Pareto dominance): Consider two decision vectors ã ¼ ða 1 ; . . . ; a n Þ and b ¼ ðb 1 ; . . . ; b n Þ, ã is said to Pareto dominate b (denoted as ã 0 bÞ, if and only if 8i 2 f1; . . . ; mg; f i ð ãÞ 6 f i ð bÞ and 9j 2 f1; . . . ; mg; f j ð ãÞ &lt; f j ð bÞ ð 5Þ In this case, b is said to be Pareto dominated by ã.
