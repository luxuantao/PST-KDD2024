<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>There has been a growing interest to study and build systems of mobile sensor networks. It is envisaged that in the near required information to personnel outside, Our approach the problem of future, very large scale networks consisting of both mobile based on virtual potential fields. we treat each node in the and static nodes will be deployed for applications ranging network as a virtual charged particle and &amp;fine simple force from environment monitoring to emergency search-and-rescue laws to the interaction neighboring operations <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref>. The mobile nodes in the network will enhance kinds of One is its capabilitiesthey could be used to physically collect and a repulsive force that tries maximize coverage while the is degree.As a result of these forces, a group of nodes placed reconfigure. Further, for successful operation of the network, coverage while satisfying the the deployment should result in configurations that not only provide good 'sensor coverage' but also satisfy certain local (e.g. node degree) and global (e.g. network connectivity) constraints. Informally, Constrained Coverage is the problem of finding a deployment configuration which maximizes the collective sensor coverage of the nodes while satisfying one or more constraints.</p><p>In this paper we consider constrained coverage for a network whose constituent nodes are all autonomous mobile robots.</p><p>The constraint we consider is node degreethe number of neighbors of each node in the network. More precisely, we require each node to have a minimum degree K , where K is parameter of the deployment algorithm. Our interest in this particular constraint is twofold </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">RELATED WORK</head><p>In 1992, Gage inlroduced a taxonomy for coverage by multirobot systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. He defined three kinds of coverage: blanket coverage, barrier coverage and sweep coverage. According to this taxonomy our problem falls into the category of blanket coverage problems where the main objective is to maximize the total detection area.</p><p>The problem of dispersing a large group of mobile robots into an unknown environment has received a lot of anention. Arkin and Ali developed a behavior-based approach for dispersion of robot-teams by using a random-wandering behavior coupled with obstacle and robot avoidance behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. More recently, Batalin and Sukhatme have addressed the problem of multi-robot area coverage <ref type="bibr">[b]</ref>.Their approach is based on using local dispersion of the robots to achieve We make the following assumptions:</p><p>1) The nodes are capable of omni-directional motion, 2) Each node can sense the exact relative range and bearing of its neighbors, 3) The quality of sensing (communication) is constant within R. <ref type="bibr">(R,)</ref> and is zero outside the sensing (communication) range, i.e. it follows a binary model.</p><p>We impose certain desiderata on the problem solution. .The be distributed and scalable not require a prior map or localization of nodes . adapt to changes in the environment and the network itself . mince of the deployment algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. THE DEPLOYMENT ALGORITHM</head><p>Potential field-based techniques have been used extensively to solve navigation problems in mobile robotics. In these methods, virtual potential fields are used to represent goals and constraints and the control law for the robot's motion is formulated such that it moves from a high potential state to a low potential state similar to-the way in which a charged panicle would move in an electrostatic field.</p><p>In our deployment algorithm, we construct virtual forces between nodes so that each node can attract or repel its neighbors. The forces are of two kinds. The first, Fcover, causes the nodes to repel each other to increase their coverage, and the second, Fdes,,, constrains the degree of nodes by making them attract each other when they are on the verge of being disconnected. By using a combination of these forces each node maximizes its coverage while maintaining a degree of at least K.</p><p>In OUT experiments, each node.begins with more than K neighbors and repels all of them using Fcover till it has only K left. The resulting neighbors are called the node's critical neighbors and the connections between them and the node are called critical connections.</p><p>The node now communicates to all its neighbors that its connection with them is critical and therefore should not be broken. It then continues to repel all its neighbors using F, , but as the distance between the node and its critical neighbor increases. IIFcOverll decreases and [lFdegree/l increases. As a result, at some distance qRc, where 0 &lt; q &lt; 1, the net force IIFcOver + Fdesreell between the node and its neighbor is zero. At this distance, the node and its neighbor are in equilibrium with respect to each other. We call f the safety factor because the larger its value, the smaller the probability of critical neighbors losing connectivity.</p><p>The forces are constructed as inverse square law profiles -llFcowr1l tends to infinity when the distance between nodes is zero so that collisions are avoided. Similarly, llFdegreell tends to infinity when the distance between the critical neighbors is R, so that loss of connectivity between them is prevented.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a node with &gt; K and exactly K neighbors and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the corresponding force profiles.</p><p>Mathematically, the forces can be expressed. as follows.</p><p>Consider a .network of n nodes 1,2,3,. . .,TI at positions xl, x2,. . . ,x,-respectively. Let Asij represent the Euclidean distance between nodes i and.j, i.e. Az, = 11%xjll F,,,,.and Fdegree arcdefined as follows.</p><p>1) the normalized per-node coverage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>U and q.</head><p>K,,,.,:</p><p>Consider two nodes that are repelling each other. As the distance d between them increases, the combined coverage of the nodes increases, reaches a maximum of 2rR: at d = 2R. and remains constant after that. This implies that for d &gt; 2R, repelling does not improve coverage. We therefore pick a value for K,,,,, such that Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> THE DEPLOYMENT ALGORITHM . q: A large q increases the probability of critical neighbors getting disconnected while a small q results in lesser coverage. We used a value of 0.8 for q. This is a heuristic choice based on experimental experience.</p><p>. U: We conducted a simple 'two-body' variant of our scenario by implementing our algorithm on two nodes to study the variation in their interaction for different values of v. For these experiments we fixed the values of K,,,,,, Kdegree and q as explained above. We found that for small values of U the system oscillates. We picked the smallest value of v that does not lead to oscillations. This value corresponds roughly to the critically dampedcase for our system. In our experiments, we used U = 0.25. In the following two sections, we analyze the coverage achievable by uniform random and symmetrically tiled network configurations that satisfy the constraint of K-degree. These will serve as reference points to evaluate the performance of OUT algorithm.</p></div>

The probability that a randomly chosen node will have a degree of at least K is the probability that there will be at least K nodes in the area rrR: around it.</p><p>As the density of deployment increases, the probability that each node will have a degree of at least K , increases but the per-node coverage of the network decreases.

A striking feature of these configurations is that the line; connecting neighboring nodes fo&amp; regular polygons that tile the plane. For instance, in a network with K = 3 the angle between twn neighbors of a node is = 120' and therefore configuration represents a hexagonal tiling. However, such configurations ye only. possible-for K = 0,' 1,2,3,4 and 6:For instance, if K =.5, then to form a symmetrically tiled configuration, the corresponding regular polygon should have an interior angle of Given a symmetrically tiled configuration, we can compute the ' p r node coverage as a function of ~R , and R,. If R, ,&gt; 2R,, Cooerage = 1 because there will be no overlap between the nodes. For the.case when R, &lt; 2R, and K = 1, can derive similar exnressions-for the other values of K.</p><p>= 72" which is not possible.  using the Player/Stagel software platform which simulates the behavior of real sensors and actuators with a high degree of fidelity [13]. Each of the nodes in our simulations is capable of omni-directional motion and sensing (using a.laser range finder). Further, each node has a retro-reflective beacon so that it can be distinguished from the obstacles in the environment.</p><p>In most of our simulations we used a 2-d obstacle-less environment.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the initial and final network configuration for a typical deployment. The circles in the figure represent the coverage areas of individual nodes. The nodes start in a compact grid like configuration at the center of the environment and spread out to cover a large portion of the environment. In the particular instance shown, the sensing range of the nodes is equal to their communication range.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> shows the variation of the coverage and average degree of the network with time for different values of K.</p><p>The coverage (average degree) increases (decreases) rapidly in the first 1-2 minutes and then saturates to a stable value within 4-5 minutes. This is because, initially all the nodes have more than K neighbors and so they spread out uninhibitedly to improve the coverage until the degreee constraints activate and restrict'their motion. Further, since these constraints activate at different stages for different values of K , the coverage (average degree) graphs for the different values of K, start off. identically but branch off at different points and settle at different values of final coverage (degree).</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">.</ref>8 compare the performance of our algorithm in terms of the coverage and average'node degree with the uniform random and symmetrically tiled network configurations for three different regimes -R, &gt; ZR,, R, = 2R, and R, &lt; 2R,. Clearly, the configurations we obtain outperform the random network. Note that while computing the coverage of the symmetrically tiled configurations we assume that the size of the network is infinite. The values thus-obtained are in reality an upper bound on the coverage that can be achieved with finite networks because in the latter case, we will have to take into accnunt the edge effects.</p><p>Our third petfnfiance metric (as discussed ,in section III) is the percentage of the nodes in the network that have a minimum degree of K. This we found was at least 95% in all the network configurations resulting form our deployment algorithm. This is also the case-with .the random networks. Recall that while finding the density of deployment for the random network we explicitly imposd~the constraint that each node should have at least K neighbors with a probability of at least 0.95. In the symmetrically tiled configurations however this probability is 1 since all the nodes have exactly THE SYMMETRICALLY TILED NETWORK CONFTGURATIONS FOR Rs &lt; % &lt; 2Rs K neighbors.</p><p>An appealing and unexpected result is that there is no significant change in the per-node coverage obtained when the size of the network N was varied from 49 to 81 (Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). One would expect that for smaller values of N the edge effects will be more significant and therefore as N increases the per-node coverage will increase. We speculate that either the edge effects do not vary significantly with the network size or a 49 node network is large enough to make edge effects negligible. In future, work we plan to fully characterize this relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a deployment algorithm for mobile sensor networks that is designed to maximize the collective K sensor coverage while simultaneously constraining the degree Fin (I of the network nodes. The pair-wise interaction between nodes is governed by two kinds of virtual forcesone causes the nodes to repel each other to improve their coverage and the other is an attractive force that prevents the nodes from losing connectivity. By using a combination of these two forces, every node tries to maximize its coverage while maintaining the required number of neighbors.</p><p>We have tested the algorithm extensively in simulation. Starting with configurations in which each node has a degree greater than the required degree K, the algorithm results in networks in which more than 95% of the nodes have a degree of at least K . Our analysis of uniform random and symmetrically tiled networks proves that the algorithm results in reasonably good coverage. We are working towards validating these results through experiments on real robots.</p><p>Possible criticisms of the algorithm are the strong assumptions it makes on the capabilities of the nodesin particular the ability of each node to measure the exact range and bearing </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>-'</head><label></label><figDesc>We use the following three-metrics.to evaluate the perfor-. . deployment algorithm should:</figDesc></figure>
