<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The modeling and compensation for friction effects has been a topic of considerable mainstream interest in motion control research. This interest is spawned from the fact that modeling nonlinear friction effects is a theoretically challenging problem, and compensating for the effects of friction in a controller has practical ramifications. If the friction effects in a system can be accurately modeled, there is an improved potential to design controllers that can cancel the effects (e.g., model-based controllers); whereas, excessive steady-state tracking errors, oscillations, and limit cycles can result from controllers that do not accurately compensate for friction. Friction is exaggerated at low velocities, which are present in high-precision and high-performance motion control systems; unfortunately, a general model for friction which describes the effects at low velocity has not been universally accepted. Many models of friction have been proposed to deal with the various regimes of friction, each with their own merits and limitations. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> for a survey of friction modeling and control results. Given the difficulty in accurately modeling and compensating for friction effects, researchers have proposed a variety of (typically offline) friction estimation schemes with the objective of identifying the friction effects. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, an offline maximum likelihood, frequency-based approach (differential binary excitation) is proposed to estimate Coulomb friction effects. Another frequency-based offline friction identification approach was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Specifically, the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> uses a kind of frequency-domain linear regression model derived from Fourier analysis of the periodic steady-state oscillations of the system. The approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> requires a periodic excitation input with sufficiently large amplitude and/or frequency content. A new offline friction identification tool is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> where the static-friction models are not required to be linear parameterizable. However the offline optimization result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is limited to single degree-of-freedom systems where the initial and final velocities are equal. Another frequency domain identification strategy developed to identify dynamic model parameters for presliding behavior is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Additional identification methods include least-squares <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Kalman filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to friction identification schemes, researchers have developed adaptive, robust, and learning controllers to achieve a control objective while accommodating for the friction effects, but not necessarily identifying friction. For example, given a desired trajectory that is periodic and not constant over some interval of time, the development in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> provides a learning control approach to damp out periodic steady-state oscillations due to friction. As stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a periodic signal is applied to the system and when the system reaches a steady-state oscillation, the learning update law is applied. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a discontinuous linearizing controller was proposed along with an adaptive estimator to achieve an exponentially stable tracking result that estimates the unknown Coulomb friction coefficient. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> describes a technical error in the result presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that invalidates the result. Additional development is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> that modifies the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to achieve asymptotic Coulomb friction coefficient estimation provided a persistence of excitation condition is satisfied. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Tomei proposed a robust adaptive controller where only instantaneous friction is taken into account (dynamic friction effects are not included).</p><p>Motivated by the desire to include dynamic friction models in the control design, numerous researchers have embraced the LuGre friction model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. For example, the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> was extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to include the LuGre friction model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, resulting in an asymptotic tracking result for square integrable disturbances. Robust adaptive controllers were also proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to account for the LuGre model. Canudas et al. investigated the development of observer-based approaches for the LuGre model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Canudas and Lichinsky proposed an adaptive friction compensation method, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Canudas and Kelly proposed a passivity-based friction compensation term to achieve global asymptotic tracking using the LuGre model. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Barabanov and Ortega developed necessary and sufficient conditions for the passivity of the LuGre model. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, three observer-based control schemes were proposed assuming exact model knowledge of the system dynamics. The results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> were later extended to include two adaptive observers to account for selected uncertainty in the model. The observer-based design in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> was further extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Specifically, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a partial-state feedback exact model knowledge controller was developed to achieve global exponential link position tracking of a robot manipulator. Two adaptive, partial-state feedback global asymptotic controllers were also proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that compensate for selected uncertainty in the system model. In addition, a new adaptive control technique was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to compensate for the nonlinear parameterizable Stribeck effect, where the average square integral of the position tracking errors were forced to an arbitrarily small value.</p><p>In this paper and in the preliminary results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a tracking controller is developed for a general Euler-Lagrange system that contains a new continuously differentiable friction model with uncertain nonlinear parameterizable terms. Friction models are often based on the as-sumption that the friction coefficient is constant with sliding speed and have a singularity at the onset of slip. Such models typically include a signum function of the velocity to assign the direction of friction force (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>), and many other models are only piecewise continuous (e.g., the LuGre model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we proposed a new friction model that captures a number of essential aspects of friction without involving discontinuous or piecewise continuous functions. The simple continuously differentiable model represents a foundation that captures the major effects reported and discussed in friction modeling and experimentation and the model is generic enough that other subtleties such as frictional anisotropy with sliding direction can be addressed by mathematically distorting this model without compromising the continuous differentiability. Based on the fact that the model is continuously differentiable, a new integral feedback compensation term originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> is exploited to enable a semi-global tracking result while identifying the friction on-line, assuming exact model knowledge of the remaining dynamics. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to conclude the tracking and friction identification results. Experimental results show two orders of magnitude improvement in tracking control over a proportional derivative (PD) controller, and a one order of magnitude improvement over the model-based controller. Experimental results are also used to illustrate that the experimentally identified friction can be approximated by the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>

DYNAMIC MODEL AND PROPERTIES</head><p>The class of nonlinear dynamic systems considered in this paper are assumed to be modeled by the following general Euler-Lagrange formulation:</p><p>M(q) q + V m (q; _ q) _ q + G(q) + f( _ q) = (t):</p><p>(1)</p><p>In (1), M(q) 2 n2n denotes the inertia matrix, V m (q; _ q) 2 n2n denotes the centripetal-Coriolis matrix, G(q) 2 n denotes the gravity vector, f( _ q) 2 n denotes a friction vector, (t) 2 n represents the torque input control vector, and q(t), _ q(t), q(t) 2 n denote the link position, velocity, and acceleration vectors, respectively.

The friction model in (2) has the following properties: 1) it is symmetric about the origin, 2) it has a static coefficient of friction, 3) it exhibits the Stribeck effect where the friction coefficient decreases from the static coefficient of friction with increasing slip velocity near the origin, 4) it includes a viscous dissipation term, and 5) it has a Coulombic friction coefficient in the absence of viscous dissipation. To a good approximation, the static friction coefficient is given by 1 + 4 , and the Stribeck effect is captured by tanh(2 _ q) 0 tanh(3 _ q). The Coulombic friction coefficient is given by 4 tanh( 5 _ q), and the viscous dissipation is given by 6 _ q.

The filtered tracking error r(t) is not measurable since the expression in (6) depends on q(t). After premultiplying (6) by M(q), the following expression can be obtained: M(q)r = M(q) q d + V m (q; _ q) _ q + G(q) + f( _ q) 0 (t) +M (q) 1 _ e 1 + M(q) 2 e 2 (7)   where ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), (4), and (5) were utilized.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head><p>Experiment 1 illustrates an approximate factor of 60 improvement in the RMS tracking error over a PD controller, and a factor of approximately 4 over a typical exact model knowledge controller with  static and viscous friction feedforward terms (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>); Experiment 2 illustrates an approximate factor of 98 improvement in the RMS tracking error over the PD controller, and a factor of approximately 6 over the exact model knowledge controller. In Tables I and II, the RMS error from the proposed controller is approximately two orders of magnitude better than the PD controller and approximately one order of magnitude better than the model-based controller. This performance improvement was obtained while using similar or lower input torque.</p><p>The performance improvement is based on the fact that the proposed controller contains a feedforward term that identifies the friction as a general time-varying disturbance. To develop the friction identification term, the friction model is required to be continuously differentiable. Experiments 1-4 illustrate the identified friction torque. Specifically in Experiment 4, the parameters of the nonlinear parameterizable continuously differentiable friction model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> were varied to  match the experimentally obtained friction torque. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows that the proposed friction model in (2) approximates the experimental friction torque. However, since friction is anisotropic in nature, the magnitude of friction in experimental data is not symmetrical about the horizontal axis whereas the friction model in (2) approximates it as symmetric. Hence, future work can focus on mathematically distorting the model proposed in (2) by addition of more terms to make it asymmetric or making the unknown coefficients time-varying in order to capture more friction effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, semi-global asymptotic tracking is proven in the presence of a proposed continuously differentiable friction model that contains uncertain nonlinear parameterizable terms. To achieve the tracking result, an integral feedback compensation term is used to identify the system friction effects. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to conclude the tracking and friction identification results. Experimental results show two orders of magnitude improvement in tracking control over a proportional derivative (PD) controller, and a one order of magnitude improvement over the model-based controller. Experimental results are also used to illustrate that the experimentally identified friction can be approximated by the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>On the Stabilization of Linear Systems</head><p>Under Assigned I/O Quantization</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bruno Picasso and Antonio Bicchi</head><p>Abstract-This paper is concerned with the stabilization of discrete-time linear systems with quantization of the input and output spaces, i.e., when available values of inputs and outputs are discrete. Unlike most of the existing literature, we assume that how the input and output spaces are quantized is a datum of the problem, rather than a degree of freedom in design. Our focus is hence on the existence and synthesis of symbolic feedback controllers, mapping output words into the input alphabet, to steer a quantized I/O system to within small invariant neighborhoods of the equilibrium starting from large attraction basins. We provide a detailed analysis of the practical stabilizability of systems in terms of the size of hypercubes bounding the initial conditions, the state transient, and the steady-state evolution. We also provide an explicit construction of a practically stabilizing controller for the quantized I/O case. Index Terms-Controlled invariance, dynamic output feedback, practical stability, quantized systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Quantization is a peculiar characteristic of many systems, which can be caused by analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, binary or digital sensors and actuators, etc. In other cases, it is necessary to introduce quantization of signals in order to reduce the information complexity of some sensors (such as, e.g., video cameras) by encoding it in a proper symbolic alphabet. Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, quantized control systems have been attracting increasing attention of the control community. Most recently, interest on quantization has been stimulated by the growing number of applications involving "networked" control systems, i.e., systems interconnected through communication channels of limited capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.
