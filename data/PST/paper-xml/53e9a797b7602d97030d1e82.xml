<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. IINTRODUCTION</head><p>For typical robotic tasks that require interaction with the environment, contact forces must properly be handled by the robot controller <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. In such cases, a pure motion controller usually gives poor performance and can even cause instability.</p><p>If force sensor information is not available for control purposes, one can assign a suitable dynamic behavior between position and force variables at the contact (e.g., impedance control) [2], [3]. On the other hand, several schemes can be devised which attempt to control both end-effector position and contact force by embedding force measurements in the controller. Hybrid control is perhaps the most widely adopted strategy to forcdposition control of robot manipulators [4]- <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. The basic idea is the possibility to choose whether to control position or force along each task space direction through the use of proper selection matrices. Stability of hybrid control was addressed in [8]. The problem of forcdposition control with force sensory feedback was also treated in [91, [lo] for the general case of constrained motion tasks.</p><p>A conceptually different approach to forcdposition control of robot manipulators is the parallel control strategy [ 113. As opposed to the hybrid control strategy, both force and position variables are used along the same task space direction without any selection mechanism.</p><p>The effectiveness of the scheme is ensured by the dominance of the force control loop over the position control loop along the constrained task directions where interaction occurs. This makes the scheme suitable to manage contacts with unstructured environment and unplanned collisions, which are known to represent a drawback for hybrid controllers. Extensive description of the parallel approach and performance analysis of a control scheme with full dynamic compensation in the case of contact with an elastically compliant frictionless surface can be found in [12], <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p><p>In view of real-time implementation, a new parallel control scheme was recently proposed which is based on simple position PD control+ gravity compensation + desired force feedforward + force PI control [14]. A preliminary analysis, inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, showed asymptotic stability of the system around an equilibrium state. In detail, for given force and position set points, the force error is driven to zero at the expense of a position error at steady state. The proof in [ 141, however, leads to restrictive conditions on the feedback gains.</p><p>This work presents an improved proof of local asymptotic stability based on the Lyapunov direct method with use of LaSalle invariant set theorem [16]. A different Lyapunov function is chosen which results in relaxed conditions on the feedback gains; in particular, the position proportional gain does not directly affect stability of the contact.</p><p>The Lyapunov function is further modified to prove local exponential stability of the scheme yielding a new set of conditions to be satisfied for the feedback gains.</p><p>The proposed control scheme is tested in simulation on the industrial robot COMAU SMART 6.10R only the first three joints are considered. The numerical case study confirms the results anticipated in theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MODFLING</head><p>The class of robot manipulators considered in this work is that of open kinematic chains of rigid links connected by actuated joints. If the manipulator interacts with the environment, it is convenient to describe its dynamics in an m-dimensional operational space [5] that is the space where manipulation tasks are naturally specified. The equations of motion can be written in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">B(z)Z + C(z, 2)i + g(z) = U -f (1)</formula><p>where z is the (m x 1) vector of operational variables (usually endeffector location), B is the (m x m) symmetric and positive definite inertia matrix, Ci is the (m x 1) vector of Coriolis and centrifugal generalized forces, g is the (m x 1) vector of gravitational generalized forces, U is the (m x 1) vector of driving generalized forces, and f is the (m x 1) vector of contact generalizes forces exerted by the manipulator on the environment; all operational space quantities are expressed in a common reference frame.</p><p>Notice that the model (1) describes an ideal robot system where the effects of joint friction, backlash and elasticity, actuator dynamics, etc. are neglected. This is a common assumption which is reasonable in a suitable operational range.</p><p>The ( n x 1) vector T of joint actuating generalized forces is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r = JTu, (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where J is the (m x n ) manipulator Jacobian matrix. 0018-9286/94$04.00 0 1994 IEEE When m is equal to the number of joints n and the manipulator moves in a singularity-free region of the workspace, the vector of operational variables constitutes a set of Lagrangian generalized coordinates and B assumes the meaning of a true inertia matrix.</p><p>Instead, in the case of kinematically redundant manipulators (m &lt; n), B is only a pseudo inertia matrix [SI.</p><p>For the purpose of the present work, the attention is restricted to the case of nonredundant, nonsingular manipulators with m = n = 3, i.e., only translational motion and force components are considered. Then, z denotes the end-effector position.</p><p>Accurate modeling of the contact between the manipulator and the environment is usually difficult to obtain in analytic form, due to complexity of the physical phenomena involved during the interaction. It is then reasonable to resort to a simple but significant model, relying on the robustness of the control system to absorb the effects of inaccurate modeling. Following these guidelines, the case of an environment constituted by a rigid, frictionless and elastically compliant plane is analyzed. The choice of a planar surface is motivated by noticing that it is locally a good approximation to surfaces of regular curvature. The rigidity of the contact plane allows the neglect of the effects of local deformation at the contact. The total elasticity, due to end-effector force sensor and environment, is accounted through the compliance of the plane. Friction effects are neglected within the operational range of interest.</p><p>With the above assumptions, the model of the contact force considered takes on the simple form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f = K ( z -zo),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where z is the position of the contact point, 20 is a point of the plane at rest, and K is the (3 x 3) constant symmetric stiffness matrix [17] that establishes a linear mapping between (z -20) and f; notice that (3) holds only when the manipulator is in contact with the environment and all quantities are expressed in the common reference frame. According to [ 141, the matrix K can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">K = k nnT (4)</formula><p>where k &gt; 0 is the stiffness coefficient acting along the unit vector n orthogonal to the contact plane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. FORCEPOSITION RF~GULATION</head><p>A typical task for a robot manipulator in contact with the environment can be prescribed in terms of a position set point Z d and a force set point f d . It can be recognized that, in general, simultaneous achievement of both set points is not guaranteed.</p><p>A viable strategy is to adopt the parallel control approach [ll];</p><p>this is especially effective in the case of inaccurate contact modeling.</p><p>The key feature is to have a force control loop working in parallel to a position control loop along each task space direction. The logical conflict between the two loops is managed by imposing dominance of the force control action over the position one. The potential offered by this technique compared to conventional controllers also using force feedback sensory information is extensively discussed in [12], <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p><p>A force/position parallel controller for the system (1) was proposed in [14], based on position P D control + gravity compensation + desired force feedforward + force PI control, i.e., where , n is unknown, the null vector can be assigned to f d that is anyhow in the range space of any matrix K . Thus, in the remainder, it is assumed that f d E R(K).</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A z = z d -z is the position error, Af = f d -f is</formula><p>Analogously, it can be recognized that null position errors can be obtained only on the contact plane, while the component of z along n has to accommodate the force requirement specified by f d ; thus, Z d can be freely reached only in N ( K ) , i.e., dong the unconstrained directions of the operational space. As a further assumption, it is supposed that the contact between the manipulator and the environment is not lost after the impact.</p><p>As demonstrated in [14], an equilibrium ( 2 , ) fw} for the system (1) under the control ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 2-= p n T ( f d + k z o ) + ( I -nnT)zd f, = k nnT(zoc -2 0 ) = f d . (7)</formula><p>This is consistent with the above considerations about specification of position and force set points. An example of construction of the equilibrium point in a two-dimensional case is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>If the desired force set point f d is not aligned with n, an equilibrium trajectory rather than an equilibrium point is obtained. The expected effect is a drift of the end-effector along the unconstrained directions of the operational space.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CASE STUDY</head><p>The proposed force/position controller was tested in a case study on the six-joint industrial robot COMAU SMART 6.10R. This is an elbow manipulator geometry with zero shoulder offsets and spherical wrist; only the first three joints were considered. The complete numerical data for the robot parameters can be found in  In the following, the numerical results of two simulation runs with a sampling time of 2 [ms] are presented.</p><p>In the first run, it is k = lo5 [Nm-'1. For the purpose of comparison, both the full forcdposition controller and the pure position controller (kF = 0, kI = 0 ) were used. It can be seen that the equilibrium position zm (= zo in this case) is reached (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>) and the contact force is null at steady state (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), so as desired. Notice also that, without force feedback, finite steady-state errors occur both for position and force. In the second run, the robustness of the proposed controller was tested by changing the stiffness coefficient into k = lo6 [Nm-'] but leaving the same feedback gains as above. The results of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> demonstrate that satisfactory performance is obtained even when tuning of the force feedback gains was done by underestimating the actual stiffness of the environment.</p><p>VI. CONCLUSION Forcdposition regulation of robot manipulators in contact with an elastically compliant surface was analyzed in this work. The controller consists of a PD action on the position loop, a PI action on the force loop, together with gravity compensation and desired contact force feedforward.</p><p>Both local asymptotic stability and exponential stability were proven via the Lyapunov method, thanks to the introduction of offdiagonal terms in the Lyapunov functions. In particular, those terms feature positive constants that serve as additional degrees of freedom to satisfy conditions on the feedback gains but remarkably are not used by the control law.</p><p>A case study was developed for an industrial elbow manipulator, whose tip experiences an unexpected impact with the environment on the way toward the target position. The numerical results of two sets of simulations confirmed the theoretical derivation. Exponential stability was verified and robustness of the scheme to imprecise estimate of contact stiffness was successfully tested.</p><p>Current work is devoted to investigate the stability of the scheme in the case of imperfect compensation of the gravity term and possibly resort to an adaptation mechanism on the system state.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

The general problem of robust stabilization can be formulated as follows: given a model of the plant with uncertain parameters, find a compensator which stabilizes the plant regardless of the values of uncertain parameters. In the most recent works on robust stabilization, emphasis has been placed on the analysis part [ 11. On the other hand, very little has been done concerning the synthesis of robust controllers. Few results are known for structured (parametric) uncertainties which give not only necessary and sufficient conditions for the controller to exist, but also particular solutions parameterized in terms of arbitrary holomorphic functions <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Some of such problems have been solved using techniques from complex analysis, particularly the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation procedure [2]-[4] which is also known to be useful in network theory (circuit modeling and passive circuits synthesis <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. The so-called Nevanlinna recursion provides an easy constructive algorithm yielding the unique solution in the "degenerate case" and a parameterization of all solutions in the "nondegenerate case" Later, Khargonekar and Tannenbaum [4] described a general methodology for using the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation in several control pfoblems, and as an _example, they considered the case of P ( s ) = P ( s ) / ( s --y ) , whereP(s) isafixedrealrationalfunctionand y is an uncertain parameter, y E [a0 -a, a0 +PI. In the recent paper [SI this problem has been extended to several uncertain poles which cannot move freely and must lie on a specified curve determined by exactly one uncertain coefficient in the plant's denominator.</p><p>In our work we consider the case of one uncertain parameter in the plant transfe: function which has the following stru_cture</p></div>
