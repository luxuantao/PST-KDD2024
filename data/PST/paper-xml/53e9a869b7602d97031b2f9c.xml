<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this work we present a novel concept of a quadrotor UAV with tilting propellers. Standard quadrotors are limited in their mobility because of their intrinsic underac tuation (only 4 independent control inputs vs. their 6-dof pose in space). The quadrotor prototype discussed in this paper, on the other hand, has the ability to also control the orientation of its 4 propellers, thus making it possible to overcome the aforementioned underactuation and behave as a fully-actuated flying vehicle. We first illustrate the hardware/software specifi cations of our recently developed prototype, and then report the experimental results of some preliminary, but promising, flight tests which show the capabilities of this new UAV concept.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Common UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are under actuated mechanical systems, i.e., possessing less control inputs than available degrees of freedom (dofs). This is, for instance, the case of helicopters and quadrotor UAVs [1], <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For these latter platforms, only the Cartesian position and yaw angle of their body frame w.r.t. an inertial frame can be independently controlled (4 dofs), while the behavior of the remaining roll and pitch angles (2 dofs) is completely determined by the trajectory chosen for the former 4 dofs.</p><p>Presence of such an underactuation does not only limit the flying ability of quadrotors in free or cluttered space, but it also degrades the possibility of interacting with the en vironment by exerting desired forces in arbitrary directions. As quadrotor UAVs are being more and more exploited as autonomous flying service robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, it is important to explore different actuation strategies that can overcome the aforementioned underactuation problem and allow for full motion/force control in all directions in space.</p><p>Motivated by these considerations, several possibilities have been proposed in the past literature spanning different concepts: ducted-fan designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, tilt-wing mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, or tilt-rotor actuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Along similar lines, previous works [10], <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> also discussed a novel concept for a quadrotor UAV with actuated tilting propellers, i.e., with propellers able to rotate around the axes connecting them to the main body frame. This design grants a total of 8 control inputs (4 + 4 propeller spinning/tilting velocities), and, as formally shown in <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>, makes it possible to obtain complete controllability over the main body 6-dof configuration in IR3 x SO(3), thus rendering the quadrotor UAV a fully actuated flying vehicle.</p><p>M. Ryll and P. Robuffo Giordano are with the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, SpemannstraBe 38, 72076 TUbingen, Germany {markus.ryll,prg}@tuebingen.mpg.de. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. II reviews the modeling assumptions and control design pro posed in [10] and upon which this work is based. Section III describes our prototype from the hardware and software points of view and discusses the main 'real-world' discrep ancies w.r.t. the modeling assumptions taken in [10]. Finally, Sect. IV presents some experimental results for hovering and trajectory tracking regimes, and Sect. V concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. REV IEW OF THE DYNAMIC MODELING AND CONTROL DES IGN</head><p>For the reader's convenience, in this Section we will briefly sununarize the modeling assumptions and control ap proach proposed in [10] for a quadrotor with tilting propellers (from now on denoted as "omnicopter"). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a picture of the prototype, while Figs. 3-2 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> present CAD and schematic views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Dynamic model</head><p>The omnicopter consists of 5 rigid bodies in relative mo tion among themselves: the main body B and the 4 propeller groups Pi. The propeller groups Pi host the propeller and its associated (spinning) motor as well as the additional motor responsible for the tilting actuation mechanism, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Let F w : {O w ; X w , Y w , Z w } be a world    As for the dynamics of the main body B, one obtains (2)   i =l with I B E JR3x3 being the (constant) symmetric and positive definite Inertia matrix of B. Here, the torques T B E JR3 exerted on B are generated by the moments of the four propeller forces T Pi E JR3 acting at 0 Pi' that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">4 TB = IBWB + WB X IBwB + L B RpiTp"</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">4 TB = L( B OPi x B RpiTpJ. i =l (3)</formula><p>Again, we model the propeller forces as acting along the Z Pi axes so that Tp, = [0 0 Ti] T with Ti = kjWilwil, kj &gt; 0, and neglect additional aerodynamic effects.</p><p>Finally, concerning the translational dynamics, assuming that the barycenter of each propeller group Pi coincides with 0 Pi (which holds with a good approximation for the prototype described in Sect. III-A), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">4 + w RB L B Rp,Tpi i =l (4)</formula><p>where m is the total mass of the quadrotor and propeller bodies and 9 the scalar gravity constant.</p><p>To conclude, we note that this model has 8 independent inputs: the 4 motor torques actuating the tilting axes X Pi' i.e., T (Xi = T� i X Pi E JR, and the 4 motor torques actuating the spinning axes Z Pi' i.e., TWi = T� Z Pi E JR, with i = l. . .4. Owing to its actuation system, the omnicopter can exactly track a desired and arbitrary trajectory (Pd(t), Rd(t)) E IR3 x 50(3) for the body position P and orientation w RB taken as output functions, see <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. We then review here the proposed tracking control scheme. First, we simplify the previous dynamical model by assuming that the motors actuating the spinning and tilting axes can realize given desired speeds Wi and WCXi = ai with negligible transients thanks to high-gain low-level loops. This way, wcx , and Wi can be considered as 'velocity' inputs in place of the (actual) motor torques. Second, we neglect the gyroscopic effects due to the relative motion among the omnicopter parts, and treat them as disturbances to be rejected by the trajectory controller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symbols Definitions</head><p>We start defining a  A direct inversion of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) by means of a static feedback linearization does not yield a satisfactory solution for the aforementioned 6-dof tracking problem. This is due to the lack of a direct coupling between the output accelerations (jj, WB) and the tilting inputs Wcx. However, as explained in [10], one can resort to a dynamic feedback linearization scheme for obtaining the sought result. In fact, by differen tiating (5) w.r.t. time, one obtains where (i) the new input w is the dynamic extension of the former (and actual) input w, and (ii) input Wcx explicitly appears in the output dynamics. Furthermore, it is possible to prove that the 6 x 8 coupling matrix A( a, w) has always rank PA = rank(A) = 6 provided that Wi i= 0, i = 1 ... 4, i.e., that the propeller spinning never stops, see <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= [CXl ... CX 4 V E IR 4 , Wcx = [WCX , ••• wcx 4 ] T E IR</formula><p>Therefore, assuming this rank condition holds, system (7) can be inverted as   with kH &gt; 0 being a suitable gain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Discussion</head><p>In view of the next developments, we discuss some remarks about the 'implementability' of the proposed con troller <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. The controller needs measurement of the position p, linear velocity jJ and linear acceleration p, of the orientation w RB, angular velocity W B and angular acceleration W B, and of the tilting angles 0: and propeller spinning velocities w. As it will be explained in Sect. III B, measurement of the linear position/velocity ( p, jJ) and of the orientation w RB will be obtained by means of an external visual tracking system, while measurements of the angular velocity W B will be provided by the gyroscopes onboard our prototype. Similarly, direct measurements of 0: and w will be possible from the low-level motor controllers actuating the spinning and tilting axes.</p><p>As for the remaining acceleration measurements (p, W B)' instead of resorting to numerical differentiation of the cor responding (noisy) velocity quantities, we exploit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and evaluate (p, W B) as a function of measured quantities and applied commands. This, of course, requires the ad ditional knowledge of the various model parameters (e.g., mass, inertia, internal geometry), and unavoidably neglects all those effects not captured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The next Sections will however confirm the reasonability of these assumptions for our prototype and the robustness of the proposed controller in coping with these non-idealities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOTYPE AND SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Prototype</head><p>As first prototype developed by our group, we opted for a very low cost solution with all parts available off-the-shelf. The trajectory tracking controller of Sect. II-B is imple mented in Matlab/Simulink and, via the Real-Time Work shop toolbox, is then deployed and executed in real-time on an Intel Atom board (Quadm0747, from now on 'Q7-board' ) running the Linux UbuntulO.lO real-time environment. The Q7-board is mounted below the battery and is equipped with a wireless USD-dongle for communication. As only one RS-232 port (TTL level) is available on the Q7-board, the second microcontroller board is connected via one USB port and USBToSerial converter. The Q7-board is powered by a battery, with the necessary voltage conversion and stabilization performed by a power-supply board containing a 12V DC/DC power converter.</p><p>The nominal mass of the full omnicopter is 1.32 Kg. From a high detail CAD model of the body and propeller groups o o ��--;----,;'c-, ----:;�";___;___ ___!" o o ��- <ref type="figure">;</ref><ref type="figure">�";</ref> In order to obtain accurate values of k f and km for our motor-propeller combination, we made use of a testbed equipped with a 6-dof torque/force sensor (Nano17-E, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7</ref>) for identifying the mappings between the propeller spinning velocity and the generated thrust Ti and torque TDi .</p><p>This resulted in the following polynomial models (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6</ref>): Ti = 4.94e-18IwiI 3 + 9.62e-1 3 IwiI2 + 1.56e-5 1w il (13)   and where W i = wilwil as explained before. Controller (8-12) was then implemented by directly exploiting the map pings (13-14) for obtaining (Ti' TDJ, and by replacing fJ Ti</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I fJ TD ' 1 k f = �</formula><p>and km = � . ' both evaluated upon the uW, W i uW, W i measured Wi.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. System architecture</head><p>The Q7-board runs a GNU-Linux Ubuntu 10.10 real time OS and executes the Matlab-generated code. The controller runs at 500 Hz and takes as inputs: (i) the desired trajectory (Pd(t), Rd(t)) and needed derivatives (Pd(t), Pd(t), Pd(t)) and (Wd(t), Wd(t), Wd(t)), (ii) the current position/orientation of the omnicopter ( p, W RB) and its linear/angular velocity (p, W B), (iii) the spinning velocities of the propellers W i, (iv) the tilting angles ai. The position P and orientation w RB of the omnicopter are directly obtained from an external motion caption system 3 (MoCap) at 240 Hz. A marker tree consisting of five infra red markers is mounted on top of the omnicopter for this pur pose. Knowing P, the linear velocity P is then obtained via numerical differentiation, while the angular velocity W B is measured by the onboard IMU (3 ADXRS610 gyroscopes).</p><p>Due to performance reasons (bottleneck in serial com munication), the sending of the desired motor speeds and tilting angles, and the reading of the IMU-data, of the actual spinning velocities, and of tilting angles is split among two communication channels and two microcontrollers (called, from now on, 'p, C-Board' and 'IMU-Board' ). The desired motor spinning velocities wDesi are sent from the Q7-board to the p, C-Board via a serial connection at the frequency of 250 Hz and 8 bit resolution, and from the p, C-Board to the brushless controllers via I 2 C-bus at again 250 Hz (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">8</ref>). The brush less controllers implement a PID controller for regulating the spinning velocity. The desired tilting angles aDesi are sent from the Q7-board to the p, C Board via the same serial connection at a frequency of 55 Hz and 10 bit resolution, and from the p, C-Board to the servo motors via PW M (signal length 15 ms). We note that the trajectory tracking controller described in Sect lI B assumes availability of the tilting velocities W"'" see ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), while the current architecture only allows for sending desired angles commands aDesi' This is addressed by numerically integrating over time the controller cOlmnands, that is, by implementing aDesi = It: W"'i(T)dT.   {); D es, (in particular, the PWM modulation) unfortunately introduces a non-negligible roundtrip delay of about 18 ms form sent command to read values. We experimentally found this delay to significantly degrade the closed-loop perfor mance of the controller, and therefore propose in the next Sect. III-C a simple prediction scheme for mitigating its adverse effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Coping with the non-idealities of the servo motors</head><p>The i-th servo motor for the tilting angles can be approx imately modeled as a linear transfer function G( s) with, in series, a transport delay of T = 18 ms, that is, as the delayed linear system ();i(S) = G(s)e-T s {);desi (s). A model of the undelayed G( s) was experimentally obtained by measuring the step response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9</ref>) of the servo motors while having 300 (</p><note type="other">Cartesian Conlroller u{</note><formula xml:id="formula_5">)<label>15</label></formula><p>The performance degradation of the cartesian trajectory controller (8-12) can then be ascribed to two main effects, namely presence of the transport delay T and slow dynamic response of G est (s) to fast changing inputs. In order to miti gate these shortcomings, we resorted to the following simple strategy (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">10</ref>): instead of feeding back the measured (i.e., delayed) angles ();i to the cartesian controller (8-12), we replaced them with the (undelayed) desired angles {);des,. In parallel, we aimed at improving the servo motor performance (i.e., making G est (s) more responsive) via a Smith predictor scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. In fact, as well-known from classical control theory, the Smith predictor is an effective tool for coping with known delays affecting known stable linear systems. In our case, an additional outer PID controller C (s) plugged into the Smith predictor loop, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">10</ref>, allowed to improve the rising time of the servo controller.</p><p>Finally, since we found the measured angles {);i to be affected by significant noise, we filtered their readings with a 2nd order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 20Hz. The location of this cutoff frequency was experimentally determined by analyzing omine the power spectrum of the angles {);i recorded during a hovering flight of 40 s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section we will present results from three exper iments run with our prototype and aimed at validating our modeling and control approach. The first experiment is a hov ering task meant to show the performance of the controller in the simplest scenario, and also to highlight the importance of having included the null-space optimization term (12) in the control strategy. The other two experiments are intended to show the performance in tracking position/orientation trajectories which would be unfeasible for standard quadrotor UAVs: a circular trajectory with constant (horizontal) attitude and a rotation on the spot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Hovering on the spot</head><p>In the first experiment, we show the importance of having included the minimization of the cost function H ( w) in the -" :-0 --:C---::--:;----7;;-" --c� � � � " � �� ,, ---;; 0 .   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Circular trajectory</head><p>In this experiment we demonstrate the ability of the omnicopter to follow an arbitrary trajectory in space while keeping a desired orientation (constant in this case). As explained, this would be unfeasible for a standard quadrotor UAY. The chosen desired trajectory is a horizontal circle with diameter of 1 m and lying at a height of z = 1.05 m from ground, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">13</ref>. The quadrotor is commanded to travel along the path with a constant speed of 0.2 mls while keeping the main body parallel w. r.t. the ground. We set the gains in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and (10) to the same values as in Sect. IV-A.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">14</ref>(a) shows the desired (solid) and real (dashed) position of the omnicopter while following the trajectory (the two plots are almost coincident), while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">14(b</ref>) reports the orientation error eR (the desired orientation during the trajectory was set to Rd = 13)' The maximum position error max(lle p (t)ll) while following the path was approximately 4.2 cm, with avg(lle p (t)ll) ;::: :; 1.6 cm. The maximum orientation errors were 0.12 rad for roll, 0.08 rad for pitch and 0.18 rad for yaw. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15(a)-(b)</ref> show the behavior of the tilting angles ai, and of the motor spinning velocities Wi which kept close to wrest=450 rad/s as expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Rotation on spot</head><p>In the last experiment we demonstrate the tracking abil ities in following a given orientation profile Rd (t) while keeping the same position in space. Again, this maneuver is clearly unfeasible for a standard quadrotor UAY. The   involving a rotation on the spot still confirms the capabilities of the omnicopter and the robustness of the proposed control strategy in coping with all the non-idealities of real-world conditions. The interested reader can also appreciated the reported maneuvers in the video attached to this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONC LU SION S</head><p>In this paper, we have addressed the hardware/software design and control implementation for a recently-developed prototype of a novel quadrotor UAV with tilting propellers -the 'omnicopter'. Contrarily to standard quadrotors, the omnicopter design allows to actively rotate the 4 propellers about the axes connecting them to the main body. This makes it possible to obtain full controllability over the 6-dof body pose in space, thus overcoming the underactuation hin dering standard quadrotor UAVs. The reported experiments, although preliminary, have clearly shown good potential of the UAV in various experiments. After having obtained these promising results, confirming the validity of our design, our next step is to build an improved prototype with a better actuation system. This will allow, on one side, to gain a higher tracking accuracy, and, on the other side, to fully exploit the omnicopter 6-dof motion capabilities also in interaction tasks with the environment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: A picture of the prototype on a testing gimbal</figDesc><graphic coords="1,324.49,148.80,221.76,139.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
