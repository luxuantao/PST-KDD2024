<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Neuronal power attenuation or enhancement in specific frequency bands over the sensorimotor cortex, called Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) or Event-Related Synchronization (ERS), respectively, is a major phenomenon in brain activities involved in imaginary movement of body parts. However, it is known that the nature of motor imagery-related electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is non-stationary and highly variable over time and frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding a discriminative time-and frequency-dependent spatial filter, which we call 'non-homogeneous filter.' We adaptively select bases of spatial filters over time and frequency. By taking both temporal and spectral features of EEGs in finding a spatial filter into account it is beneficial to be able to consider non-stationarity of EEG signals. In order to consider changes of ERD/ERS patterns over the time-frequency domain, we devise a spectrally and temporally weighted classification method via statistical analysis. Our experimental results on the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a and BCI Competition II dataset IV clearly presented the effectiveness of the proposed method outperforming other competing methods in the literature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), which translates human intentions into commands to control an external device by analyzing and recognizing brain signals, allows users to communicate with their environment without using the brains normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Therefore, it has been of great interest to many research groups for patients that suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, locked-in syndrome, etc.</p><p>Among various methods of eliciting the specific regulation of brain signals, imagined body-part movement, called motor imagery, has been most widely used in an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI due to its naturalness and spontaneousness. In terms of neurophysiology, motor imagery accompanies attenuation (ERD: Event-Related Desynchronization) or enhancement (ERS: Event-Related Synchronization) of rhythmical synchrony over the sensorimotor cortex in the specific frequency bands of m-rhythm (8-13 Hz) and b-rhythm (14-30 Hz) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. However, it is also known that the motor imagery responsive frequency bands are highly variable for inter-and intra-subjects. Furthermore, due to the volume conduction effect in EEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> finding a classdiscriminative spatial filter that certainly improves classification performance has been considered as a challenging problem in the BCI community <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>While many previous methods showed satisfactory results in their experiments, they did not consider the non-stationary feature of human brain activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. That is, they found an optimal spatial filter from samples in the predefined time segment and applied it to all the sample points within the time segment homogeneously in classification. We call this type of spatial filter 'homogeneous' spatial filter. On the while, in this paper, we propose a novel method of finding a bank of spatial filters, called 'non-homogeneous' spatial filters, each of which is learned for a different segment in time.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a novel method of finding non-homogeneous spatial filters. Unlike other Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)-based methods that find optimal spatial filters and apply them homogeneously over all samples, the proposed method optimizes spatial filters for each of the time-frequency segments to reflect the non-stationary feature of human brain activity. Second, we devise a spectrally and temporally weighted classification method. A weight determined by sum of Fisher ratios which are the measure of the discrimination level of selected bases of each spatial filter based on a ratio of between-class variance and within-class variance is assigned for each time-frequency segment. From our experiment on a public dataset, it was proved that the proposed weighting scheme improved the classification accuracy.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review the previous work in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe a method for non-homogeneous spatial filters optimization and for the construction of a time-frequency weighted classifier. Experimental results and analysis are presented in Section 4, and concluding remarks are drawn in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>One of the most effective and widely used algorithms to find an optimal spatial filter is the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, which maximizes the variance of EEG signals of one class while minimizing the variance of EEG signals of the other class. Here, a class refers to a motor imagery task. However, as the CSP algorithm considers only spatially discriminative patterns while ignoring the spectral characteristics of EEG signals, the performance is dependent on the preceding spectral filtering, in which the frequency band is commonly predetermined and fixed manually <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Hereafter, we use the terms of spectral filter and frequency band interchangeably throughout the paper.</p><p>For optimization of the spectral filter, variants of CSP methods, namely, Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (CSSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Common Sparse Spectral Spatial Pattern (CSSSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Sub-Band Common Spatial Pattern (SBCSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> have been proposed. The FBCSP, which presented the best performance on the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a, extracts CSP features with a filter bank, which is composed of multiple nonoverlapping frequency bands with an equal bandwidth, to determine subject-specific optimal frequency bands. Later, adaptive FBCSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Discriminative Common Spatial Pattern (DCSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> were proposed extending the FBCSP for the construction of a subject-specific filter bank. Wang and Zheng proposed a Local Temporal Common Spatial Patten (LTCSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that takes into account local temporal relations among signals in the estimation of covariance matrices of the CSP algorithm. This overcomes the limitation of the CSP that neglects temporal information in EEG signals.</p><p>Some research groups have devoted their efforts for timefrequency analysis of EEG signals. In order to reflect the temporal variation of neuronal signals, Qin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Deng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> devised, respectively, their own time-frequency weighting schemes. Ince et al. proposed a method using adaptive time-frequency segmentation to select discriminative time-frequency features <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. More recently, other groups have tried classifying EEG signals with simultaneous analysis on the spacetime-frequency domain based on machine learning techniques such as principal component analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> or parallel factor analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>All these methods, however, assumed that the spatial filters of EEG signals were homogeneous during motor imagery by constructing spatial filters with fixed bases for whole time range of the signals. The bases can be most appropriate for whole time range of the signals, but it does not be guaranteed for segmented time range because of non-stationary features of the signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding non-homogeneous spatial filters over both the time and frequency domains. Unlike previous methods, it optimizes individual spatial filters to each decomposed time-frequency segment by selecting different sets of discriminative bases. By constructing spatial filters with an individual set of bases for each segmented time range, the non-stationary features of signals can be managed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Proposed method</head><p>In this section, we describe a novel method to learn timefrequency varying spatial filters, which we call 'non-homogeneous spatial filters.' The main idea of our method is to decompose a singletrial EEG into space-time-frequency components and to find classdiscriminative spatial filters, one for each pair of time and frequency components. The rationale for our approach is that brain activities are non-stationary in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and ERD/ERS patterns during motor imagery are not necessarily evoked in an identical or similar time segment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Therefore, we need to consider those characteristics in finding the optimal spatial filters.</p><p>The technical challenges of the proposed method are how to select discriminative bases of each filter and how to design classifiers based on the filters. Instead of constructing a homogeneous filter which has fixed bases for whole time range, the proposed method constructs non-homogenous filters which have different sets of bases for each segmented time range. The conventional CSP algorithm guarantees the fixed bases are discriminative for whole time range of signals, but does not guarantee it for segmented time range. The proposed method solves the problems by adopting the Fisher ratio which can determine the discrimination level of each basis. It selects discriminative bases of each filter based on a ratio of betweenclass variance and within-class variance. Also, the proposed method of Fisher ratio-based weighted classification manages the level of discrimination of each filter in the same framework.</p><p>A schematic diagram of the proposed method is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. We first decompose a multi-channel EEG into the tensor of space-time-frequency by applying filter bank-based spectral filtering, CSP-based spatial filtering, and time-domain segmentation in a row. Then, the proposed non-homogeneous spatial filter optimization is performed for each pair of time and frequency bands by means of a Fisher criterion. The features extracted from the spatially filtered signals are used to train classifiers. In the evaluation, the class label is determined based on a weighted sum of outputs from classifiers. We should note that the CSP algorithm and classifier training is based on the one-against-one approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Space-time-frequency representation</head><p>Motivated by Ang et al.'s work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we employ a filter bank, S ¼ fs 1 ,s 2 , . . . ,s B g, that bandpass-filters a single-trial EEG of the c-th class X c A R NÂT , where N and T denote, respectively, the number of channels and the number of sample points. Similar to the previous work, the predefined and fixed multiple frequency bands are used as follows: We then spatially transform the bandpass-filtered signal</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V b c ¼ h b X c<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">V c b Z b c ¼ W b V b c<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where W b A R NÂN denotes a spatial filter optimized from the b-th bandpass-filtered signals with the conventional CSP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The rows of W b denote stationary spatial filters. By simple manipulation, we can obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V b c ¼ ½W b À1 Z b c<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>), the columns of ½W b À1 are time-invariant modes and these are called common spatial patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Meanwhile, the columns of Z c b can be considered as the basis producing the measured single-trial EEG at the time-points.</p><p>When it is considered for the nature of the non-stationary feature of human brain activity, it is believed that classifying a single-trial EEG with the features extracted from long-time samples is unreasonable. Thus, we dissect the spatially filtered single-trial EEG into overlapping multiple segments in time and assume that the electrical activity is stationary in a short-time window, i.e., one time segment, but the activities of different windows may not be. We impose to overlap consecutive time segments, because it is unknown when the activity changes in time.</p><p>We then convert the single-trial EEG X c into the tensor of space-time-frequency Z c A R NÂKÂB , where N, K, and B denote, respectively, the number of channels, the number of time segments in a trial, and the number of frequency bands in a filter bank. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> illustrates an example of transforming a single-trial EEG to a space-time-frequency tensor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Non-homogeneous spatial filter optimization</head><p>Here, we propose a novel method of finding the discriminative spatial filters for each time-frequency segment individually by means of the Fisher ratio. We first compute the second-order statistics of the samples, which is a common approach of extracting features in the motor imagery-based BCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. The variance of each space-time-frequency segment, Y i,k,b c , is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Y i,k,b c ¼ V c ½Z i,k,b c ð<label>4Þ</label></formula><p>where c is a class label, V c ½Á denotes a variance of the samples, and i, k, and b denote, respectively, an index of EEG channel, time segment, and frequency band. The spatially filtered signal Z i,k,b c is obtained by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) with a full rank matrix W b , as explained above, deferring the selection of discriminative spatial filters. We compute the discriminative power of the features between two classes for each segment with the Fisher ratio as follows:  We exploit the Fisher criterion defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) for a metric that measures how strongly a feature is correlated with the corresponding class labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The features of a high Fisher ratio mean that they are class-discriminative, possibly improving classification performance. Therefore, it is natural to select the spatial filters of the high Fisher ratio in W b and use them for feature extraction. In this paper, we select a set of discriminative spatial filters for each time-frequency segment with the following rule: One may think of applying the CSP algorithm for each segment individually instead of applying it over all time-points and selecting discriminative spatial filters for each segment. But the assumption we used in our approach is that though evoked bases of common spatial patterns reflect the neurophysiological characteristics of changes in the human brain, the kinds of bases are coherent over time. Hence, our approach can be considered to select discriminative features from non-stationary brain activities, although we still do not know where the bases originate in the volumetric brain.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F i,k,b ¼ P c D c ðm c ½Y i,k,b Àm½Y i,k,b Þ 2 =ðCÀ1Þ P c V c ½Y i,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">S k,b ¼ [ i ðF i,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Feature extraction and classification</head><p>We compose a feature vector, following the common approach in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, with the logarithmic values of the normalized variances of the samples transformed by the selected spatial filters as follows: We use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are the most widely considered in BCI due to their simplicity. We apply them to each time-frequency segment individually. In order to overcome the problem of intra-subject variability of ERD/ERS patterns in a motor imagery task, we consider multiple frequency components and multiple time segments simultaneously in class label decision. We assign a weight to each time(k)-frequency(b) segment with the sum of Fisher scores of the selected non-homogeneous spatial filters oðk,bÞ ¼</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f c ¼ log Ŷ i,k,b c P M j ¼ 1 Ŷ j,k</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">P i A S k,b F i,k,b</formula><p>and decide the class label l of the singletrial EEG with the following rule</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">l ¼ 1 if X B b X K k oðk,bÞoðk,bÞZ0 À1 otherwise 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; :<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>where B is the number of frequency bands, K is the number of time segments, and oðk,bÞ A fþ1,À1g denotes the output class label from the classifier of the (k, b)-th segment. This strategy of deciding the class label can be considered as 'spectrally and temporally weighted classification' and it is one of the contributions of this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental results and analysis</head><p>In this section, we present feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the classification performance with other competing methods in the literature and analyzing the experimental results on a publicly available dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">EEG dataset and preprocessing</head><p>We investigate the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> that contains EEG signals recorded from 9 subjects performing 4 different motor imagery tasks: left-hand, right-hand, foot, and tongue. The dataset is comprised of two sessions conducted on different days. Each session includes 6 runs separated by short break. There are 12 trials for each of the 4 tasks in a run. Each run is further composed of 48 trials and one session consists of 288 trials totally. The EEG data were acquired using 22 electrodes and 3 EOG channels that were positioned according to the international 10-20 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The signals were sampled at 250 Hz and bandpass-filtered between 0.5 Hz and 100 Hz. An additional 50 Hz notch filter was enabled to suppress line noise. Refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> for the details of the dataset.</p><p>The selection of a time interval for the motor imagery classification is an important factor that has a great impact on the classification performance. In this paper, following Ang et al.'s work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we extract features from the signals of all electrodes except the electrooculograms (EOGs) between 0.5 s and 2.5 s after onset of the visual cue in the training step. As the evaluation is performed by using continuous classification output for each sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, the class label is evaluated on every 10-th sample by using a sliding window of length 2 s (called an 'outer-window') by overlapping 240 samples between two consecutive windows from onset of the visual cue. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> shows the time scheme of the experimental paradigm and the EEG signals used for training and test, respectively.</p><p>We employ a filter bank approach covering 4-40 Hz with 4 Hz bandwidth for each frequency band, B ¼9 frequency bands in total. As the number of channels is 22, we use 22 bases of CSP filters W b where bA f1,2, . . . ,Bg. Within the outer-window, we further segment the single-trial EEG in time with an 'inner-window' of size 100-, 200-, and 300-samples in order to construct a space-time-frequency tensor. Because consecutive inner-windows are 50% overlapping, we obtain 9, 4, and 2 time segments, i.e., K¼ 9, 4, 2, respectively, in an outerwindow.</p><p>We also investigate the BCI Competition II dataset IV<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> that contains EEG signals for self-paced left-and right-hand motor imagery tasks. It consists of 316 trials for training and 100 trials for test. The EEG data were acquired from a normal subject using 28 electrodes according to the international 10-20 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The EEG data were recorded at 1000 Hz with a band-pass filter between 0.05 and 200 Hz but they were downsampled at 100 Hz for comparison experiments with <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. For the data set, we also employ a filter bank approach covering 4-40 Hz with 4 Hz bandwidth for each frequency band. We segment the singletrial EEG in time by a window of size 6-samples with a third overlapping in order to construct the space-time-frequency tensor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Performance comparisons with other methods</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the performance of the proposed method with LDA and SVM classification models. We use a metric of Cohen's Kappa value that measures the agreement between two estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The LDA model shows higher performance than the SVM model but there was no significant difference (p ¼0.3990) in the statistical analysis, paired T-test.</p><p>We compare the performance of the proposed method to that of two other competing methods, Ang et al.'s Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Time Segmented FBCSP (TS-FBCSP) based on the LDA classification model with the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a. The FBCSP selects discriminative frequency bands from filter banks and constructs CSP filters for the frequency bands. The TS-FBCSP, the intermediate method between the FBCSP and the proposed method, is variation of the FBCSP applying our idea of dissecting the time domain into multiple segments and then optimizing homogeneous spatial filters for each time segment individually. Because the performance of the CSP is highly dependent on the number of basis pairs of CSP filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we perform spatial filters optimization using the values of 2, 3, and 4 for the methods. The main difference between the proposed method and FBCSP/TS-FBCSP is the way of finding optimal spatial filters; homogeneity and nonhomogeneity. Instead of constructing a filter which has fixed bases for whole time range, the proposed method constructs filters which have different sets of bases for each segmented time range based on Fisher ratio.</p><p>The goal of the BCI Competition IV with dataset II-a was evaluation of classification algorithms based on the session-tosession transfer rate using the session 1 and session 2 dataset for training and evaluation respectively. We use a metric of Cohen's Kappa value that measures the agreement between two estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. As stated, there are multiple class labels, one for each outer-window. The classification accuracies obtained from every outer-window used for the three competing methods are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>. The results were obtained with 2 pairs of bases in a CSP filter and LDA. The figure clearly shows that the maximum classification accuracies are obtained by the outer-windows positioned between 4 s and 5 s and there is a gradual decrease thereafter. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we also summarize the best performance of the three competing methods from the time course of the Kappa values in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>. The proposed method outperforms the competing methods. The highest mean accuracy of 0.60 represents the best performances for 5 subjects. The statistical analysis shows significant difference between the previous FBCSP and the proposed method with p ¼0.0167 for m¼2, p ¼0.0066 for m¼3, and p¼0.0032 for m ¼4 in paired T-test. For all the cases, the proposed method outperformed FBCSP in a 95% confidence level. In order to see how the size of inner-window affects the classification performance of the proposed method, we summarize the best performance of 100-, 200-, and 300-samples inner-window in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. The mean Kappa values are 0.60, 0.59, and 0.56, respectively. As the proposed method constructs non-homogeneous filters for each inner-window, the non-homogeneity of the proposed method is reduced when the size of inner-window becomes larger.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the performance comparison of the proposed method with those of the winners of the competition. The proposed method represents the best performance in 6 subjects, marked in boldface with the highest mean accuracy. For reference, we briefly describe their methods. The 1st winner of the competition applied the FBCSP and selected discriminative frequency bands by means of the mutual information between class labels and feature vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. They applied homogeneous spatial filters in feature extraction. The 2nd winner applied the CSP on broadband-filtered (8-30 Hz) signals and used LDA and a naive Bayesian classifier with features composed of log variance of the spatially filtered signals. Unlike other competitors, the 3rd winner applied a channel selection method by recursively removing less discriminative one, and built a classifier with three Support Vector Machines (SVM). The statistical analysis shows significant difference between the proposed method and the 2nd and 3rd competition methods with p¼ 0.0083, and p o0:0001, respectively in paired T-test. The proposed method outperformed 2nd and 3rd winners methods in a 99% confidence level.   With the BCI Competition II dataset IV, we compare the performance of the proposed method to that of other previous methods, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Discriminative CSP (DCSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Local Temporal CSP (LTCSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, in the literature. For the comparison, we use LDA in the experiments. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows performance of the four competing methods with the percentage accuracy. In the experiment, the proposed method represents the best performance of 88% accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Analysis of the weight distribution in time-frequency segments</head><p>In this section, we analyze the weights distributed over timefrequency segments to present the effectiveness of the proposed method with the first dataset. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the normalized weights of the time-frequency segments for left-and right-hand motor imagery classification. In the figure, the darker the face color of the time-frequency segment, the higher its weight. Based on the figure, we can confirm the inter-subject variability of the motor imagery tasks. Another important feature is that the proposed method can represent the change of discriminative power between classes in time. This important fact is reflected by assigning a weight to each time-frequency segment and this approach eventually improves the performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Effects of spatial filter selection</head><p>In this section, we analyze the effect of spatial filter selection in time-frequency segments with the first dataset. In Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>, we illustrate the weight distributions in terms of the Fisher ratios of the spatial filters over two dominant frequency bands for Subject 1 and Subject 8, respectively. Although many of the high Fisher ratios are distributed at the first and last m couples of spatial filters, this is the explanation for why the conventional approach of choosing the first and last m column vectors in spatial filters works. However, it is not always true across time-frequency segments and subjects. This indicates that the common approach of selecting pairs of first and last few spatial filters may not be optimal. Accordingly, the proposed method of selecting discriminative spatial filters adaptively in each time-frequency segment showed better classification performance. For example, many of the high weights for Subject 8 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> are distributed across the spatial filters. The proposed method captures this fact and selects the discriminative spatial filters accordingly and thus resulted in higher performances compared to TS-FBCSP, an improvement of as much as 0.05 for Subject 8, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, the performance for Subject 1 is decreased by 0.08, 0.03, and 0.01 compared with the performances of TS-FBCSP with m¼2, m¼3, and m¼4. We summarize that this is the result of selecting spatial filters of relatively low weights but still larger than the threshold s in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) (see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). Hence, determining the optimal threshold in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is another problem that should be considered in our future work.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref> shows the selected spatial filters and the change of their weights over time for the classification of left-and right-hand motor imagery tasks for Subject 8. The figure shows that the selected spatial filters are highly related to left-and right-hand motor imageries, because they are contralaterally well localized in the left-and rightsensorimotor cortex. When seeing change of weights of each basis over time, discriminative sets of bases and their weights are highly time-varying. As the proposed method constructs non-homogeneous spatial filters considering those non-stationary characteristics of ERD/ ERS, it is superior to the other competing methods.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and further research</head><p>The ERD/ERS patterns generated by motor imagery have high intra-and inter-subject variability in the space, time, and frequency domains. Many research groups have assumed that the spatial distribution of the single-trial EEG was homogeneous and applied spatial filters homogeneously across all the time. Unlike previous methods in the literature, we proposed a novel method of finding non-homogeneous spatial filters in time-frequency segments. The method optimized individual spatial filters over time with different sets of discriminative bases. We designed the strategy of the spectrally and temporally weighted classification rule to decide a class label. By the weighted classifiers based on our non-homogeneous spatial filters, we considered non-stationarity of EEG signals and achieved performance improvement for motor imagery classification. Based on our experimental results on the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a and BCI Competition II dataset IV, the effectiveness of the proposed method is clear and it outperforms the other competing methods.</p><p>While the proposed method enhanced the performance, it used a filter bank with a fixed bandwidth dissecting a wide band  of interest into smaller ones across subjects without considering spectral variation in task relevant brain responses. Therefore, it will be our forthcoming research issue.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>where h b</head><label></label><figDesc>denotes a spectral filter of the b-th frequency band in a filter bank, denotes a convolution operator, b A f1,2, . . . ,Bg, B is the number of frequency bands of interest, and V c b represents the bandpass-filtered single-trial EEG of the c-th class.</figDesc></figure>
