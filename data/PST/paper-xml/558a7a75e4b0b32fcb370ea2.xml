<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Xiaoping Yun and Nilanjan Sarkar</head><p>Abstract-Many robotic systems are subject to nonholonomic as well as holonomic constraints. Rolling contact between two rigid bodies is a typical example of such a system. In this study, a unified state space formulation of robotic systems subject to both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints is presented. The position-level holonomic constraints are first replaced by a set of velocity-level constraint equations that asymptotically converge to the original holonomic constraints. Having represented both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints in a common form, a state space representation of the constrained systems is then developed. A numerical algorithm for implementing the state space representation is also described. The proposed formulation eliminates the need to solve holonomic constraints either analytically or numerically, and ensures that holonomic constraints are always satisfied, particularly in computer simulations. The formulation makes it possible to treat systems with holonomic constraints, with nonholonomic constraints, or with both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints in a unified framework. Two examples are presented to illustrate the application of the unified formulation.</p><p>Index Terms-Holonomic constraints, nonholonomic constraints.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Nonholonomic Systems</head><p>Nonholonomic systems were actively studied in the past several years <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, owing partly to many interesting applications ranging from space robots <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, underwater robots <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>, wheeled mobile robots/vehicles <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[23]</ref>, grasping <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[25]</ref>, and manipulation <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[27]</ref>. Even though one cannot completely enumerate all classes of nonholonomic constraints, a special class of nonholonomic constraints that arise from these applications is characterized by velocity-level equality equations. Dynamic systems that are subject to this class of nonholonomic constraints enjoy an inherent structure that is particularly suitable for state space representations. Both kinematic and dynamic models of such systems can be conveniently transformed into a state space form. From control point of view, in state space form nonholonomic systems can be analyzed using advanced state space control theory. From simulation point of view, they can be numerically integrated using methods developed for ordinary differential equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Holonomic Systems</head><p>Holonomic constraints are characterized by equality equations in terms of position variables (or those that can be integrated to positionlevel equations if initially described by velocity-level equations). Much of work on holonomic systems in robotics was discussed in the context of force control <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[31]</ref>, with an emphasis on regulating the Lagrange multiplier. Yoshikawa <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[28]</ref> studied position/force control of manipulators under holonomic constraints. Constraints were differentiated to obtain coordinate axes that are normal to a constraint surface and those that are tangent to the constraint surface. Motion equations of manipulators were projected onto the tangent axes. Contact forces in the normal axes were represented as an algebraic equation. Holonomic constraints were enforced by explicitly controlling contact forces. Yun <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[29]</ref> introduced dynamics into the contact force equations of Yoshikawa's approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[28]</ref>, making it possible to asymptotically stabilize contact forces. McClamroch and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[30]</ref> assumed that part of generalized coordinates can be solved in terms of the remaining ones from holonomic constraints. A nonlinear transformation was introduced to transform differentialalgebraic equations of constrained systems into an algebraic equation characterizing the constraint force and an ordinary differential equation on the constraint manifold that does not explicitly depend on the contact force. In a separate work, McClamroch <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[32]</ref> viewed dynamic models of constrained manipulators as singular systems of differential equations. Mills and Goldenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[31]</ref> approached the problem using descriptor variable systems: E _ x = Ax + Bu where E is singular. Since E is singular, there are algebraic constraints among state variables. Results from descriptor variable systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[33]</ref> were applied to controller design. This method is only applicable to a neighborhood of an operating point since it is based on a linearized model of the constrained manipulator.</p><p>While the work mentioned above addresses the specific problem of position/force control of constrained manipulators, McClamroch <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[34]</ref> studied feedback stabilization of general control systems described by differential-algebraic equations. Conditions on the local stabilization of such systems are established using a state realization approach and a classic linearization (first order approximation) approach.</p><p>Udwadia and Kalaba <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[35]</ref> presented a formulation of motion equations that is able to incorporate both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. This is accomplished by differentiating holonomic constraints twice and nonholonomic constraints once. Both types of constraints are represented at acceleration level. This formulation is analytically appealing, but amplifies the drift problem through differentiation of constraint equations and uses more variables than minimum to describe motion equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Numerical Solutions</head><p>Computer simulation is now a common tool in control system design. To simulate a constrained mechanical system, it is necessary to numerically solve differential-algebraic equations. Numerical solutions to differential-algebraic equations are significantly more challenging than those of ordinary differential equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[36]</ref>. Differentialalgebraic equations considered in the numerical computation literature take the general form of</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F (x; _ x; t) = 0:<label>(1)</label></formula><p>When @F @ _</p><p>x is singular, there are underlying algebraic equations in <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. Unlike ordinary differential equations _ x = f (x; t), (1) may not necessarily have a solution through every given initial value x(t0). Some differential-algebraic equations are more difficult to solve numerically than others. An index is defined to measure the degree of difficulty or singularity of differential-algebraic equations. The index is defined as the minimum number of times that all or part of (1) must be differentiated with respect to t in order to determine _ x as a function of x and t <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[36]</ref>. According to this definition, ordinary differential equations have an index of zero. Differential-algebraic equations characterizing constrained mechanical systems have an index of three <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[37]</ref>. Differential-algebraic equations with an index greater than one are commonly referred to as higher index systems that are in general difficult to solve numerically.</p><p>For mechanical systems with holonomic constraints, the first and easiest approach is to eliminate dependent variables (Lagrange coordinates) from the motion equations. It is then possible to write the motion equation using an ordinary differential equation in terms of a minimal set of independent variables. The elimination process requires solving dependent variables in terms of the independent variables. Assuming the holonomic constraints are independent and continuously differentiable, the implicit function theorem ensures that elimination is analytically possible. Nevertheless, in practical systems, it may be difficult to solve implicit holonomic constraint equations.</p><p>Alternatively, holonomic constraints may be differentiated once or twice with respect to time and represented at the velocity or acceleration level. The velocity-level or acceleration-level representation of holonomic constraints can then be integrated with the equations of motion. Differentiation reduces the index of the problem. For example, by replacing the position constraint with the velocity constraint and using appropriate initial conditions, the index of the constrained system is reduced from three to two, with less difficulty in numerical methods. But there are two problems with this approach, namely, enforcement of the constraints (or drift problem) and the satisfaction of the initial condition.</p><p>1) First, if the velocity-level constraints are not uniformly satisfied during the course of motion (e.g., in the case of computer simulations), the corresponding position-level constraints will not be satisfied. Further, as soon as the position-level constraints are violated, they cannot be enforced anymore. Campbell and Leimkuhler <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[38]</ref> have demonstrated that in some cases, it is possible to have different eigenvalues of the Jacobian for the original constrained mechanical system and the differentiated form. As a result, the differentiated form may be less well behaved numerically. This numerical degradation is more noticeable if the Jacobian is nearly nonsingular and if there are rapidly oscillating or fast transients appearing in the constraints. 2) Second, the system trajectory must start from an initial condition that exactly satisfies the holonomic constraints. This is, in general, not a problem in the physical implementation of controllers, but is a serious problem in the computer simulation of controllers. Leimkuhler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[39]</ref> studied the consistent initialization problem and introduced consistency conditions. A numerical algorithm was developed by approximating the consistency equations by finite differences. It is shown that many solvers for differential-algebraic equations become extremely inefficient when the initial values are inconsistent. To eliminate the drift problem, Gear et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[40]</ref> suggested a stabilization formulation. Their method explicitly enforces both position and velocity level constraints by utilizing an additional Lagrange multiplier. Although such a formulation eliminates drift problem, it is found out <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[37]</ref> that it can be very inefficient and poorly conditioned. Overdetermined differential-algebraic equations, where the original constrained system is augmented by both velocity and acceleration constraints, have been investigated by Führer and Leimkuhler <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[41]</ref>. Using the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse to solve this system is mathematically equivalent to the stabilization method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[40]</ref>, however, effective implementations using generalized inverses to solve such an overdetermined system remain underdeveloped <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[42]</ref>. Another approach to eliminating drift is to use Baumgarte's stabilization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[44]</ref> that will be discussed in detail in Section III-D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Proposed Approach</head><p>It is clear that there does not exist a single method that solves all the problems concerning the solution of differential-algebraic equations representing constrained mechanical systems. It is extremely difficult to solve constrained systems at position level because of high index. On the other hand, differentiating the constraint at higher level introduces drift into the solution. If drift must be avoided, the solution becomes very inefficient. Additionally, numerical methods that are developed to solve differential-algebraic equations do not consider control inputs, and thus do not automatically lend themselves to a control formulation (e.g., state-space formulation) of the constrained mechanical systems. Methods that seek to formulate constrained mechanical systems for the control purpose often model the system as a singular differential equation that is very difficult and complicated to solve.</p><p>In this paper, we present a unified state space formulation of systems subject to both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. The position-level holonomic constraints are first replaced by a set of velocity-level constraint equations that asymptotically converge to the original holonomic constraints. By doing so, holonomic and nonholonomic constraints are represented in a common form at the velocity level. The combined velocity constraints are incorporated with the motion equations to derive a state space representation, following a similar procedure previously developed for nonholonomic systems.</p><p>In addition to its main contribution of providing a unified treatment for systems with holonomic constraints, systems with nonholonomic constraints, and systems with both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints, a numerical algorithm for implementing the state space representation is described. The proposed formulation also eliminates the need to solve holonomic constraints either analytically or numerically, and ensures satisfying holonomic constraints, particularly in computer simulations. Another benefit of the formulation is that it does not assume or require that holonomic constraints always be satisfied. Consequently, the proposed formulation is able to deal with transitions from noncontact to contact and vice versa.</p><p>In summary, the contributions of this paper are three fold. It provides a unified state space control formulation to mechanical systems subject to holonomic and nonholonomic constraints; it solves the problem of consistent initialization; and it offers a numerical algorithm to solve constrained mechanical systems.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes motion and constraint equations necessary for subsequent development. Section III is devoted to four different approaches to holonomic constraints. The proposed unified formulation of holonomic and nonholonomic systems is presented in Section IV. Section V details two examples. Some discussion on the proposed formulation is provided in Section VI.</p></div>

Unlike nonholonomic systems, there is not a "canonical" state space representation for holonomic systems. There are a number of ways by which holonomic systems can be represented in state space. Each of them is described in the following section, along with their advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Remark 1: We assumed that nonholonomic constraints are given by velocity-level equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and holonomic constraints are described by position-level equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>). In practical problems, both types of constraints may be described at velocity level. If both types of constraints are represented in the form of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), the number of holonomic and nonholonomic constraints can be determined by using the Frobenius Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[22]</ref>. Briefly, let 1 be the distribution spanned by the null space of B(q), and 1 3 be the smallest involutive distribution containing 1. It is clear that n 0 m = dim(1) dim(1 3 ). There are three possibilities.</p><p>1) If 1 itself is involutive, i.e., dim(1) = dim(1 3 ), all m constraints are in fact holonomic.</p><p>2) If dim(1 3 ) = n, i.e., 1 3 spans the entire space, all m constraints are nonholonomic.</p><p>3) If dim(1 3 ) = n 0 k; k out of m constraints are holonomic and the remaining ones are nonholonomic. If holonomic constraints, initially represented as velocity-level equations, are difficult to integrate into position-level equations, the best that one can do is to enforce these holonomic constraints at velocity level by treating them in the same way as nonholonomic constraints.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Direct Elimination</head><p>If the holonomic constraints described by (4) are independent and continuously differentiable, then k out of n generalized coordinates, in principle, can be locally solved in terms of the rest n 0k variables based on the implicit function theorem. Let us, in such a case, partition q into two blocks q = q v q d where q d is k-dimensional dependent variables, and q v is (n 0 k)dimensional independent variables. Based on the implicit function theorem, there is a local function <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> such that q d = (qv): <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> Using this relationship, the dependent variable q d can be eliminated from motion equations <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[48]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 2: The direct elimination method described above is preferred if it can be carried out at all. In practical applications, there are difficulties that may prevent the use of this method, some of which are listed below.</p><p>1. The implicit function theorem ensures the existence of a local function defined in <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. In practice, it may not be possible to obtain such a function at all.</p><p>2. Even if q d can be solved in terms of qv, there may be a problem of singularity. For example, if the holonomic constraint equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is given by q1q2 + q3q4 = 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(7)</formula><p>and q 4 is chosen as the dependent variable q d . q 4 can be solved in terms of q1; q2, and q3, but there is a singularity when q3 is equal to zero. In other words, q d can be solved locally, but it cannot be solved globally. 3. There is another problem of multiple solutions, for example, if the holonomic constraint equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">q 2 1 + q 2 2 0 = 0<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where is a constant, or is given by l1 sin(q1) + l2 sin(q1 + q2) + l3 = 0</p><p>where l i are constants.</p><p>4. Finally, by using the direct elimination method, it is assumed that the holonomic constraints are always satisfied. If for any reason the holonomic constraints are not satisfied over any period of time, the reduced order equations of motion derived by the direct elimination method are not valid. They do not characterize the motion of the mechanical system during that period of time. If these equations are used for simulation, the resulting motion trajectory during that period of time and thereafter may not be correct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Velocity-Level Constraints</head><p>In this method, the holonomic constraint equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is differentiated once and is represented at velocity level in the form of dC(q) dt = 0 ) J(q) _q = 0 <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref> where J(q) = @C(q) @q . The velocity-level constraints, <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>, are equivalent to the position-level constraints, (4), provided that the initial condition of the system q 0 = q(t 0 ) is a valid one, namely, C(q 0 ) = 0.</p><p>Since the velocity-level constraint equation is exactly in the same form as the nonholonomic constraints considered in Section II-A, the holonomically constrained system can be represented in state space using the same procedure for nonholonomic systems described in Section II-A. Using this procedure, the dependent position variables are not eliminated. The dimension of the state vector is (2n 0 k).</p><p>Remark 3: There are two problems with this methods concerning the initial condition and the enforcement of the constraints.</p><p>1. As stated above, the velocity-level constraint equation is equivalent to the original position-level constraint equation only if the system starts from a valid initial condition. To use this method, particularly in computer simulations, one must numerically solve the system of nonlinear equations C(q) = 0 for a valid initial q 0 .</p><p>2. Once the holonomic constraints are violated in a computer simulation, they cannot be enforced. The violation can occur, for example, if the initial condition is not a valid one, or the velocity-level constraints are not strictly satisfied due to numerical inaccuracy.</p></div>

Starting from any initial condition, the approach ensures that the holonomic constraints will eventually be satisfied. Similarly, if the holonomic constraints are not satisfied in the middle of motion trajectories for any reason, it enforces the satisfaction of the constraints. This is particularly useful for computer simulations of constrained systems. 3) A numerical algorithm is described for implementing the state space model or any model-based controller. The core step of the algorithm is the computation of _ S(q) and _ (q). It circumvents the problem of symbolically or numerically differentiate S(q) and (q). The algorithm is equally applicable to nonholonomic systems described in Section II-A. 4) The type of nonholonomic constraints described by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) is catastatic. The unified formulation can easily accommodate acatastatic constraints which have the form of B(q) _ q = b(q) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(56)</ref> or equivalently B(q) dq = b(q) dt:</p><p>(57)</p><p>All remains intact in the formulation except that the zero in the lower half of a(q) in ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) is replaced by b(q). 5) The formulation overcomes the difficulties of singularity and multiple solutions encountered by the direct elimination method. 6) The formulation represents holonomic and nonholonomic systems in state space, which makes it possible and easy to apply the state space control methods. 7) Finally, the formulation does not assume that holonomic constraints are always satisfied. It can treat transitions from noncontact to contact, and vice versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented a unified formulation for treating systems subject to both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. The constrained systems are represented in state space, which allows one to analyze and synthesize such systems by employing well-developed state space methods. Because the formulation uses a stable first-order differential equation to replace algebraic holonomic constraint equations, it reduces the numerical instability of holonomic constraints that occurs in computer simulations, and eliminates the need to solve multiple nonlinear holonomic constraint equations either analytically or numerically. Since it does not assume or require that holonomic constraints are always satisfied, it is able to deal with transitions from noncontact to contact, and vice versa. The two examples demonstrated the usefulness of the formulation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
