<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Motivated by the desire to lower the installation and hardware costs, and driven by the need for radio frequency (RF) spectrum exploitation, the sharing of system platforms and common frequency bands between radar and communications have become the main objectives guiding active sensing and wireless technologies. The co-existence of radar and wireless communication systems can ease competition over bandwidth <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. It can also complement the functionality of cognitive radio <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and cognitive radar <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in enhancing spectrum usage and efficiency. In other words, co-existence of the two platforms within the same frequency band can proceed in concert with the continual search and utilization of the available spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Sharing of spectrum resources and occupation of the same frequency bandwidth, however, require devising effective approaches to limit cross-interference between the two system functions and to properly apply the spatio-temporal degrees of freedom made possible by advances in waveform design and ubiquitous use of multi-sensor transmit/receive configurations. Spectrum sharing and the use of common transmit platform between radar and communications require the operator to define the primary and secondary system functions, as demanded by power allocations and preference in beam directivity. The problem of embedding communication symbols into the radar backscatter was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Incorporating communications as secondary to the primary radar function has been reported in a number of papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The embedding of a communication signal into the radar emission was reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>More recently, a method for information embedding using time modulated arrays has been reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The phases of the transmit array elements are adjusted from pulse to pulse in order to introduce variations in the sidelobe levels (SLLs) towards the intended communication receiver. During each radar pulse, the communication receiver detects the SLL and interprets the associated information symbol. Although the waveform does not change from pulse to pulse, it is difficult to design multiple transmit power distribution patterns with the same mainlobe using time modulated arrays. This difficulty is attributed to the fact that the optimization criterion involved in the design is highly nonlinear and computationally demanding.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a new approach to dual-function radar communications (DFRC) using waveform diversity in tandem with sidelobe control. Multiple orthogonal waveforms are used to embed a sequence of L B bits of information. The sidelobes towards the communication directions are controlled to have two distinct levels. This is achieved by designing two transmit beamforming weight vectors. All waveforms are transmitted simultaneously with one bit embedded in each waveform. The receiver interprets the bit associated with a certain waveform as 0 or 1 based on whether that waveform is radiated over the transmit beam associated with the first or the second transmit weight vector, respectively. Note that most modern pulsed radar systems support pulse repetition frequencies in the kHz range <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and, therefore, by embedding few bits per pulse, an overall data rate in the range of kbits per sec can be achieved. When the number of transmit array elements is large, higher values of L B can be used leading to higher data rates. In addition to the waveform diversity, incorporating other types of diversity, e.g., polarization, offers the potential for achieveing even higher data rates.</p><p>The proposed technique has the following attributes: (i) The communication message can be delivered to single or multiple communication directions as long as they are located outside the mainlobe where the primary radar function of the system takes place; (ii) The communication process is inherently secure against intercepts from directions other than the pre-assigned communication directions; (iii) The decoding of each bit at the receiver is independent from other neighboring bits in the sequence; (iv) The same set of waveforms are transmitted within every radar pulse which enables the radar to perform coherent processing; (v) The waveform diversity enables the radar to operate in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mode; and (vi) The communication directions can be adjusted adaptively if the receiver is mounted on a moving platform. The superiority of the proposed approach over the recently developed method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is validated using simulation examples.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. The signal model is described in Section II. Formulations for transmit beamforming designs to achieve quiescent mainlobe response and variable SLLs towards certain directions are presented in Section III. In Section IV, we introduce two novel signaling strategies for the proposed information embedding approach. Performance analysis of the proposed signaling strategies is provided in Section V. Supporting simulation results are presented in Section VI and conclusions are drawn in Section VII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SIGNAL MODEL</head><p>In this section, we develop a generic DFRC signal model employing waveform diversity and sidelobe control. The proposed system and the one reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are special cases of the developed model, as will become apparent in the following sections. Consider a DRFC system equipped with one dual-function transmit array, one radar receive array, and one (or more) communications receive array(s). The transmit and radar receive arrays consist of M T transmit and M R receive antennas, respectively, arranged in an arbitrary linear shape. Without loss of generality, we assume that both the radar transmit and receive arrays are closely spaced to each other such that a target located in the far-field would be at the same spatial angle with respect to both arrays. The purpose of the dual-function transmit array is to embed information toward the direction(s) of the communication receiver(s) as a secondary task without affecting the main task of the DFRC system, i.e., the radar operation. The transmit array is used to focus the transmit power within the main beam where the radar operation takes place.</p><p>The M T × 1 vector of the baseband representation of the signals at the input of the transmit antennas is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s(t; τ ) = K k=1 λ k (τ )u * k ψ k (t),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where t and τ denote the fast-time index (i.e., time within the radar pulse) and the slow-time index (i.e., pulse number), respectively, ψ k (t), k = 1, . . . , K are K orthogonal waveforms,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u k , k = 1, . . . , K are the M T × 1 transmit beamforming weight vectors, λ k (τ ), k = 1, . . . , K</formula><p>are the weights used to determine how much power is assigned to each transmit waveform such that the total transmit power is fixed, and (•) * denotes the complex conjugate. The waveforms ψ k (t), k = 1, . . . , K are assumed to satisfy the orthogonality condition at zero time-delay, Assuming that L far-field targets are located in a certain range-bin within the radar main beam, the M R × 1 vector of baseband signals received by the radar is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">that is T ψ k (t)ψ * k ′ (t) = 0, k = k ′ ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">x(t; τ ) = L m=1 β m (τ ) a T (θ m )s(t; τ ) b(θ m ) + x(t; τ ) + z(t; τ ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where β m (τ ) is the reflection coefficient of the mth target which obeys the Swerling II target model, i.e., the reflectivity remains constant during the entire radar pulse but changes from pulse to pulse, a(θ m ) and b(θ m ) are the M T × 1 and the M R × 1 steering vectors in direction θ m of the transmit and receive arrays, respectively, x(t; τ ) is the M R × 1 vector comprises the signals that impinge on the receive array from the sidelobe region, z(t; τ ) is the M R × 1 vector of additive white Gaussian noise with zero mean and covariance σ 2 z I M R , (•) T denotes matrix transpose, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I M R is the M R × M R identity matrix.</formula><p>It is worth noting that the processing of the radar received data can be performed directly on the M R × 1 data vector x(t; τ ), i.e., without making use of the waveform diversity. Alternatively, incorporating a preprocessing step via matched-filtering the received data to the orthogonal transmitted waveforms may lead to improved radar operation, depending on the transmit signaling strategies used to embed information, as will be discussed later in Section IV. Note that the utilization of the waveform diversity at the radar receiver requires that the transmit waveforms be orthogonal at all time-delays and Doppler-shifts within the range and velocity specifications of the radar. However, in practice, perfectly orthogonal waveforms with overlapped spectral contents cannot be achieved and, therefore, waveforms with low cross-correlations should be used. The problem of waveform design with low crosscorrelations has been extensively studied in the literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and references therein).</p><p>Consider J communication receivers located at arbitrary directions within the sidelobe region.</p><p>The orthogonal waveform dictionary used at the transmitter is assumed to be known to each communication receiver. Assume that the jth communication receiver is equipped with N j receive antennas arranged in an arbitrary linear shape. The N j × 1 vector of baseband signals at the output of the receive elements is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y j (t; τ ) = α j c j (φ j ) a T (θ j )s(t; τ ) + n j (t; τ )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where α j is the channel coefficient which summarizes the propagation environment between the transmit array and the jth communication receiver, φ j is the direction-of-arrival (DOA) with respect to the broad side of the jth communication receive array, c j (φ j ) is the steering vector of the receive array in direction φ j , and n j (t; τ ) is the N j × 1 vector of additive white Gaussian noise with zero mean and covariance σ 2 j I N j .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. TRANSMIT BEAMFORMING DESIGN</head><p>In this section, we introduce computationally efficient methods for appropriately designing the M T × 1 transmit beamforming weight vectors needed for implementing the proposed DFRC methods given in Section IV as well as the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The proposed methods require the use of only two transmit beamforming weight vectors while the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> requires the use of K = 2 L B weight vectors. The formulations described in this section design each transmit beamforming weight vector separately and, therefore, enable design of an arbitrary number K of transmit beamforming weight vectors. From the radar operation view point, one key requirement is to maintain a constant transmit power radiation pattern within the main beam of the radar during the entire dwell time, i.e., during the coherent processing interval. On the other hand, in order to embed information in the beamformer, the SLL in the communication directions should be permitted to assume different values. These two key requirements are achieved via appropriate transmit beamforming design. We consider the transmit beamforming design for the following two cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case 1: Narrow Main Beam</head><p>Consider the case where the main beam of the radar is focused towards the spatial angle θ t .</p><p>A meaningful way to design each transmit weight vector u k , k = 1, . . . , K, is to minimize the power radiation level in the out of sector region Θ, while maintaining a distortionless response towards the desired direction θ t . In addition, a certain pre-specified SSL is enforced in the directions where the communication receivers are located. Assuming that the number of communication receivers is less than the number of transmit antennas, i.e., J &lt; M T , the transmit beamforming design can be formulated as the following optimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">min u k max θ u H k a(θ) , θ ∈ Θ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">subject to u H k a(θ t ) = 1,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">u H k a(θ j ) = ∆ k , j = 1, . . . , J,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where ∆ k is a pre-determined positive number used to determine the amount of transmit power radiated towards the communications directions over the kth transmit beam and (•) H denotes the Hermitian operation. The optimization problem (4)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) is convex and can be efficiently solved using the interior point methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It is worth noting that the aforementioned optimization problem should be solved K times, i.e., it should be solved for every u k , k = 1, . . . , K. Note that the total number of equality constraints in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) equals J + 1 ≤ M T , which is less than or equal to the number of degrees of freedom and, therefore, a feasible solution to (4)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) is guaranteed. However, if the number of communication directions is larger than M T , it is possible that the problem becomes infeasible. In such a case, the equality sign in (6) should be relaxed (e.g., changed to an inequality) and the value of ∆ k should be carefully chosen to warrant a feasible solution to the relaxed formulations of the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case 2: Wide Main Beam</head><p>For the more general case when the radar operation takes place in a wider spatial sector Θ = [θ min θ max ], one way to design the transmit beamforming weight vectors is to minimize the difference between a desired transmit power radiation pattern and the actual one under the constraints that the sidelobes be bounded by certain pre-defined levels. This can be formulated as the following optimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">min u k max θ |G d (θ)| -u H k a(θ) , θ ∈ Θ (7) subject to u H k a(θ) ≤ ε, θ ∈ Θ,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">u H k a(θ j ) = ∆ k , j = 1, . . . , J,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where G d (θ) is the desired transmit beampattern and ε is a positive number of user's choice used for controlling the SLLs.</p><p>In ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">9</ref>), the objective function fits the actual transmit pattern associated with each transmit beam which is mandated by the radar operation. The set of constraints in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">8</ref>) is used to upperbound the transmit power leakage within the sidelobe areas, which is also mandated by the radar operation. Note that the upper bound determined by the parameter ε is the same for all transmit beams. The set of constraints in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">9</ref>) is associated with the secondary function of the system, which is to embed information by enforcing different SLLs towards the communication directions. It is worth noting that the parameter ∆ k which determines the SLL is different for each transmit beam. Since ε is the highest sidelobe level as mandated by the main radar operation of the system, the condition ∆ k ≤ ε, k = 1, . . . , K should be satisfied. However, a tradeoff between the primary radar and the secondary communication operations can be achieved by allowing the SLLs towards the communication directions to be higher than the rest of the sidelobe region.</p><p>This means that more transmit power is assigned to the communication operation at the price of a decreased transmit gain within the main radar beam. In this case, the set of constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> should cover the sidelobe region excluding the communication directions.</p><p>The optimization problem ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">9</ref>) is difficult to solve due to the non-convex objective function.</p><p>Therefore, we reformulate the problem by slightly modifying the objective function. We set the desired radiation pattern as G d (θ) = e ϕ(θ) , yielding the following optimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">min u k max θ i e ϕ(θ i ) -u H k a(θ i ) , θ i ∈ Θ, i = 1, . . . , I<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">subject to u H k a(θ p ) ≤ ε, θ p ∈ Θ, p = 1, . . . , P,<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">u H k a(θ j ) = ∆ k , j = 1, . . . , J,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where θ i , i = 1, . . . , I, and θ p , p = 1, . . . , P , are discrete grids of angles used to approximate Θ and Θ, respectively, and ϕ(θ) is a phase profile of user's choice. The optimization problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) is convex and can be solved in a computationally efficient manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, the parameter ε should be carefully chosen to warrant a feasible solution. One way to do this is to solve the following auxiliary problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">min u k ,ε ε (13) subject to u H k a(θ p ) ≤ ε, θ p ∈ Θ, p = 1, . . . , P,<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">u H k a(θ j ) = ∆ k , j = 1, . . . , J,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>which is guaranteed to have a feasible solution. Denote the solution to ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">15</ref>) as ε min . Then, the range of ε values which warrants a feasible solution to the optimization problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) is given as ε ≥ ε min . Note that the transmit beamforming weight vector obtained by solving ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) yields a unit magnitude within the main radar beam. However, in practice, the transmit weight vector can be scaled up to the desired transmit gain as long as the total transmit power budget does not exceed the maximum allowed power of the actual system. Further note that scaling up the transmit weight vector results in magnifying the transmit power distribution at all angles equally, i.e., the relative SLLs with respect to the mainlobe remain unchanged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIGNALING STRATEGIES FOR INFORMATION-EMBEDDING</head><p>During each radar pulse, the transmitter is assumed to embed L B bits of information denoted as the binary sequence B l , l = 1, . . . , L B . In this section, we propose two signaling strategies for information-embedding using waveform diversity in tandem with sidelobe control. Both signaling strategies require the use of only two transmit beamforming weight vectors denoted as u H and u L . Both u H and u L are assumed to have the same transmit power radiation pattern except in the spatial directions of the communication receivers where the SLL associated with u H is assumed to be higher than the SLL associated with u L . Either of the optimization problems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) or ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) can be used for designing the aforementioned two weight vectors by choosing ∆ k = ∆ H while designing u H and ∆ k = ∆ L for designing u L , where ∆ H &gt; ∆ L . Therefore, the constraints in (6) (similarly ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>)) should be restated as u H H a(θ j ) = ∆ H and u H L a(θ j ) = ∆ L while designing u H and u L , respectively. We assume that both u H and u L are normalized to have unit norm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Proposed Transmit Signaling Strategy 1</head><p>The first method requires the use of a number of orthogonal waveforms equals to the number of transmit bits per radar pulse, i.e., L B waveforms are transmitted simultaneously.

A few comments are in order with regards to the two proposed signaling strategies. Unlike strategy 1, since the detection of a certain bit in strategy 2 is performed by comparing the received signal strength associated with one waveform to that of another waveform, no threshold is required. Moreover, in signaling strategy 2, the number of waveforms transmitted via u H equals the number of waveforms transmitted via u L regardless of the binary sequence comprising the embedded information. As such, from the radar operation view point, any clutter or interference located in the sidelobe region will result in the same signal reflections during the entire coherent processing interval. On the other hand, the signaling strategy 1 uses the bit sequence to determine which waveform will be transmitted via a particular SLL. This may cause clutter to slightly change from pulse to pulse during the coherent processing interval. For illustration, assume that the number of 0's in the bit sequence during a certain pulse is L 0 and the number of 1's during the same pulse is L 1 , i.e., L B = L 0 + L 1 . Signaling strategy 1 results in L 0 waveforms being transmitted via u H and the remaining L 1 waveforms being transmitted via u L . If L 0 and L 1 are not equal, which is likely to be the case, then any clutter or interference located in the communication direction will result in a slightly changing signal reflections. Note that the aforementioned advantages of strategy 2 over strategy 1 are obtained at the expense of using twice the number of orthogonal waveforms as compared to the signal strategy 1.</p></div>

Therefore, information embedding can proceed by choosing a certain waveform to be radiated over either of the transmit beams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 2: BER Performance for Narrow Main Beam</head><p>Next, we use the setup in Example 1 to investigate the performance of the two proposed methods in terms of the BER and compare it with the technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Note that the latter technique employs a single waveform in tandem with 4 SSLs towards the communication direction to deliver L B = 2 bits of information. On the other hand, we employ two orthogonal waveforms to deliver two bits per pulse, i.e., one waveform per bit, for the first proposed method and four orthogonal waveforms, i.e., two waveforms per bit, for the second proposed method. To test the BER, a sequence of 10 6 symbols unencoded (two bits each) are transmitted. In addition, a convolutional encoder of rate 2/3 is applied to the original sequence resulting in 1.5x10 6 encoded  sequence. Both the unencoded and the encoded sequences are embedded independently using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the proposed two methods. The communication receiver is assumed to be equipped with N = 10 receive antennas arranged in a non-uniform linear array where the   The received encoded sequence is decoded using a Viterbi decoder. The BERs versus the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) for the three methods is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> for both the unencoded as well as the encoded data sequences. Clearly, both proposed methods achieve superior BER performance as compared to the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Note that the latter method transmits 25% of the information via each of the four beams. Therefore, intersymbol interference becomes a considerable source of detection error resulting in performance degradation. This phenomenon is expected to be worse if longer binary sequences are used. It is worth noting that, for all methods tested, the BER associated with the encoded sequence outperforms the BER associated with the unencoded sequence. However, this BER superiority comes at the price of slower data transmission rate.</p></div>

The BERs are calculated based on transmitting 1.5x10 6 symbols of encoded data sequence. The Viterbi decoder is used to decode the received data. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> depicts the BER versus angle for the three considered methods, which shows that the BER assumes high values for directions other than the intended communication directions in all cases. This means that all methods have inherent security against information interception from directions other than the communication directions. It can be also confirmed from the figure that the two proposed methods have a better BER towards the communication directions as compared to the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 4: Probability of Target Detection for Narrow Main Beam</head><p>Next, we evaluate the performance of the radar operation within the main beam focused towards θ radar = 0 • , in terms of the probability of target detection. We assume a single target located in the far-field at direction θ t = 0 • . The number of radar receive elements is chosen to be M R = 10, with the antennas arranged in an arbitrary linear array configuration, co-located with the transmit array. The target is considered to be detected if the received power from θ t exceeds a certain threshold, which is set to unity in this example. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the probability of target detection versus SNR. We observe that all methods tested provide similar target detection performance, which implies that the process of information embedding in the sidelobe region does not adversely affect the primary radar operation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 5: Transmit Beampattern Design for Wide Main Beam</head><p>In this example, we assume that the main radar operation takes place within the sector Θ = [-10 • 10 • ]. We further assume that the radar operation requires the power level emitted in the sidelobe areas to be at least 20 dB lower than the mainlobe. The communication operation remains in the sidelobe region, where a single communication direction of θ = -50 • is considered. Again, we assume that L B = 2 bits of information are to be transmitted during every radar pulse. The four transmit weight vectors are designed by solving (10)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. The parameters ∆ k , k = 1, . . . , 4, and ε are chosen to have the same values as in Example 1. The first and fourth designed vectors are used for the proposed methods, while all four are employed for implementing the SLL based method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> plots the transmit power distribution patterns for all four transmit weight vectors, which clearly shows that all patterns are identical within the sector Θ, whereas the SLLs towards the communication directions are distinct from each other, thereby enabling information embedding. Note that the difference between two adjacent SSLs towards the communication direction is the same in terms of log-scale magnitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 6: BER Performance for Wide Main Beam</head><p>This example tests the BER versus SNR for the communication receiver located at -50 • using the transmit beamforming vector designs of Example 5. During each radar pulse, the transmitter embeds 2 bits of information and the communication receiver performs detection on a pulse by pulse basis. Similar to Example 2, the experiment is carried over 10 6 independent trials of unencoded data. The information sequence is generated randomly. Also, a convolutional encoder and a Viterbi decoder are used to perform the simulation using encoded data sequence. Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> shows the BERs versus SNR for all methods tested. It is clear that the two proposed methods achieve superior BER performance as compared to the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The figure also shows that the BER associated with the case of encoded data sequence is better than that for the case of unencoded data for all methods tested. Again, this comes at the price of slower data transmission rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 7: DOA Estimation Performance for Wide Main Beam</head><p>This example evaluates the DOA estimation performance of the radar operation. We assume two targets located in the far-field at angles 3 • and 5 • , respectively. The target reflection coeffi- cients are assumed to be constant during each radar pulse, but change from pulse to pulse and are drawn from a normal distribution. The number of radar receive array elements is chosen as M R = 10. The number of pulses used is 100, i.e., 100 data snapshots are used at the radar receiver to build the data covariance matrix. The MUSIC algorithm is used to perform DOA estimation for all methods tested. The two targets are assume to be resolved provided  is satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The root-mean square error (RMSE) and the probability of target resolution are averaged over 1000 independent runs. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref> show the RMSE versus SNR and the probability of target resolution versus SNR, respectively. It can be observed that the two proposed methods outperform the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This is because the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> transmits a single waveform at any given pulse and as such, does not exploit any waveform diversity, i.e., the size of the data at the radar receiver has dimensions M R × 1. For the first proposed method,  This increased dimensionality results in improved DOA estimation performance as compared to the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. For the second proposed method, two different waveforms are transmitted all the time leading to 2M R × 1 virtual data 100% of the time. This results in even better DOA estimation performance and probability of source resolution as compared to the first method.</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">θi -θ i ≤ θ 2 -θ 1 2 , i = 1, 2,<label>(49)</label></formula><p>However, the performance improvement is achieved at the expense of using twice the number of orthogonal waveforms as compared to the first proposed method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 8: Effect of sidelobe modulation on out-of-sector interference localization</head><p>The final example tests the effect of varying the SLLs from pulse to pulse on the performance of DOA estimation of powerful sources located in the sidelobe region. Since the sources are located outside the mainbeam of the radar, they are treated as interference. We use the same  setup as that of Example 7, except that two interfering sources are assumed to be located at directions -52 • and -48 • , respectively. The interference reflection coefficients are assumed to be constant during each radar pulse, but change from pulse to pulse and are drawn from a normal distribution. We assume that the secondary function of the system embeds two bits of information during each radar pulse where the probabilities of embedding '0 ′ and embedding '1 ′ are equal. Therefore, the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> utilizes four different sidelobe levels which means that 25% of the received data snapshots have interference strength proportional to each one of the four sidelobe levels. This variation in the interference strength within a CPI is expected to degrade the interference DOA estimation performance. For the first proposed method, the sidelobe variation takes only two distinct levels, namely 'high' and 'low'. This implies that 25% of the received data snapshots exhibit interference strength proportional to the high sidelobe level, 25% of the received data snapshots exhibit interference strength proportional to the low sidelobe level, and the remaining 50% exhibit interference strength proportional to the average of the high and low SLLs. For each embedded bit using the second proposed method, two orthogonal waveforms are emitted simultaneously; one via each of the high and low SLLs. In this case, the strength of the received interference signal is proportional to the average of both the high and low SLLs for all radar pulses.</p><p>The RMSE and the probability of source resolution are averaged over 500 independent runs.</p><p>Figs. 13 and 14 show the RMSE versus interference-to-noise ratio (INR) and the probability of target resolution versus INR, respectively. It can be observed from the two figures that the proposed method 1 slightly outperforms the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> because it exhibits less SLL variation.</p><p>The figures also show that the proposed method 2 has the best performance because the strength of the received interference signal is not affected by variations in the SLLs during the entire CPI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>A new approach to dual-function radar-communication system was introduced, which recognizes the primary radar function of the system and employs array beam sidelobes to transmit the </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>where T is the pulse width. The orthogonal waveforms are used for matched-filtering at the receiver enabling the extraction of the received signals components associated with each transmitted waveform. It is worth noting that the baseband signals in the transmit signal vector s(t; τ ) need not be orthogonal. The purpose of the transmit weight vectors u k , k = 1, . . . , K, is twofold: (i) To focus the transmit power within the main beam of the radar operation while minimizing the power radiated in the out-of-sector area; (ii) To enable information-embedding towards communication directions via achieving certain predetermined SLLs. Appropriate ways to design the transmit weight vectors will be discussed later in Section III.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>1 . 2 .Fig. 1 .</head><label>121</label><figDesc>Fig 2 show the Rician probability density functions versus the magnitude of the received signal at the communication receiver for the first proposed signaling strategy. In this case, the high and low SLLs are chose such that A H = A 1 / √ 2 and A L = A 4 / √ 2. The reason for this choice is that the method in [14] assigns the entire transmit power to a single waveform, whereas the first proposed signalizing strategy divides the total transmit power equally among two orthogonal waveforms. Note that the two Rician distribution functions associated with the high and low SLLs are the same for the individual bits because each bit is associated with an independent waveform, i.e., the received signals associated with the individual bits are separable from each other at the receiver. The threshold used to detect the embedded bit is indicated as a vertical line in the figure. Fig. 2 also depicts the tails of the Rician distributions which correspond to</figDesc></figure>

Two array responses associated with the same main beam were designed using two different transmit weight vectors in order to achieve distinct spatial transmit power distribution patterns outside the radar designated beam. This distinction was aimed at creating two sidelobe levels in the direction of the designated communication receiver. The bilevel sidelobes at specific angles were used in conjunction with multiple orthogonal waveforms to enable effective co-existence between the radar and communications platforms. The number of orthogonal waveforms was chosen as equal to the length of the bit sequence to be delivered during each radar pulse. The use of bi-level sidelobe radiation pattern enables a communication receiver to interpret the information bit in each orthogonal waveform. The proposed technique permits information delivery to single or multiple communication directions as long as they are located outside the mainlobe of the radar. The communication process was shown to be inherently secure against intercept from directions other than the pre-assigned communication directions. The effectiveness of the proposed technique and its superiority over existing DFRC techniques in terms of the BER performance were demonstrated through extensive simulations.</figDesc></figure>
