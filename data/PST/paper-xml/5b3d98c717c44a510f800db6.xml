<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mobile Health (mHealth) applications are readily accessible to the average user of mobile devices, and despite the potential of mHealth applications to improve the availability, affordability and effectiveness of delivering healthcare services, they handle sensitive medical data, and as such, have also the potential to carry substantial risks to the security and privacy of their users. Developers of applications are usually unknown, and users are unaware of how their data are being managed and used. This is combined with the emergence of new threats due to the deficiency in mobile applications development or the design ambiguities of the current mobile operating systems. A number of mobile operating systems are available in the market, but the Android platform has gained the topmost popularity. However, Android security model is short of completely ensuring the privacy and security of users' data, including the data of mHealth applications. Despite the security mechanisms provided by Android such as permissions and sandboxing, mHealth applications are still plagued by serious privacy and security issues. These security issues need to be addressed in order to improve the acceptance of mHealth applications among users and the efficacy of mHealth applications in the healthcare systems. Thus, this paper presents a conceptual framework to improve the security of medical data associated with Android mHealth applications, as well as to protect the privacy of their users. Based on the literature review that suggested the need for the intended security framework, three-distinct and successive phases are presented, each of which is described in a separate section. First, discussed the design process of the first phase to develop a security framework for mHealth apps to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive medical data. The second phase is discussed who to achieve the implementation of a prototypic proof-of-concept version of the framework. Finally, the third phase ending discussed the evaluation process in terms of effectiveness and efficiency for the proposed framework.</p><p>Android-provided security features are still insufficient to protect user data against few security attacks that are equally applicable to mHealth apps and their data, such as side channel threats, privilege escalation attacks, sensors-based covert channels and DMB attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12]</ref>. mHealth apps are a new and revolutionary development in healthcare system, and a huge number of people can access this new system at a very low cost.</p><p>Considering the great utility and impact of this phenomenal development, and the detrimental effect that security and privacy issues might cause to its successful deployment, those issues in mobile health applications on Android platform need to be addressed to improve mHealth apps' effectiveness and alleviate any barriers to their rapid integration into the healthcare system. The main theme of this article is the security and privacy of mHealth apps on Android smartphones. This theme involves two main research components: the security of Android smartphones, and the incorporation of mHealth apps' security within Android security model. Then, figure out the weak points and consequently proposed a new methodology as a solution are discussed as demonstrated in our study framework in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 presents the research problem. Section 3 describes the literature review studies. Section 4 reports discussion of three distinct and successive phases. Section 5 concludes the conclusion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>mHealth apps are hereby defined as software programs that provide health related services through smartphones and tablets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. mHealth is an emerging field which has the potential to make healthcare professionals more efficient, increase patient satisfaction and reduce the healthcare cost. The general concept of mHealth includes medical apps. There are several types of medical apps, some are using external devices such as medical sensors, and some apps are using smartphone resources, such as the camera for the treatment of the patient. The use of mHealth apps among physicians and patients has grown significantly since the introduction of mobile phones. Physicians can access patients' data and medical knowledge at the point of care, and they can also monitor patient health through mHealth apps. The sensitive nature of these apps' purpose and consequence of use -in relation to human health-impose several questions about their reliability, authority, and compliance to regulations. Aside from the functional requirements, issues related to non-functional requirements have also to be addressed, such as the usability of the apps by users from different age groups. In particular, it soon became clear that mHealth apps carry substantial risks to the security of user's sensitive medical data as well as their privacy <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Developers of these apps are usually unknown, and users are unaware of how their data are being managed and used. In mHealth, users can easily enhance the functionalities of their smartphones by connecting them to external devices, such as medical devices, sensors and credit card readers. This introduces many new threats along with the useful applications in various domains, including healthcare information systems and retail <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. Android is an operating system based on Linux for mobile devices. Android platform provides a rich application framework that allows developers to build innovative apps in the Java language environment. Android is a multi-user system in which each app is considered an individual user, and is given a unique user ID (UID). Every app runs in its own Linux process and uses a separate virtual machine to be isolated from other apps. In this way, Android platform implements the principle of least privilege. That is, each app, by default, can only access those components that are required to do its own work. MHealth apps operate on mobile platforms, and because the Android operating system is chosen as the target platform in this article, there is a need to investigate its structure as well as its security model in detail.</p><p>In order to protect user data, system resources (including the network) and apps themselves, Android platform provides the following extra security features: security at the OS level through the Linux kernel's secure interprocess communication (IPC), application sandbox, application signing, and the Android permission model. Recently, researchers have been actively involved in the study of mHealth apps, in particular their security and privacy. For example, Mitchell, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> investigated the security and privacy challenges of mHealth apps; He, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> raised the security concerns of Android mHealth apps; and Plachkinova, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> proposed a taxonomy of mHealth apps' security and privacy concerns. Nevertheless, beyond the identification and investigation of the problem itself, there is no actual solution for the security and privacy of mHealth apps specifically, except one policy framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. This framework provides some guidelines to secure mHealth apps; however, these policies are not enough and even not implemented to secure mHealth apps. In addition,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Mobile Health Applications on Android Platform</head><p>This section provides necessary background information on the concepts of the Android platform and the security issues at the intersection of mhealth and android platform. The section is divided into two sub-sections. Section 3.1 is providing a complete background on the Android architecture, and what has been done to secure this platform. While, the section 3.2 reviews the most relevant works in the literature on the threats to mHealth apps, and provides a critical assessment of their security and privacy. This section also summarizes the existing solutions to address those issues. The focus of the section is directly related to the research in this article, which attempts to contribute and propose a novel solution to the said issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Android Platform and Its Security</head><p>The main goal of this study is to protect sensitive information of mHealth apps and their user. MHealth apps operate on mobile platforms, and because the Android operating system is chosen as the target platform in this study, there is a need to review its structure as well as its security model in detail. This section briefly presents the details of Android OS, its components, the possible types of communication in the system, and the supported security mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Android System Architecture</head><p>Android is a Linux based operating system developed primarily for mobile devices (e.g., smartphones or tablets) circa 2003 by Android Inc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. Soon after, Google acquired this company in 2005. Google commenced the first Android device in October 2008, and thenceforth it maintains the development of the operating system, as well as its marketing and support. Google also releases the source code of Android under open source licenses, and allows vendors to customize new releases of the operating system and to use the customized version in their own devices, subject to the compliance of a special compatibility agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. Android operating system is a stack of software components, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Android platform comprises a Linux kernel, a middleware layer and an application layer. Google customized the underlying Linux internals to provide strong isolation between different processes, and then built the whole system upon the modified Linux kernel. The kernel also serves as an abstraction layer between the hardware and other software layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. The Linux kernel provides the usual basic facilities, for instance: memory management, device drivers, process scheduling, and a file system. The Android middleware layer lies on the top of the Linux kernel. This layer contains three main components: the application framework, the native operating system libraries, and the Android runtime environment. The application framework is written in Java and is a collection of services that define the environment in which Android apps are run and managed. These services are offered to apps as Java classes. System applications such as the system content providers and system services are also part of the application framework. These applications and services provide the essential functionalities and services of the platform, such as System Settings, Clipboard, LocationManager, WifiManager, and the AudioManager. In Android platform, system content providers are essential databases, while system services provide the required high-level functions to control the device's hardware and to get information about the platform state, such as location and network status. Another part of the middleware is a set of native libraries, which provide functionalities such as graphics processing and multimedia support. These libraries are written in the C/C++ programming language. The final part of Android middleware layer is the runtime environment, which comprises the Dalvik Virtual Machine and core Java libraries. This layer is mostly written in C/C++ except parts of the core libraries, and is customized for the specific needs and requirements of resource-constrained mobile devices. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, Android Application layer is located at the top of the Android software stack. This contains both the pre-installed apps (i.e., native Android apps) and the third party apps developed by different (unofficial) app developers. Apps are written in Java, but for performance reasons may include native code (C/C++), which is called through the Java Native Interface (JNI). Basically, the Android OS is a multi-user system, in which each app has a unique user ID (UID). All files in an app will be assigned to that apps UID and usually not accessible to other apps. Each app runs in its own Linux process with a unique UNIX user identity and isolated from other apps, so that apps must explicitly share data and resources. In this way, Android platform implements the principle of least privilege. Generally, Android app consists of certain components: Activity (User interface), Service (background process), Broadcast Receiver (mailbox for broadcast messages), and Content Provider (SQL-like database) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. The usual path to develop Android apps is to use the special Software Development Kit (SDK) provided by Google, which include an extensive set of tools and API libraries, using the Java programming language. This development option relies on the rich Java application framework in Android, which enable developers to interact with various aspects of the system including hardware and software components, such as sensors, wireless interfaces, telephony services, as well as multimedia and user interface elements. It is also possible to write native apps in the C/C++ language through the special Native Development Kit (NDK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. A finalized Android app is not distributed in the traditional Java bytecode format within ".class" files or ".jar" archives. Rather, Android development kit includes a tool that converts the Java compiled</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2 Android System Architecture</head><p>Android platform is a common target for academic research studies, including the present one. The main reason behind this popularity is straightforward: Android is an open product; its source code is available from Google for interested parties, including other software developers and hardware vendors. This has resulted in an interesting outcome. On the one hand, researchers can dissect the operating system source code, studying relevant parts to their research and potentially modifying the code base accordingly. The possession of a real and mature operating system code at the disposal of researchers to experiment with and implement new ideas proved very attractive and rewarding. Most of the research literature on mobile platforms is directed towards Android, which results in yet more studies that address this platform. On the other hand, being released under an open license (subject to compliance agreement), Android platform can be adopted by any hardware vendors, including mobile device manufacturers or embedded-system developers. The target devices that employ Android are far more than those employing competing mobile platforms. For example, the market share of Android-based smartphones is almost 87.6% as of 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. This means that research studies on the Android platform have much broader potential impact than studies performed on other mobile platforms. Also related to this point is the fact that more hardware devices from various vendors are available to experiment with. This enables researchers to verify their results on a variety of designs and implementations. The aforementioned reasons justify for the selection of Android platform as the main target in this as well as other studies. Nevertheless, it is worthy emphasizing that most of the results are often applicable to other mobile platforms, with some modifications that depend on the nature of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">The Structure of Android Apps</head><p>An Android app is an application software that is developed to be run on mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. Each Android app contains one or more of four main components: activities, services, broadcast receivers or content providers. With a few exceptions, communication between apps occurs through the middleware layer, which defines the different types of inter-process communication (IPC). There is a direct correspondence between types of IPC and the four main components of apps. In general, IPC is implemented through objects called intent message <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. By definition, an intent is "an abstract description of an operation to be performed" <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. Intents are addressed either directly to a component using the application's unique namespace, or to an action string. For instance, it can be used with the startActivity() method to launch an Activity, with the bindService(Intent,ServiceConnection,int) or startService(Intent) methods to communicate with a background Service, and with the broadcastIntent() method to send it to any interested BroadcastReceiver components. Further, developers define intent filters based on action strings for different components of apps to automatically start out on corresponding events. For instance, two different Android apps' components and their interaction is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The details of an app components are given below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3 Android App Components and Their Interactions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.1">Activity</head><p>An activity component represents a single screen with a user interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. An activity component interacts with the user through touchscreen and keypad. Apps usually contain multiple activities, one for each screen presented to the user. For example, in an email app, one activity shows a list of new emails, another activity for reading emails, and another activity to compose an email.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.2">Service</head><p>A service is "a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. A service component does not provide a user interface. Furthermore, this component provides background processing that continues even after its app loses focus. Services also define arbitrary interfaces for remote procedure call (RPC), including method execution and callbacks, which can only be called after the service has been bound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.3">Content provider</head><p>A Content Provider component manages a shared set of app data. This component is a database-like mechanism for sharing data with other apps. An app user can store the data in the file system, an SQLite database, on the web, or any other persistent storage location that apps can access. The interface with content providers does not use intents, but rather is addressed through a content URI. It supports standard SQL-like queries, e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, through which components in other apps can retrieve, store or even modify the data according to the content provider's schema (i.e., if the content provider allows it).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.4">Broadcast receiver</head><p>A broadcast receiver is another Android app component that responds to system-wide broadcast announcements. It is an asynchronous event mailbox for broadcasted intent messages. Many broadcasts originate from the system, for instance, a broadcast announcing that the battery is low, the screen has turned off, or a picture was captured. Apps can also initiate broadcasts, for instance, to let other apps know that some data has been downloaded to the device and is available for them to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. Every app package includes a manifest file. The manifest file defines all components in an app that also includes their types and intent filters. Note that Android platform allows apps to dynamically create broadcast receivers that do not appear in the manifest <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Android Security Model</head><p>This section briefly lists the security mechanisms that Android platform uses to secure the application environment. Android implements a number of security mechanisms, the most prominent of which are application sandboxing and a permission framework that enforces mandatory access control (MAC) on intercomponent communication calls and on the access to core functionalities. A detailed overview of Android security mechanisms can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.1">Android permission system</head><p>By default, Android apps have limited access to system's resources and to each other's components. The access to sensitive resources within Android is protected through a security mechanism called permissions. It provides protected APIs for the sensitive resources, including telephony, GPS, location, camera, Bluetooth, SMS/MMS and network access. To make use of the protected APIs, an Android app must declare the permissions associated to those APIs' in its own manifest file, and the permissions are agreed upon at installation time by the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.2">Application sandboxing</head><p>All installed apps on Android platform run in an application sandbox. The Android assigns a unique user identifier (UID) to each app and runs it as an individual user in a separate process. Furthermore, each app runs in its own instance of the DVM under the assigned UID. This sandboxing mechanism also applies to native code contained in apps. However, apps from the same vendor can use a shared UID, hence basically sharing the sandbox. Basically, the kernel enforces security between applications via standard Linux features, such as UIDbased permissions and process isolation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.3">Application signing</head><p>Application signing allows to identify the author of an app. Application signing is the first step to ensure the application sandbox mechanism; certificates are signed to ensure which UID is associated to which app and different apps run under different UIDs. As an app is installed on Android OS, the system verifies that the app has been properly certified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.4">Secure inter-process communication</head><p>In Android platform, processes can communicate by using any of the standard UNIX-style mechanisms. Android platform also provides new Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms that includes binder, intents, services and content providers. Binder is a lightweight remote procedure call mechanism that is designed for high-performance in-process and cross-process calls. Services can provide interfaces directly accessible using Binder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.5">SELinux</head><p>Android employs Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> to apply mandatory access control. SELinux is the primary Mandatory Access Control (MAC) mechanism built into a number of GNU/Linux distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Android Security Research Trends</head><p>Recently, a number of security extensions for Android have been proposed. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> is classifying the diverse and rich literature on Android security into a comprehensive taxonomy of research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4 Taxonomy of Literature on Android Security</head><p>Two major directions can be recognized in existing studies on the current security model of Android <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. Some researchers focus on the protection mechanisms while others analyse the apps themselves. When it comes to the Android security model, one of the most obvious and common targets for research studies is the permissions system. Researchers have covered several aspects related to permissions. Few works have explained the permission system <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>, while others have analysed them <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. Other studies have questioned their effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35]</ref>, and also their usability <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref>. Yet, further research proposed improvements to the permission system itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. In addition, research on permissions includes attempts to guide developers on how to request the right permissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> as well as guidelines for platform designers <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>.</p><p>One of the most infamous attacks on the Android platform is the privilege escalation attack.

Apps might leak users' sensitive data unintentionally. This type of apps is sometimes referred to as grayware. Techniques to protect privacy were addressed by many research works. One of the most common techniques is the concept of information-flow tracking. In this technique, private data are tainted and then traced throughout its flow in the app. The flow is logged and possibly blocked whenever a labelled object moves from a private domain to a public domain (e.g., transferred out through the network). A famous implementation of this type of techniques is TaintDroid <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>.

Several studies proposed enhancements to extend the current platform in the form of new frameworks. Those enhancements aimed to improve several aspects of the system's security and the user's privacy. For example, Saint <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> proposes a framework to control grants of install-time permissions and the use of those granted permission during runtime, all according to a policy dictated by the app developer. Other frameworks that enhance runtime policy include Apex <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, Aurasium <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref> and AppGuard <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>.</p><p>Another way to improve Android security is to provide context-aware privacy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Threats to mHealth Apps</head><p>Although mHealth apps provide a lot of benefits and easy access to healthcare services, they are loaded with new security and privacy risks to mHealth app user [3, <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">132,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">133]</ref>. Smartphone apps for healthcare are rapidly increasing. There are several types of mHealth apps, some are using external devices such as medical sensors, and some apps are using smartphone resources, such as the camera for the treatment of the patient. Recently, several studies showed that lack of standardization, guidelines, security and privacy of user data are the main barrier to the widespread use of mHealth apps, and these issues should be addressed in order to improve mHealth apps reliability and usability <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>. The market of mHealth apps is nevertheless growing rapidly; hence, health data are also increasing. Privacy and security of sensitive medical data could be significantly affected by this new trend of treatment of the patient. mHealth apps handle sensitive medical data for patients and healthcare professionals, and those data are as sensitive as those handled by HIPAA entities, but mHealth apps handle the data using lower assurance than HIPPA entities. There is a need to develop frameworks and guidelines for mHealth apps to ensure the security and privacy of health data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. Android mHealth apps use third party servers and unsecured Internet communication which have raised the security and privacy concerns. He et al (2014) revealed that several mHealth apps send information over the Internet without encryption and put sensitive information into logs. Numerous apps have component exposure threats, and some apps store unencrypted information on an external storage, e.g., SD Card, where a malicious app can read them. Several mHealth apps use Bluetooth in order to collect data from health or medical sensors. In fact, Bluetooth play a major role for communication in sensor-based health monitoring systems; mHealth apps collect numerous types of health information from Bluetooth, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, pulse oximetry, respiration, blood pressure, body temperature, body weight, exercise activities and quality of sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. mHealth apps store various type of information without encryption, including but not limited to, mobile users' name, date of birth, country, preferred language(s), culture preference(s), insurance carrier identifier, personal app identifier, medications, medical conditions, physician(s), and pharmacies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. mHealth apps are different from other health information systems from various perspectives. First, mHealth apps collect large amount of data from patient because mobile devices are always with the patient and can collect data for a long time. Second, mHealth apps collect much broader range of data, which include not only physiological data, but also include the patient activities, location, lifestyle, social interactions, diet details, eating habits and so on. Third, the nature of communication between the patient and healthcare professionals is different <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. These aspects imposed new security and privacy threats to mHealth information systems. There are several potential attack surfaces in Android system that a malicious party can use to gain unauthorized access to sensitive medical data in mHealth apps. A recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> stated seven attack surfaces that need protection: Third Party Services, Internet, Logging, Bluetooth, SD Card Storage, Side Channels and Exported Components. mHealth apps in Google Play usually send sensitive medical data in plain text and store them on third party servers whose confidentiality rules are not sufficient for this type of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> lists the seven attack surfaces that a malicious party can use to access sensitive medical data. Developers can view and collect debugging output of apps from Android logging system; therefore, a malicious app with READ_LOGS permission may access sensitive information from log messages. A malicious app with WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE or READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions can write or read files from external storages, such as SD card <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. Android app developers can declare a component as public or exported; if a component is declared as exported, then a malicious app can send unwanted intents to the component. Furthermore, if a content provider is declared as exported or public, this enables malcious apps to write or read the exported content provider without any permission <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. A malicious party can also use side channels to get sensitive information from mHealth apps in the Android operating system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Side Channel</head><p>Sensitive information can be inferred by a malicious app with side channels, e.g. network package size, sequence, timing, etc.</p><p>He, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> identified another problem. Developers usually put sensitive information into HTTPS URLs for secure transmission of data. However, even though this information is not visible during transmission, it is still visible in other places, such as server logs, mobile app logs, browser history and so on. It may be difficult to identify or control who is accessing the logs. Mitchell et al (2013) used forensic analysis and testing to prove that current mHealth apps lack adequate privacy and security controls. The authors revealed that several apps store unencrypted personal information on the smartphone itself. The log files show plain text instead of encrypted text from top-downloaded app. These issues are more important for mHealth apps that store personal health information (PHI) or electronic health records (EHR) and exchange that data with health-related websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. Data security, access control and confidentiality are the main security issues in mHealth apps that must be addressed in order to use these apps in healthcare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134]</ref>. Security standards have not yet been fully implemented by OS developers, app programmers, device manufacturers or the different levels of government agencies; therefore, it is very easy for malicious parties to get access to user data collected by mHealth apps. OS manufacturers commonly hide information relating to data security and data collection policies inside the tens of pages of legalese presented to end users and they usually click "Agree" without reading it <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. McCarthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> reported that most of the users' data are poorly protected in mHealth apps. The author also reported that in a technical analysis study of 43 health and fitness apps, only 60% of the paid apps and 74% of the free apps had a privacy policy, and it is accessible either on the developer's website or in the app. However, only 48% of the paid apps and 25% of the free apps informed users about the privacy policy. In addition, none of the free apps and just one of the paid apps encrypted all the communications sent from the device to the developer. The data without encryption in mHealth apps pose a serious threat to users' data privacy. Adhikari, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> performed analysis on 20 most popular mHealth apps and highlighted the various security concerns. In brief, the serious risks to users' data are insufficient security measures, lack of users' authentication, sharing of information with third party, and lack of users' knowledge about the app. Nowadays, users can easily enhance the functionalities of their smartphones by connecting them to external devices, such as medical devices, sensors and credit card readers, which allow them to use smartphones in various application domains such as healthcare information systems and retail stores. However, this new development is not accompanied by a corresponding levels of protection; indeed, if an app has permission to use communication channels like Near Field Communication (NFC) and Bluetooth, then it can easily access the devices that communicate with the smartphone on these channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. Android's permissions and sandbox security model mainly protect local resources, such as SDcard, GPS, etc. Each of these resources is protected through one or more permissions, and can only be accessed by Android apps that have appropriate permissions to use particular resources. On the other side, no permissions are allocated to an external device; however, android can only control channels that links smartphone to external device, such as NFC, Bluetooth, Audio port, etc. The main problem here is that many external devices share the same channel in order to communicate with smartphone and many apps also claim the permission to use that channel for different purposes. Consequently, it is very difficult to control unauthorized access on external devices in the presence of those insiders (unauthorized apps that has permission to use the device's communication channel). Naveed, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> revealed this new security issue for Android devices called as External Device Mis-Bonding (DMB). A malicious app using DMB attack can surreptitiously collect patient's data from an Android device or spoof a device and inject fake data into the original device's medical app. In data-stealing attack, a malicious app with Bluetooth permission can surreptitiously downlaod a patient's sensitive data from external devices without being noticed, using side-channel infromation to find the right moment for download. In data-injection attack, a malicious app with Bluetooth permission can collect the pairing information of an authorized device and reset the link key, and it can pair with a malicious device to inject fake medical data into the original device's official app. In fact, Bluetooth secure communcation is designed for protecting device to device communication, not to protect communcation between a device and an app <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. External devices may not develop their own authentication systems because these are simple sensors and usually do not have much resources to ensure authentication. Some of the most common threats to mHealth apps are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>. Those threats include: (1) identity threats: misuse of patient identity information (PII);</p><p>(2) Access threats: unauthorized access to personal health information (PHI) or personal health records (PHR); and (3) Disclosure threats: unauthorized disclosure of PII or PHI. [Plachkinova, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>] report the various types of threats that mHealth app are posing to users. A taxonomy of mHealth apps with respect to security and privacy is proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>, and it has three dimensions, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">5</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6</ref> depicts the proposed taxonomy based on the model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">5</ref>. Details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">An Empirical Assessment of mHealth Apps' Security</head><p>To gain a first-hand experience with the security and privacy of mHealth apps, we conducted an assessment experiment on mHealth apps. A sample of 100 mHealth apps has been selected, downloaded, and inspected to identify possible security and privacy issues. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref> presents the results of this experiment, summarising the issues that have been found on the sample mHealth apps. During the experiment, it was observed that a lot of apps were disclosing the user data (73 out of 100). Only 11 apps out of 100 were accessing the external devices, and when checked against DMB attacks (for both data injection and data stealing DMB attacks), not a single app was able to defend against DMB attacks. Furthermore, 53 apps were a source for a malicious app to perform privileges escalation attacks. Only 7 apps were using the encryption to secure user data. Some apps were accessing user information that was not necessary at all to fulfil their functionalities. Only, 45 percent of the apps were using authentication to secure user information. Among these 100 apps, 73 were detected to be leaking the private information. Most of those apps request to access the location, contacts, call logs, phone identity, camera, account information and Bluetooth. Among the 73 apps, 48 apps leak the location information, 43 apps send the IMEI number, and 24 apps leak both IMEI number and location information. Although 32 apps are accessing the contacts, most of them do not need contacts to perform their functions. Further, 21 apps have permission to access Bluetooth, which can cause DMB attack.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Existing Solutions for mHealth Apps' Security</head><p>Attempting to resolve security issues in mHealth apps is the focus of this paper. This section presents the most related proposals in the literature, which attempt to address the problems of security and privacy for mHealth apps. It is notable that the number of existing proposals is small, despite the importance of the topic. Below is a listing of those works. A policy framework is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, which includes the following guidelines to improve the security and privacy for mHealth apps:</p><p>• CONTEXT: Provide details about the applications, its capabilities and limitations, and its use of patient information. • MINIMIZATION: Minimize the amount of information that is collected from/about the patient.</p><p>• INFORMED CONSENT/AWARE-PATIENT: The patient should be made aware of how the information will be used and has been used by the application. A more aware patient is likely to make better decisions about trade-offs involving information privacy-security and healthcare benefits.</p><p>• OWNERSHIP: The ownership of the information should be well defined meaning who owns the user data even in anonymous form. • DELETION-AFTER-DEACTIVATION: If a patient has deactivated an application, all information about/from the patient should be deleted.</p><p>• SECURE STORAGE: The information should be kept securely at device, server or cloud. To reduce transmission over wireless networks, information that is subject to change can be stored locally, while more static information can be kept at a server. • END-TO-END: Various weak points in the end-to-end security should be identified and efforts be made to correct these weaknesses in applications, devices, operating</p><p>This policy is a set of guidelines to follow for the developers and users. These recommendations were developed based on the results of conducting a physical forensics analysis of several widely used mHealth applications. Another security and privacy solution for mHealth apps was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. Again, the authors proposed a set of recommendations to consumers and mHealth app developers that can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. The proposed guidelines are based on a comparative analysis of the 20 most popular mHealth apps at the time of publication. The aim of the analysis was to identify risk and safe features that can help consumers select safe mHealth apps and aid developers in building mHealth apps with appropriate security and privacy measures. Sensitive consumers' information should always be stored encrypted so that attackers cannot simply retrieve this data off of the file system. Try to use apps without entering personal information if permitted Apps should be designed to help patients through the evolution of a disease and provide recommendations Look for user reviews and the privacy policy of an app, either through the app store or online.</p><p>Include user authentication. Provide options so user can safely retrieve their login details if forgotten. Only 10% or 2 apps out of 20 apps ask for user authentication prior to login. Remove data when usage stopped. This may prevent unauthorised use of stored data when consumers no longer use the apps.</p><p>Minimise sharing information with third parties or advertisers and ask users to confirm agreement before sharing. 65% or 13 apps shared consumers' information to third parties or advertisers. Give feedback on product: Users' feedback on the features, privacy and policy, and functions of an app will help the developers to restructure the app appropriately.</p><p>Apps should allow consumers to delete their personal information completely. According to the analysis only 5% or 1 apps mentioned in its privacy policy that consumers can delete information completely therefore this criterion need to be improved appropriately. Provide user with information about the implementation of security measures and authentication and what how/where their data is stored.</p><p>On a more technical level, a static taint-analysis framework was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>, which is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Static taint analysis works by analysing tainted data flows through Android apps and sending outputs to human analysts or to automated tools which can make security decisions. Again, in this research, the author also proposed some recommendations, listed below:</p><p>• Encryption is essential to secure personal data stored on mobile devices.</p><p>• When accessing web-based services for syncing users' sensitive data, TLS/SSL is necessary to be deployed throughout the Internet transmission session. • Even though the network transmission session is protected and encrypted, using third party services to store users' sensitive data must be closely reviewed and users should be informed when it is happening.</p><p>• Developer guidelines or training can be helpful in avoiding many of the common mistakes that are rooted from development with poor secure practices. • Risk assessment provided by authorities can further minimize the security risks that may harm users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 8: Static Analysis System Design Framework</head><p>In conclusion, there is no comprehensive solution for mHealth apps to address their security and privacy issues. Most of the research work in the literature just proposed some recommendations and guidelines for the developers and users of mHealth apps. This paper, on the other hand, is proposing a practical framework for mHealth apps that protects the mHealth apps efficiently and effectively. The research in this study does not ignore previous works, however, as building an effective solution involves a range of functions and techniques that can be beyond the capabilities of a single project. For example, the taint-analysis system in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> is employed in this paper as part of the proposed framework to provide static taint analysis of target mHealth apps.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Issues in Android Security</head><p>A key component of the Android security model is the permission system that controls the access to sensitive device resources by third-party apps. However, Android's permission control mechanism has been proven ineffective to protect user's privacy and resource from malicious apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. Further, it has been shown that the majority of smartphone apps attempt to collect data that are not required for the main function of the app <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">140]</ref>. Reasons for the drawbacks of the existing permission system include users inexperience with realizing irrelevant resource requests and their urge to use the app even at the expense of compromising their privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36]</ref>. Further, vulnerabilities in Android kernel can be exploited to obtain access to resources or services that are by default protected from an app or a user. This type of attack is called privilege escalation attack and it enables unauthorized apps to perform actions with more privileges than they have been granted. This, in turn, leads to unauthorized access to user data and many sensitive information leakages. It is also possible to exploit Android exported (i.e. public) components an obtain access to critical permissions, and hence, to sensitive resources and information <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>. There is also the threat of colluding apps, where several apps are developed by the same developer, and therefore released under the same certificate. Users install theses apps, some of which are granted sensitive permissions and others are granted normal ones. Afterwards, each of these apps gets access to the combined pool of their permissions and resources because they are all assigned the same UID <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">141]</ref>. Android platform lacks a configurable, runtime ICC control. This was a design decision to fulfil several purposes. The first purpose is to prevent an app from accessing any open interfaces of another app, even if the former had obtained the required permissions at its install time <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142]</ref>. The second objective is to prevent an app from intercepting an intent broadcast, and possibly stopping its propagation afterward <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142]</ref>. By intercepting system-event broadcasts, a malicious app is able to intercept important system events stealthily, which contain sensitive information, such as an incoming call or SMS. A third purpose is to isolate apps and prevent them from communicating via ICC and other shared channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">143]</ref>. However, this lack of runtime inter-app access control can lead to data leakage and confused deputy problems. The presently uncontrolled ICC among apps in Android can be exploited by colluding apps. Moreover, an Android device has several identifiers that can be used as a unique device ID, such as IMEI, Android system ID, or hardware serial number <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>. As Android devices are prone to information leakage, if this device ID is also leaked, external parties can track the user easily. Even outside the Android middleware, there exist potential security weaknesses that could compromise the security of an Android device. In particular, potential security weaknesses or vulnerabilities can be located at the Linux kernel and its native libraries <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">144]</ref>. Also, weaknesses and vulnerabilities can be associated with device manufacturers' customization and preinstalled apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">145,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">146]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Issues in Mobile Health Applications on Android Platform</head><p>Using smartphone apps in the delivery of healthcare is rapidly proliferating. mHealth apps have several potentials that drive this popularity, including the ability to increase patient satisfaction, improve doctor efficiency, and reduce the cost of healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>. There is still no regulatory protection for mHealth apps similar to that available for traditional health sectors, including PC-based electronic health. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) is not yet widely applied to mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to apply its regulatory oversight to only those apps that turn smartphones into medical devices and whose functionality can pose risk to patients' safety if not functioning as intended, which is only a subset of all mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>. Several recent studies showed that the lack of standardization, guidelines, security and privacy of user data are the main barriers to the widespread use of mHealth apps <ref type="bibr">[8-10, 134, 135]</ref>. mHealth apps face the usual security challenges of enforcing confidentiality, integrity, and availability via authentication, authorization, and access control <ref type="bibr">[8-10, 134, 149]</ref>. Such protection is necessary to facilitate the adoption of these apps by the healthcare system. Users of mHealth apps are also susceptible to privacy threats, such as identity theft, disclosure threats, privilege escalation attacks and side channel threats, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138]</ref>. Leakage of information is a major challenge for mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>, where these apps may leak information in numerous ways. For example, apps usually declare their components as public <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, so malicious apps can easily access their information. Besides, apps usually store unencrypted data on smartphone external storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">137]</ref>, so any app that has the permission to access external storage can easily access the user's data. Usage of third party services and sharing of information with social networks or other third parties are also raising threats to mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">149]</ref>. In addition, mHealth apps use external devices to enhance the functionality of the phone. These devices also impose serious threats to users data, such as external-Device MisBonding (DMB) attacks that include data-stealing and data-injection attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, since Android permission system does not provide permission-based protection for external devices and sensors. Existing smartphone operating systems, particularly Android, are not sufficient to ensure privacy and security of users' data, particularly in the case of mHealth apps. One major issue in the security model of Android is that the permission mechanism is too coarse-grained and the user might not be aware of the full implications when granting permissions to apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. Based on the above facts, there is a need for a better solution to protect the security of mHealth apps, and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their data. Data associated with mHealth apps are particularly of sensitive nature, and unauthorized leakage or manipulation of these data do not only threaten the privacy of the patients, but might threaten their health or even lives. The intended protection is two-way; meaning it protects the mHealth app and its corresponding data from potential threats on the system, and also protects the system and its resources from installed mHealth apps that can unintentionally or otherwise bring new threats by means of poor design, or ill will. The focus of this article is to propose such a solution in the form of a security framework for mHealth apps on Android platform. The proposed framework ought to address the aforementioned security and privacy issues on Android, with a special focus on threats associated with mHealth apps, such as the revealed vulnerabilities in literature, including information leakage; and the published attacks, such as DMB, privilege escalation, and side-channel attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>This section outlines the general methodology proposed in this study. The proposed methodology divided into three distinct and successive phases, each of which are described in a separate section, starting from the design process of the framework (Section 4.1), followed by the implementation of a prototypic proof-of-concept version of the framework (Section 4.2), and finally ending with the evaluation process (4.3). The overall proposed methodology is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">9</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Phase I: Framework Design</head><p>The main goal of this article is to propose a security framework for mHealth apps to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive medical data. Based on the finding of the literature in the previous section, several specifications have shaped out to constitute the desired framework, considering the security issues of mHealth apps and the limited resources of mobile devices. First of all, the requirements of the security framework have been identified, which led to design a number of components that are necessary to implement the required functions, including the performance of security checks against installed apps, information leakage, malware, device connections, and similar cases. To orchestrate all those functions, there is a need for a core component to administer the checks, and take proper decisions probably based on a repository of security policies. The said components form the core of the intended framework, and were grouped in a single layer named as the Security Module Layer (SML). Crucial to the operation of this layer is to have a low-level access as an entry point into the internals of the underpinning Android platform, in terms of reference monitors and hooks onto the various levels of the kernel, middleware as well as the application level. To keep the design modular, the task of interfacing the SML to the mobile operating system should be delegated to another layer of the framework called the System Interface Layer (SIL). This layer should be adopted from a previous research work that was leveraged to provide the necessary foundation for SML. According to this reasoning during the design process, the SML is required to do all the compulsory security functions and SIL is required to work as an integration layer between SML and the Android OS in order to make SML functional. The resulting overall design was named as MHealth Apps Security Framework (MASF). MASF mitigates various security and privacy threats facing by mHealth apps, such as data leakage, privileges escalation attacks, DMB attacks, and misuse of granted permissions to apps. Furthermore, to protect sensitive medical data and mHealth apps from different attacks, MASF provides several mechanisms that includes fine-grained access control, context-aware access control, and it further provides data shadowing mechanism to protect user private information by providing fake versions of the requested data when deemed necessary by the framework. MASF also enables the users to define their own policies according to their requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Phase II: Prototype Implementation</head><p>The implementation of MASF encompasses the two layers designed in the previous phase; i.e. SML and SIL. SML comprises a number of software modules that correspond to the various required security functions, each of which can run in the user mode. Besides, it also implements a database utility to store security policies, should be implemented in Android as a SQLite local database. In addition of implementing their own logic, several such modules need to call special API functions to access the internals of the Android platform in order to interfere with the normal operation of the system. In other words, those security modules need to be integrated into Android. An integration framework should be adopted from literature to work as the SIL; this helped in interfacing SML to the Android OS. SIL provides a platform that makes possible the monitoring of various references and actions made by mHealth apps, performing different security checks and also the enforcement of the security policies. Afterwards, the new framework based on both SML and SIL should be compiled together within the Android source code into a custom Android copy, which should subsequently be deployed on a real phone. During this process the following tools should be used: Java programming language, a development station, a development IDE and an Android smartphone. The following steps describe the implementation of the framework prototype:</p><p>1. A distribution of the Linux operating system (Ubuntu 14.04) should be installed to establish an environment to download and install the stock Android source code. 2. The source code of the stock Android operating system, version 4.3, should be downloaded from http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html. 3. To enforce security checks and hooks, MASF needs an integration layer into the Android source, which should be provided by the System Interface Layer. SIL should be adopted from another framework in the literature called ASF, and SIL patches should be installed into source code of Android 4.3. 4. MASF should be programmed according to the proposed design, and then should be installed onto the modified source code of Android. 5. Thereafter, this customize source code should be compiled and installed into a real Android device.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Phase III: Evaluation</head><p>In this phase, MASF should be evaluated and analysed in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness of this framework should be evaluated by demonstrating that the framework can successfully protect the security and privacy of mHealth apps and its users. To check the effectiveness, a sample of mHealth apps should be tested against the various attacks. Furthermore, a number of experiments should be conducted to evaluate functioning of MASF, such as to test effectiveness of MASF against different attacks, test against malwares, impact of data shadowing, impact of permission restrictions, impact of disabling intents, and impact of enabling/disabling system peripherals. Subsequently, false positive and usability test should also perform on Android customised with MASF. On the other hand, the efficiency of MASF should be evaluated by examining the performance overhead on the underlying Android system during the operation of the framework. To check the performance overhead, the following metrics should be measured: CPU utilization, memory usage, and energy consumption. Several experiments should be conducted to evaluate the performance of MASF. Due to the lack of publicly available implementations of similar frameworks, the results of MASF's performance evaluation should be compared to those obtained out of stock Android versions. The performance of mainstream Android copies is considered as a baseline against which the impact of the proposed framework's impact on the system should be measured. Therefore, the CPU time, memory usage and energy consumption of Android apps on a stock version (without MASF) are considered as the reference of measurement for the apps performance after installing MASF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>A conceptual framework is presented for the security of mobile health applications on android platform. As such, two major issues were covered in this paper: First, a brief background on the Android platform architecture and its security model, as the main target platform in the study.
