<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper is concerned with the ultimate boundedness control problem for a class of networked nonlinear systems subject to the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocol scheduling and uniform quantization effects. To prevent the transmission data from collisions, the communication between sensor nodes and the controller is implemented via a constrained communication channel, where only one sensor node is permitted to transmit data at each time instant. The TOD protocol is utilized to regulate the signal transmission over the communication network under which the scheduling behavior is described by a special switching function. On the other hand, the uniform quantization effects of the network are characterized by a round function (i.e. the nearest integer function). The purpose of the addressed problem is to design an observer-based controller for the networked nonlinear systems such that, in the presence of TOD protocol and uniform quantization effects, the closed-loop system is ultimately bounded and the controlled output is locally minimized. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the dynamics of the closed-loop system in mean square by applying the stochastic analysis approach. Furthermore, the desired controller gains are derived by solving a convex optimization problem.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The past two decades have witnessed a great deal of research attention devoted to networked control systems (NCSs). In an NCS, data exchange between different system components. e.g. sensors, actuators and controllers, is implemented through the shared communication networks instead of the pointto-point communication. The utilization of communication networks brings several advantages including low cost, simple installation, reduced hardwire and high reliability. Nevertheless, the networked-induced issues arise inevitably which could degrade the system performance. Such networked-induced issues include, but are not limited to, packet dropouts, communication delays, quantization effects and fading channels. Accordingly, the control and filtering problems of NCSs subject to various networked-induced phenomena have gained considerable research interest and a wealth of literature has appeared on these topics, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Among various networked-induced phenomena, signal quantization is regarded as an important source which has significant impact on the performance of the networked system. So far, the control and filtering problems of NCSs with quantization effects have attracted an ongoing research interest, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. There are generally two kinds of popular modeling methods for the quantization phenomenon that have been adopted in the literature, namely, the uniform quantization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the logarithmic quantization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which belong to the fixed-point quantization and the floating-point quantization, respectively. From a practical point of view, because of the wide utilization of the fixed-point-number scheme in both hardware and software implementations, the uniform quantization scheme is more widely used in networked systems. By now, some effort has been made towards the control and filtering problems for networked systems with uniform quantization effects, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the references therein.</p><p>On the other hand, the communication constraints induced by the underlying protocol would also significantly affect the performance of the networked system. The widely utilized communication protocols in industry include the Round-Robin (RR) protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and the stochastic communication protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Among these communication protocols, the TOD protocol is of particular interest to researchers since its properties can be characterized by quadratic functions and this makes it feasible to seamlessly incorporate the corresponding scheduling behaviors into Lyapunov-theory-based designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The TOD protocol was first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the stability condition for an NCS has been given with either the RR protocol or the TOD protocol. Furthermore, it has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, via experiments, that the TOD protocol could be realized in the Controller Area Network (CAN). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the stability for a class of NCSs has been studied subject to the time-varying transmission intervals, time-varying transmission delays and communication protocols, e.g. the RR protocol and the TOD protocol.</p><p>In response to the above discussion, a seemingly interesting research problem is to investigate the ultimate boundedness control problem for the networked nonlinear systems subject to the TOD scheduling and uniform quantization effects owing to its clear engineering insight in both control and communication areas. Nevertheless, this is a non-trivial problem with two challenges identified as follows: 1) how to develop an approach to analyze the boundedness of the TOD-constrained NCS with uniform quantization effects? and 2) how to obtain the sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired controllers? It is, therefore, the main purpose of this paper to offer satisfactory answers to the two questions. In this paper, we aim to study the ultimate boundedness control problem for a class of networked nonlinear systems with the TOD protocol and uniform quantization effects. More specifically, the objective of this paper is to design a nonlinear-observer-based controller for the networked system subject to the uniform quantization effects and TOD scheduling such that the dynamics of the closed-loop system is ultimately bounded in mean square. The main contributions of this paper are highlighted as follows. 1) The ultimate boundedness control problem is, for the first time, investigated for networked nonlinear systems with the TOD scheduling. 2) A novel framework is developed to deal with the ultimate boundedness control problem subject to the TOD scheduling, which is effective to incorporate the scheduling behavior into the boundedness analysis issue. 3) The controller gains are derived in the sense of minimizing the asymptotic upper bound of the controlled output in mean square.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the networked nonlinear system with the TOD scheduling and uniform quantization effects is introduced and the nonlinear-observer-based controller is proposed. In Section III, the ultimate boundedness control issue of the closed-loop system is studied based on the stochastic analysis approach. Furthermore, the required controller gain matrices are obtained by solving a minimization problem subject to some matrix inequality constraints. In Section IV, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by a numerical simulation example. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.</p><p>Notations: The notation used here is fairly standard. R n and R n×m denote, respectively, the n dimensional Euclidean space and set of all n × m real matrices. N (N + , N -) denote, respectively, the set of integers (nonnegative integers, negative integers). The notation X ≥ Y (X &gt; Y ), where X and Y are real symmetric matrices, means that X -Y is positive semidefinite (positive definite). If A is a matrix, A T represents the transpose of A. tr{A} represents the trace of A. 0 represents zero matrix. The n-dimensional identity matrix is denoted as I n or simply I, if no confusion is caused. The shorthand diag{• • • } stands for a block-diagonal matrix. E{x} and E{x|y} will, respectively, denote expectation of the stochastic variable x and expectation of x conditional on y. Given a vector x, x refers to the Euclidean norm of x and, for a given positive definite matrix P , x P denotes the weighted norm of x: x P √ x T P x. In symmetric block matrices, " * " is used as an ellipsis for terms induced by symmetry. Matrices, if they are not explicitly specified, are assumed to have compatible dimensions. The Kronecker delta function δ(a) is a binary function that equals 1 if a = 0 and equals 0 otherwise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The system model</head><p>Consider an NCS shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where the signal transmission between the sensors and controller is implemented via a network with certain network-induced effect. In the following, we introduce the plant, communication network and the controller in the state space. The plant shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is a nonlinear system of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">     x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + f (Gx(k)) + Bu(k) + Eω(k) y(k) = Cx(k) + Dω(k) z(k) = M x(k) (1)</formula><p>where x(k) ∈ R nx , u(k) ∈ R nu , y(k) ∈ R ny and z(k) ∈ R nz are, respectively, the state vector, control input, measurement output before transmitted through the communication network, and the output vector to be controlled. ω(k) ∈ R nω is the disturbance noise with zero-mean and known variance R = R RT ≥ 0. f (•) is a nonlinear vector-valued function satisfying certain condition to be given later. A, B, C, D, E, G and M are constant matrices of appropriate dimensions.</p><p>Assumption 1: The nonlinear function f (•) satisfies f (0) = 0 and the following condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f (x) -f (z) ≤ F (x -z)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the matrix F is a real matrix of appropriate dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Description of the communication network</head><p>We discuss the effects induced by the communication network. In this paper, two network-induced constraints are considered, namely the TOD protocol scheduling and uniform quantization effects. Without loss of generality, we first assume that the sensors of the plant are grouped into N (N &gt; 1) sensor nodes according to their spatial distribution. As such, for technical analysis, the measurement output y N (k) can be rewritten as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y(k) = y T 1 (k) y T 2 (k) • • • y T N (k) T<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y i (k) (i ∈ {1, 2, • • • , N })</formula><p>is the measurement of the i-th sensor node before transmitted. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the signal transmitted through the network is quantized first and then scheduled by the communication network subject to the communication protocol. First, we introduce the quantization effects of the network. Let the quantized measurement be y(k)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y T 1 (k) y T 2 (k) • • • y T N (k) T .</formula><p>In this paper, the signal would be quantized by an uniform quantizer Q(•) when it is transmitted via a communication network. Suppose the saturation level of quantization is sufficiently large. Hence, the uniform quantizer could be written as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y(k) = Q(y(k)) =      εR(y (1) (k)/ε) εR(y (2) (k)/ε) . . . εR(y (ny) (k)/ε)      (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where ε is called the quantizing level. y (i) (k) denotes the ith element of the vector y(k). The function R(•) rounds a number to the nearest integer. Let ∆(k) Q(y(k)) -y(k) be the quantization error. Hence, it is easy to see that</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆(k) ∞ ≤ ε/2.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Next, we shall introduce the effects induced the communication protocol scheduling. In the considered networked system, the TOD protocol is utilized to schedule the signal transmission between sensors and the controller. In networked communication circumstances, communication protocols are always employed to determine which node (or nodes) obtains access to the network at each time instant. The main idea of the protocol scheduling considered in this paper is that only one sensor node is permitted to send data via the communication network at each transmission instant. Let ξ(k) ∈ {1, 2, • • • , M } denote the selected sensor node obtaining access to the communication network at time instant k. Then, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, due to the scheduling of the TOD protocol, ξ(k) can be characterized by the following selection principle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ξ(k) arg max 1≤i≤N y i (k) -ȳi (k -1) 2 Qi (6)</formula><p>where ȳi (k -1) represents the previously transmitted signal before time instant k (excluding k) associating with the sensor node i, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Q i (i ∈ {1, 2, • • • , N })</formula><p>is a known positive definite matrix denoting the weight matrix of the i-th sensor node.</p><p>By defining</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q diag Q 1 , Q 2 , • • • , Q N and ȳ(k - 1) ȳT 1 (k -1) ȳT 2 (k -1) • • • ȳT N (k -1)</formula><p>T , the selection principle (6) could be rewritten as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ξ(k) = arg max 1≤i≤N y(k) -ȳ(k -1) 2 QΦi (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Φ i = diag δ(i -1)I, δ(i -2)I, • • • , δ(i -N )I (i ∈ {1, 2, • • • , N }) and δ(•) ∈ {0, 1} is the Kronecker delta function.</formula><p>According to the definition of ȳ(k -1), it is easy to see that</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ȳ(k) = Φ ξ(k) y(k) + I -Φ ξ(k) ȳ(k -1)<label>(8)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The nonlinear-observer-based controller</head><p>Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we adopt the following nonlinear-observerbased control scheme for the networked system (1) subject to the TOD scheduling and uniform quantization effects:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">     x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + f Gx(k) + L 2,ξ(k) (ȳ(k) -C x(k)) + Bu(k) + L 1,ξ(k) (ȳ(k) -C x(k)) u(k) = K ξ(k) x(k)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where x(k) ∈ R nx is the state estimate of the system (1), and the matrices L 1,ξ(k) , L 2,ξ(k) and K ξ(k) are controller parameters to be designed.</p><p>Let the observer error be e(k) x(k) -x(k).

It can be observed that the controller design scheme established in this paper could be specialized to the design of Luenberger-observer-based controller by setting L 2,i = 0 (1 ≤ i ≤ N ). In such a case, the minimum value of ρ would be larger than that obtained in Corollary 1. In other words, the nonlinear-observer-based control scheme could provide a better performance with a smaller asymptotic upper bound of E{ z(k) 2 } as compared with the Luenbergerobserver-based control.</p></div>

The nonlinear function is taken to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">f (x(k)) = 0.1 sin(2x 1 (k)) sin(2.2x 2 (k))</formula><p>with which the matrices F and G could be selected as F = 0.1I and G = diag{2, 2.2}, respectively. The variance of the disturbance noise is R = 0.49I. Set the decay rate be 0.99 (i.e. θ = 0.01). Then, according to Corollary 1, the minimization problem (34) can be solved via the Matlab software (YALMIP 3.0). The controller gain matrices are derived as follows: Set the simulation run length to be 160 and let the initial state be x(0) = <ref type="bibr">20 12</ref> T . Based on the derived controller parameters, numerical simulation results is given in Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> plots the state trajectories of the open-loop and closed-loop system. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the selected sensor node obtaining access to the communication network under the TOD scheduling. It can be observed from the state trajectories of the open-loop system that the plant under consideration is an unstable system. By employing our designed controller with the above derived parameters, the state trajectories would eventually enter an ultimate boundedness region. The simulation results have confirmed that the designed ultimate boundedness controller performs very well. For the purpose of examining the advantages of our proposed control scheme compared with the Luenberger-observer-based control scheme, we shall provide a simulation comparison between these two control approaches subject to different variance of the noise. Simulation results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>, where ρ1 and ρ2 represent the minimum of ρ under the nonlinear-observer-based control and the Luenberger-observer-based control, respectively. It can be seen that our developed control method performs better than the Luenberger-observer-based control method.   </p><formula xml:id="formula_61">K 1 = -0.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The ultimate boundedness control problem has been addressed for a class of networked nonlinear systems subject to the so-called TOD protocol scheduling and uniform quantization effects. The communication between sensor nodes and the controller is implemented via a constraint network under which only one node is allowed to send data at each time instant. The TOD protocol has been employed to determine which node obtains access to the network. A novel nonlinearobserver-based controller has been presented to guarantee that the dynamics of the closed-loop system is ultimately bounded in mean square subject to the disturbance noise and the quantization error. The simulation example has been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design scheme. Further research topics include the extension of the main results to the fault estimation/filtering problem (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) subject to communication protocol scheduling.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Structure of the control system with a communication network</figDesc><graphic coords="2,315.00,231.67,241.60,93.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
