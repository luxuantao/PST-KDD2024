<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we propose a new method for generating synthetic handwritten signature images for biometric applications. The procedures we introduce imitate the mechanism of motor equivalence which divides human handwriting into two steps: the working out of an effector independent action plan and its execution via the corresponding neuromuscular path. The action plan is represented as a trajectory on a spatial grid. This contains both the signature text and its flourish, if there is one. The neuromuscular path is simulated by applying a kinematic Kaiser filter to the trajectory plan. The length of the filter depends on the pen speed which is generated using a scalar version of the sigma lognormal model. An ink deposition model, applied pixel by pixel to the pen trajectory, provides realistic static signature images. The lexical and morphological properties of the synthesized signatures as well as the range of the synthesis parameters have been estimated from real databases of real signatures such as the MCYT Off-line and the GPDS960GraySignature corpuses. The performance experiments show that by tuning only four parameters it is possible to generate synthetic identities with different stability and forgers with different skills. Therefore it is possible to create datasets of synthetic signatures with a performance similar to databases of real signatures. Moreover, we can customize the created dataset to produce skilled forgeries or simple forgeries which are easier to detect, depending on what the researcher needs. Perceptual evaluation gives an average confusion of 44.06% between real and synthetic signatures which shows the realism of the synthetic ones. The utility of the synthesized signatures is demonstrated by studying the influence of the pen type and number of users on an automatic signature verifier.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>HE use of biometric traits has become well-established in commerce and forensics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The most commonly used traits for identification or verification are the face <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the fingerprint <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and the iris <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Among the most challenging biometrics are those related to human behavior because of their unpredictable variability. It is wellestablished that during the early stages of development the human neuromotor system learns a way of writing, walking, key stroking, etc. that contains a sort of 'water mark' for the person's identity. This water mark is difficult to imitate or disguise by a forger because of the differences between individuals' neuromuscular systems. This therefore gives a theoretical advantage to these behavioral biometrics. It is, however, enormously difficult to detect and characterize this water mark. This is because of both the relatively few samples generally available and the inherent variability of human behavior. This can change not only for psychological reasons but also because of the adaptation of different postures, the wearing of different dress, the use of different writing tools and for other unaccountable factors.</p><p>In a behavioral biometric such as the handwritten signature, research nowadays tends to focus on improving recognition accuracy, although topics such as interoperability, standards, scalability and template protection are also gaining attention. Obtaining statistically reliable performance evaluation is not only time consuming and expensive but also requires the availability of large databases and common benchmarks. Well-established experimental protocols and benchmarks alleviate some of the drawbacks in performance evaluation. Several standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, databases (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>[8] <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) and competitions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) have been developed for this purpose. Additionally, legal issues regarding data protection hamper the sharing and distribution of biometric data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The use of synthetic biometric data in large datasets has recently emerged as an aid to more accurate performance evaluation. Such data has been applied to fingerprints <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the iris <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, handwriting <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and even signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>[19] <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These datasets can improve the assessment of vulnerability and algorithm robustness. Legal considerations are, of course, paramount.</p><p>The proposals in the literature for synthetic handwritten signatures are as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>:</p><p>Generation of duplicated samples. The synthesis algorithm generates new samples from those of an existing user. The generator produces new duplicates through several transformations. An example of dynamic signature duplication can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for improving enrollment in dynamic signature verification. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> new static signatures are generated from two dynamic samples produced by the same user. The GAVAB static handwritten signature database comprises signatures duplicated by affine transformation of the original signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Generation of new synthetic identities. Here, the new signers and their signatures are created from statistical descriptors. Although there are several handwriting synthesizers in the literature, few synthesize samples for a new identity. Popel in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> describes an approach for signature generation using a model based on visual characteristics extracted from the time domain. After a visual validation, no clear quantitative results are given. A novel methodology is proposed by Galbally et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for the generation of synthetic on-line signatures on the basis of flourish and isolated characters. Their method combines the advantages of both spectral analysis and the kinematic theory of rapid human movements to generate the master signature of a new identity. Similarly, a proposal to use heuristic procedures to generate genuine and forged signatures is proposed at <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Recognizing that signing is a human task which involves complex cognitive functions and fine motor control, this paper proposes a novel method of generating both genuine and forged signatures of new synthetic identities. This is performed by attempting to emulate the mechanism of motor equivalence which is defined as the personal ability to perform the same movement pattern by different muscles.</p><p>The motor equivalence theory, also known as the Degrees of Freedom (DoF) problem, it was formulated by K. Lashley <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and it was N. Bernstein who articulated it in its current form <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Their studies are based on the activity of the Central Nervous System (CNS) which controls posture and movement and focus on the kinematical properties, seen from a musculo-skeletal viewpoint.</p><p>The motor equivalence theory suggests that the brain stores in two steps the movements aimed at performing a single task. The first is called effector-independent which stores the movement in an abstract form as a spatial sequence of points representing the action plan. The parietal cortex in general, and the posterior parietal cortex and the occipitotemporal junction in particular, are suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> as the most important brain region for representation of the action plan. The second step is called effector dependent and consist of a sequence of motor commands directed at obtaining particular muscular contractions and articulatory movements in order to execute the action plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> .</p><p>Applying the equivalence model to handwriting, the action plan may be represented in terms of strokes which are encoded in terms of relative positions and spatial directions. Once the movement has been planned, the motor control delivers the commands to specific muscles to produce the handwriting.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> it is suggested that fast and coordinated movements cannot be executed solely under feedback control since biological feedback is slow. Thus <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposes that the brain needs to acquire an inverse model of the object to be controlled by motor learning. Focusing on the internal inverse model of the limbs created by the cerebellum, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> calculates the motor commands which compensate for the arm's dynamics. Therefore, in the human development stage, early handwriting actions are highly demanding of attention, slow to execute, clumsy and not particularly accurate. After long-term practice, the movements become quick, smooth, automatic, and can be performed effortlessly, using minimal cognitive resources. This all suggests that the internal model could be replicated by a kinematic filter.</p><p>The kinematic filter is designed based on the kinematic theory which describes a stroke velocity profile as the output of a system made of two neuromuscular systems: one, an agonist, acting in the direction of the movement, and the other, an antagonist, acting in the opposite direction, compensating for the arm dynamics or inertia. The composition of the agonist, antagonist and arm inertia produce the well-known stroke overlapping which conveys handwritten quadratic trajectories <ref type="bibr">[27][28]</ref>[29] <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Using motor equivalence, the inverse model and kinematic theory, we propose an off-line handwritten signature synthesizer. Obviously, we do not pretend to model the mechanism of motor equivalence. Our idea is to construct a synthetic signature generator, inspired by motor equivalence hypotheses, which is built as follows (see Fig. The aims of our experiments are: firstly, to determine the ability, in terms of the equal error rate, of the synthesizer to generate identities with different stability and forgers with different skills; and secondly to be able to assess the realism of the generated images by a perceptual survey. Furthermore, a synthetic database of 4000 synthetic signers with 24 genuine samples and 30 forgeries with different inks is generated and made publicly available at http://www.gpds.ulpgc.es/download. This database is obviously free of any legal concerns on privacy.</p><p>The paper is presented as follows: sections 2 and 3 respectively describe the trajectory plan and the inverse motor approaches. Section 4 is devoted to the ink model. Section 5 is dedicated to the signature synthesizer parameters. Section 6 is focused on the performance and perceptual experiments while section 7 shows a case study of the usefulness of the signature synthesizer. The eighth section closes the paper with conclusions and suggested future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">SYNTHETIC SIGNATURE TRAJECTORY PLAN</head><p>This section proposes a trajectory plan which imitates the cognitive action plan for a handwritten signature. During the early development stage, human beings learn in visual coordinates the spatial sequence associated with the motor task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> of generating a signature. Firstly, the sequence of points needed to generate the inked trace is learned. Then, the sequence of motor commands is acquired and executed as a single action.</p><p>We assume the Western style of signing, which is either one of or a combination of a text and a flourish. The proposed trajectory plan is described in two steps: text trajectory and flourish trajectory. If both exist, once defined, they are scaled and connected. The method allows the generation of several types of signatures with different complexity levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Text Trajectory Plan</head><p>Learning to write is a complex procedure which starts with lines and scribbles. After reaching the age of about 3 years, most children understand that writing is made by combining lines, curves, and repeated patterns. About a year later, children begin to use letters in their own style. Usually they start by experimenting with the letters in their own names, as these are the letters most familiar to them. Thus, children begin to learn the shape and sequence of the letters in their name although their motor control is not yet accurate.</p><p>In some countries, children start their handwriting practice using printed worksheets. These help them to guide the height, width and length of each alphabetical letter they write or trace, whether in upper or lower case, and to construct the numerals. The tracing of lines or the joining up of dots, within the lines on a worksheet, helps them to learn each letter shape and the writing sequence. The lines help the formation of spatial relationships between objects thus creating the spatial memory or cognitive map. Once this is acquired, a child is able to select an ordered sequence of target points to perform fluent writing.</p><p>The cognitive map of the writing sequence is imitated in this paper by a letter trajectory plan which consists of: i) a grid of possible trajectory points, distributed in the signing area, which simulates the cognitive map; and ii) a set of letter trajectory plans which describe the sequence of trajectory points necessary to write each letter. The text trajectory plan is built by concatenating horizontally the letter trajectory plan of each letter with the necessary horizontal spaces between them. The grid of trajectory points for each letter is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Each point is labeled with a number. The distance between columns and rows of the grid define the letter shape and writing style which is generally different for different writers but constant for each writer.</p><p>For each letter, the trajectory plan is defined as a sequence of trajectory points. For instance, the trajectory plan for the letter 'P' is defined as the following sequence of trajectory points: {5, 1, 8, 15, 22, 23, 24, 17, 10, 3}. For the letter 'e' it is {11, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>, 26} and so on. The result can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> . The trajectory points in which the pen should stop because the writer has lifted the pen from the paper (for instance to write the upper horizontal line in the letter 't' or because of a discontinuity or a pen direction change) are marked as the initial point of a new stroke. Note that these trajectory points are not necessarily related with the so called target point in the cortex action plan. This procedure to synthesize offline signatures is loosely based on the motor equivalence model theory but it does not pretend to model or simulate it.</p><p>Finally, the trajectory plan of a given text is defined by concatenating the trajectory plan of different letters, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The distance between letters is related to the grid size and defined later, although it appears constant in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Flourish Trajectory Plan</head><p>The flourish trajectory points are defined as a sequence of points randomly generated inside a synthetic signature envelope. This envelope attempts to imitate the signing area that often limits the flourish area in the user brain.</p><p>The signature envelope is modeled by means of an Active Shape Model (ASM) which consist of a mean signature shape 𝑥̅ , a matrix 𝑃 of eigenvectors which describe the main modes of variation of the envelope and a vector 𝑏 of weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The ASM is trained according the methodology proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> with the MCYT off-line database.</p><p>A new synthetic signature envelope is obtained as 𝑥 𝑓 = 𝑥̅ + 𝑃 • 𝑏. This is calculated by selecting the 𝑏 vector weights randomly from within a uniform distribution of mean zero and deviation equal to |𝑏 𝑘 | &lt; 4√𝜆 𝑘 , where 𝜆 𝑘 are the eigenvalues of the 𝑃 matrix eigenvectors.</p><p>The flourish trajectory points are located randomly inside the signature contour. The number of target points is constant for a given user. As the signature envelope con-tains the signature, the flourish trajectory points are randomly located as separately as possible, taking into account that the line joining the consecutive trajectory points does not cross the envelope. An example is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>If there are both a text and a flourish, their trajectory plans are combined in three steps. The first displaces the geometrical center of the text trajectory plan to the mass center of the signature envelope. The second resizes the text trajectory plan to adjust the scale between both trajectory plans. The scale is the ratio between the text length and the horizontal contour width. The value for the scale is an identity constant. In the third step, the signature trajectory plan is obtained by concatenating the text and flourish trajectory plan adding, if the text and flourish are connected, a link between the end of the text trajectory plan and the beginning of the flourish trajectory plan. An example where both trajectory plans are connected can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MOTOR CONTROL APPROACH</head><p>Once the signature trajectory plan is defined, an inverse model for motor control is applied to obtain a realistic human signature trajectory. Theories on how the arm reaches planned trajectories are a central issue in motor control. The strokes are considered as primitives from which complex movements are assumed to be planned and executed. The strokes reflect some of the fundamental properties of a writer's neuromuscular system, as well as some of the basic features of the motor control strategies employed to produce these simple movements. Among these basic features, the most remarkable is the invariance of the velocity profile of the end-effector for a subject performing a rapid stroke over a wide range of movement size and speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Many of the different computational models can be classified into two main types: kinematic and dynamic. The kinematic model has been found to be successful in reproducing the various invariants observed in rapid strokes.</p><p>The kinematic theory describes a stroke velocity profile as the output of a system made of two neuromuscular systems: one, an agonist, acting in the direction of the movement, and other, an antagonist, acting in the opposite direction, compensating for the arm dynamics or inertia. The composition of the agonist, antagonist and arm inertia produce the well-known stroke overlapping which convey handwritten quadratic trajectories. The kinematic theory models the velocity of both movements by a Delta-lognormal. Each lognormal is characterized by its amplitude 𝐷, time of occurrence 𝜏, the log time delays 𝜇 and the log-response time 𝜎. The velocity profile of a stroke is then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑣 𝑡 = 𝐷 1 𝛬(𝑡; 𝜏 1 , 𝜇 1 , 𝜎 1 2 ) -𝐷 2 𝛬(𝑡; 𝜏 2 , 𝜇 2 , 𝜎<label>2 2 )</label></formula><p>(1) where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝛬(𝑡; 𝜏, 𝜇, 𝜎 2 ) = 1 𝜎√2𝜋(𝑡 -𝜏) 𝑒𝑥𝑝 {- [ln(𝑡 -𝜏) -𝜇] 2 2𝜎 2 }</formula><p>for 𝑡 &gt; 𝜏, and 0 elsewhere. Introducing the kinematic model within the trajectory plan will convert the sequence of straight lines into a trajectory similar to that produced by the human control motor. Two approaches to producing handwriting trajectories have been identified: 1) the space oriented models which approach the trajectory formation on the basis of the capability of expressing and controlling the trajectory of the hand in space; and 2) the muscle oriented models which attempt to relate the trajectory formation to the muscle geometry and muscle properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The existing space oriented models of handwriting comply with the hypothesis that handwritten trajectories are divided into simple strokes which can be composed by concatenating them and smoothing the transition between consecutive segments. To preserve the handwritten aspect, the composite planar trajectory should be bicubic and the linking between strokes must guarantee continuity up to the second time derivative <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Several methods provide rules for satisfying the two conditions simultaneously, such as composite Bezier curves and regular spline functions. A previous paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, proposes forming the signature trajectory by linking the trajectory points with straight lines and polynomial smoothing using a Savitsky-Golay filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we use a simpler and equally efficient smoothing of the trajectory plan using a Kaiser filter whose finite impulse response ℎ 𝑡 (𝑛) is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ℎ 𝑡 (𝑛) = 𝐼 𝑜 (𝜋𝛽√1 -(2𝑛 𝑁 𝑡 ⁄ -1) 2 ) 𝐼 𝑜 (𝜋𝛽) ⁄ , 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑁 𝑡 ; 0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (2)</formula><p>where 𝐼 0 is a zeroth order Modified Bessel function of the first kind. 𝑁 𝑡 + 1 corresponds to the length of the filter and β is the shape factor. In this work β is fixed to zero and its variation is left for future work. We guess β could be useful for simulating some effects of ageing or handwriting disorders. As the length of the filter is related to the apparent speed of the stroke, higher speed conveys greater inertia and therefore longer filters, it is called kinematic filter.</p><p>The above procedures are useful for signatures with just flourishes and produces trajectories similar to a human being, but several issues arise when generating signatures with both a text and a flourish. Writing the text requires a finer finger control motor than writing the flourish for which the major movement is made by the forearm. The wrist usually moves during the whole signing process. Thus, according to the equivalence motor theory, for generating text and flourish we need more degrees of freedom than in the case of generating just the flourish because of the greater number of muscles involved.</p><p>Thus, we use a multi-level motor scheme based on several kinematic filters of variable length that simulate the inertia of the different muscles used for handwriting. Note that this is an operational approach not necessarily related to real muscles or movements. In short, our proposal relies on three kinematic filters which are heuristically related to the finger, forearm and wrist applied as follows:</p><p>1. For the signature text, the trajectory points are linked by straight lines and divided into strokes. These are defined for each letter plan. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.a shows an example of stroke division.</p><p>2. The finger speed profile is then estimated. The profile of each stroke j at the pixel 𝑡 is obtained as 𝑣 𝑗 𝑡 = 𝐷 𝑗,1 𝛬(𝑡; 𝜏 𝑗,1 , 𝜇 𝑗,1 , 𝜎 𝑗,1</p><p>2 ) -𝐷 𝑗,2 𝛬(𝑡; 𝜏 𝑗,2 , 𝜇 𝑗,2 , 𝜎 𝑗,2 2 ) following the Delta-lognormal model. The parameters 𝐷 𝑗,1 , 𝐷 𝑗,2 , 𝜏 𝑗,1 , 𝜏 𝑗,2 , 𝜇 𝑗,1 , 𝜇 𝑗,2 , 𝜎 𝑗,1 2 , 𝜎 𝑗,2 2 are fixed for each identity since they represent the identity's motor system. The parameter values are obtained randomly in the range given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Finally, the finger speed profile 𝑣 𝑓 𝑡 of the signature text is obtained by adding the stroke speed profiles as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑣 𝑓 𝑡 = ∑ 𝑣 𝑗 𝑡 𝑛𝑠 𝑗=1</formula><p>where 𝑛𝑠 is the number of strokes. The 𝑣 𝑓 𝑡 is normalized to a maximum value equal to 1. It is actually a scalar version of the sigma lognormal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. An example can be seen at Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.b.</p><p>3. The finger speed profile is used to select the length of the kinematic filter that programs the finger control motor. The kinematic filter length at pixel 𝑡 is calculated as 𝑁 𝑓 𝑡 = 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 × 𝑣 𝑓 𝑡 where 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 is a user constant which depends on the image resolution and the mean speed of the finger. The result of applying the inertia filter can be seen at Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.c. where we suppose that 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 is equal to the maximum distance between columns or rows of the trajectory grid.</p><p>4. For the flourish, straight lines link the flourish trajectory points. Each corner is marked as a new stroke. The Delta lognormal parameters of each stroke are randomly worked out and the flourish speed profile 𝑣 ℎ 𝑡 is obtained by adding the speed of each stroke. In this case, the filter length is obtained as 𝑁 ℎ 𝑡 = 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ × 𝑣 ℎ 𝑡 . We use 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ instead of 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 because the motor system for the flourish is different from the motor system for the signature text. As the flourish is written quicker than the text, so 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ &gt; 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 .</p><p>The result of applying the text and flourish kinematic filters can be seen at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.b and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.c respectively.</p><p>5. The wrist moves continuously when writing both the signature text and flourish. Thus we apply a third kinematic filter to the signature. In this case, the strokes are considered as the groups of connected letters (a word with all the letters connected, several connected letters, an isolated letter, etc.). The Delta lognormal parameters are  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">INK MODEL FOR REALISTIC IMAGES</head><p>The tool used most for handwriting is the ballpoint pen. So we have used the ink deposition model of a ballpoint to produce realistic images, as at <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>The ballpoint pen is a writing instrument which dispenses ink from an internal reservoir through the rolling action of a metal ball at its tip. Mainly due to ink viscosity and gravity or reservoir pressure, the ink flows from the reservoir to coat the ball. Handwriting is produced by rolling the ball on a sheet which deposits the ink on the paper. Our model supposes that the ballpoint pen generates a sequence of inked spots when rolling.</p><p>The spot shape is modelled as an ellipse the vertical and horizontal axes of which are given by 𝜙 𝑣 = 𝜙 𝑠 cos β and 𝜙 𝑢 = √2𝜙 𝑠 𝜙 𝑣 -𝜙 𝑣 2 where 𝜙 𝑠 is the pen tip diameter and β the pen inclination angle. The major axis of the ellipse is perpendicular to the pen azimuth 𝜃. Both are calculated by supposing that a pen pivot is located 2.5 𝑐𝑚 from the lower right hand corner of the paper and at 2.5 𝑐𝑚 above the paper. This assumes an average hand size.</p><p>Although the pen speed and pressure are not always correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, this paper assumes that the spot gray level amplitude is inversely proportional to the speed. Let the pen speed at dot (𝑥 𝑡 , 𝑦 𝑡 ) be equal to 𝑣 𝑝 𝑡 = 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 × 𝑣 𝑓 𝑡 + 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ × 𝑣 ℎ 𝑡 + 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑤 × 𝑣 𝑤 𝑡 . The normalized pressure is presumed to be 𝑝 𝑡 = 1/ (𝑣 𝑝 𝑡 / max 𝑡 𝑣 𝑝 𝑡 ). The spot gray level amplitude is defined as 𝐴 𝑡 = 𝑝 𝑡 × Δ𝑝 + 𝑝 𝑚𝑖𝑛 where Δ𝑝 and 𝑝 𝑚𝑖𝑛 are random numbers in the range [0 -0.3] and [0.6 -0.8] respectively. To take into account the pen tip irregularities or deposition failures, the spot is multiplied by a random normal noisy spot defined as 𝑁(0.75,0.25). The signature images is obtained by overlapping the consecutive spots so as to correspond to the rolling action of the ballpoint pen. The maximum dark value is taken into account by cropping the signature level intensity to 2𝜙 𝑠 .</p><p>The last step in improving the realism of the off-line signature images is to approximate the calculated stroke gray level histogram to a real ink histogram distribution. The histogram of the generated strokes is equalized to match one of the ink histograms of the three more usual ink types: fluid, viscose and solid <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>These inks plus the usual commercial ball pen diameters 𝜙 𝑠 = {0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35,0.4, 0.45} mm mean that 18 pen types are available. Additionally, the variables Δ𝑝, 𝑝 𝑚𝑖𝑛 are randomly generated for each signature. An example of the result can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>. The effect is realistic although there is room for improvements, e.g. to create striated ink deposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SYNTHETIC SIGNATURE PARAMETERS FOR DATABASE GENERATION</head><p>A signature database contains several genuine samples of the same signer plus several forgeries of each signer made by different forgers. Each genuine signature is different from the others and the difference among them is called the within class variability. The differences between the different signers is called the between class variability. For synthetic signature generation, the between variability is obtained by changing the parameters that generate the signatures. These parameters are divided into three groups. The first group contains the parameters needed to generate the morphology and lexicon of the signature. We understand these terms to mean respectively the form and formation, i.e., the number of words, letters per word, whether the signature has a flourish, the relationship between the text and flourish length and so on. The second and third groups include the parameters required to generate the trajectory plan and the motor control parameters respectively.</p><p>To obtain realistic synthetic signatures, most of the parameters range has been obtained by the analysis of real signatures databases as detailed in the next section. The MCYT off line database <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> includes 75 signers, 15 genuine signatures and 15 deliberate or skilled forgeries for each signer. All signature data was acquired with the same pen and the same paper templates.</p><p>The GPDS960GraySignature corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> contains 24 genuine signatures and 30 deliberate forgeries from 881 individuals. The genuine signatures were written with the same ink and the forgeries with 10 different inks. Both databases were scanned at 600dpi with 256 gray levels.</p><p>The peculiarities we examined which allow the generation of a more realistic synthetic database imitating the proportions of a real database are listed below:</p><p>1. The measured probability of signatures containing flourish and text is 86.6%. The probability of signatures with only either a flourish or a text is 8.3% and 5.1% respectively.</p><p>2. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.a shows the distribution of words in the signature, up to the third word. Those with one word: 50%, with two words: 36.3% and with three words: 13.7%.</p><p>3. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.b shows the distribution of the number of letters per signature. This is modeled by a normal distribution of mean 5.5 and sigma 2.2.</p><p>4. The number of flourish corners is related to the flourish complexity which is a relevant signature parameter. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.c shows the distribution of the number of flourish corners which is approximate by a lognormal distribution of 𝜇 = 1.59 and 𝜎 = 0.42 which corresponds to a mean equal 5.38 and variance equal to 5.5. As real signatures can include two flourishes, the second one is approximated by using the same probability distribution with 𝜇 = 1.37 and 𝜎 = 0.28.</p><p>5. Some signatures have wider texts in relation to the flourish widths than others. To model this fact, the distribution of the ratio between the text and flourish widths is worked out and represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.d. This distribution can be fitted by a lognormal distribution of 𝜇 = -0.22 and 𝜎 = 0.38 which corresponds to a mean equal to 0.85 and variance equal to 0.11.</p><p>6. Real signatures present an inclination or skew. This is measured by enveloping the signature by an ellipse and working out the angle of the major axis. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.e shows the distribution of the measured skew which is approximated by a generalized extreme value probability density function with shape parameter 𝜉 = -0.12, scale parameter 𝜎 = 7.68 and a location parameter 𝜇 = 2.43.</p><p>7. Similarly, the slant effect is another personal feature needed to imitate the generation of synthetic signatures. The estimated distribution of the signature slant is depicted at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.f. It suggests again a generalized extreme value probability density function but with a shape 𝜉 = -0.16, scale 𝜎 = 11.54, and a location 𝜇 = -0.21.</p><p>8. The distribution of the letter size, in terms of their width in millimeters, in the above mentioned databases is shown at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.g. It can be approximated by a normal distribution of 𝜇 = 3.00 and σ = 0.62 . 9. The distribution of the space in millimeters between letters is shown at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.h. It can be approximated by a normal distribution of 𝜇 = 1.17 and σ = 0.20 .</p><p>10. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.i estimates the distribution of the space between words in millimeters as a normal distribution of 𝜇 = 8.00 and 𝜎 = 0.89.</p><p>Other interesting data we use to help generate the synthetic database are as follows:</p><p> The probability of connecting the last letter of the text with the beginning of the flourish is fixed at 58%.  Of the signatures with a flourish, 81% have just one flourish and 19% of them have a second nonconnected flourish.  The probability of all the letters being connected is 59%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Parameters to Generate a Synthetic Signature</head><p>The parameters we use to generate automatically the signature of a new synthetic identity are given in three groups below.</p><p>Parameters to define the signature lexical morphology 1. 𝑃𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡, 𝑃𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠ℎ, 𝑃𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡&amp;𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠ℎ: Probability that the signature includes only text, only flourish or text plus flourish. Their values are obtained from the real database counting given at section 5.1.</p><p>2. 𝑃𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡: Probability of the text and the flourish being connected. This is worked out with the probability given at section 5.1.  𝑁𝑐 are located as defined at section 2.2.</p><p>Parameters to generate the trajectory plan 9. 𝑐 𝑖 = (𝑥𝑟𝑐 𝑖 , 𝑦𝑟𝑐 𝑖 ) 𝑖=1 𝑁𝑐 : Positions of the flourish corners obtained as defined at section 2.2.</p><p>10. {𝑑𝑐 𝑖 } 𝑖=1 4 : The distance between columns of the grid trajectory points (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>) that define the letter shape and size. Taking into account the distribution at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.g and a 600dpi image, this is obtained randomly in the range  pixels for each identity.</p><p>11. {𝑑𝑓 𝑖 } 𝑖=1 6 : Distance between rows of the grid trajectory points defined in the same way as 𝑑𝑐 𝑖 .</p><p>12. 𝑠𝑤𝑟: This defines the ratio (𝑇𝑒𝑥𝑡 𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ/ 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠ℎ 𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ) which is obtained randomly from the distribution of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.d. The ratio is fitted to the synthetic signature by estimating:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑙2𝑓 = (𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑖 (𝑥𝑟𝑐 𝑖 ) -𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑖 (𝑥𝑟𝑐 𝑖 )) / (Σ(𝑁𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠) × Σ 𝑖 (𝑑𝑐 𝑖 )) (5)</formula><p>and scaling the letter size as follows: 𝑑𝑐 𝑖 = 𝑑𝑐 𝑖 × 𝑙2𝑓 × 𝑠𝑤𝑟 and 𝑑𝑓 𝑖 = 𝑑𝑓 𝑖 × 𝑙2𝑓 × 𝑠𝑤𝑟.</p><p>13. 𝑣𝑙: Variability of the letter. A letter is never written in exactly the same way by a writer, so we introduce a variable to control the letter shape variability. This can be described as inner word variability. Each time a letter is generated, the grid trajectory points are moved inside a circle of radius is equal to 𝑣𝑙 as shown at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>. Each writer has his own variability. The radius depends on the letter size and it is heuristically fixed for each identity in the range [0.5 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 -1.2 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑] where 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛 {𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑖 {𝑑𝑐 𝑖 } , 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑖 {𝑑𝑓 𝑖 }}.</p><p>14. 𝑣𝑏𝑙: Variability of the baseline. This is different from the variability of the other trajectory points because of the expected ability of a healthy writer to write on or close to a straight line. Therefore, the variability or circle radius of the trajectory points 5, 12, 19, 26 and 33 is smaller than 𝑣𝑙 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). This variable is randomly set up in the range [0.2 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 -1.7 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑] pixels for each identi-ty.</p><p>15. 𝑠𝑏𝑙: Space between consecutive letters for an identity. See distribution Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.h.</p><p>16. 𝑠𝑏𝑤: Space between consecutive words for an identity, as modeled by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.i. 17. 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑙: Variability of the space between letters. This is not constant even within the same word. So it changes among the letters and can be seen as an example of inner word variability. Therefore, each time a letter is added, the space to the prior letter is obtained as 𝑠𝑏𝑙 + 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑙 which is calculated as random value in the range [-0.7 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 -0.7 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑] pixels. This range has been heuristically adjusted.</p><p>18. 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑤: Variability of the space between words. As in the case of 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑙, each time a word is added, the space to the prior word is obtained as 𝑠𝑏𝑤 + 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑤 which is calculated as a random variable in the heuristic range [-4 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 -4 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑] pixels.</p><p>19. 𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑤: The signature skew is modeled as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.e and is accomplished by rotating the signature trajectory plan.</p><p>20. 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡: The slant of the handwriting. Following the distribution of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.f, this is achieved by applying an affine transformation to the text trajectory plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameters to generate the motor control approach</head><p>The values of the following four parameters are inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.

This variable depends on the letter size, so its range is defined between [1.5 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 -4 × 𝑚𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑].</p><p>26. 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ : Length of the smoothing filter for the forearm motor model. This variable depends on the flourish size.  By varying these parameters randomly, according to their probability density function, 98% of the cases found in the real databases can be generated by the synthesizer. One example of a signature that the synthesizer cannot generate one with two lines of text.</p><p>It is possible to generate signatures with just a text line (𝑃𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 1 and 𝑃𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠ℎ = 0) or only a flourish (𝑃𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 0 and 𝑃𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠ℎ = 1). For signature with text and a flourish both parameters are equal to 1.</p><p>The complexity of the text line is set up by parameters 𝑁𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠 and 𝑁𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 which correspond to the number of words and letters in the signature text. The signature complexity increases with the number of words and letters.</p><p>On the other hand, the complexity of the flourish is adjusted by the parameter 𝑁𝑓 and 𝑁𝑐 which corresponds to the number of flourishes and number of corners in the flourish. If the number of flourishes or corners increases, the signature is more complex.</p><p>The readability of the signature is related to the length the kinetic filters whose parameters are called 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 , 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ and 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑤 . If the value of these parameters increases, this implies an increase in the handwriting speed, resulting in the text line becoming less and less legible. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> show the change in text line readability as the kinematic filter length is increased.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Parameters to Generate Multiple Samples of a Synthetic Identity</head><p>The above variables allow us to generate the master signature of a new synthetic identity. In this section we describe the procedure required to define the synthetic signer stability or the within variability, i.e. the differences between multiple genuine samples.</p><p>In this paper, the within variability is controlled by two parameters. The first refers to the flourish and the second to the text and neuromuscular kinematic filters. These parameters are:</p><p>1. 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑔: Radius of flourish corner ball. We introduce the variability in the flourish by changing the position of the corners of the flourish. The new corners lie inside a ball of radius 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑔 around the user corners (𝑥𝑟𝑐 𝑖 , 𝑦𝑟𝑐 𝑖 ) 𝑖=1 𝑁𝑐 . 2. 𝑤𝑛𝑣: Within text variability. Each time a signer produces a new signature, it keeps the same cognitive map and action plan but the neuromuscular path slightly changes its conditions due to different posture, equilibrium condition, etc. therefore introducing slight differences in the handwritten text. In the synthetized signature this is modeled by changing the value of the following text parameters: 𝑣𝑙, 𝑣𝑏𝑙, 𝑠𝑏𝑙, 𝑠𝑏𝑤, 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑙, 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑤, 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡, 𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑤, 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 , 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ and 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑤 . With the variable 𝑤𝑛𝑣 we define the percentage that each variable changes, i.e., for the new synthetic signature sample the new 𝑣𝑙 value will be a random number between [𝑣𝑙 -𝑣𝑙 × 𝑤𝑛𝑣/100 -𝑣𝑙 + 𝑣𝑙 × 𝑤𝑛𝑣/100] and so on. Obviously, we check that the newly obtained values are within the given parameter range. Otherwise, the maximum or minimum value is assigned, depending on which values exceed the range.</p><p>The within variability of the identity will be proportional to 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑔 and 𝑤𝑛𝑣.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Parameters to Generate Forgery Samples</head><p>In the case of forgery generation, as the forger imitates the genuine signature, he or she will try to extract the action plan from the original signature, so the forger follows a similar trajectory to the genuine signature but with a higher variability than the within class variability because of mistakes in the reconstruction of the action plan and the different neuromuscular systems between the forger and genuine signer.</p><p>The above principles are summarized in two parameters, the first related to the flourish and the second to the text. These variables are:</p><p>1. 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓: Radius of the forgery flourish ring. As in the case of genuine identity, the flourishes made by a synthetic forger are generated by moving the flourish corners. To simulate the greater variability of the forgers and their difficulties in capturing the exact corner position, we use a ring instead of a ball. Therefore 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓 is a vector comprising the inner and an outer ring radius. The bigger the intersection area between the genuine ball and the forgery ring, the more skilled the forger.</p><p>2. 𝑓𝑛𝑣: Forger text variability. This parameter is intended to simulate the forger variability for writing the text. As in the case of 𝑤𝑛𝑣, it expresses the percentage variability in respect the parameter value but in this case it consists of two values: 𝑓𝑛𝑣(1) and 𝑓𝑛𝑣 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The first indicates the minimum variability and the second the maximum variability. For example, the 𝑣𝑙 value for a forger is a random value in the range:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[𝑣𝑙 -𝑣𝑙 𝑓𝑛𝑣(2) 100 , 𝑣𝑙 -𝑣𝑙 𝑓𝑛𝑣(1) 100 ] ∪ [𝑣𝑙 + 𝑣𝑙 𝑓𝑛𝑣(1) 100 , 𝑣𝑙 + 𝑣𝑙 𝑓𝑛𝑣(2) 100 ]</formula><p>If the modified value is not in the parameter range, it is set to its nearest extreme value. The modified parameters are:</p><p>a. As in the case of genuine generation: 𝑣𝑙, 𝑣𝑏𝑙, 𝑠𝑏𝑙, 𝑠𝑏𝑤, 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑙, 𝑣𝑠𝑏𝑤, 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡, 𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑤, 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 , 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ and 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑤 .</p><p>b. Additionally, as the forger does not capture the exact are also modified by 𝑓𝑛𝑣. c. Finally, as a forger has a different neuromuscular system, the values of variables 𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛, 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛, 𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑎 and 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑎 are worked out anew but as the forger forces his own neuromuscular system to imitate the genuine signature shape the variables 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑓 , 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 ℎ and 𝐿𝑃𝑠𝑖 𝑤 are modified by 𝑓𝑛𝑣 as said above.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> shows different examples of synthetic genuine and forged signatures obtained by the procedures described: it displays signature with both flourish and text with different complexities, a signature with only text and another one with just a flourish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>These experiments are aimed at determining the ability of the synthesizer to generate realistic synthetic datasets. The stability of the genuine signatures and the skills of the synthetic forgers are customized by adjusting the values of the variables: 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑔, 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓, 𝑤𝑛𝑣 and 𝑓𝑛𝑣.</p><p>Therefore, two kinds of experiments have been carried out: perceptual experiments to assess the realism of the synthetic signature images and performance experiments on generated synthetic databases to validate in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) the synthetic signer variability and the forgers' skills.</p><p>The performance experiments are carried out in two steps. The first works out the relation between the EER with random forgeries and the parameters 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑔 and 𝑤𝑛𝑣 which controls the within and between variability of the synthetic signature database. The second step studies the sensitivity of the EER for forgers' skill with respect to the parameters 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓 and 𝑓𝑛𝑣.</p><p>The perceptual experiment is carried out by estimating human ability to distinguish between synthetic and real signatures through a survey with people outside of the forensic area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Protocol for Performance Experiments</head><p>The performance evaluation is computed by using the verifier proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. It is based on texture features such as the local binary pattern (LBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and the local derivative pattern (LDP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The signature is transformed to the LBP and LDP image which is divided into 12 sectors. The histogram of each sector is worked out, concatenated and its dimension reduced by using a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to obtain the feature vector. The classifier is based on a least square support vector machine (LSSVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Following a well-established experimental protocol, the training set consists of 10 randomly selected genuine signatures. The remaining genuine signatures are used for testing. When testing with a specific signer, random forgery scores are computed by using the genuine test samples from all the remaining users. Scores for forgers are computed from the synthetic forgeries of the signer. All the experiments are repeated 10 times and the averaged results in term of Equal Error Rate (EER) are provided.</p><p>In order to establish a reference for the realism of the performance results obtained with the synthetic databases, the performance obtained with the real signatures of the GPDS corpus with 150 users are an EER=0.44% for random forgeries and EER=15.90% for skilled forgeries. For the 881 real users from the same database, the EERs are equal to 0.88% and 23.42% for random and skilled forgeries respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Performance Experiments</head><p>This section studies the performance sensitivity with respect to the four parameters that define the database variability. First we report at Table I the sensitivity with respect to the parameters that set up the synthesis of genuine samples: 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑔 and 𝑤𝑛𝑣. The ability of these parameters to produce datasets with different inner and between class variability is clear from the range of different EERs obtained. It can be seen that reducing the flourish corner ball radius, decreases the synthetic signer variability and improves the performance. Also the performance is more sensitive to 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑔 than to 𝑤𝑛𝑣. Moreover, the ability of the procedure to produce realistic databases is proved by the fact that the synthetic database performance is similar to the real GPDS database performance when 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑔 = 2.96 mm and 𝑤𝑛𝑣=30%.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">II</ref> evaluates the ability of the synthetic procedure to produce forgeries with different skills. This depends on the following parameters: the inner and outer radius of the flourish corner ring for forgeries 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓(1) and 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓(2) and the forger text variability 𝑓𝑛𝑣. Table <ref type="table">II</ref> presents the results for various 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓(2) and 𝑓𝑛𝑣, supposing for the sake of simplicity that 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓(1) = 3.77 mm. The EER reduces when the outer ring radius increases because a greater 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓(2) means less skilled forgers. Again, 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓 influences the performance more than 𝑓𝑛𝑣 because it is the former variable which best describes the forgers' skills. Similar results to those for a real GPDS database can be obtained by setting 𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑓(2) = 6.70 mm and 𝑤𝑛𝑣=100%.</p><p>In conclusion, the proposed procedure is able to generate useful customized databases. The different variabilities and therefore performances are tuned according to only four parameters.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Perceptual experiments</head><p>We conduct perceptual experiments to investigate the generator's ability to produce humanlike signatures. In a similar way to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> [37] <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, this is measured by showing non-forensic volunteers a set of real and synthetic images. The volunteers are not told whether the signature is real or synthetic. They are asked to score between 0 (very sure synthetic) and 10 (very sure human) the realism of the presented signature according to their impression, formed after a quick inspection of the signature. For this experiment, forty synthetic signatures were generated with real texts. They were combined with another 40 real signatures randomly selected from GPDS, MCYT. Real and synthetic signatures were randomly mixed.</p><p>To avoid any background effects, the signatures were set against the same white background. In addition, the test was presented on printed sheets to avoid the use of computer facilities, e.g. the zoom, to help make the decision. A subset of this experiment is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> The realism of the synthetic generator is measured by calculating two kinds of errors, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. We work out the False Synthetic Rate (FSR): a real signature is assigned as synthetic if the score is less than 5. We then work out the False Real Rate (FRR): a synthetic signature is assigned as real if its score is greater than 5. The final Average Classification Error (ACE) is calculated as ACE= (FSR + FRR)/2. The results of the survey of 80 volunteers are shown in the first three columns of Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. The average score of real and synthetic signatures is also given at Table III along with the average time taken to complete the experiment. The value of ACE=44.06% confirms the expected confusion between real and synthetic signatures. This conclusion is also supported by the real and synthetic average score of around 5. Therefore, we conclude that perceptually the synthetic signature generator based on the motor equivalence approach along with the virtual deposition ink model is able to produce signatures that human non-expert examiners accept as real.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CASE STUDY: ROBUSTNESS AGAINST NUMBER OF IDENTITIES AND INK VARIABILITY</head><p>An advantage of our synthetic signature generator is that it allows easy checking of the robustness of verification algorithms according to different scenarios. In this section, as a useful example of applying the synthetic algorithm, we analyze the robustness of the signature verifier to different numbers of users and inks. Five versions of the same database are generated for the following 5 experiments:</p><p> Experiment 1: Generation of a database by assigning a random pen to each sample. Our pen model considers 18 possible types of pen. The pen diameter varies in the range {0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45} 𝑚𝑚 and the ink type is randomly chosen from solid, viscous and fluid.</p><p> Experiment 2: Signature images for all the samples are generated with a ballpoint of 0.4 mm and solid ink. This is similar to the pen used for the off-line MCYT signature database.</p><p> Experiment 3: In this case, the images are generated with a ballpoint of diameter 0.2 mm and viscous ink.</p><p> Experiment 4: The images are obtained with a ballpoint of diameter 0.2 mm and solid ink.</p><p> Experiment 5: As in the case of GPDS, the genuine signature of each synthetic identity is generated using the same randomly selected pen. The forgeries are synthesized with a randomly selected pen.</p><p>By comparing the results of experiments 2 and 4 we can see the influence of the ballpoint diameter on the signature verifier. Also, we can see the effect of varying the ink type by comparing the results from experiments 3 and 4. The influence of the pen can be seen in experiment 5 where the random and simulated forgeries have been written with a different pen than that used for the genuine signatures. Experiment 1 shows the most realistic case because each sample is written with a different pen. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref> shows the results of the above experiments using a different number of identities. Increasing the number of identities does not display a clear tendency in the EER. This indicates that the EER depends more on the identities' variability than on their number. On the other hand, randomly changing the ink decreases the performance. From comparing experiment 2 and 4, it seems that narrower ballpoints make verification easier; and by comparing the third and fourth experiments, it appears that the ink type is not relevant in a database when all the signatures are taken with the same ink type. The comparison of the first experiment (randomly selected inks) with the second (all users with the same ink as in the MCYT database) and fifth (each user with one ink type as in GPDS database) indicates that the results obtained with the GPDS and MCYT databases are biased positively with respect to real applications where each signer uses a different pen for each signature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposes a novel method for the generation of synthetic off-line handwritten signatures inspired by the human neuromotor model. The proposed method generates entirely realistic synthetic genuine and synthetic forged signatures. Additionally, an ink deposition model is used to generate images with a highly realistic appearance.</p><p>The designed synthetic signature generator is based on the so called internal model which defines the handwriting action in two steps: the action plan and neuromotor inverse model. The signature generator imitates the action plan by using a trajectory plan, i.e. a sequence of target trajectory points in a grid. The neuromotor path is represented by a kinematic filter based on a variable length Kaiser window. The window length is proportional to the inverse of the pen speed, which is obtained using a scalar version of the sigma lognormal model. Once the synthetic signature's trajectory is worked out, an ink deposition model is defined to obtain realistic images of the signature generated.</p><p>The parameters we use to define the synthesized signature are obtained by analyzing the lexical and morphological aspects of signatures in the MCYT Off-line signature and GPDS signature corpus. Parameters such as the number of words in a real signature, the number of letters per word, the presence or absence of a flourish or text, text and flourish relations, etc. have been statistically characterized.</p><p>The validation protocol is twofold: performance related and perceptual. The performance experiment is aimed at learning the ability of the synthetic signature generator to produce databases with different within class variability and forgeries with different forger skills. The experiments show that by varying only four variables it is possible to control the writer stability and the forger skill. It is possible to find values of these parameters to synthetize databases with a similar performance to a real database such as the GPDS.</p><p>The perceptual experiment is addressed at learning the ability of the synthesizer to generate humanlike signatures. A survey to 80 people shows a near 50% of confusion between real and synthetic signatures which proves the realism of the generated synthetic signatures.</p><p>The novel synthetic generation algorithm has enormous potential for many applications such as performance estimation, security evaluation, scalability studies, ink effect studies, etc. Some of them are evaluated in this paper. In our on-going research we are adding parameters to test temporal drift to the database to simulate the effects of multisession signature taking, ageing and neurodegenerative illness. We believe forgery generation can be also improved by using the ScriptStudio program <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
