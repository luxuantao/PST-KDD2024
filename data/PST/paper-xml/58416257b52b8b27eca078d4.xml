<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In big cities, taxi service is imbalanced. In some areas, passengers wait too long for a taxi, while in others, many taxis roam without passengers. Knowledge of where a taxi will become available can help us solve the taxi demand imbalance problem. In this paper, we employ a holistic approach to predict taxi demand at high spatial resolution. We showcase our techniques using two real-world data sets, yellow cabs and Uber trips in New York City, and perform an evaluation over 9,940 building blocks in Manhattan. Our approach consists of two key steps. First, we use entropy and the temporal correlation of human mobility to measure the demand uncertainty at the building block level. Second, to identify which predictive algorithm can approach the theoretical maximum predictability, we implement and compare three predictors: the Markov predictor (a probability-based predictive algorithm), the Lempel-Ziv-Welch predictor (a sequence-based predictive algorithm), and the Neural Network predictor (a predictive algorithm that uses machine learning). The results show that predictability varies by building block and, on average, the theoretical maximum predictability can be as high as 83%. The performance of the predictors also vary: the Neural Network predictor provides better accuracy for blocks with low predictability, and the Markov predictor provides better accuracy for blocks with high predictability. In blocks with high maximum predictability, the Markov predictor is able to predict the taxi demand with an 89% accuracy, 11% better than the Neural Network predictor, while requiring only 0.03% computation time. These findings indicate that the maximum predictability can be a good metric for selecting prediction algorithms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In big cities, taxi service is imbalanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. While in some areas passengers experience long waits for a taxi, in others, many taxis roam without passengers. This imbalance leads to profit loss for taxi companies, since vehicles are vacant even when there is demand. Besides, it reduces the level of the passenger satisfaction due to long wait times. The ability to predict taxi demand can help address the taxi-service imbalance problem. Knowledge of where a taxi should be traveling can bring benefits to both taxi drivers and companies: taxi drivers can drive to high taxi demand areas, and taxi companies (e.g, Uber) may re-allocate their vehicles in advance to meet the passenger demand.</p><p>We define the taxi-demand prediction problem as follows: given historical taxi demand data in a region i, we want to predict the number of taxis that will emerge within i during the next time interval. Inspired by previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we aim to predict the met taxi demand. We use the number of pick-ups as a representation of the taxi demand in a region, and treat them as sequence data (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Note that although we focus on met taxi demand, our method is general and can be applied for predicting the unmet taxi demand. As we discuss in Section VII-B, unmet demand can be inferred from the met taxi demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Many methods have been proposed to predict taxi demand, including uncertainty analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, probabilistic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, to apply these methods, we must answer two key questions: 1. Given a predictive algorithm α, considering both the randomness and temporal correlation of the taxi demand sequence, what is the upper bound of the potential accuracy that a predictive algorithm α can reach? 2. Given an upper bound of potential accuracy, which predictor has a better performance given the trade-off between the computation time and the accuracy?</p><p>In this paper, we answer these questions by analyzing the maximum predictability (Π max ) of taxi demand in a region to select the best predictor. The maximum predictability is defined by the entropy of the taxi demand sequence, considering both the randomness and the temporal correlation. Maximum predictability Π max was first introduced by Song et. al for analyzing user mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. They used a data set capturing the mobility patterns of 50,000 individuals over three months and showed that there is a potential 93% predictability in user mobility. Here, we define the maximum predictability Π max as the highest potential accuracy that a predictive algorithm can reach for predicting taxi demand.</p><p>The maximum predictability captures the degree of temporal correlation of the taxi demand sequence by measuring the regularity of human mobility. For most regions, the taxi demand is governed by a certain amount of randomness (e.g., unexpected events) and some degree of regularity (e.g., weekly patterns), which can be exploited for prediction. For example, a building block with Π max = 0.3 indicates that for at least 70% of the time, the taxi demand of this block appears to be random, and only for 30% of the time can we hope to predict the taxi demand. In other words, no matter how good the predictive algorithm is, we cannot predict with better than 30% accuracy the future taxi demand of a building block with Π max = 0.3. Π max represents the fundamental limit for predictability of the taxi demand in a building block. a) Predictability Variation in Different Regions: Previous work assumed that the maximum predictability (the degree of the temporal correlation) in different regions is the same, and proposed the use of a single predictive algorithm for all regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, the strong temporal correlation of taxi demand does not always hold. Different regions have different functions and thus different predictability (see Section V-B). Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the hourly taxi demand from two building blocks in NYC. The taxi demand near the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MoMA) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> top) exhibits a strong temporal pattern. The regular peaks in MoMA happen during weekends and after the close time every weekend -people usually visit the museums during weekends and leave after the close time. In contrast, the taxi demand near the west port (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> below) seems to be more random. There is no clear temporal pattern near the west port. This is because the taxi demand in a transportation hub such as the west port is heavily dependent on the arrival of ships and there is a high variability of arrival time <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In fact, the taxi demand near MoMA has one of the highest predictability among all the building blocks in NYC, and the taxi demand near the west port has one of the lowest predictability. Intuitively we should use different predictors for predicting the taxi demand in these two building blocks. For MoMA it is better to use a predictor that is able to capture the temporal correlation, for example, a Markov predictor. For the west port, a predictor that uses machine learning and capture additional features such as the ship schedule may be more effective. We posit that to select best predictor, we must analyze the maximum predictability (Π max ) of the taxi demand in each region.</p><p>Contributions. In this paper, we make three key contributions:</p><p>• We measure the theoretical maximum predictability of the taxi demand for each building block in NYC. This represents the upper bound of the potential accuracy that a predictive algorithm α can reach. We show that the maximum predictability of the taxi demand can reach up to 83% on average. The maximum predictability captures the degree of the temporal correlation of the taxi demand sequence. Our findings indicate that taxi demand in NYC has a strong temporal patterns. • We implement and compare the prediction accuracy of three predictors: the Markov predictor (a probabilitybased method) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) predictor (a sequence-based method) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and the Neural Network (NN) predictor (a machine learning-based method) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We observe that the NN predictor provides better accuracy for building blocks with low predictability, and the Markov predictor provides better accuracy for building blocks with high predictability. Our findings indicate that the maximum predictability is an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy and a computeintensive NN predictor with multiple features does not always outperform a simpler Markov predictor. • We show that knowledge of the predictability at each building block can help determine which predictor to use, while taking accuracy and computational cost into consideration. Most of the previous research does not consider the heterogeneity of the predictability in different regions and uniformly applies the same prediction method, and this can lead to inefficiencies. For example, a Markov-based predictor is four orders of magnitude faster (with only 0.03% computation time) than a computingintensive NN predictor. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents how we obtain the maximum predictability Π max and Section III describes the three approaches we implemented for predicting taxi demand. In Section IV, we introduce the data sets we use in this paper and how we preprocess these data. We discuss the results of the taxi demand predictability analysis in Section V. In Section VI, we compare the performance of the three predictive algorithms and show that predictability provides an effective measure for selecting appropriate prediction methods. Related work is discussed in Section VII and we conclude in Section VIII, where we outline directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PREDICTABILITY OF TAXI DEMAND</head><p>In this section, we formally define maximum predictability Π max . Our goal is to answe the following question with the proposed maximum predictability Π max : Problem 1. Given a predictive algorithm α and a sequence of the taxi demand D (i) n from time 1, 2, . . . n at building block i, considering both the randomness and the temporal correlation of the taxi demand, we want to find the maximum predictability (the highest potential accuracy) Π max that a predictive algorithm α can reach.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table">I</ref> summarizes the main symbols used in this paper.</p><p>Since there can be high variability in taxi demand, it is hard to predict the exact value for d (i) t . For simplicity, we use a factor q to round the value for the taxi demand. We group every q taxi demand as one taxi demand. We try to predict the taxi demand at every q level, e.g., if q = 10, then 620-629 all become 620 in the sequence. After a few tests, we set q = 10 for making the prediction more relaxed while keeping the errors low. We show the effect of q on Π max in our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Appendix D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Entropy</head><p>Entropy is an effective measure to characterize the degree of predictability. In general, a low entropy means higher predictability. We use three entropy measures: the random entropy S (i) random , the Shannon entropy S (i) Shannon , and the real entropy S (i) real <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. 1) Random Entropy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S (i) random = log 2 N (i)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here N (i) is the number of unique taxi demand in</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D (i)</formula><p>n , e.g., for the sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D (i) n = 2122, the unique taxi demand N (i) is 2.</formula><p>In general lower entropy means higher predictability.

Note that both random entropy and Shannon entropy are time-independent and do not consider temporal patterns. A sequence D 3) Real Entropy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">S (i) real = - S (i) n ⊂D (i) n P (S (i) n )log 2 [P (S (i) n )]<label>(3)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P (S (i)</head><p>n ) represents the probability of finding a particular time-ordered sub-sequence S (i) n in the taxi demand sequence D (i) n . Unlike Shannon entropy and random entropy, the real entropy not only considers the frequency of different taxi demand in a building block, but also the order of the temporal patterns of the taxi demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The problem of finding all the subsets of a given set has exponential complexity (O(2 n )). Here we use a Lempel-Ziv estimator to calculate the real entropy. The Lempel-Ziv estimator can rapidly converge to the real entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For a taxi demand sequence after time n, the entropy can be estimated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">S (i) real ≈ 1 n t s (i) t -1 ln n<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here, s</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(i) t</formula><p>represents the length of the shortest subsequence starting at the time t which doe not appear from 1 to t -1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Maximum Predictability Π max</head><p>We define the predictability Π as the success rate that an algorithm α can correctly predict the future taxi demand at a building block. For a building block with N (i) unique taxi demand, the predictability measure is subject to the Fano's inequality, Π ≤ Π max <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Given an entropy S and the distinct taxi demand N (i) in building block i, the maximum predictability Π max can be computed by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">S = -Π max log 2 (Π max ) -(1 -Π max )log 2 (1 -Π max ) +(1 -Π max )log 2 (N (i) -1) (5)</formula><p>The maximum predictability Π max is a value between 0 and 1. The larger the value, the more accurate the algorithm is. Due to the space limit, we give a brief proof of the predictability upper bound Π max here. For details, we refer the reader to Appendix. E in our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>With different entropy measures, S</p><p>random , S</p><p>Shannon and S (i) real , we have different maximum predictability values Π random , Π Shannon and Π real . It has been proven that Π random ≤ Π Shannon ≤ Π real <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, thus Π real is the maximum predictability Π max . Now we can answer the problem proposed in the beginning of the section: given a predictive algorithm α, Π max is the maximum predictability that a predictive algorithm α can reach. The detailed analysis of the maximum predictability of each building blocks in NYC can be found in Section V.</p><p>Proof. Given a predictive algorithm α, let P α (X</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">(i) n = X(i) n |h (i)</formula><p>n-1 ) be the distribution generated over the next taxi demand X(i) n at location i and h</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">(i) n-1 = {X (i) n-1 , X (i) n-2 , . . . , X (i) 1 }</formula><p>the location i 's past taxi demand from time</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">1 to n -1. Furthermore, X (i) t</formula><p>represents the taxi demand at location i at the time t, and P r[X</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">(i) n = x (i) |h (i) n-1 ] is the probability that the next taxi demand X (i) n is x (i) given the taxi demand history h (i) n-1 . Thus P (X (i) n |h (i)</formula><p>n-1 ) is the true distribution over the next taxi demand.</p><p>Let π(h</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">(i)</formula><p>n-1 ) be the probability that there is a most likely taxi demand at the location i given the taxi demand history h (i) n-1 . The probability of successfully predicting the next taxi demand is P r α {X</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">(i) n = X(i) n |h (i) n-1 }. Since π(h (i) n-1 ) ≥ P (x (i) |h (i)</formula><p>n-1 ) for any x (i) , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">P r α {X (i) n = X(i) n |h (i) n-1 } = x (i) P (x (i) |h (i) n-1 )P α (x (i) |h (i) n-1 )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>≤</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">x (i)</formula><p>π(h</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">(i) n-1 )P α (x (i) |h (i) n-1 )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>= π(h</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">(i) n-1 )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Then, we define the predictability Π(n) for a taxi demand sequence with a history of length n -1. P (h</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">(i)</formula><p>n-1 ) represents the probability of a particular taxi demand history h (i) n-1 . If we sum over all the possible histories of length n -1, we have the predictability as</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">Π(n) = h (i) n-1 P (h (i) n-1 )π(h (i) n-1 ).</formula><p>The overall predictability Π can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">Π = lim n→∞ 1 n n t Π(t).</formula><p>Let N (i) be the total number of possible taxi demand value and there is a uniform distribution over the remaining N (i) -1 possible taxi demand value. Then we will have X , whose distribution P (X (i) |h (i) ) = (p, 1-p</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">N (i) -1 , 1-p N (i) -1 . . . , 1-p N (i) -1</formula><p>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data Sets</head><p>Taxi data set. The New York yellow taxi data set is a public data set provided by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. It includes trip records from all trips completed in yellow taxis in New York City in June, 2014. Each trip record contains pick-up and drop-off time, pick-up and dropoff locations, trip distances, itemized fares, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data was recorded through meters installed in each taxi. In total we have 13,813,031 taxi pick-up records from 13,237 yellow taxis.</p><p>The New York Uber data set is a public data set provided by the TLC <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This data set contains 663,845 Uber pickup records in June 2014. The key information provided by these data sets is summarized in our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>. We extract the following information from the data set: taxi id, pickup time and the corresponding pick-up location (building block).</p><p>Pluto data set. We use the Pluto (Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output) data set to map the GPS points with the associated building blocks and provide the land use information for each building block <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The Pluto data set is an extensive land use and geographic data set provided by NYC Department of City Planning. It contains detailed information about every piece of land in the city, including year built, number of units, and lot size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data Preprocessing.</head><p>We use the Pluto building shape file to map the pick-up GPS points with the associated building blocks: if a building block is within 200 ft radius of the pick-up location, we consider that building as the one passengers getting on the taxi and there is one taxi demand at that building block. If multiple building blocks are within 200 ft radius of the pickup location, we consider the nearest building block as the one that has a taxi demand. There are over 43,000 building blocks in Manhattan, however, for meaningful analyses, only those that have sufficient temporal coverage were included in our study. We found 9,940 such building blocks in our data set with at least 5 pick-ups a day. For the rest of the paper, we only use these 9,940 building blocks, unless otherwise noted. After the map matching process, we obtain the taxi demand sequence for each building block (Building block id i, taxi demand sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">D (i) n = d (i) 1 d (i) 2 d (i) 3 . . . d (i) n ).</formula><p>Scalability. All of our data preprocessing were conducted using the operational data facility at our research center. In particular, the mapping of taxi pickups to geospatial features, which requires a lot of processing given the volume of the pickup trips, on a 1200+ core cluster running Cloudera Data Hub 5.4 with Apache Spark 1.6. The cluster consists of 20 high-end nodes, each with 24TB of disk, 256GB of RAM, and 64 AMD cores. It takes about ten minutes for our R-tree based <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> algorithm to map matching the 14 million samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we analyse the predictability of taxi demand over each building block in NYC. We show that the maximum predictability of the taxi demand can reach up to 83% accuracy in average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Limits of Predictability</head><p>We show the distribution of the entropy and the maximum predictability obtained from the yellow taxi data set in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>. Here we group taxi demand every hour and study the hourly taxi demand. We first determine the entropy S and maximum predictability Π of the taxi demand of each building block using the yellow taxi data set. Then we obtain the distribution of the entropy S and maximum predictability Π over all building blocks. We find that the distribution of S (i) random peak at S (i) random = 3.6 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3 (a)</ref>). It implies that a building block would have N (i) = 2 3.6 ≈ 12 distinct taxi demand levels. That is, almost every two hours we will observe a new taxi demand level compared to the previous one. Recall that we define q = 10 when categorizing the taxi demand, which implies that there are about 10 taxi demand differences every two hour in the same building block. In contrast, the real entropy S (i) real peaks at a much smaller entropy value, S (i) real = 0.9. As discussed in Section. II-B, the real entropy captures the temporal correlation of the taxi demand sequence. The small real entropy S (i) real means a high temporal pattern. The predictability that any algorithm can correctly predict the next taxi demand is Π, and the upper bound is Π max . From the distribution of the maximum predictability Π max shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> (b), we observe that average value of Π max is 0.83. It indicates that the taxi demand can be potentially correctly predicted with an accuracy 83% over all the building blocks. Both Π random and Π Shannon are smaller than Π max , which is constant with the previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Π random ≤ Π Shannon ≤ Π max . Since Π max captures the temporal correlation of taxi demand, we can reach a higher  potential predictive accuracy if considering the temporal correlation in our predictive algorithms. Similar results can also be found if we group the taxi demand daily instead of hourly (see our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Predictability of Different Functional Buildings</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> we plot the heat map of hourly taxi demand predictability in Manhattan. From the figure we observe that different building blocks exhibit different maximum predictability. In the working places such as Lower Manhattan or residential places such as East Village, they have higher predictability (temporal correlation). People usually go work in the morning and come home during night, thus the predictability in these areas are higher compared to other places.</p><p>To further evaluate the predictability of different functional regions, in Table <ref type="table">II</ref> we show the predictability of taxi demand of building blocks with different land use. Both residential and working places have high predictability and thus exhibit strong temporal patterns. For other places such as hotels, transportation centers or bureau properties, the predictability is not as high as the residential or working places. The taxi demand for these regions is mainly dependent on the events happened during the day. E.g., a boat arrives at the pier or guests check out in a hotel. building block groups with Π max increasing from low to high (E.g., 0%-10% means the bottom 10% building block group according to Π max ). For each group we calculate the average prediction error. We find that the NN predictor provides better accuracy for building blocks with low predictability. In the group with lowest maximum predictability Π max = 72%, the NN predictor has a prediction accuracy 70%-the highest of all predictors. This is because that the NN predictor is able to capture the multiple features such as the weather information <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which can not be captured by other two predictors.</p><p>The Markov predictor provides better accuracy for building blocks with high predictability, and converges to the predictability upper bound Π max quickly. This is constant with previous research that there is a high positive correlation between the maximum predictability and the Markov predictor prediction accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the building blocks with high maximum predictability, the Markov predictor is able to predict the taxi demand with an 89% accuracy, 11% better than the NN predictor. Besides. the computation time of the Markov predictor is only 0.5 seconds, 0.03% of the NN predictor (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6 (b)</ref>). The Markov predictor is able to provide better predication accuracy with much less computation time for the areas with high predictability.</p><p>From the experiment we find that the maximum predictability Π max can help us determining which predictor to use. In the areas with low predictability we can use the NN predictor to reach high accuracy by capturing the multiple features, while in the areas with high predictability the Markov predictor is able to provide better prediction accuracy while keeping the computation time low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. RELATED WORKS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Predicting Taxi Demand</head><p>Taxi demand prediction problem has attracted more attentions recently due to the available of taxi data set. Mukai et. al forecast the taxi demand from taxi historical data with a neural network (multilayer perceptron) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Li Et. al adapt the feature selection tool, L1-Norm SVM, to select the most salient feature patterns that determining the taxi performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. An improved ARIMA based prediction method to forecast the spatial-temporal variation of passengers in hotspots is proposed by Li et. al <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Moreira-Matias et. al argue that ARIMA prediction method is not the best solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. They propose a new ensemble framework and show that their ensemble work can reach a high prediction accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Inferring Unmet Demand</head><p>From the taxi data set we can measure and predict the met taxi demand, that is, the number of the taxi services emerged and will emerge at different locations. However, the unmet taxi demand, e.g., the number of people who need a taxi but could not find one, can not be simply extracted from the taxi data set. To solve this problem, recent papers try to infer the unmet taxi demand from the taxi data set. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> the authors combine flight arrival with taxi demand and predict the passenger demand at different airport terminals in Singapore use queueing theory. Anwar et. al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> formalize the unmet taxi demand problem and present a novel heuristic algorithm to estimate it without any additional information. They infer the unmet taxi demand from taxis with empty services and show that it can be used to quantity the unmet demand. It must be noted that, although in our paper we only focus on predicting the met taxi demand of different building blocks. Our method is a general solution and can be used for predicting unmet taxi demand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Temporal Pattern of Human Mobility</head><p>It has been found that urban human mobility exhibit strong regularities, e.g., people usually go to work during daytime on weekdays, and go home after work. Marta et al. find that the trajectories in human mobility exhibit strong regularities by studying cell phone user's locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. They show that human trajectories exhibit a high degree of temporal and spatial temporal pattern. Each person has a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations such as home or working places. Song et al. propose the entropy-based probability to measure the temporal pattern of the individual human mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. They find an potential prediction algorithm can reach up to 93% accuracy. They also observe that the user can be found in his or her most visited location during the corresponding hour long period with a high probability, which also indicates the high temporal pattern of human mobility. The temporal pattern of human mobility also leads to the temporal pattern of taxi pick-ups. The human mobility patterns for different functional regions are different. Previous papers analyse the temporal pattern of urban human mobility and infer the functions of the regions in three cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Similar results can also be found in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, where there is a high predictability in the residential places and a low predictability in the transportation hubs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we analyse over 14 million yellow and Uber taxi pick-up samples in NYC. We find that there is a high predictability of taxi demand (up to 83% in average), which indicates strong temporal correlation of human mobility. We also examine which predictive algorithm can approach the maximum predictability. We show that the compute-intensive NN predictor does not always have better prediction accuracy than the Markov one. In the areas with low predictability, the NN predictor can reach high accuracy by capturing additional features (weather, etc). On the other hand, in the areas with high predictability, the Markov predictor is able to reach high prediction accuracy while keeping the computation time low. We also find that, the temporal correlation of the taxi demand can be better captured in the Uber taxi data, possibly due to different cruising strategies.</p><p>It must be noted that our results is not limited to taxi demand problem. Same approach can be used for predictions in other spatio-temporal data sets, such as mobile traffic of a cellular tower <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the number of tweets at a location <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> or the bike usage of a bike station <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In the future work, we will propose a new predictability-based predictor for the spatiotemporal prediction problem, e.g., the output of the Markov model can be viewed as an feature for NN predictor.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Due to the sparsity of the Uber taxis, we analyse the maximum predictability of both data sets at neighborhood level. We group the hourly taxi demand in each neighborhood and examine the maximum predictability of the hourly taxi demand sequence. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the maximum predictability of the Uber taxi service is higher than the yellow taxis. This is possibly because that the yellow taxis usually use a random cruising strategy, while the Uber taxis go to the passenger's places when a request is received. The temporal correlation of the taxi demand in a region can be better captured by the Uber taxi. Similar results can also be found in our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref> with daily taxi demand sequence.</p></div>
