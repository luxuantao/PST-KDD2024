<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The objective of most vision problems involves interpreting the motion of features of a three-dimensional (3-D) object through two-dimensional images that are projected perspectively<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> from the 3-D feature; hence, as stated in <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> vision systems are inherently perspective. Most research related to perspective systems have targeted the identification of the motion parameters (e.g., feature velocities) by using measureable state information. For example, for the following second-order system <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">_ x 1 _ x 2 = a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 x 1 x 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>the typical problem is to utilize the measureable states x 1 (t) and x 2 (t)</p><p>to determine the unmeasurable parameters a i (t) 8i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and possibly the unknown initial conditions x 1 (t 0 ) and x 2 (t 0 ). An excellent overview of research that has targeted this and similar problems (typically using an extended Kalman filter) is provided in <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to the class of perspective problems associated with using the measureable states to determine the parameters, several researchers have recently investigated the problem when the motion parameters are known along with the image-space feature coordinates, and the goal is to determine the unknown states (i.e., the actual 3-D position of the feature). For example, a recursive identifier based observer was developed in <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> to exponentially identify range information of features (i.e., points, lines, and planar curves) on an affine plane from successive images of a camera that is moving in a known manner (i.e., with known motion parameters). In <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, Chen and Kano develop a new observer for a more general perspective system that exponentially forces the observation error to an arbitrarily small neighborhood [i.e., uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB)].</p><p>In this note, we develop an observer to determine range information (and, hence, the 3-D task-space coordinates) for an object feature moving with general affine motion dynamics with known motion parameters. As in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[11]</ref>, the perspective system examined in this note and the preliminary work in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> is more general than the skew-symmetric system examined in <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. The unmeasurable range information is determined from a single camera provided an observability condition similar to <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> is satisfied. As stated in <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, many geometric structures of a perspective system are lost if they are studied via linearization; hence, to develop the observer, the perspective system is transformed into a nonlinear dynamic system (i.e., the image-space feature dynamics). Based on the nonlinear dynamics of the image-space signals an observer is designed that is inspired by the recent disturbance observer results in <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[9]</ref>. The structure of the proposed observer facilitates a Lyapunov-based analysis that is less complex than the sliding-mode based analysis derived for the observer design of <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. More significantly, the unknown states can be exactly determined rather than "almost" determined as in the UUB result in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The analysis demonstrates that the 3-D task-space coordinates of the feature point can be asymptotically identified. The proposed observer can also be applied to object motion described by Riccati dynamics and can be extended to n-dimensional perspective systems. Simulation results are provided that illustrate the performance of the observer.</p><p>The note is organized in the following manner. In Section II, the general perspective system is presented and the image-space feature dynamics are determined. In Section III, the observation problem is defined, and the observer is developed. The observation error is proven to be asymptotically regulated through a Lyapunov-based analysis in Section IV. Simulation results are provided in Section V, and concluding remarks are made in Section VI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. OBSERVATION PROBLEM</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Objective</head><p>The objective in this note is to determine the unmeasurable state x 3 (t) of the perspective vision system described by ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and (3). From (3) and the fact that y1(t) and y2(t) are measurable, it is clear that if x 3 (t) is identified then the complete 3-D task-space coordinate of the feature can be determined. To achieve this objective, an observer is constructed based on the unmeasurable image-space dynamics for y(t).</p><p>To quantify the performance of the observer, a measurable observer estimation error signal, denoted by e(t) 2 2 , is defined as follows:</p><p>e [ e 1 e 2 ] T = [ y 1 0 ŷ1 y 2 0 ŷ2 ] T</p><p>where ŷ(t)</p><p>[ŷ1(t); ŷ2(t)]</p><p>T 2 2 denotes a subsequently designed observer signal. To facilitate the subsequent development, a filtered observation error signal, denoted by r(t) 2 2 , is designed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r [ r 1 r 2 ] T = [ _ e 1 + 1 e 1 _ e 2 + 2 e 2 ] T<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where 1, 2 2 denote positive constant gains. Based on the dynamics in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and the definitions introduced in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">12</ref>) and</p><p>(13), it is clear that r(t) is unmeasurable due to the fact that _ y(t) is a function of the unmeasurable disturbance terms f1(x3; y1) and f 2 (x 3 ; y 2 ). The subsequent development will target the design of estimates for f 1 (x 3 ; y 1 ) and f 2 (x 3 ; y 2 ) based on the strategy that if the mismatch between the estimates and the disturbance terms f 1 (x 3 ; y 1 ) and f 2 (x 3 ; y 2 ) can be driven to zero, then x 3 (t) can be identified by exploiting the fact that bi(t) 8i = 1; 2; 3 and the states y 1 (t) and y 2 (t) are measurable. Specifically, from ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), the inverse of the square of x 3 (t) can be determined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 x 3 2 = f 2 1 + f 2 2 (b1 0 b3y1) 2 + (b2 0 b3y2) 2 : (14)</formula><p>Based on the structure of ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), it is clear that the following observability condition must be satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(b 1 0 b 3 y 1 ) 2 + (b 2 0 b 3 y 2 ) 2 &gt; 0 :<label>(15)</label></formula><p>That is, x 3 (t) can be identified once the mismatch between the disturterms f 1 (x 3 ; y 1 ) and f 2 (x 3 ; y 2 ) and the respective estimates are driven to zero. Remark 3: The observability condition introduced in (15) is not required by the subsequent analysis to prove that the observer design remains bounded. That is, the subsequent analysis can be used to prove that f 1 (x 3 ; y 1 ) and f 2 (x 3 ; y 2 ) can be identified independently of (15); however, (15) is required to prove that x3(t) can be identified. In <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, a discussion is provided regarding the physical justification of (15) with regard to the focus of expansion.</p></div>

Based on the fact that ke(t)k ! 0 and k_ e(t)k ! 0 as t ! 1, the expression given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">12</ref>) can be used to determine that ŷ1 (t) and ŷ2 (t) approach y 1 (t) and y 2 (t) as t ! 1, respectively. Therefore, the expression in (19) can be used to determine that f1 (t) and f2 (t) approach f1(t) and f2(t) as t ! 1. If the observability condition given in (15) is satisfied (i.e., if either f 1 (x 3 ; y 1 ) or f 2 (x 3 ; y 2 ) are nonzero), then the result that f1(t) and f2(t) approach f1(t) and f2(t) as t ! 1, the fact that the parameters bi(t) 8i = 1, 2, 3 are assumed to be known, and the fact that the image-space signal y(t) is measurable can be used to identify the unknown task-space parameter x3(t) from (14). Once x 3 (t) is identified, the complete 3-D task-space coordinates of the object feature can be determined from (3).</p><p>Remark 2: In addition to the general affine motion model considered in (2), several results in literature have examined the following Riccati motion dynamics (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>) For these dynamics, the same expressions given in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) can be obtained and, hence, the observer design in ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">18</ref>), (21), and ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) still applies for this motion field. Note that the observer developed in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> for the affine motion dynamics in (2) can also be applied to the motion dynamics in (40). As in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, the observer system design in this note can also be extended to general n-dimensional perspective systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section, numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm developed in ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">22</ref>).

The impact of these results are that the developed observer can be used to enable a monocular vision system to identify the range parameter (even in the presence of sensor noise) of an object moving (with known motion parameters) with an affine or Riccati motion dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this note, a new observer inspired by the development in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[9]</ref> was developed to identify an unmeasurable range signal (and, hence, the 3-D task-space coordinates of an object feature) via a single camera given the motion parameters of a general affine system (or Riccati system). To develop the observer the affine perspective system is transformed into the nonlinear feature dynamics. Through a Lyapunov-based analysis, the observer was proven to asymptotically regulate the observation errors. Simulation results are provided that illustrate the performance of the observer even in the presence of image noise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Feedback control system design has to deal with the following problems: 1) asymptotic tracking and disturbance rejection of classes of signals such as steps, ramps, sinusoidal inputs; 2) stability and robust stability; and 3) transient response control. The first two topics have received a great deal of attention. (see <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> and the references therein). On the other hand, there are very few results dealing with the problem of transient response control, despite the fact that good transient response is one of the most important requirements for every control system. For a certain class of transfer functions whose poles are all real, negative, and distinct, analytical expressions of transient responses were provided in <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. It was also shown that this formula in closed form can be used to determine the zeros that result in minimum transient time. In <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, some limitations on transient response are studied in terms of poles and zeros of the system. The `1 optimal control approach proposed in <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> specifically deals with the worst case time domain response under bounded amplitude inputs and is one of few "modern" approaches to time response control (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[9]</ref> for other optimization based approaches). Based on asymptotic time scale and eigenstructure assignment, a solution to a robust perfect tracking problem for minimum phase multiple-input-multiple-output systems in the presence of initial conditions and external disturbances has been reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[10]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, the relationship of undershooting step responses and nonminimum phase zeroes has been studied, and in [13] and [14] the design of nonovershooting controllers for discrete time systems have been proposed. A good summary of classical control approaches can be found in <ref type="bibr">[15] and [16]</ref>.</p><p>This note presents some new results to directly address the transient response control problem. The main ideas are based on certain relations between characteristic polynomial coefficients and time domain responses. These relations were initially presented by Naslin in the 1960s <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. An important contribution in this regard is due to Manabe [18] who investigated the problem of obtaining good transient response in control systems. His investigation focused on studying the generic behavior of the plant in the context of the so-called coefficient diagram that depicts the coefficients of the plant and characteristic polynomial on a logarithmic scale. Using this diagram, he successfully designed controllers for many industrial systems.</p><p>In this note, we begin by defining two important sets of parameters called here generalized time constant and characteristic ratios, respectively. These parameters are written in terms of coefficients of a polynomial. The properties of these parameters with respect to time domain response, in particular speed of response and overshoot, are then derived analytically. These properties are later used to construct a desired transfer function and a controller design procedure for minimum phase plants to achieve a transient response, with independently specified overshoot and rise time. The controller can be of state feedback plus feedforward or of two parameter type. The same procedure can be used for non minimum phase systems where reduced overshoot and increased speed of response may be obtained although they may not be independently specifiable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. STEP RESPONSE SPEED-UP</head><p>In this section, we develop some preliminary results on "speeding up" (or "slowing down") the step response of a system. If x(t) is a signal w(t) = x(t) is a time scaled version of x(t) and is speeded up if &gt; 1 and slowed down if 0 &lt; &lt; 1.</p><p>Let y(t) denote the forced response, to a step r(t), of a system with transfer function G(s). We are interested in determining a system with transfer function H(s) so that its forced response to r(t) is y(t) for a given &gt; 0. We say that H(s) speeds up the step response of G(s) by a factor .

C. Kim, L. H. Keel, and S. P. BhattacharyyaAbstract-This note develops an approach to directly control the transient response of linear time-invariant control systems. We begin by considering all-pole transfer functions of order for which we introduce a set of parameters = 1 . . . called the characteristic ratios. We also introduce a generalized time constant . We prove that and can be used to characterize the system overshoot to a input and the speed of response, respectively. By independently adjusting and in all-pole systems, arbitrarily small or no overshoot as well as arbitrarily fast speed of response can be achieved. These formulas are used to develop a procedure to design feedback controllers with feedforward or two parameter output feedback type for achieving time response specifications. For a minimum phase plant we show that arbitrary transient response specifications, namely one with independently specified overshoot and specified rise time or speed of response can be exactly attained.Index Terms-Characteristic ratios, generalized time constant, overshoot, transient response.</figDesc></figure>
