<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The interest in a further pruning of the set of frequent patterns that can be drawn from real-life datasets is growing up. In fact, it is a quite survival reflex towards providing a manageably-sized and reliable knowledge. This fact is witnessed by the proliferation of what is called concise representation of frequent patterns. In this paper, we propose an exact concise representation that explores the disjunctive search space in addition to the conjunctive one, in contrast with almost all known concise representations which only focussed on the latter space. This representation required the definition of a new disjunctive closure operator. The latter operator partitions the search space into distinct disjunctive equivalence classes and, hence, makes possible to drastically reduce the number of handled patterns. Empirical evidences are presented about the relative size of the new representation w.r.t. those based on frequent closed, (closed) non-derivable and essential patterns, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and motivations</head><p>Within the traditional framework of association rule mining, managing the high number of frequent patterns extracted from real-life datasets becomes an important topic (1) . A growing number of works hence explored the conjunctive search space to get out a nucleus of patterns, from which the remaining ones can be derived without information loss. Such an exploration was mainly motivated by the fact that the conjunctive operator -linking items -got the monopoly since the application of association rules in market basket analysis. Such a nucleus is better known as exact concise representation. Beyond expected high compactness rates, an exact concise representation should make possible to guess the frequency status of a pattern, and then to exactly retrieve its support when it is frequent enough. The main exact concise representations proposed are those based on frequent closed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, non-derivable <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, closed non-derivable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>  (2) and essential patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The first three representations also have the interesting property of being true (also called perfect in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) covers of frequent patterns, since their cardinality is always smaller than that of the frequent pattern set.</p><p>The main originality of the concise representation based on frequent essential patterns stands in the fact that it mainly explores the disjunctive search space where elements are characterized by their respective disjunctive supports, instead of conjunctive ones. It hence makes use of the inclusion-exclusion identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to bridge both conjunctive and disjunctive search spaces. Nevertheless, in spite of such originality, this representation suffers from two major disadvantages: 1. It is not self-contained in the sense that the essential pattern set does not make possible by itself to decide whether a pattern is frequent or not. Hence, such a set has to be burdened by additional elements belonging to the positive border of the order ideal induced by the frequency constraint. 2. Several essential patterns can characterize the same set of objects and, therefore, they present a certain form of redundancy. In this situation, finding a closure operator related to essential patterns would be of paramount importance to get a more reduced concise representation. Indeed, thanks to this operator, many essential patterns will be mapped into the same element within the disjunctive search space. Thus, the obtained representation will be more compact, especially for dense datasets. Furthermore, the simultaneous use of essential patterns and disjunctive closed ones can also ease the detection of their respective disjunctive equivalence classes and, hence, the traversal of the disjunctive search space. This can intensively be explored in many applications as done within the conjunctive search space thanks to their correspondences; minimal generators and closed patterns respectively (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for a study). Indeed, these particular patterns are structurally localized within the associated lattice what gives them more semantics, contrary to other patterns numerically retained (like non-derivable patterns) independently from their localization.</p><p>The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. The next section recalls the key notions used throughout this paper. Section 3 describes the concise representation based on frequent essential patterns. The disjunctive closure operator as well as its main properties are detailed in Section 4, where a new disjunctive closure-based concise representation is also introduced. The empirical evidences about the utility of our approach are provided in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the main related work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Key notions</head><p>In this section, we briefly sketch the key notions used in the remainder of this paper. A pattern can be characterized by three kinds of supports as sketched by the following definition. Definition 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (SUPPORTS OF A PATTERN) Let K = (O, I, R) be an extraction context. We distinguish three kinds of supports associated to a pattern I:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">a b c d 1 × 2 × × 3 × × 4 × × 5 × × × 6 × × × 7 × × × Table 1. An extraction context.</formula><p>-Conjunctive support:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Supp(I ) = | {o ∈ O | (∀ i ∈ I, (o, i) ∈ R)} | -Disjunctive support: Supp(∨I ) = | {o ∈ O | (∃ i ∈ I, (o, i) ∈ R)} | -Negative support: Supp(¬I ) = | {o ∈ O | (∀ i ∈ I, (o, i) / ∈ R)} |</formula><p>A pattern I is said to be frequent if Supp(I ) is greater than or equal to a user-specified minimum support threshold, denoted minsup. Since frequent patterns fulfill the order ideal property <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the supersets of infrequent items will also be infrequent. The set of items I (and consequently the extraction context K) will hence be considered as only containing frequent ones. Infrequent items will thus be pruned. Please also note that Supp(∨I ) ≥ Supp(I ).</p><p>Given the respective disjunctive supports of a pattern's subsets, we are able to derive its conjunctive support using the inclusion-exclusion identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Furthermore, thanks to the De Morgan's law, we are even able to straightforwardly derive its negative support. Lemma 1 shows these important properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 1. (DERIVATION OF THE CONJUNCTIVE AND NEGATIVE SUPPORTS)</head><p>Let I ⊆ I be an arbitrary pattern. Its conjunctive and negative supports are respectively derived as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Supp(I ) = ∅⊂I1⊆I ( -1) | I 1 | -1 Supp( ∨ I 1 )<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">Supp(¬I ) = | O | -Supp( ∨ I ) (2) Example 2.</formula><p>Consider the extraction context of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Given the respective disjunctive supports of bc' subsets (3) , its conjunctive and negative supports are inferred as follows:</p><p>• Supp(bc) = ( -1) |bc| -1 Supp(∨bc) + ( -1) |b| -1 Supp(∨b) + ( -1) |c| -1 Supp(∨c) = -Supp(∨bc) + Supp(∨b) + Supp(∨c) = -5</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">+ 3 + 3 = 1. • Supp(¬bc) = |O| -Supp(∨bc) = 7 -Supp(∨bc) = 7 -5 = 2.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Frequent essential pattern-based concise representation</head><p>The next definition presents the frequent essential patterns. These patterns constitute the core of the concise representation which motivates ours (cf. Section 1). Definition 3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> (FREQUENT ESSENTIAL PATTERN) Let K = (O, I, R) be an extraction context and I ⊆ I. I is an essential pattern iff Supp(∨I ) = max{Supp(∨I\i) | i∈ I}. An essential pattern I is also frequent if Supp(I ) ≥ minsup. <ref type="table">1</ref> for minsup = 1. ad is not an essential pattern since Supp(∨ad) = Supp(∨a) = 7. Whereas bc is an essential pattern since Supp(∨bc) = 5 = max{Supp(∨b), Supp(∨c)} since Supp(∨b) = Supp(∨c) = 3. bc is also frequent since Supp(bc) = 1 ≥ minsup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 3. Consider the extraction context of Table</head><p>The set of frequent essential patterns, denoted FEP K , was proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to be an order ideal in (2 I , ⊆). The following theorem presents the frequent essential patternbased concise representation. BD + (FP K ) denotes the set of maximal frequent patterns, which is used to detect the frequency status of an arbitrary pattern. Theorem 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> The set FEP K of frequent essential patterns increased by BD + (FP K ) constitutes an exact concise representation of the set of frequent patterns.</p><p>It is worth noting that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, this representation was shown not to be perfect, contrary to the authors' claim.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">New disjunctive closure-based concise representation</head><p>Here we detail the main constructs related to the disjunctive closure operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which will make possible to map several essential patterns into a unique element within the disjunctive search space. This is the starting point of our new concise representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The disjunctive closure operator</head><p>Let us start by defining the disjunctive closure operator. Definition 4. (DISJUNCTIVE CLOSURE OPERATOR) Let K = (O, I, R) be an extraction context. The disjunctive closure operator h is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h : P (I) → P (I) I → h(I ) = {i ∈ I | (∀ o ∈ O) ((o, i) ∈ R) ⇒ (∃ i 1 ∈ I )((o, i 1 ) ∈ R)}.</formula><p>Roughly speaking, the disjunctive closure h(I ) of a pattern I is equal to the maximal set of items which only appear in the objects that contain at least an item of I. <ref type="table">1</ref>, the pattern bc is a disjunctive closed pattern since it is equal to the maximal set of items only contained in the set of objects where b or c appears, i.e., {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}. Hence, h(bc) = bc. While acd is not a disjunctive closed pattern since b only appears in the set of objects where at least an item of acd appears. In fact, h(acd) = abcd.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 4. Given the extraction context depicted by Table</head><p>Actually, Definition 4 gives an explicit expression of the disjunctive closure operator, free from the connection operators linking P (I) and P (O). This definition structurally characterizes the disjunctive closure of any pattern X and, hence, allows to straightforwardly compute it from any extraction context. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one allowing the extraction of a concise representation of frequent patterns based on a disjunctive closure operator, and, hence exploring the disjunctive search space. We will denote by DCP K the set of disjunctive closed patterns extracted from a context K. Thanks to the closure operator h, the disjunctive search space is partitioned into distinct disjunctive equivalence classes. In the latter classes, disjunctive closed (resp. essential) patterns are the largest (resp. minimal) elements, w.r.t. set inclusion.</p><p>The following propositions allow to establish the relation between the smallest disjunctive closed pattern containing a pattern I and h(I ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 1. Let I ⊆ I. h(I ) is the smallest disjunctive closed pattern containing</head><formula xml:id="formula_6">I: h(I ) = min ⊆ {f ∈ DCP K | I ⊆ f }. Proposition 2. Let I ⊆ I. Supp( ∨ I ) = Supp( ∨ h(I )).</formula><p>Proposition 3 makes possible to deduce the disjunctive closure of a pattern using the disjunctive closure of one of its subsets, while Proposition 4 establishes the link between disjunctive closed patterns and frequent essential patterns. Proposition 3. Let X ⊆ I and Y ⊆ I be two patterns. We then have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(X ⊆ Y ⊆ h(X )) ⇒ (h(Y ) = h(X )).</formula><p>Proposition 4. Let I ⊆ I and FP K be the set of frequent patterns. We then have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(I ∈ FP K ) ⇒ (∃ f ∈ DCP K and I 1 ∈ FEP K s.t. h(I 1 ) = h(I ) = f and I 1 ⊆ I ).</formula><p>Proof. (Sketch) The proof is based on the fact that the set FEP K is an order ideal in (2 I , ⊆) whose elements are the minimal ones in their associated disjunctive equivalence classes.</p><p>In the remainder of the paper, we will denote by EDCP K (Essential Disjunctive Closed Patterns) the subset of DCP K whose elements have at least a frequent essential pattern as generator. Thanks to Proposition 4, it is easy to show that the disjunctive closures of the patterns belonging to BD + (FP K ) are contained in EDCP K .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 5. Consider the context of Table 1. Within the disjunctive lattice sketched by</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, different sets of patterns are indicated. The essential patterns are shown with bold letters, while the disjunctive closed patterns are underlined. The set FEP K induces an order ideal structure, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> for minsup = 1. Let BD -(FEP K ) be the negative border of FEP K equal to min ⊆ {I ∈ P (I) \ FEP K }. The elements belonging to this border are in italic. An example of a disjunctive equivalence class, induced by the disjunctive closure operator, is also sketched. Its minimal element is the essential pattern a and its largest one is the disjunctive closed pattern abcd. Please note that if, for example, a pattern is in bold letters and is also underlined, then this means that it is both an essential pattern and a disjunctive closed one. As an indication, the patterns belonging to BD + (FP K ) are encircled. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">New disjunctive closure-based concise representation</head><p>It is commonly known that the definition of a concise representation is closely related to the way the whole set of frequent patterns will be generated starting from its elements. Suppose we have at hand the set EDCP K where each element is provided with its disjunctive support (as it is the case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). We need to analyze the "tools" that will be of help in such a regeneration process. To the best of our knowledge, only the formula shown in Lemma 1 makes the link between the disjunctive support of a pattern and its conjunctive one. This formula requires knowing beforehand the disjunctive supports of the subsets of a given candidate to be able to compute its conjunctive support. Hence, an APRIORI-like regeneration is naturally advocated. This manner of regeneration consists in finding the conjunctive supports of 1-patterns, 2-patterns, and so on.</p><p>Let X be a pattern to which we are interested in retrieving its conjunctive support. Reaching X is conditioned by the fact that all its subsets (and more precisely, the immediate ones) are proven to be frequent. Indeed, the set of frequent patterns is an order ideal <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Hence, if a subset of X is infrequent, then X will necessarily be infrequent. Assume now that all subsets of X are frequent. At this step, the main information we have about each subset consists in its disjunctive closure (cf. Proposition 1) and, consequently, its different supports (cf. Lemma 1). If X is included in the closure of one of its immediate subsets, then we have its disjunctive closure and, hence, its disjunctive support (cf. Proposition 3). We can thus compute its conjunctive support. Please note that in this case, X is obviously not an essential pattern. If X is included in none of its subsets' closures, then X is necessarily an essential pattern. However, the closure of X is required to correctly compute its conjunctive support and then deduce if X is frequent or not. Nevertheless, how can we ensure that such a closure belongs to EDCP K ? Indeed, X can be an infrequent pattern and, at the same time, the unique generator of its disjunctive equivalence class. Hence, its closure will necessarily not be in EDCP K (4) . This important part was missed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, what motivates a careful scrutiny to correct the representation and make it really exact.</p><p>At this step of the treatment, to correctly regenerate the whole set of frequent patterns, it is clear that we need the disjunctive closures of frequent patterns (i.e., EDCP K ), augmented by the closures uniquely generated by essential patterns belonging to the negative border of FEP K . These latter closures do not belong to EDCP K , but they bring key information when an infrequent essential pattern is reached. They are also necessarily sufficient because once an infrequent pattern is discovered all its supersets will not be treated. Hence, an important result is that EDCP K is not sufficient to ensure the exact regeneration of the whole frequent pattern set, what makes the claim of the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> incorrect. As characterized in the remainder, some closures should then be added to ensure that some candidates will not be erroneously considered as frequent whereas they are actually infrequent. These closures will form the set ADCP K (Added Disjunctive Closed Patterns). An interesting question will be: how can we reduce the cardinality of ADCP K without affecting the exact regeneration of the whole frequent pattern set? Let X be an infrequent essential pattern belonging to BD -(FEP K ). Let us have a look at the formula establishing the link between the conjunctive and disjunctive supports:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Supp(X ) = ∅⊂X ⊆X ( -1) |X |-1 Supp(∨X ) = (-1) |X|-1 Supp(∨X ) + ∅⊂X ⊂X ( -1) |X |-1 Supp( ∨ X ).</formula><p>Suppose that |X| is even. Hence, ( -1) |X|-1 = -1. Assume now that we did not compute the disjunctive closure f of X. Then, two cases can arise: either X is covered by at least an element in EDCP K or is not covered at all (i.e., ∀ f ∈ EDCP K , X f ). In the latter case, it is obvious that X is infrequent (cf. Proposition 4). Let us analyze the former case. Let f 1 be the smallest closure in EDCP K covering X. It is clear that f ⊆ f 1 (otherwise, the closure of X will never be f ) (5) . Hence, Supp( ∨ f 1 ) ≥ Supp( ∨ f ) = Supp( ∨ X ). Hence, if we use Supp( ∨ f 1 ) in the formula instead of Supp( ∨ X ), the support value we obtain will be lower than or equal to the exact support of X (6) . This does not affect the final decision about the frequency status of X since it is infrequent and the possible decrease of its support will maintain its infrequency status. Hence, if X is an infrequent pattern of even size belonging to BD -(FEP K ), we need not compute its disjunctive closure, what consists in a very interesting pruning. <ref type="table">1</ref> for minsup = 2. Applying an extraction process, we obtain EDCP K = {(b, 3), (c, 3), (d, 3), (abcd, 7)}, where each couple represents a disjunctive closed pattern and its disjunctive support. Let us regenerate the set of frequent patterns. We begin by 1-patterns, i.e., a, b, c and d. The smallest closure containing a is abcd. Hence, its disjunctive support is equal to 7, which also corresponds to its conjunctive support. It is the same for the remaining 1patterns. Thus, we find that their associated conjunctive supports are respectively equal to 7, 3, 3 and 3. We hence have the four candidates frequent. We then handle candidate 2-patterns. Consider the case of bc whose subsets are proven to be frequent. The smallest closure in EDCP K containing bc is abcd. However, abcd is not the actual closure of bc. Nevertheless, this does not affect the final decision about the frequency status of bc. Indeed, three cases should be distinguished: (i) if bc was frequent, hence its closure must belong to EDCP K , (ii) if bc is not covered by the elements of EDCP K then bc is necessarily infrequent, otherwise, (iii) since |bc| = 2, then (-1) |bc|-1 = -1 and hence taking a largest closure (i.e., abcd), instead of the actual one (i.e., bc) will decrease the result obtained thanks to Formula (1) (cf. Lemma 1), and, hence, bc will always be considered as infrequent and no status change can arise. Thus, the closure of bc is not required in the representation when bc is infrequent. Note that the application of Formula (1) is required independently from the frequency status of bc since we cannot guess its status beforehand only if it contains an infrequent subset what is not the case here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 6. Consider the extraction context depicted by Table</head><p>Unfortunately, such a pruning cannot be applied when X is of odd size. Indeed, in this case, ( -1) |X|-1 = +1. Thus, using Supp( ∨ f 1 ) instead of Supp( ∨ X ) will probably lead to the increase of Supp(X ). Consequently, if X is infrequent and we augment its conjunctive support, then this may lead to a support value greater than or equal to minsup what clearly falsifies its frequency status. In this situation, we can further reduce the cardinality of ADCP K by only maintaining the closure f of X if it is included in at least an element of EDCP K . Indeed, a pattern X is eligible to be frequent only if it is covered by a pattern of EDCP K (cf. Proposition 4). This can simply be done once f is computed by set inclusion operations with maximal elements of EDCP K . <ref type="table">1</ref> for minsup = 1. EDCP K = {(b, 3), (c, 3), (d, 3), (bc, 5), (bd, 5), (cd, 5), (abcd, 7)}. As in the previous example, we begin by 1-patterns, i.e., a, b, c and d. We find that their associated conjunctive supports are respectively equal to 7, 3, 3 and 3. We then treat candidate 2-patterns and we find that the different candidates are frequent. We now reach candidate 3-patterns. The unique candidate is bcd since all its subsets are proven to be frequent. bcd hence fulfills the order ideal property of frequent patterns. It is also not contained in the closure of its subsets (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). bcd is hence an essential pattern. If we will apply the same regeneration process to bcd, abcd will be considered as the disjunctive closure of bcd since it is the smallest one in EDCP K containing it. The conjunctive support of bcd will then be equal to 1. However, this is not true because abcd is not the actual disjunctive closure of bcd. The latter should be equal to bcd. Since |bcd| = 3, (-1) |bcd|-1 = +1 and hence taking a largest closure (i.e., abcd), instead of the actual one (i.e., bcd), will augment the conjunctive support of bcd, actually equal to 0, which shifts its status from infrequent to frequent. The problem arises because EDCP K only contains closures having at least a frequent essential pattern as generator. This is not the case of h(bcd) equal to bcd whose unique generator is obviously bcd. Such a closure necessarily does not belong to EDCP K since bcd is infrequent (its conjunctive support is equal to 0). Hence, its closure must be added to the representation to ensure not including bcd with the set of frequent patterns during the regeneration process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 7. Now consider the context of Table</head><p>We now give the formal definition of the set ADCP K that ensures the new representation being exact. Definition 5. Let EP K be the set of the essential patterns that can be extracted from a context K. The set ADCP K is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ADCP K = {h(X ) | (X ∈ BD -(FEP K ) EP K ) ∧ (( -1) |X| = -1) ∧ (∀X ⊆ I, h(X ) = h(X ) ⇒ Supp(X ) &lt; minsup) ∧ (∃f ∈ EDCP K s.t. h(X ) ⊂ f )}.</formula><p>To summarize, ADCP K contains closures generated by infrequent essential patterns of odd sizes belonging to BD -(FEP K ). These closures have all their corresponding essential patterns infrequent and are covered by at least one element of EDCP K . It is important to mention that in ADCP K , we did not consider the disjunctive closures of infrequent non-essential patterns belonging to BD -(FEP K ) since they are already included in EDCP K (cf. Proposition 3).</p><p>The concise representation EDCP K ADCP K will be denoted DCP K rep.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Theorem 2. DCP K rep is an exact concise representation of FP K .</formula><p>The proof of Theorem 2 can be treated as a naive algorithm for deriving frequent patterns and their associated supports.</p><p>In addition to the exact retrieval of frequent patterns as well as their various supports, DCP K rep presents three other main properties: 1. Homogeneity: DCP K rep only involves disjunctive closed patterns (vs. FEP K BD + (FP K )). Hence, it ensures the homogeneity of the representation since all its elements are provided with the same kind of support; the disjunctive one. They also have the same structural properties. Indeed, they are the top elements of their associated equivalence classes within the disjunctive search space. 2. Small size: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the size of EDCP K is shown to be significantly smaller than those of the best known concise representations. In addition, the size of ADCP K is very small since its elements must fulfill many easy-to-check constraints. Hence, the size of DCP K rep will be, in most cases, smaller than those of the other representations.</p></div>

Indeed, for a pattern X s.t. |X| = n, the retrieval process of Supp(X ) from these representations requires the costly evaluation of 2 n deduction rules based on Bonferroniinequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The computation cost for inferring supports is then awfully high. While the retrieval of Supp(X ) from our concise representation only needs to evaluate a unique inclusion-exclusion identity. Furthermore, it allows the straightforward retrieval of the disjunctive and negative supports of frequent patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental results</head><p>We compare, through various experiments, the size of our concise representation to those of the exact ones based on frequent closed, (closed) non-derivable and essential patterns. This is done in the most critical cases, i.e., for strongly correlated datasets (7) . Indeed, within such datasets, the ratio between the cardinality of the frequent pattern set and those of concise representations is high. Thus, we are in the most interesting cases. Moreover, equivalence classes extracted from sparse datasets are often reduced to the associated generators and cannot be compacted anymore. This makes the size reduction rates brought by concise representations meaningless in such datasets. Due to lack of space, we only summarize the main results in this section.</p><p>All experiments were carried out on a PC equipped with a 1.73GHz Centrino Duo Core and 2GB of main memory, and running the Linux version Fedora Core 6 (with 2GB of swap memory). Results are shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. The abbreviation "FP K set"(resp. "FCP K rep" (8) , "N DP K rep", "CN DP K rep", and "FEP K rep") is used to stand for the set of frequent patterns (resp. frequent closed, non-derivable, closed non-derivable and essential pattern-based concise representation). It is important to note that in the experimental results given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the authors have chosen a specific interval of minsup for each dataset to extract CN DP K rep. However, we noticed that their program abruptly comes to an end with an execution error beyond these intervals. Therefore, we use the symbol "-" to designate a case where an execution error occurred. At a glance, we can also deduce the following assertions: 1. Necessity to set up concise representations: Indeed, their respective sizes w.r.t. that of the set of frequent patterns clearly show their utility and potential benefits. In particular, even for high minsup values, the cardinality of the introduced concise representation is considerably reduced. 2. Effectiveness of the proposed concise representation: Indeed, for CHESS, CON-NECT and PUMSB datasets, the size of DCP K rep is significantly reduced compared to those of the remaining concise representations, while offering different kinds of patterns' supports. 3. Scalability of DCP K rep: It is easily observable that, in most cases, the cardinality of DCP K rep is less sensible to the variation of minsup than those of the other concise representations. 4. Absence of an outstanding concise representation: For example, in some cases, the size of DCP K rep is slightly greater than the size of the other concise representations (e.g., MUSHROOM for minsup = 5%).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>First of all, let us make an alignment between the disjunctive search space and the conjunctive one. We will hence find that an essential pattern is the mapping of the concept of minimal generator (aka key pattern and free-set in the literature, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for references) when the conjunctive search space is considered. While the disjunctive closed patterns are the mapping of conjunctive ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The concepts of essential and disjunctive closed patterns can be considered as particular cases of composite items <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> where the disjunction of items is used to compose new items, the composite ones. This is an attempt towards making useful infrequent items in some applications. For example, consider the context of Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and let minsup = 4, b and c are hence infrequent items since their support is equal to 3. Nevertheless, the support of b∨c is equal to 5 and, hence, Supp(b∨c) ≥ minsup. b∨c will be considered as a new item (a composite one) even if, actually it is composed of two items. It will be used during the mining process since it is frequent what makes b and c useful.</p><p>It is important to make the link between our work and that of Zhao et al. Indeed, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the authors proposed connection operators to link P (I) and P (O) for the case of disjunctive Boolean expressions. Nevertheless, their definition of the operator linking P (O) to P (I) depends on that ensuring the opposite direction and was not independently given from any other operator. Furthermore, they neither proposed the expression of the resulting closure operator nor carried out a thorough analysis of inherent structural properties.</p><p>The disjunction operator (i.e., the operator ∨) has also been used to define some concise representations only exploring the conjunctive search space, like those based on disjunction-free sets and (generalized) disjunction-free generators <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>  (9) . This required the introduction of what is called disjunctive rule. Such a rule has a premise part composed by a conjunction of items and a conclusion part, distinct from the premise one, containing a specified number of items linked using the disjunction operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Some works <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> were interested in using disjunction within association rules to define what is called generalized association rules. These rules grasped the interest of many researchers since they offer wealthier types of knowledge in many applications. In addition to the inclusive disjunction operator, i.e., the operator ∨, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> were also interested in the exclusive disjunction operator, denoted ⊕. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the author mainly focusses on association rules having conclusions containing mutually exclusive items, i.e., the presence of one of them leads to the absence of the others, what is expressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> using the operator ⊕. Other forms of generalized association rules were also described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and future work</head><p>In this paper, we presented a new disjunctive closure operator as well as its main properties. Based on this operator, we introduced a new concise representation which corrects the claim of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> where the associated representation can miss some cases. This required the addition of few further elements what ensures the correctness of the whole regeneration process of frequent patterns. In addition to interesting compactness rates, our concise representation allows a straightforward computation of the disjunctive and negative supports. The experimental results showed that, in most cases, its size is significantly smaller than those of the best known concise representations. It is worth noting that our approach can easily be extended when negative items are handled.</p><p>Other avenues for future work mainly address the following points: First, due to space limitations here, we intend to address as next step the complexity time issue (generation and derivability) of our representation vs. those of the literature. In this respect, other algorithms for mining conjunctive closed patterns could be adapted to disjunctive ones, both breadth-first search algorithms and depth-first ones. Second, a structural characterization of disjunctive closed patterns w.r.t. existing frameworks like the k-free sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> will be done. Another important task consists in overcoming the lack in the literature of semantics' studies related to concise representations. The study of the possible extension of our representation to other pattern classes should also be examined. Finally, the extraction of generalized association rules will be thoroughly addressed. Indeed, setting up a theoretical framework that includes different kinds of operators is of paramount importance for jumping beyond standard association rules.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Definition 1 .Example 1 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>(EXTRACTION CONTEXT) An extraction context is a triplet K = (O, I, R), where O represents a finite set of objects, I is a finite set of items and R is a binary (incidence) relation (i.e., R ⊆ O × I).
