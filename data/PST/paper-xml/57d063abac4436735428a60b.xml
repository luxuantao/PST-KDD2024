<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Roof-top solar photovoltaic systems are normally invisible to system operators, meaning that their generated power is not monitored. If a significant number of systems are installed, invisible solar power could significantly alter the net load in power systems. In this paper, a data-driven methodology is proposed to estimate the power generation of invisible solar power sites by using the measured values from a small number of representative sites. The proposed methodology is composed of a data dimension reduction engine and a mapping function. A number of established methods for reducing the dimension of large-scale data is investigated, and a hybrid method based on k-means clustering and principal component analysis is proposed. The output of this block provides a small subset of sites whose measured data are used in the mapping function. We have implemented several mapping functions to estimate the total generation power of all sites based on the measured output of the selected subset of sites. Numerical results based on data from California's power system are presented.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I NVISIBLE solar power generation refers to the solar power capacity that is not monitored by, and thus not visible to, power system operators. Mainly in the form of small-scale, roof-top photovoltaic (PV) modules, invisible solar power generation is a growing reality in power systems. California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission, through the Go Solar California campaign, have announced a goal of 3,000.0 MW of solar power installations on homes and businesses by the end of year 2016. The state seems to be well on track to reach this goal; the installed capacity reached 2,374.0 MW of residential and commercial solar PV installations through 246,266 small scale projects at the end of April 2015 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. New worldwide small-scale roof-top solar power installations reached 23 GW in 2013, and is expected to continue growing at a rate of above 20 additional GW per year until 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Several factors contribute to the growing trend in adopting solar power in residential and commercial settings. The cost of solar power generation has continuously declined over the past decade. For example, the turnkey cost of solar power systems in California has dropped from 11 $/W in 2007 to 5.5 $/W in 2014 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In some regions, government policy has promoted and in some cases subsidized solar power generation to respond to environmental concerns around electricity generation. For example, in Ontario, Canada, the Government put in place a generous initial $0.8/kWh feed-in-tariff in year 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref> that led to a boom in solar power industry in this province. Technology breakthroughs on the energy storage side of solar generation systems are also expected to be a defining factor in future growth of solar power. The latest announcement by Tesla Motors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> promises to make its Powerwall <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> accessible and affordable in near future, which will likely make roof-top solar power generation an even more attractive option.</p><p>Despite the environmental benefits of solar power generation, rapid growth of invisible solar generation could potentially pose new challenges in power systems operation. Solar power basically adds negative demand to the system, i.e., when it is available, it reduces the system's total electricity demand. At a high penetration rate, solar power generation can thus impact the system's net load pattern significantly. Net load is defined as the conventional electricity load minus the nondispatchable generation. On the other hand, system net load is a key input when scheduling the short term operation of power systems. Thus, estimating the system net load in presence of significant invisible solar power generation is of interest. In theory, one may estimate the total solar power generation in the system by monitoring and measuring every single solar generation site. However, with the growing number of small solar sites, this may not be practically possible. Building an infrastructure to monitor, collect, archive and manage solar power generation data for every small-scale site could become very costly. On the other hand, concerns around privacy make it difficult for power utilities to make a plausible case for continuously collecting and using solar power data from private sites. Hence, estimating invisible solar power generation could be a challenge for power utilities.</p><p>The industry has already started exploring options to bring a level of visibility to roof-top solar power generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. In late 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy approved funding for several projects to deal with this issue. Defined by several industry partners, these projects are meant to develop methods for making roof-top solar power generation more predictable <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no literature yet exists that addresses the problem of estimating invisible solar power generation in power systems.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate electricity generation from invisible solar PV resources using data mining tools. The idea is to identify a limited number of solar PV sites whose data could be used to estimate the total power generation from a much larger set of sites. The proposed methodology has two main components, i.e., data dimension reduction and output estimation. For data dimension reduction, we use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, the k-means Clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, a hybrid k-means+PCA approach proposed in this work, Relief <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>, and the Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> techniques. For output estimation, we employ a variety of well established methodologies, including, linear regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, Kalman filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, and Wavelet Neural Networks (WNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. The main contribution of this paper is to investigate how data-mining could be employed to estimate the aggregated solar power generation from a large set of solar power sites without continuously measuring the output of every single site.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, the proposed methodology is introduced in Section II. Then, numerical results are presented in Section III. Finally the paper concludes in Section IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY</head><p>In this section the proposed framework for estimation of invisible solar generation is introduced. We assume that actual, measured data over a limited period of time is available for the large set of PV sites for which the aggregated output needs to be estimated on an ongoing basis. For example, the data could be arranged to be collected for a 4-month period for all sites of interest. This set of limited data is used to identify a small number of informative sites. We demonstrate that those few sites are the only ones that need to be continuously monitored, and they provide enough information to estimate the total generated power from all the sites.</p><p>Although the methodologies in this paper are developed assuming there is a clean set of measurements available for the region, this may be a challenge in practice. However, the data that we have used is sufficient to establish a base for invisible solar power estimations and the challenges involved. The proposed methodology will be the basis for the authors' future works that are focused on particularly two issues, i.e., how to minimize the impacts of data availability limitations on model's performance, and how to make the model adaptable to new addition of solar sites in the region. Note that the new generation of solar power production systems give the owners the option to monitor and publish their power production data to public sites. An example is the system provided by Enphase <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. As the popularity of such systems increases, more and more data will be available in the future, that would certainly help improving invisible solar power estimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. General Framework</head><p>The proposed methodology is developed in four stages, as follows:</p><p>1) Data Collection From the Entire Solar Power Generation Fleet: In this stage, power generation data and any other information are collected from the available sites within the territory of interest over a limited time period. Our analyses showed that three to four months worth of data was sufficient to provide reasonable results. While collecting such data on a continuous basis may be very costly and impractical, doing so for a limited period of time could be managed. Denote the measured output power of site i at time t by p i (t), for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , I}. I denotes the number of solar PV generation sites for which the total output generation is to be estimated. We also assume that the location of every single site is known and specified by its longitude and latitude, referred to here by Lon i and Lat i for site i, respectively. In addition to power generation and location information, there could be M other variables for which the measurements are collected (e.g., temperature, cloud coverage, etc.). We refer to those variables by x (m) i , m ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , M}. Assume measurements are available for all variables for T time steps. Thus, the complete set of available information for all sites can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = p i (t), Lon i , Lat i , x (m) i (t)| ∀i = 1, . . . , I, ∀m = 1, . . . , M, ∀t = 1, . . . , T . (1)</formula><p>We also define the measured total power generation for all the sites as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P tot (t) = I i=1 p i (t) ∀t = 1, . . . , T.</formula><p>(2)</p><p>2) Data Dimension Reduction: In this stage, a data dimension reduction methodology is used to reduce the complete information set S into set S , as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S = p j (t), Lon j , Lat j , x (m) j (t)| ∀j = 1, . . . , J, ∀m = 1, . . . , M, ∀t = 1, . . . , T (3)</formula><p>where, J is a smaller set of sites whose information could be used to reasonably estimate the total generated power by all I sites. In general, I is very large, whereas J I. Observe that depending on the characteristics of the data dimension reduction technique, availability of data, quality of each of the measured variables, and the modeler's other preferences, a subset of the available information, say S (.) ⊆ S, may be used at this stage.</p><p>We have used five selected data dimension reduction methodologies in this work, as explained in Section II-B.</p><p>3) Building the Mapping Function: In this stage, the parameters of a mapping function are estimated. The function maps the total power generation from all I sites to the information from the J selected sites. Define the estimated total power generation from all sites by Ptot (t). The model, referred to here by f , can be generically described as follows: where, is the mapping error. Data of prior times to t may also be included in the inputs. In (4) lag indicates the lag times in the input data. The objective of building the model is to estimate the mapping function f such that the difference between the values of P tot (t) and Ptot (t) are minimized. In this paper, four mapping functions are explored, as explained in Section II-C.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ptot (t) = f S t,t-1,...,t-lag +<label>(4)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Aggregated Output Estimation:</head><p>In the last stage, measurements from only the J selected sites are used as the input to the mapping function of the previous stage. The output is an estimate of the total power from all I sites. Measurements from other sites are no longer needed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> summarizes the above four stages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Employed Data Dimension Reduction Techniques</head><p>In this work, we implement five data dimension reduction techniques, namely, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k-means Clustering, a proposed hybrid k-means+PCA approach, Relief, and Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS). These methods have been used previously in the literature in similar applications and good performance has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. However, the proposed methodology does not rely on a specific technique.</p><p>1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a wellknown linear dimension reduction technique. It is very fast and computationally efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. It constructs a low-dimensional representation of the data that describes the most probable variance in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. PCA is found to perform better than non-linear complex classification approaches in natural databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. It has been applied in Synchrophasor data dimensionality reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, extracting the distinct features of fault component <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, wind farm a, and grouping of wind parks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. More details on formulation and implementation of this method can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The primary output of the PCA method is lower dimensional data. If fact, it uses all of the available information and maps them to the new space using different principal vectors, where each has information amount relative to its corresponding eigenvalue. However, the ultimate goal here is to rank and select the candidate sites. In order to do so, different methodologies could be used. In this work, backward elimination technique is applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. This procedure ranks all the sites based on the information they contain. The reasoning behind backward elimination method is that an Eigen vector related to a small Eigen value correspond to near-constant relationships among a subset of sites. If one of the variables involved in such a relationship is removed, little information will be lost. An obvious choice would be the variable with the highest coefficient in absolute value in the relevant Eigen vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In the present research work, we only had access to power generation and locational information of each site. No other measured variables were available. We applied the PCA technique to power generation values, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S PCA = {p i (t)| ∀i = 1, . . . , I, ∀t = 1, . . . , T}.</formula><p>(5)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) k-Means Clustering:</head><p>This technique basically reduces the dimension of the input data by grouping the sites into clusters. The objective is to find clusters that contain as many similar sites as possible yet are different from other clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. In practice, the number of individual roof-top sites could be very large. Adding the time dimension to the problem, one can appreciate that the number of variables used to find a small number of clusters could easily grow very large, and make the method computationally impractical <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. Thus, in this work, we have only included the locational information of the sites, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S KM = {Lon i , Lat i | ∀i = 1, . . . , I}. (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>The rationale is that the sites that are geographically close, are perhaps subject to similar solar regimes and thus, their outputs are close. The idea here is to group the I sites into a small number of cluster of sites, say J, and choose a representative site from each cluster. Applying this technique leads to J clusters. The method provides a centroid for each cluster, which is not necessarily coincident with any of the sites. We choose the site that has the minimum distance to the cluster centroid as the site representing the cluster.</p><p>3) Proposed Hybrid k-Means+PCA Approach: Using each of the two previously discussed techniques may not always yield the best outcome. Although PCA is fast and efficient, it sometimes does not find good solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. Furthermore, since k-means in the current work only relies on the locational data, it only selects the site that is closest to the centroids regardless of the quality of its data. To mitigate these issues, we propose a hybrid k-means+PCA approach to benefit from the strengths of both of these approaches. Hence, the input information set for this approach is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S PA = {p i (t), Lon i , Lat i | ∀i = 1, . . . , I, ∀t = 1, . . . , T}. (7)</formula><p>The proposed hybrid k-means+PCA technique has the following steps:</p><p>Step 1) Apply the k-means Clustering on the I sites and find the J clusters.</p><p>Step 2) For each cluster repeat the following steps.</p><p>Step 3) Find the Euclidian distance of each site in the cluster to the centroid.</p><p>Step 4) Sort the sites based on the calculated Euclidian distance. Then, calculate the cumulative distance of the sites, and normalize the cumulative distances based on the last cumulative distance. Step 5) Rank all of the sites in the cluster using the PCA technique.</p><p>Step 6) Form a matrix whose first column shows the site numbers in the order from highest to lowest PCA ranks. The second column contains the associated normalized cumulative distances.</p><p>Step 7) Choose the first site for which the cumulative distance is less than a pre-specified threshold α, however, the cumulative distance for the next site in the column is more than α. The site associated with the selected order is the representative for the corresponding cluster. α is a measure that forces the selected site to be closer to the centroid compared to at least (1 -α) × 100% of the sites in the cluster. If such cumulative distance is not found, choose the first site that has lower cumulative distance compared to the next site in the column. If none of the conditions hold, choose the site with the highest PCA rank in Step 5. This algorithm is represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The above steps find the site that takes into account the information from both k-means Clustering and PCA methods. Although the priority is based on within-cluster PCA ranks, the threshold α considers the distances such that the site with highest possible PCA rank and closest to the centroid point is chosen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Relief:</head><p>The Relief is well-established feature selection approach, proposed by Kira et. al, and inspired by instancebased learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. In our particular application, it selects the sites that are statistically relevant to the target variable, e.g., P tot (t). By defining an instance from a selected subset of sites, Relief assigns weights for the different sites which are iteratively computed for each randomly selected instance together with its corresponding near-hit and near-miss instances. The closest instance within the same class set is the near-hit instance while the near-miss instance is the closest instance in the opposite class set. It uses Euclidean distance for selecting near-hit and near-miss instances. Finally, relevant sites are chosen when they have weights larger than the specified threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. Relief was later extended for multi-class classification problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. Relief was recently implemented in applications such as electricity price forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, load forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> and probabilistic modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. Hence, it was explored as a candidate data dimension reduction technique. We use the power generation at individual sites as the input for Relief, similar to the input for PCA method defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Correlation-Based Feature Selection (CFS):</head><p>The idea here is to select the sites that have a high correlation with the target yet having low correlation with each other. This is the basis of the CFS that was introduced by Hall <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. Because of its good speed and efficiency, it has been used in feature selection applications such as electricity load forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, and electricity price classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. Hence, we also employ CFS as one of the data dimension reduction techniques. We use generation data as the input to the CFS.</p><p>While the data reduction methods may have some similarities, we use them to diversify the numerical experiments and determine how exactly each method may perform in this particular application.</p><p>The first three data dimension reduction tasks are performed in MATLAB R . Relief and CFS are implemented using the java-based Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Model Estimation</head><p>The goal of this stage is to estimate the aggregated generation of all of the I sites, using only the data of J selected sites. Four mapping functions are explored in this section, i.e., linear regression, Kalman filter, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Wavelet Neural Networks (WNN).</p><p>1) Linear Regression: Linear regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> finds a linear relationship between the inputs and output of the model. Based on (4), the inputs of the linear regression model are p j (t), p j (t -1), . . . , p j (tlag), ∀j = 1, . . . , J, and its output is Ptot (t). Linear regression is very simple and easy to implement and hence, might be of great interest in industrial applications.</p><p>2) Kalman Filter: Kalman filter is a very useful tool that expresses the dynamics of a system by state-space equations. It takes into account uncertainties such as measurement and process noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. Hence, it could be beneficial in invisible solar estimation and thus is implemented here. In the current study, an Auto Regressive (AR) model is used to model the linear relationship of P tot (t) to its previous lags. Moreover, measurement errors or any other source of uncertainty, such as passing clouds over the PV modules, are also considered. In general, each site has different characteristics and equipments and thus, the errors associated with their measurements would be different. However, in the current work there is no information available about the site's reliability. Hence, the uncertainty is assumed to be relative to the capacity of the sites, i.e., the sources of uncertainty are assumed to be the same across the sites. It is also assumed that the uncertainty of the sites are not correlated to each other.</p><p>3) Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP): Artificial neural networks are powerful tools for mapping a set of input variables to an output variable. MLP is one of the most frequently used engines in different applications and can be used to approximate any continuous nonlinear function to any accuracy level <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. MLP has been implemented to approximate non-linear functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, and forecasting applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. The inputs of the MLP are data of selected J sites and the output of the model is the aggregated generation value of the total number of sites. Hence, the MLP has J inputs and only one output. The MLP is trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. The LM is known as an efficient and fast training algorithm for highly non-linear neural networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Wavelet Neural Networks (WNN):</head><p>The WNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> is a type of neural network whose activation functions in the hidden layer are Wavelet functions. WNNs have been used in different forecasting applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> and have shown promising results. Thus, a WNN with multidimensional Morlet Wavelet as the activation function is explored in this paper for the estimation stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>Ideally, proper numerical simulations for the proposed method should be done based on a very large set of roof-top solar module data. Collecting and processing such large set of data is still an ongoing effort by the authors. Observe that it is not a mandatory requirement for roof-top solar panel owners to collect and archive their power production data. Thus, finding relevant data in the public domain for expanding our numerical experiments has been challenging. We, however, believe that the presented numerical results provide good insight into the applicability of the proposed method.</p><p>For the purpose of proving the concept in this paper, we have used the NREL solar data <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>, that is readily available. This set of data contains the estimated production of 405 PVsites across California. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the locations of the 405 sites. This number of sites is obviously far smaller than that  of roof-top sites, yet we think the data could be used to prove the concept. We have downscaled the capacity of the sites to 1-50 kW to represent residential and commercial solar PV systems. We have used hourly production data. The daily total peak generation for the test data varies between 1,147.0 kW and 4,217.0 kW. This indicates that the data includes a variety of solar production regimes from high power during sunny days to lower power during cloudy days. Most of the sites are concentrated in western and southern California, where the major cities are located. The dataset includes production values for each individual site for a full year. We use four months worth of data for training the process, and use the remaining eight months for out-of-sample testing. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the scatter plot of the correlation coefficients among individual sites versus their physical distances. As expected, there are high correlations between closer sites, and thus, reducing the dimension of the data should not lead to loss of significant amount of information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data Dimension Reduction</head><p>We applied the five data dimension reduction techniques discussed in Section II-B to the hourly generation data for the 405 sites from the dataset. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the location of the selected sites by each of the five techniques when selecting the 15 most informative sites. While different methods select different sites, in general, the selected sites represent all concentrations of the sites across the sate. Among all the techniques, k-means shows better diversity in the placement of the selected sites. There is a reasonable similarity between the sites selected by Relief and CFS, which roots in the way these models select them. However, PCA selects the sites mainly in south where more generation capacity is available. The hybrid k-means+PCA technique selects the sites that have the properties of the sites selected by both k-means Clustering and PCA techniques alone. As the figure shows, these sites are very close to those of the k-means approach. Since the combined approach still selects only one site for each cluster, between the two close sites the one with a higher PCA rank will be selected. These results are slightly different compared to those of the k-means technique. The value of threshold α has a key role in the performance of the hybrid k-means+PCA technique. Very small values of α lead to results closer to k-means Clustering, whereas large values of α move the results toward those of the PCA technique. The best α is found by trial and error, which is 0.01 that is used for the reported results in this paper.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> compares the capacity of the top 15 selected sites. As could be seen, PCA selects the sites with the maximum or close to maximum capacity. Other approaches select the sites from a variety of capacities. This means that the PCA is biased to the capacity of the sites. We also used the normalized data of the sites in the PCA approach, which in turn results in different ranking for the sites. However, the final estimation accuracy were not satisfactory and hence they are not reported here.</p><p>Table I also reveals that, for the selected top 15 sites, there is only one common site between PCA and the hybrid k-means+PCA approach. However, 10 sites are common between k-means Clustering and the hybrid k-means+PCA approach. Moreover, the capacity of the different sites are usually higher than those selected from k-means but none of them is 50 kW.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Estimating Invisible Solar PV Generation</head><p>We use the four mapping techniques, i.e., linear regression, Kalman filter, MLP, and WNN to estimate the hourly aggregated generation of the I = 405 sites in the dataset. For the MLP and WNN, respectively, 50 and 4 hidden neurones are found, by trial and error, to be the best configuration for this dataset. Furthermore, it has been found by trial and error that 24 hours was the best lag for the AR in the Kalman filter. In addition, in linear regression and the WNN, previous data associated with lags of {1, 2, 24, 25, 48} hours are also included in the inputs. "Trial and error" here means that the authors have done the simulations using different configurations and the best results based on the eight months test data are reported here. On the other hand, these lags are not included in the Kalman filter and the MLP. Since the relation of aggregated generation with its past values is modeled by AR in the Kalman filter we did not include individual site's lagged values. Moreover, since including the lags will increase the number of the inputs, and thus complexity, of the MLP, the final results found to be worse compared to only using data of time t.</p><p>We use average daily Root Mean Squared Error (DRMSE) values to measure the accuracy of the proposed approach, which is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">DRMSE = 1 ND ND d=1 ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1 N d t∈T d P tot (t) -Ptot (t) 2 ⎫ ⎬ ⎭<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where, ND is total number of test days, N d is the number of daylight hours of day d, and T d is the set of all daylight time stamps on day d. The RMSE values are calculated for each day only for daylight hours and then their averages over the 8-month test period are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. The smallest DRMSE among each estimation model is highlighted in gray. Moreover, in the table the results for the best combination of data reduction approach and estimation function for each number of selected sites is shown in bold font. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, observe that the k-means Clustering algorithm generally serves better than other individual data reduction approaches for all four estimation engines. This means that locational data is very valuable in order to select the best candidate sites. However, in some cases, such as the case with 10 sites in the linear model, PCA has less estimation error compared to the k-means sites. In addition, Relief and CFS are the worst approaches to select the candidate sites and the final estimation errors are high for all of the four models.</p><p>The other observation from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> is that the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA data reduction method shows significant improvements in the final estimation results in most of the cases compared to the k-means Clustering and PCA approaches. In fact, in most of the cases the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA approach outperforms all four individual data reduction techniques. Although we expect less DRMSE by selecting more sites, this does not always hold, specially when using k-means approach. The reason is that in some cases, the centroid site does not have a good quality output behavior to be able to represent the neighboring sites. This leads to less accurate results. The proposed hybrid k-means+PCA approach solves the issue of bad site selections for k-means, e.g., selection of 9-10 sites. Moreover, the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA data dimension reduction approach leads to lower errors compared to the other approaches. From the table, and for this particular dataset, the linear regression model along with the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA data dimension reduction method has outperformed other methods from a DRMSE viewpoint. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> depicts box plot of the estimation errors during daylight hours for the two best models, i.e., hybrid k-means+PCA approach with linear regression in the top and WNN on the bottom. As both Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Table II reveal, the more sites used, the better the results could be. However, the rate of estimation accuracy improvement decreases as the number of the sites increases. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> clearly shows that the difference between the performance of the two best models is marginal for J = 15 and above. This means that although using more sites leads to better results, there needs to be a tradeoff between the number of selected sites and the desired accuracy of the estimations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> depicts the estimation results, along with the actual values, for the linear regression function and the proposed hybrid kmeans+PCA data reduction approach for J = 15. In the top plot, the method estimates the total power generation reasonably well for the high-production days. However, for the cloudy days that seem to have had less sunshine, the model misses the actual values to some extent. This is mainly because no weather-related information is included in the simulations  and the models are purely built based on past power values. As the bottom plot shows, better estimations are made for the days that have a consistent power production pattern. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> shows the estimation results and actual values for a sunny day at the top and a cloudy day on the bottom. As the figure shows, the model performs very well on sunny days but has higher errors of up to 200 kW on the cloudy day.</p><p>Daily peak is an important measure in power system operation. Daily solar power generation peak error results in wrong calculation of the daily net load valley, which in turn could jeopardize the security of the system and impose extra costs.  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> summarizes the average daily peak estimation errors for different approaches over the estimation period, i.e., 8 months, for J = 15. From this figure, the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA approach performs better than other data reduction techniques for both the average and standard deviation of the errors. Another observation is that although MLP and WNN perform relatively close to the other two strategies using PCA and k-means, their results for the Relief and CFS are worse than others. This means that neural networks could be more sensitive to data reduction methods for daily peak estimation. In addition, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> presents box plot of the daily peak estimation error for different approaches with J = 15. This figure also confirms that the hybrid k-means+PCA approach performs better than other data reduction techniques and the best results are associated with linear regression and WNN estimation functions.</p><p>We also analyzed the daily energy estimation errors for all the combinations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> shows the related daily energy estimation errors for different methods for Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>. Average daily ramp rate error for J = 15 candidate sites. KM: k-means; PA: the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA approach; Rel: Relief; Lin: linear regression; Kal: Kalman filter.

Similar to the previous case, the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA data reduction is the best of the models. However, here the improvements compared to the k-means or PCA is marginal. Moreover, the difference between Relief and CFS compared to others is very high and they performed poorly in this regard. The results also show that the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA data reduction technique along with linear regression or WNN outperforms other methods.</p><p>Ramp rate, which is the changes of power generation during a specified time interval is a critical parameter in system operation. In this work, we have defined morning ramp rate as the average hourly change in the aggregated generation from 7 to 10 am. Similarly, afternoon ramp rate is defined as the average hourly change during 3 pm to 6 pm. The mean and standard deviation of average morning and afternoon ramp rate errors of different models is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>. These results also show that the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA data We have also analyzed the results to see how often the estimated total power generation values differ from the actual values by less than 5% of the peak generation, and the results are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref> for J = Observe that the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA approach outperforms all of other data techniques by missing the margin in about 2.2% of the time in both linear regression and the WNN estimation functions.</p><p>We have also analyzed the results separately for high and low generation days to see how the proposed approach works on sunny and cloudy days. In order to do this, we have considered days that have daily aggregated peak generation of less than 3,000 kW, which is 70% of the annual peak generation, to be low generation days. Out of 245 test days, 27 days were considered to have low generation. The 70% threshold is chosen to have enough 'low' generation test days for reasonable conclusions. Note that because of the generally good sunshine regime in California most of the test days in our case study have a high daily peak solar power generation. Only 2 days and 9 days have the daily peak of less than 2000 kW and 2500 kW, respectively. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">14</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">15</ref> show box plot of daily peak and energy estimation errors of the two day types tor J = 15 for the best combination of models, respectively. Observe from the figures that in all of the cases the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA data dimension reduction approach outperforms the other approaches for both high and low generation days and its results are more robust compared to the k-means and PCA approaches. Both figures also show that the errors are generally higher for cloudy days compared to sunny days. However, results from the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA data dimension reduction approach are more stable compared to the other approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposes a methodology to estimate total generation from invisible solar PV sites. The proposed method has two main components, i.e., a data dimension reduction engine and a mapping function. The data dimension reduction engine selects a small subset of most informative sites from the large set of all available sites. The mapping function estimates the total power generation of all sites based on the data from the selected subset of sites. We use PCA, k-means Clustering, Relief, and CFS for data dimension reduction. We also propose a new hybrid k-means+PCA data reduction approach that combines k-means Clustering with PCA. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the solar PV generation data of California's power system with a total of 405 sites. We provide discussions on average daily root mean squared estimation error, daily peak estimation error, daily energy estimation error, and ramp rate estimation error.</p><p>The results showed that the proposed framework is capable of estimating invisible solar generation with a good accuracy. In addition, the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA approach is found to outperform all of other data dimension reduction techniques. Although WNN showed similar or slightly better results compared to linear regression, considering the simplicity of the latter, it may better suite practical applications. In addition, the combination of linear regression and the proposed hybrid k-means+PCA dimension reduction method was found to generally outperform other combinations with respect to estimating the daily peak, total generated energy, and morning and afternoon ramps.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
