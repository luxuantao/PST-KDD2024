<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PURPOSE of motion control is to maintain a prescribed</head><p>A motion for the control object by applying compensating corrective torques or forces. Motion controlled systems intended for autonomous operation need optimization as well as a capacity of adapting to new and rapidly changing operating conditions.</p><p>The optimality of such control design is therefore meaningful to consider, Linear optimal control based on linearized equations of motion is a standard approach to the solution of such problems. Nonlinear dynamics with motion constraints and rapidly changing operating conditions sometimes make such control problems difficult. The rigid body mechanics of flight control or robot manipulator motion is often formulated with the general equations obtained from Lagrangian mechanics (time arguments omitted)</p><p>The position coordinates q E R " with associated velocities q and accelerations q are controlled with the driving forces r E R " . The (generalized) moment of inertia M ( q ) , the Coriolis, centripetal, and frictional forces C(q, q)q, and the gravitational forces G ( q ) all vary along the trajectories.</p><p>The control problem can be stated as follows: to find the torques (forces) 7 so that the control object follows a trajectory, provided that equations (1) of the rigid body mechanics are known. From the standpoint of linear quadratic control theory, it is natural to include the torques (forces) in the performance index. Attempts to design linear quadratic control often fail, however, due to the position-dependent nonlinear behavior of the system expressed in (1).</p><p>Both optimal control and adaptive control [ 111 are relevant in this context. Various adaptive control algorithms were earlier proposed in robotics by Tomizuka et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. Dubowsky and  DesForges [7] proposed an adaptive control that adjusts feedback gains to follow a reference model. <ref type="bibr">Koivo and Guo [20]</ref> used an autoregressive model to fit data. Both these teams assumed the interaction forces among the joints to be negligible. The idea is to use state feedback to enable exact cancellation of nonlinear terms and factors followed by optimal control design for the simplified system.</p><p>Linear optimal control solutions are standard and rely on linearized equations with regard to an operating point. <ref type="bibr">Saridis and Lee [28]</ref> made early work on self-optimizing control in robotics and <ref type="bibr">Luo and Saridis [25]</ref> studied linear quadratic design of PID controllers. Apart from approximate solutions, there are also approaches with suboptimal solutions based on the nonlinear equations. <ref type="bibr">Lee and Chen [22]</ref> proposed a suboptimal nonlinear control design based on quasi-linearization and linear optimal control. Discrete-time adaptive control, based on linearized dynamics around preplanned trajectories, was proposed by Lee and  Chung [23].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>There are two natural choices of the control variable for computation of optimal motion control. One approach is based on minimization of local accelerations, velocities, and positions. Solution of the linear quadratic control problem provides the optimal accelerations and the corresponding torques can be calculated with the ''exact linearization" or "computed torque" method. This optimization is based on linear system dynamics with double integrator action and does not include the nonlinear dynamics of (1). Thus, control is not optimized with respect to the applied torques.</p><p>However, optimization criteria with penalties on the torques rather than accelerations lead to complicated trajectory-dependent mathematical problems. Methods hitherto published generally require cumbersome trajectory-dependent numerical or approximate solutions 1221, [28], <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</p><p>There would appear to exist no analytic solution to the quadratic control problem of motion described by equations of Lagrangian mechanics. It is the purpose of this paper to present stable analytic solutions to the problem of quadratic optimal control of motion control with minimization of the applied torques (forces) when velocity and position measurements are available. An optimal control approach is adopted to solve a Hamilton -Jacobi equation and present feedback solutions to the stated optimal motion control problem. The given problem is reduced into two separate problems:</p><p>1) explicit solution of an optimal tracking problem with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation,</p><p>2) adaptive control.</p><p>The solutions to the two problems permit the following:</p><p>-optimization of a performance index, -stability, -trajectory planning. Thus, separated solutions are obtained for optimality and adaptation. The approach should be of interest in robot manipulator control, biomechanics, flight control, and other branches of applied mechanics.</p></div>

RIGID BODY DYNAMICS</head><p>We model the motion dynamics as a set of n rigid bodies connected and described by a set of generalized coordinates q E R " .

SELF-OPTIMIZING ADAPTATION</head><p>The calculation of the appropriate applied torques T* corresponding to the optimal control (43) can be viewed as a feedforward control with respect to M , C , G and its accuracy is thus dependent on adequate knowledge of M , C , G (cf. "exact linearization" or the "computed torque" method). In cases with uncertain or time-varying parameters of M , C , G, there is a need of identification and adaptation of the optimal control to the operating conditions. Adaptation of the "exact linearization" or the "computed torque" method is easily implemented only if accelerations are available to measurement. The optimal control algorithm (43) presented here, however, is easily modified for self-optimizing adaptive control.</p><p>The matrices M, C , G are assumed in A6 to have a known structure but the parameters are now assumed unknown (cf. A7).

DISCUSSION A N D CONCLUSIONS A time-variant optimal control problem of rigid body motion has been solved with explicit solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The algorithm optimizes the trajectories with respect to position errors, velocity errors, and the forces (torques) that affect the kinetic energy, but not with respect to gravitation. The optimal solution provides asymptotically stable optimal control. Globally stable adaptive control for self-optimization has been designed to solve the case of uncertain parameters.</p><p>The proposed solutions contribute to an understanding of the close connections between classical mechanics and optimization theory for motion control. The matrix K of (35) represents a spring action around the given reference position, whereas terms containing M ( q ) represent kinetic energy. The Hamiltonian Y = .T+ i/ of analytical mechanics may be compared to the Hamilton-Jacobi solution V ( 2 , t ) that represents a sum of kinetic energy and "potential" energy of a spring action described by a stiffness matrix K . The spring action thus formally replaces gravitation as the source of potential energy.</p><p>The optimal control algorithm presented here exhibits a certain similarity to the linear quadratic control problem. Equation ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) and the algebraic Riccati equation are similar, but the solutions are very different. Although the Riccati equation solution is positive definite, the present algorithm does not generally provide a symmetric weighting matrix To. Secondly, the sohtion to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the linear quadratic control case differs in structure from the solution (35) of the present work.</p><p>The optimal control is globally asymptotically stable, whereas the self-optimizing adaptive control is globally stable in the sense of Lyapunov. In both cases there is global convergence of tracking errors. That there is uniform global asymptotic stability follows from the Lyapunov function property of the solution V( 2, t ) to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The uniform stability in the sense of Lyapunov follows from the existence of a negative semidefinite Lyapunov function derivative as shown in Theorem 3. Finite initial conditions and q r , q r â‚¬ L" mean that ?(a( to), to) is bounded. A finite value of the Lyapunov function V necessarily means a finite magnitude of the tracking errors 4, 4. The L"-stability follows from the fact that the Lyapunov function can only decrease with time. The adaptive control tracking errors globally converge to zero with all signals remaining bounded.</p><p>The solution V ( 2 , t ) to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation has all standard properties of a Lyapunov function with interpretations of energy. Similar Lyapunov functions have been presented outside the context of optimization by <ref type="bibr">Bayard and Wen [3,</ref> although their results are restricted to local stability for certain initial conditions of finite magnitude. Lyapunov design based on similar Lyapunov functions and with global stability properties has been presented in [ 181.</p><p>The control law contains nonlinear and linear compensations that can be calculated with algebraic matrix equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32)</ref>. The matrices T , I , T I , providing velocity and position feedback are easily computed from the weighting matrices of control optimization. The closed-loop properties may be effectively chosen with the weighting matrices Q , R of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref>. In turn, these matrices may be chosen according to general design experience in linear quadratic optimal control, the self-optimizing adaptation being chosen with the weighting matrix K O .</p><p>The original problem formulation focuses attention on the minimization of the control effort associated with kinetic energy. This suggests that the term N( q, q ) q of (16) should be included in the considered control variable U although this is a choice and no technical necessity. The forces N ( q , q ) q represent workless forces of the system which may or may not be included in the optimization problem as motivated by applications. The matrix N ( q , q ) may also be replaced in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">19</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">21</ref>) by some other skew-symmetric matrix that eliminates the third term of (19) in cases when no friction is included in C(q, q ) [so that U = 7 -G(q)]. No restrictions are therefore imposed and we avoid the attention to skew-symmetric matrices appearing recently from technical motivations in robotics [3], [ 191, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>.</p><p>A noteworthy feature is that the optimization presupposes a nonzero T I , of the state transformation matrix of V to guarantee asymptotic stability. The degenerate solution K = 0 with T ! , = 0, T I , # 0 appears for QZ2 = 0 of ( <ref type="formula">23</ref> This means that velocity and position coordinates are necessarily dependent. The state-space transformation (17) may therefore serve to eliminate some redundance while keeping the full 4) verification that V solves (26). state-space order (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>).</p><p>As many practical applications of controlled motion consider operations that must be solved in finite time, it might be argued that the infinite-time problem is less relevant for applied motion control. However, a minor reformulation of the optimization 3) derivation of the U that minimizes H of (24).</p><p>First, it is necessary to verify that V , and thus M ( q ) , is a function of 2 and t only. Notice that the reference value q,(t) is by definition a function of t only. It is then obvious that M ( q ) = M ( 4 + q r ( t ) ) = M ( 2 , t ) . ( A l . 1 ) problem under consideration here suggests that in fact it has wide practical application. The problem with an infinite-time optimization criterion may be viewed as a finite-time problem with a performance optimization together with an end point condition at t = tJ on the closed-loop stability</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">= ./J:L(i,u*) dt + V x ( z ( t f ) , t f ) . (68)</formula><p>Notice that the Lagrangian L is positive so that V,( z( t f ) , t f ) 5 Vx( :(to), to). This makes possible learning action applicable to finite-time operation with periodic or iterative motion. The self-optimizing adaptation of an optimal trajectory intended for periodic motion may thus be made by a few repetitive trials.</p><p>The application potential of the proposed methodology lies in the control design in areas such as robotics and flight control and in motion control analysis (e.g., of biomechanics). Both optimal feedback control laws can be derived and optimal trajectory planning performed with the present approach. The self-optimizing adaptation is valuable both in cases of uncertain or timevarying system parameters and for reconfiguration of the control system. The algorithm determines an optimal trajectory in configuration space that obviously generates a trajectory in Cartesian space. The inverse problem (i.e., the determination of a trajectory in Cartesian space that is translated to configuration space) has not been treated here.</p><p>Only rigid body motion has been explicitly treated here. Structural flexibilities that can be modeled by methods of analytical mechanics may be included in the equations <ref type="bibr">( I )</ref> and thus in the optimal control solution. It should be borne in mind, however, that the method presented here is dependent on access to measurements of all velocity and position variables, a prerequisite which may be a disadvantage with regard to such practical applications as active damping of vibrations.</p><p>Several extensions of the methods described here are possible. Finite-time optimization with a time-varying K ( t ) leads to matrix equations that require matrix inversion of M ( q ) and is thus computationally more complicated than the solution presented here.</p></div>
