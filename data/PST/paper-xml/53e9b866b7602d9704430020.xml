<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Intrusion detection is an important problem in sensor networks. Prior works in static sensor environments show that constructing sensor barriers with random sensor deployment can be effective for intrusion detection. In response to the recent surge of interest in mobile sensor applications, this paper studies the intrusion detection problem in a mobile sensor network, where it is believed that mobile sensors can improve barrier coverage. Specifically, we focus on providing -barrier coverage against moving intruders. This problem becomes particularly challenging given that the trajectories of sensors and intruders need to be captured. We first demonstrate that this problem is similar to the classical kinetic theory of gas molecules in physics. We then derive the inherent relationship between barrier coverage performance and a set of crucial system parameters including sensor density, sensing range, and sensor and intruder mobility. We examine the correlations and sensitivity from the system parameters, and we derive the minimum number of mobile sensors that needs to be deployed in order to maintain the -barrier coverage for a mobile sensor network. Finally, we show that the coverage performance can be improved by an order of magnitude with the same number of sensors when compared to that of the static sensor environment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ECENTLY, there has been an increased interest in the de- ployment of mobile sensors for intrusion detection, partly motivated by the demand of border surveillances. For instance, the American Border Patrol operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> tested sensor-mounted UAV in conjunction with the existing static sensor network (or so-called "virtual fence") along the American/Mexican borders. Under such a scenario, mobile sensors are not only able to cover larger areas, but also act as a backup when a "coverage hole" appears on the virtual fence due to ground sensor faults or use as a follow-up verification due to the false positives generated from ground sensors. Therefore, a mobile sensor network (MSN) can potentially improve the intruder detection by overcoming the coverage and physical sensing limitations in a stationary wireless sensor network (WSN), which is the focus in this paper.</p><p>In this paper, we are primarily interested in the barrier coverage by considering both moving intruders and mobile sensors. Specifically, we extend the notion of -barrier coverage, which was first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in stationary WSNs, in which a sensor network deployed over a belt region is said to provide -barrier coverage if every path that crosses the width of the belt is covered by at least distinct sensors. This barrier coverage definition is different from the general coverage formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in that the -barrier coverage does not capture simultaneous coverage from multiple sensors; instead it provides the cumulative coverage from distinct sensors.</p><p>Different from our problem, the -barrier coverage in a WSN is mainly determined by the initial network configuration. By specifying the deployment strategy and knowing sensing characteristics of sensors, we can derive the -barrier coverage performance of a WSN, and the performance remains unchanged over time. Currently, barrier coverage studies in MSNs mainly focus on designing sensor reposition algorithms to achieve coverage requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Our focus in this paper is completely different from all prior works. We formulate the dynamic aspects of the -barrier coverage that depend on both sensor and intruder mobility and examine the -barrier coverage performance under different network parameters and configurations. We now briefly describe the -barrier coverage provided by an MSN, and the related research problems.</p><p>Problem Statement: Given an initial sensor deployment over a belt region and a sensor mobility pattern, intruders are assumed to cross from one parallel boundary of the region to the other. We define the -barrier coverage for an MSN if every intruder path that crosses the width of the belt is cumulatively detected by at least mobile sensors along its traveling path. We are interested in computing the probability for a given MSN and its network parameters to satisfy -barrier coverage, where is the cumulative coverage count by mobile sensors.</p><p>Given the random nature of both intruders and sensors, it is not feasible to develop a deterministic algorithm to determine whether an MSN can provide -barrier coverage; instead, we focus on obtaining the probability of -barrier coverage by considering all possible sensor coverage from any trajectories of sensors and intruders. It is particularly challenging to model such a stochastic problem for multiple moving objects. Furthermore, we are also interested in determining the minimum number of mobile sensors that needs to be deployed in order to provide the -barrier coverage in MSNs. It turns out that our problem is very similar to the problem in classical kinetic theory of gas molecules in physics, which allows us to establish and derive the inherently dynamic relationship between moving intruders and mobile sensors.</p><p>The objectives of this paper are the following: 1) identify and characterize the dynamic aspects of the -barrier coverage under the sensor and intruder mobility; 2) compute the probability of -barrier coverage in an MSN; 3) investigate the probability of -barrier coverage sensitivity under different network parameters and system configurations; and 4) examine the average travel distance by an intruder between successive sensor coverage and its distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Results:</head><p>We study the -barrier coverage problem in mobile sensor networks, while the existing works have only considered -barrier coverage in stationary wireless sensor networks. We derive the dynamic relationship for the -barrier coverage performance from the density of mobile sensors, sensing range, and sensor and intruder mobility. We analyze the correlations and sensitivity between the parameters. We compare the coverage performance in terms of -barrier coverage probability to that from stationary wireless sensor networks, which demonstrates coverage performance significant gain can be obtained.</p><p>Organization: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes the intrusion detection studies in a wireless sensor network and the motivations to extend the study to a mobile sensor network. Section III describes the network and mobility model, as well as definitions of the intrusion detection problem in a mobile sensor network. Section IV formulates the intrusion detection problem. Section V examines the -barrier coverage sensitivity under different network parameters and configurations. Section VI reviews the related works, and finally Section VII concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARY AND OVERVIEW</head><p>We first outline the intrusion detection problem in WSNs. We next present the motivation for our study in MSNs and the key challenges. Finally, we introduce the gas kinetic theory and mean free path from physics to facilitate the study of our problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Intrusion Detection Problem in a Stationary WSN</head><p>There has been significant interest in border surveillance using WSNs. One typical example is the operation of the American Border Patrol, which places sensors along the American/Mexican borders (called an electronic "virtual fence") <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Ground sensors and infrared sensors are deployed for detecting ground vibrations from footsteps and identifying warm body movement, respectively. This illustrates that constructing sensor barriers can be effective for intrusion detection.</p><p>The concept of barrier coverage in a WSN was first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, in which it defines that -barrier coverage is to detect any intruders crossing the belt area (border) along any paths by at least distinct sensors. The work presented a centralized algorithm to determine whether a network provides -barrier coverage. An efficient distributed algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to construct sensor barriers on an irregular-shaped area without any constraints on crossing paths.</p><p>The local barrier coverage was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, in which it generalized the notion of -barrier coverage to -local -barrier coverage. This can guarantee the detection of all crossing paths whose trajectory is confined to a slice with length of the belt region. A follow-up work proposed a concept called "quality of barrier coverage" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which was used to measure the localized quality of -barrier coverage. A distributed algorithm was also developed to measure the quality and identify regions to be repaired.</p><p>All prior works consider a stationary wireless sensor network, in which sensors remain stationary after the initial deployment. The -barrier coverage of such a network is thus primarily determined by the initial network configuration and sensor deployment. Once the deployment strategy and sensing characteristics of the sensor are known, the -barrier coverage can be computed and remains unchanged over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Motivation and Overview</head><p>It is well known that node mobility improves the spatial coverage of sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For intrusion detection, there were several works <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, that considered designing sensor reposition algorithms for maintaining a barrier coverage service in an MSN. Sensor mobility can also be exploited to improve the intrusion detection. By leveraging the barrier coverage concept in a stationary wireless sensor network, in this paper, we consider how to provide barrier coverage service over a belt region for intrusion detection in an MSN. The key difficulty is caused by the sensor mobility and intruder movement.</p><p>With continuous sensor movement, previously uncovered regions can become covered as sensors move into the region. Similarly, previously covered regions can become uncovered when sensors move away. As a result, the regions covered by mobile sensors change over time. Probabilistically, there is a higher probability that intruders will be inside a covered area in an MSN over a given period of time. Furthermore, in a stationary WSN, an undetected or uncovered intruder can remain undetected or uncovered if the intruder moves along an uncovered path. In an MSN, however, an intruder is more likely to be detected since moving sensors patrol around a belt area. Therefore, mobile sensors, while providing a time-varying barrier coverage, can potentially significantly improve the intrusion detection performance.</p><p>However, there are several challenges for intrusion detection in an MSN: How do we describe and define the -barrier coverage in an MSN over a time period? What is the proper time duration that an intruder is covered by mobile sensors? What is the relationship between intrusion detection probability and sensor and intruder mobility? Finally, how do we quantify the -barrier coverage performance gain with the deployment of mobile sensors?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Kinetic Theory of Gas Molecules</head><p>Given the stochastic nature of the intrusion detection problem in an MSN, it is extremely complicated to capture all possible trajectories of sensors and intruders. Fortunately, as it turns out, our problem is similar to a problem in classical kinetic theory of gas molecules in physics, which describes the behavior of gas molecules in macroscopic terms and has a well-developed theoretical framework that we can leverage for our study.</p><p>Specifically, the theoretical framework for mean free path of moving electrons in air molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is very suitable for our study. In physics, the mean free path is the average travel distance by a particle (e.g., an electron) between successive impacts with other particles such as air molecules. The basic quantity of interest is the time for a collision between an electron and a molecule, and the distance traveled by the electron until the next collision. The mean free path of an electron can be calculated by deriving the Boltzmann constant, the temperature, the pressure, and the diameter of air molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This essentially requires to calculate the position of molecules until they cross the trajectory of an electron. Given that both air molecules and electron particles are moving objects, this scenario is almost identical for mobile intrusion detection, in which a mobile sensor needs to "collide" with a moving intruder for detection.</p><p>Intuitively, in order to apply the mean free path theory, we can treat a mobile sensor as an air molecule, and an intruder as an electron. The average travel distance of an intruder between successive coverage by mobile sensors can then be derived from the kinetic theory. This will allow us to further compute the probability that an MSN meets with certain -barrier coverage performance. To apply the kinetic theory to the intrusion detection problem, we need to make several assumptions: 1) the spatial separations between sensors (molecules) are large compared to the sensing region (molecular size); 2) sensors are initially located randomly and move with a constant speed; 3) sensors (molecules) should obey the Newton's laws of motion, where sensors undergo elastic collisions with the region boundaries (walls), but otherwise exert no forces on each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. NETWORK AND MOBILITY MODEL</head><p>In this section, we describe the basic system assumptions, and in particular the mobility models for mobile sensors and moving intruders. We then extend the notion of -barrier coverage in MSNs.</p><p>We consider an MSN to consist of mobile sensors initially placed inside a two-dimensional geographical region shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The region can be in any convex shapes under the proposed formulation. To keep it mathematically tractable, we assume is a long and narrow belt-like region, which has four boundaries. Two of them are parallel, and the other two are orthogonal to the parallel pair. We assume the width of the area to be , and the length to be , where represents the area of the region. For the initial configuration (at time ), we assume sensors are independently deployed with random uniform distribution. The random deployment can be the result of certain deployment strategies. For example, sensors may be air-dropped or launched via artillery in battlefields or unfriendly environments. Under this assumption, the sensor location can be modeled by a stationary two-dimensional Poisson process. Denote the density of Poisson process as . The number of sensors located in the region follows a Poisson distribution of parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> We define to be the probability that event occurs, and . We use to denote the expected value of a random variable .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sensing Model</head><p>We assume that each sensor has a sensing range . A sensor can only sense the environment and detect events within its sensing region, which is the disk of radius centered at the sensor. An intruder, treated as a point, is any object that is subjected to sensor detection as it crosses the barrier. It is said to be covered or detected by a sensor if it has been located inside the sensing region of the sensor. This definition is usually referred to as a binary or disc-based sensing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In the intrusion detection formulation in this paper, we essentially define a probabilistic coverage (see Section IV). Ideally, a probabilistic sensing model such as the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> could be more appropriate. For simplification and mathematical tractability, we adopt the disc-based sensing model in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Mobility Model</head><p>In an MSN, depending on the mobile platform and application scenario, sensors can choose from a wide variety of mobility strategies, from passive movement to highly coordinated and complicated motion. Sensors deployed in the air, ocean, or on wild animals move passively according to external forces such as air, ocean currents, or wild animal movement patterns; simple robots may have a limited set of mobility patterns, and advanced robots can navigate in a more complicated itinerary.</p><p>In this paper, we consider the following sensor mobility model. We assume that sensors move independently of each other and without any coordination between them. The movement of a sensor is characterized by its speed and direction. A sensor randomly chooses a direction according to the distribution with probability density function . The speed of the sensor is randomly chosen from a range , according to a probability density function of , and is the maximum sensor speed. A sensor travels to the boundary of the area with the chosen speed and direction. Once the boundary is reached, the sensor bounds back, by choosing another angular direction and continues the process. We refer to the above model as the random direction mobility model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The random direction mobility model, along with the random waypoint mobility model, is perhaps the most widely used synthetic mobility model in mobile communications. It was introduced to overcome density waves in the average number of neighbors produced by the random waypoint mobility model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A density wave is a cluster of sensors in one part of the simulation area. In the case of the random waypoint mobility model, this clustering occurs near the center of the simulation area. In other words, the probability that a mobile sensor selects a new destination located at the center of the simulation area, or a destination requiring to travel through the middle of the simulation area, is high. Thus, the mobile sensors appear to converge, disperse and converge again for generating density waves. In order to alleviate such behavior, the random direction mobility model was chosen to describe the sensor movement pattern.</p><p>Intruder movement is assumed to follow a crossing path, which is defined as a path (line segment) crossing from one parallel boundary to another. A crossing path is orthogonal if its length equals the width of the area . This is denoted as an orthogonal crossing line. In order to apply the gas kinetic theory, we assume the velocity of an intruder is a constant .</p><p>As it will become clear in Section IV from our formulation of this paper, the intruder movement is not explicitly restricted to any specific mobility model; instead, the most relevant parameter is the length of the path. For the mathematical tractability, it is assumed that the intruder mobility is independent of the sensor mobility. In reality, however, there could be spatial and temporal correlations on the mobility pattern, which is not captured in this formulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Coverage Measurement</head><p>We define the -barrier coverage for MSNs in this section. Specifically, we extend the definition of -barrier coverage in a WSN <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We first define the -barrier coverage for an intruder traveling path if the path that crossed the width of the belt is cumulatively detected (covered) by at least mobile sensors. For examples in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, -barrier coverage of the intruder traveling path (i) is given by , while the -barrier coverage of the intruder traveling path (ii) is given by . It is worth noticing that the definition of -barrier coverage is different from the general coverage definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, in which the -barrier coverage does not necessarily guarantee the simultaneous coverage from multiple sensors, but only cumulatively.</p><p>We next further define the -barrier coverage for a mobile sensor network if every intruder path that crosses the width of the belt is cumulatively detected (covered) by at least mobile sensors along its traveling path. The performance metrics is the probability that an MSN satisfies this -barrier coverage definition, where is the cumulative coverage count by mobile sensors for any intruder paths. We refer to it as probability of -barrier coverage for an MSN. We also define uncovered distance as the travel distance of an intruder between successive sensor coverage. For example from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, there are two uncovered distances for intruder path (i), between the successive coverage by sensors and , and between the successive coverage by sensors and .</p><p>Finally, we define the frequency of coverage or called coverage rate as the number of sensor coverage per unit time, which can be calculated by the intruder speed over the uncovered distance. The inverse of coverage rate is the uncovered time duration between successive sensor coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. INTRUSION DETECTION PROBLEM IN AN MSN</head><p>In this section, we formulate the intrusion detection problem in an MSN.</p><p>We first identify and characterize dynamic aspects of the -barrier coverage, which depend on both sensor and intruder movement. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the cumulative coverage area of mobile sensors during a time duration . The cumulative coverage area depends on the sensor speed , the sensing range , and the time duration . Given that sensors and intruders are constantly moving, a sensor traveling path may intersect with an intruder's traveling paths. Such an intersection, however, does not necessarily imply the sensor coverage on the intruder path. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> illustrates the difference between the intersection and the coverage of an intruder path.</p><p>As we discussed earlier, this problem is similar to a problem in classical kinetic theory of gas molecules in physics-specifically, the mean free path theory. We can treat a mobile sensor as an air molecule, and an intruder as an electron. The average travel distance of an intruder between successive coverage by mobile sensors can then be derived from the kinetic theory. Recall that we use average uncovered distance to denote the average travel distance of an intruder between successive sensor coverage. Our goal is to obtain the probability of -barrier coverage in an MSN. It can be achieved by formulating the uncovered distance and sensor coverage rate . We start to model the problem from an intruder point of view, and we first assume sensors are stationary. We will relax the assumption in the later part of this section. Recall that the sensing range is , and when , a cross section of coverage can be modeled by using a circle with diameter . The concept of  cross section is used to express the likelihood of coverage between an intruder and sensors. After a period of time , the circle swept out an area (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), and the number of sensor coverage can be estimated from the density of mobile sensors inside the area. The average uncovered distance then can be taken as the travel distance of an intruder divided by the number of sensor coverage, or it equals the intruder speed divided by the coverage rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> The average uncovered distance in the static sensor case can be further written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where is the cross section of coverage for static sensors.</p><p>In order to calculate the average uncovered distance in an MSN, it is necessary to assess the average relative velocity of mobile sensors with respect to intruders. The relative velocity can be expressed in terms of intruders' and sensors' velocity vectors, which are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(b)</ref>. Different sensor mobility models can result in different relative velocity formulations. In this paper, for simplification, we use the random direction mobility model to describe the mobile sensor movement. We consider the case with homogeneous velocity of mobile sensors and calculate the coverage rate. The general formulation, however, is not restricted to a specific mobility model and velocity assumption, as sensor mobility with different speed distributions can also be captured under the gas kinetic framework, for example, the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. By recalculating the average relative speed under the distribution and different mobility models, we can still use the theoretical framework to compute the new uncovered distance and new coverage rate. Recall that the velocity vector of an intruder is denoted by and the speed of a mobility sensor is . The sensor coverage per unit time will be given by , and we need to replace the velocity by the average relative speed of mobile sensors with respect to intruders, which is denoted by . Then, the sensor coverage per unit time can be written as , where is the cross section of coverage between the intruder and mobile sensors.</p><p>Theorem 1: The coverage rate can be obtained by ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)</p><p>Proof: Consider an intruder has certain probability to be covered by some mobile sensors for with corresponding cross section and sensor density . Then, we have The inverse of coverage rate is the uncovered time duration between successive sensor coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. -barrier Coverage in an MSN</head><p>With the formulation of the uncovered distance and the sensor coverage rate, we can now obtain the probability of -barrier coverage in an MSN. Theorem 2: <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where and are the incomplete Euler gamma function and the Euler gamma function, respectively.</p><p>Proof: With the sensor coverage rate , we can calculate the probability of an intruder having exactly number of sensor coverage along its traveling path with width , which is <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> With this probability, we can further derive the probability of an intruder having at least number of sensor coverage along its traveling path with width , which is</p><p>The integration of Poisson process can be written as the Euler gamma function So far, we have discussed the generalized formulation without a specific sensor mobility model. We now proceed to calculate the average relative speed under the random direction mobility model. However, as we illustrated previously, this can be applied to other mobility models. The speed of an intruder relative to mobile sensors varies only with the angle between their respective directions of motion, which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(a)</ref>. Since the mobile sensors move randomly with all possible directions (due to the random directional mobility model), a fraction of them move in directions that are with an angle of the intruder direction. Hence, for the average relative speed , we have</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Uncovered Distance Distribution</head><p>In Section IV-A, we only calculate the average value of the uncovered distance. We now compute the probability distribution function of the uncovered distance.</p><p>We first consider a group of intruders initially are outside the region. Let the number originally in the group at time be , and at time , let of them still be going without covered by any mobile sensors. Then, during the next time interval , the intruders will be covered and drop out of the group, where denotes the coverage rate for an intruder with speed .

Let be the fraction of all the uncovered distances that have a length between and . Then, since and , we have (</p><p>where . Both and are exponential functions, and equals the intruder speed divided by the coverage rate, which is the average uncovered distance. We then recalculate the expected value of by With the uncovered distance distribution, we can also calculate the probability (percentage) of uncovered distance , which exceeds the average uncovered distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> V. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The formulation in Section IV mainly presents the dynamic aspects of the intrusion detection problem in an MSN. The coverage performance, however, is largely affected by many system parameters including the density of mobile sensors, sensing range, and sensor and intruder mobility. In this section, we investigate the correlations and sensitivity on the coverage performance from a number of critical system parameters. Specifically, we study the relationships between -barrier coverage probability, density of sensors, and sensor mobility in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Density of Sensors and -Barrier Coverage Probability</head><p>We first study the correlation between the density of mobile sensors and the probability of -barrier coverage. From ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>), the density of sensors is linearly related to the Poisson random variables , while the probability function of -barrier coverage is the cumulative distribution function of the Poisson random variables.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. RELATED WORKS</head><p>The intrusion detection is a subset of the coverage problem, which was first introduced in sensor-based robotic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> before it grew into a critical research problem in WSNs. Originally, coverage can be further divided into two categories: blanket coverage defined to achieve a static arrangement of sensing elements that maximizes the detection rate of targets appearing within the coverage area, and barrier coverage describes a static arrangement of sensing elements that minimizes the probability of undetected enemy penetration through the barrier.</p><p>In WSNs, many existing works focus on the blanket coverage (or called full coverage) over a regular region. Hefeeda et al. proposed a probabilistic coverage protocol in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> that considered probabilistic sensing models. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> examined the issues associated with maintaining sensing coverage and connectivity by keeping the minimum number of sensor nodes in the active mode in WSNs. Recently, there has been an increased interest and in the area of barrier coverage in sensor networks. The work of -barrier coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and the subsequent works, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, have exclusively assumed sensors to be stationary nodes.</p><p>There were several works that illustrated that node mobility could improve the blanket coverage performance of MSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. One of the applications was network surveillance presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, in which the coverage problem ensured that targets of interest in the observed area are within the sensing range of one or more deployed sensors. It characterized the spatial distribution of a set of independent sensors in steady state. Chin et al. investigated the similar problem of detecting the presence/absence of a target using an MSN in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. It presented an analytic method to evaluate the detection latency based on a collaborative sensing approach with uncoordinated mobility. It analyzed the tradeoff between the number of nodes and detection latency in an MSN.</p><p>Another direction of research in MSNs focuses on developing algorithms to reposition mobile sensors in order to achieve a static configuration with enlarged covered area <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, . Specifically, the proposed algorithms attempted to spread sensors in the field for maximizing the covered area. Similarly, reposition algorithms for barrier coverage by mobile sensors were also examined. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> studied the energy-efficient sensor relocation to utilize much fewer mobile sensors than stationary sensors to achieve barrier coverage with random deployment. A similar problem was addressed by Bhattacharya et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Our focus in this paper is completely different from all prior works. There are two distinctive features in our work: 1) we try to identify and characterize the dynamic aspects of the -barrier coverage that depend on both sensor and intruder mobility; 2) we introduce a new barrier coverage performance metrics:</p><p>-barrier coverage probability. By leveraging the kinetic theory from physics, we model the dynamic problem, and we its sensitivity under different network parameters and configurations. To the best of our knowledge, we believe this is a completely new study on the -barrier coverage in mobile sensor network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we study the intrusion detection problem in mobile sensor networks. Specifically, we introduce a performance metric: -barrier coverage probability and investigate the -barrier coverage against moving intruders. By modeling the dynamic aspects of the -barrier coverage that depend on both sensor and intruder mobility, we derive the inherent relationship between the -barrier coverage performance and a set of crucial system parameters including sensor density, sensing range, and sensor and intruder mobility. We obtain the -barrier coverage probability by the (incomplete) Euler gamma functions of the system parameters. We further compare the coverage performance with mobile and static sensors, which conclusively demonstrated that the mobility can be exploited to obtain better barrier coverage.</p><p>There are two avenues for further research on this problem. 1) To consider the detection error of mobile sensors under varying sensor speeds. This can be formulated into an optimization problem for -barrier coverage probability. 2) To study the optimal patrol route of controlled mobile sensors, which aims to maximize the -barrier coverage probability among all possible sensor patrol routes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
