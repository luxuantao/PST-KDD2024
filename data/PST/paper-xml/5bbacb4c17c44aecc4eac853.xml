<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Intra-protein residue-level contact prediction has drawn a lot of attentions in recent years and made very good progress, but much fewer methods are dedicated to inter-protein contact prediction, which are important for understanding how proteins interact at structure and residue level. Direct coupling analysis (DCA) is popular for intra-protein contact prediction, but extending it to inter-protein contact prediction is challenging since it requires too many interlogs (i.e., interacting homologs) to be effective, which cannot be easily fulfilled especially for a putative interacting protein pair in eukaryotes. We show that deep learning, even trained by only intra-protein contact maps, works much better than DCA for inter-protein contact prediction. We also show that a phylogeny-based method can generate a better multiple sequence alignment for eukaryotes than existing genome-based methods and thus, lead to better inter-protein contact prediction. Our method shall be useful for protein docking, protein interaction prediction and protein interaction network construction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Very few proteins perform their functions alone. Instead, most proteins function by interacting with others to form complexes and/or protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. To understand PPIs at structure level, their 3D structures may be needed. Although significantly improved, solving the 3D structure of a PPI or protein complex by experimental techniques is still very challenging, even if its constituent proteins have known 3D structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. There is still little 3D structure information for a big percentage of currently known PPIs in bacteria, yeast and human <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Therefore, computational methods are needed to elucidate the 3D structure of a PPI or complex from its sequence.</p><p>Predicting the 3D structure of a PPI or complex is very challenging. Here we focus on an important intermediate step that predicts inter-protein residue-residue contacts between a pair of putative interacting proteins (i.e., inter-protein contact prediction). Intra-protein contact prediction has demonstrated its effectiveness on folding a single protein chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. It is also reported that inter-protein contact prediction is useful for the 3D structure modeling of a PPI or protein docking <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. A few computational methods have been developed to predict protein-level interaction, including phylogenetic profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, force field methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, genomic co-localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Nevertheless, these methods can only predict if two proteins interact or not, but not which residue pairs may interact or form a contact. Here our focus is to predict residue-level interactions (i.e., contacts) across two proteins.</p><p>Co-evolution analysis or more specifically direct-coupling analysis (DCA) is popular for intra-protein contact prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and has also been applied to inter-protein contact prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. DCA works by identifying co-evolved residues from a multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of sequences homologous to a protein under prediction. Although popular, DCA has low prediction accuracy when we cannot find a large number of sequence homologs for a protein under prediction. This problem becomes more serious for inter-protein contact prediction since it is challenging to find so many interlogs (i.e., interacting homologs) for an interacting protein pair. Because of this, currently DCA for inter-protein contact prediction mainly focuses on prokaryotes and mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> since it is relatively easy to find interlogs in prokaryotes, but does not fare well on eukaryotes with abundant paralogs because it is challenging to identify correct interlogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>We have developed a deep learning (DL) method for intra-protein contact prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, which greatly outperformed DCA and obtained the highest F1 score in CASP12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Our DL method not only works for soluble proteins, but also for membrane proteins even if trained by only non-membrane proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Compared to pure DCA, our DL method needs much fewer sequence homologs to be effective because it makes use of contact occurrence patterns, in addition to co-evolution information, for contact prediction. Inspired by the success of our DL method and the fact that it does not need so many sequence homologs, this paper studies how well DL can work on inter-protein contact prediction, especially for eukaryotic species. To avoid overfitting, we do not train our DL model using any protein complex data (i.e., inter-protein contact maps). Instead, we still use our previous DL model trained by only individual protein chains (i.e., intra-protein contact maps) to predict inter-protein contacts.</p><p>To further improve accuracy, we propose a new phylogeny-based method to identify interlogs for a putative interacting protein pair, especially for eukaryotes in which some interacting genes may be far away from each other along genome. When coupled with DL, this new method works better on eukaryotes than genome distance-based methods employed by Baker <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and Marks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> (which are mainly developed for prokaryotes). Experimental results show that combining these two methods can even further improve prediction accuracy.</p><p>We have tested our DL method using two datasets adopted by other groups and a large number of interacting protein pairs extracted from 3DComplex <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Experimental results show that our DL method indeed outperforms pure DCA for interprotein contact prediction. Our DL method not only works on prokaryotes, but also on eukaryotes and the other species. We have also observed that inter-protein contact prediction accuracy is not only highly related to the number of effective interlogs available for a protein pair under prediction, but also to the density of interprotein contacts defined as the ratio between the number of inter-protein contacts and the total sequence length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Following the definition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, we say that two residues of a protein pair form an inter-protein contact if 1) they belong to two different protein chains; and 2) in the native 3D structure of a complex containing this protein pair, the minimum Euclidean distance between their heavy atoms is less than 6Å. We measure the density of inter-protein contacts across two proteins by #contacts/L where #contacts is the number of true contacts across two proteins and L is their total sequence length.</p><p>Overview. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, given a pair of putative interacting proteins A and B for which we would like to predict inter-protein contacts, we first run HHblits <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> to find sequence homologs and build multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for A and B, respectively. Then we employ two different strategies to concatenate MSA_A and MSA_B into a paired MSA consisting of only interlogs (i.e., interacting homologs). Let MSA_g and MSA_p be the paired MSAs resulting from genome-based and phylogenybased methods (described below), respectively, from which we may use our DL method to predict two inter-protein contact maps, and then calculate their average as the final prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Building multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for a protein pair</head><p>We generate an MSA for an individual protein by running HHblits with 8 iterations and E-value=1E-20 to search through the UniProt20 HHM library dated in February 2016. The other parameters for HHblits are -maxfilt 100000000 -diff inf -all -neffmax 20. Let MSA_A and MSA_B denote the resultant individual MSAs for proteins A and B, respectively. We employ two strategies to concatenate MSA_A and MSA_B into a paired MSA, which consists putative interacting pairs homologous to the query pair. One is based upon genome information and the other utilizes phylogeny information. Not every protein in MSA_A and MSA_B can be paired. After concatenation, unpaired proteins are removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concatenating MSAs by genomic distance.</head><p>In prokaryotes and some eukaryotes, interacting genes are often co-located on the chromosome into operons <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, so we may tell if two proteins forming an interacting pair (i.e., interlog) or not by checking if their intergenic distance is less than a given threshold (we use 20 here). Both EVcomplex <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Baker <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> employed this strategy, but differed in some details. We may use a bipartite graph to describe the pairing relationship between proteins. That is, we treat each individual protein as a node and add one edge between two nodes (of two different MSAs) if their intergenic distance is less than 20. We may assign the inverse of the intergenic distance as weight to an edge. Then, we may pair two MSAs by finding the maximum matching in the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Before doing so, we may also prune edges of which at least one endpoint does not have the minimum distance to the other. After pairing proteins in two MSAs, we remove the unpaired proteins and generate a paired MSA consisting of only putative interlogs, each being supposed to be homologous to the query protein pair. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows an example of this method. Here the left (red) and right (blue) MSAs contain 5 and 6 protein chains, respectively, and the intergenic distance threshold is set to 3. In total there are 6 contigs containing 6 copies of proteins (red blocks) in the left MSA and 8 copies of proteins (blue blocks) in the right MSA. Grey blocks are coding DNA sequences not belonging to these two MSAs. Based upon intergenic distance, 4 protein pairs can be formed, as shown by the black double arrows. For example, in contig 2, the intergenic distance between proteins 2 and B is 1, smaller than that between proteins 2 and A, so we pair proteins 2 and B together. In contig 4, the intergenic distance between proteins 4 and D is 4, larger than the threshold, so we do not pair them together.</p><p>To calculate intergenic distance, we need map proteins (more specifically, coding DNA sequence (CDS)) to chromosome. To do so, we extract the UniProt IDs of a protein from the database and fetch the contig IDs from European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) via its XREF service <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Then we retrieve the contigs from ENA by their IDs and extract CDS lines that map UniProt IDs to their positions in contigs. Two CDSs are considered belonging to one gene if their spanning regions have an overlap of length at least one CDS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concatenating MSAs by phylogeny information.</head><p>It is much more challenging to concatenate two individual MSAs for a protein pair in eukaryotes. This is because an individual MSA may contain abundant paralogs and two genes may interact with each other even if they are not close by genomic distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Here we propose to concatenate two individual MSAs using phylogeny and homology information. First, we group proteins in each MSA by their species (or sub-species if possible) according to the phylogeny tree stored in the Taxonomy Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Then we sort proteins of a specific species/subspecies in each MSA by their sequence similarity (from high to low) to their respective query proteins. Let p1, p2, …, pm be the sorted proteins of a specific species in one MSA and q1, q2, …, qn be the sorted proteins of the same species in the other MSA. Then we pair pi and qi together where i ranges from 1 to the minimum of m and n. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows an example of this method. Each individual MSA contains 8 proteins (including the query). Manis pentadactyla and Alligator sinensis have no subspecies. Ailuropoda melanoleuca has two subspecies:</p><p>A.m.melanoleuca and A.m.qinlingensis. Therefore, we may divide the proteins into 4 groups. Manis pentadactyla has only one protein in each MSA, so we simply pair its two proteins to form an interlog. Alligator sinensis has 2 and 3 proteins for queries 1 and 2, respectively. We sort them by sequence similarity and remove the protein which is the least similar to query 2 and pair the remaining proteins to form 2 interlogs. Similarly, we obtain 1 interlog for A.m.qinlingensis and 2 for A.m.melanoleuca. Finally, we obtain a paired MSA of 7 interlogs (including the query itself), as shown by the black double arrows.</p><p>Calculating the number of effective interlogs. Meff measures the amount of homologous information in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). It can be interpreted as the number of non-redundant (or effective) sequence homologs in an MSA. Here we use 70% sequence identity as cutoff to determine if two interlogs are similar or not. Two interlogs are similar if and only if two proteins in one interlog are similar to their corresponding proteins in the other interlog. Let Si denote the number of interlogs (including itself) similar to interlog i. Then we may calculate Meff of an MSA as the sum of 1/Si over all the interlogs in this MSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protein features for a protein pair</head><p>For each protein pair under prediction, we derive two kinds of protein features (sequential and pairwise features) and then feed them into our DL model for contact prediction. Sequential features include protein sequence profile (i.e., position-specific scoring matrix), 3-state secondary structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and 3-state solvent accessibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> predicted by our in-house tool RaptorX-Property <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. We generate sequential features separately for two proteins in a pair and then concatenate them to form paired sequential features. That is, we treat a protein pair as a single protein by concatenating their sequences. Sequence profile is represented as a 2D matrix with dimension L×20 where L is the total protein length. Predicted secondary structure is represented as a 2D matrix with dimension L×3 (each entry is a predicted probability), so is the predicted solvent accessibility. Combining them together, we have a 2D matrix with dimension L×26 as the input sequential feature.</p><p>To calculate pairwise features, we feed a paired MSA to CCMpred <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, which outputs direct co-evolution strength between any two residues (i.e., columns) in the MSA. We also calculate mutual information and pairwise potential between any two columns in a paired MSA. See our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deep learning (DL) for inter-protein contact prediction</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> in Appendix, our DL model is formed mainly by two deep residual neural networks (ResNet) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. One is used to handle sequential features and the other pairwise features. The first ResNet conducts 1-dimensional (1D) convolutional transformation of sequential features to capture long-range sequential context of each residue in the query proteins. Its output is converted to a 2-dimensional (2D) matrix by an operation similar to outer product and then fed into the 2nd ResNet together with the original pairwise features. The 2nd ResNet conducts 2D convolutional transformation of its input to capture longrange 2D context of a residue pair. Finally, the output of the 2nd ResNet is fed into logistic regression, which predicts the probability of any two residues forming a contact. Please see our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> for a detailed description of this DL model.</p><p>Combining contacts predicted from MSAs constructed by two strategies. For a protein pair, we build two paired MSAs using both genome-and phylogeny-based methods, and from the two MSAs predict two inter-protein contact maps, respectively. Then we may calculate their arithmetic average as the final prediction for this protein pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Training and test datasets</head><p>We employed three testsets. (1) Baker's dataset: a set of 32 protein pairs used by Baker to test a direct coupling (DCA) method Gremlin <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, 28 of which are from prokaryotes. This set includes protein pairs extracted from bacterial 50S ribosomal unit, the TRAP complex, tripartite efflux system, pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex and D-methionine transport system. (2) EVcomplex's dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>: a set of 86 protein pairs, in which 82 are from prokaryotes. (3) 3DComplex version 2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>: 3067 nonredundant (40% sequence identity cutoff) complexes with experimentally-solved structures in PDB. Here we only consider heteromers, so finally obtained 4954 chain pairs in contact that involve 5296 protein chains. Among them, 841 and 178 pairs belong to human and E. coli., respectively; 1863 and 728 pairs belong to the other eukaryotes and prokaryotes, respectively. The remaining 1344 pairs belong to neither prokaryotes nor eukaryote (e.g. archaea and virus). In this set, 475 of protein pairs are too long and CCMpred cannot run them on GPUs due to memory limit, so we exclude them from consideration.</p><p>Our DL model is trained and validated using only individual protein chains (i.e., intra-protein contacts) in PDB25. That is, we did not train our DL model using any protein pairs (i.e., inter-protein contacts). A benefit of training by only protein chains is that there is no redundancy between our training data and the test data. To further verify this, we concatenate two proteins in a test pair to a single sequence and BLAST it against our training proteins. It turns out that BLAST cannot find any good alignment between the concatenated sequences and our training proteins. Please see our previous work on training our DL model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation and metrics</head><p>We evaluate our DL method by comparing it with a few pure DCA methods such as CCMpred <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, Gremlin <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and EVcomplex <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In terms of methodology and accuracy, CCMpred, EVcomplex and Gremlin are not very different given the same input MSA. However, CCMpred runs much faster, so we focus more on it. We calculate the accuracy of the top 50, 20, 10, 5 and top L/k (k=5, 10, 20) predicted contacts where L is the total length of the two protein chains. The prediction accuracy is defined as the percentage of correctly predicted contacts among the top predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result Prediction accuracy on the Baker's and EVcomplex's datasets</head><p>As shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1 and 2</ref>, tested on these two datasets, our DL method (denoted as GCNN) greatly outperforms all pure DCA methods such as EVComplex (EVfold), Gremlin and CCMpred regardless of how many top predicted contacts are evaluated and no matter how the MSA is constructed. The results indicate that the genome-based method for MSA construction outperforms our phylogeny-based method on these datasets. This is because that most test protein pairs belong to prokaryotes and co-regulated genes in prokaryotes are often co-located on the genome into operons. Merging the contacts predicted from MSAs constructed by both phylogeny-based and genome-based methods does not help, partially because that the contacts predicted from phylogeny-based MSAs have much lower accuracy. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1 and  2</ref> confirm that CCMpred performs comparably to or better than EVfold, EVComplex and Gremlin, so in the following sections we will mainly compare our method with CCMpred. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Inter-protein contact prediction accuracy (%) on Baker's data. Our DL method is denoted as GCNN and (s) indicates a web server. EVfold is the same as EVcomplex, but run locally with our MSAs. "Genome" and "Phylogeny" denote genome-and phylogeny-based methods for MSA generation, respectively. "Merged" indicates prediction is merged from "Genome" and "Phylogeny". Columns 3-9 show accuracy of top L/5, L/10, L/20, 50, 20, 10, and 5 predicted contacts.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key factors impacting inter-protein contact prediction accuracy</head><p>We have observed that inter-protein contact prediction accuracy is related to two factors: the number of sequence homologs in an MSA (i.e., Meff) and inter-protein contact density measured by #contacts/L where #contacts is the number of native contacts across two proteins and L is their total length. We divide all the 3DComplex test protein pairs into groups by their ln(Meff) or contact density and then calculate the average accuracy in each group. Since for each protein pair we have two different MSAs, we use the geometric average of their Meffs to measure the Meff of one protein pair. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows that the top L/10 prediction accuracy increases with respect to both contact density and Meff and that our DL method greatly outperforms CCMpred regardless of Meff and contact density. We have also observed that when contact density is below 0.10, the prediction accuracy is low even if Meff is large. When contact density is larger than 0.25, the top L/10 accuracy increases faster when Meff is large than when Meff is small. This trend is similar for both our DL method and CCMpred.</p><p>(A) (B) Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3 and 4</ref> further illustrate that prediction accuracy is related to contact density. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the top L/10 accuracy of our DL method and CCMpred on 125 randomly-selected protein pairs from 3DComplex, covering both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows the top L/10 accuracy on 125 protein pairs from 3DComplex with the largest contact density. It shows that the prediction accuracy of our DL method and CCMpred is better by ~30% and ~10%, respectively, than those in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, even when only top 5 or 10 predicted contacts are evaluated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phylogeny-vs. Genome-based methods for MSA construction</head><p>The phylogeny-and genome-based methods for MSA construction are complementary to each other. In general, for prokaryotic species, genome-based method works better and for eukaryotes, our phylogenybased method works better. As shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5 and 6</ref>, evaluated on 125 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref> test protein pairs (in 3DComplex) from all prokaryotic species (E. coli) with the largest contact density (i.e., #contacts/L), both our DL method GCNN and CCMpred have better prediction accuracy when the MSAs are derived from genome-based methods. Further, merging the predicted contacts from two types of MSAs yield higher accuracy on the 125 test protein pairs.</p><p>As shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7 and 8</ref>, evaluated on 125(50) test protein pairs from eukaryotes (Human) with the largest contact density, the predicted contacts from the MSAs derived from our phylogeny-based method has better accuracy when coupled with our DL method. On both testsets, merging the predicted contacts from two types of MSAs yield higher accuracy than any single type of MSAs. The results in these 4 tables also confirm that our DL method greatly outperforms the pure co-evolution method such as CCMpred. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> in Appendix also shows the contact prediction accuracy of protein pairs in 3DComplex resulting from these two MSA building methods. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Discussion</head><p>We have described the first deep learning (DL) method for inter-protein contact prediction that greatly outperforms existing pure co-evolution methods. Our approach works for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. By contrast, existing co-evolution methods were mainly tested on prokaryotes. Our DL method is not trained by any existing protein complex data (i.e., inter-protein contact maps). Instead it is trained by only single-chain proteins (i.e., intra-protein contact maps), but still works for inter-protein contact prediction. The underlying reason is that both inter-and intra-protein contacts share similar physical-chemical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and contact occurrence patterns which are learned by our DL method. Nevertheless, the set of training intra-protein contact maps may not cover all possible contact occurrence patterns across two proteins. According to our experience in developing deep transfer learning for membrane protein contact prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we shall be able to further improve our DL method by training it using both intra-and inter-protein contact maps.</p><p>We have developed a phylogeny-based method for MSA construction, which outperforms genome-based methods on eukaryotes and provides information complementary to genome-based method. The combination of these two methods may lead to better prediction accuracy on eukaryotes. Although our DL method greatly outperforms pure co-evolution methods, the prediction accuracy of our method on eukaryotes is still not that high, maybe because the MSAs constructed by our phylogeny-based method is still suboptimal. We will continue to study better methods for MSA construction to further improve prediction accuracy.</p><p>Our experimental results show that prediction accuracy is related to inter-protein contact density, in addition to the number of interlogs (i.e., interacting homologs) available for a protein pair under prediction. Usually permanent PPIs has a larger inter-protein contact density than transient PPIs and thus, so our approach may have a better predictive effect for permanent PPIs and a better method is needed to predict contacts for transient PPIs.</p><p>Due to space limit, this paper focuses only on contact prediction, but not on building 3D structural models from predicted contacts. In an extended version we will describe how well our predicted contacts can be used to build 3D complex models of a PPI or to help improve protein docking. In this paper, we assume that we do not have the 3D structure models of the two constituent proteins of a putative interacting protein pair. Sometimes we may have native structures or good 3D models of individual proteins. In this case, we shall study how to further improve inter-protein contact prediction by making use of the known 3D structures of partner proteins.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
