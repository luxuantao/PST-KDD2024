<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enhanced device-to-device (D2D) communication scheme is considered. Our objective is to maximize the system sum rate by optimizing subchannel and power allocation. We propose a novel solution that jointly assigns subchannels to D2D groups and allocates power to receivers in each D2D group. For the subchannel assignment, a novel algorithm based on the manyto-one two-sided matching theory is proposed for obtaining a suboptimal solution. Since the power allocation problem is nonconvex, sequential convex programming is adopted to transform the original power allocation problem to a convex one. The power allocation vector is obtained by iteratively tightening the lower bound of the original power allocation problem until convergence. Numerical results illustrate that: 1) the proposed joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm are an effective approach for obtaining near-optimal performance with acceptable complexity and 2) the NOMA enhanced D2D communication scheme is capable of achieving promising gains in terms of network sum rate and the number of accessed users, compared to a traditional OMA-based D2D communication scheme.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A S THE rocket increasing number of powerful smart mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, and intelligent vehicle-to-vehicle devices) and upsurge growth of varied multimedia applications (e.g., high-definition videos, massive open online courses, and virtual reality games), an explosion of wireless network services has been leaded accordingly. Driven by meeting those flood data demands, several promising technologies are identified by researchers for the coming fifth generation (5G) networks recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Particularly, device-to-device (D2D) communications is considered as one of the pieces of the 5G jigsaw puzzle for improving spectral efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In D2D enabled cellular networks, devices are allowed to communicate directly without the assistance of the base station (BS). D2D communications enable lowpower transmission of proximity services to improve the energy efficiency and allow to reuse the frequency of the cellular networks in an effort to increase the spectral efficiency. Moreover, D2D communications also have potentials to facilitate new types of peer-to-peer (P2P) services <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Motivated by the potential benefits aforementioned, many works have been prompted recently under different scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Solution approaches that allowed cellular devices and D2D pairs to share spectrum resources were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, thereby improved the spectral efficiency of traditional cellular networks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the functions to facilitate D2D session setup and mechanisms were illustrated, with the aim of controlling and limiting the interference of D2D communications to the cellular network. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> jointly studied the D2D spectrum sharing and mode selection under a hybrid network model. From the perspective of security issue, the performance of secure D2D communication was investigated in energy harvesting large-scale cognitive radio networks in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Apart from invoking D2D technique to improve the spectral efficiency of the wireless networks, another emerging technique-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-is able to address both the massive connectively and spectral efficiency enhancement issue, on the standpoint of realizing a new power dimension for multiple access <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Having been included in 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, NOMA is regarded as one of the promising candidates in future 5G networks for its potential ability to significantly improve the spectral efficiency and provide ultra high connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Different from the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technique, NOMA is capable of supporting multiple users to share the same resource (e.g., time/frequency/code), via using different power level. It is worth mentioning that due to the employment of superposition coding transmission scheme, the power allocation is an eternal problem to be investigated in NOMA, especially in multiple subchannels/subcarriers/clusters scenarios. Somewhat related power allocation and subchannel/subcarrier/cluster assignment problems have been studied in the context of NOMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. More particularly, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, with formulating NOMA resource allocation problems under several practical constraints, the tractability of the formulated problem was analytically characterized.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation and Related Works</head><p>Inspired by the aforementioned potential benefits of D2D and NOMA, it is natural to investigate the promising application of NOMA technology in the D2D communications for further performance improvement, in term of both spectrum efficiency and massive connectivity. More specifically, we develop a NOMA enhanced D2D communication scheme. In this new scheme, we propose the concept of "D2D group". Unlike the traditional concept of "D2D pair" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, one D2D transmitter is able to communicate with several D2D receivers via NOMA protocol. With OMA, transmitting contents to different D2D receivers requires multiple bandwidth channels; however, NOMA can serve these receivers in a single channel use. For example, in a D2D group, the transmitter transmits contents to three receivers requiring video, audio and text messages, respectively. If the video and audio users are with good channel conditions, they can perform successive interference cancellation (SIC) for two or three times to remove their partners' messages completely and therefore achieve high data rates. For text users, although they will experience strong co-channel interference, this is not an issue since they need to be served only with small data rates. This new concept is fundamentally different from the previous common used concept of "D2D pair". The main advantages of implementing NOMA enhanced D2D communications are the enhanced system sum rate and the increased number of accessed D2D receivers which simultaneously served by one D2D transmitter. In this work, we consider two receivers in each D2D group, which can be extended to the case that there are multiple receivers in each group.</p><p>Recall that although D2D promises unprecedented increase in spectrum efficiency, it brings in interference to the cellular network <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Similarly, the application of NOMA into D2D communications brings intra-"D2D group" interference among receivers in the same group as well as inter-"D2D group" interference among groups occupying the same subchannel, which makes the interference management problem more complicated. As such, whether NOMA is capable of enhancing D2D communications underlaying cellular networks still remains unknown and investigating effective resource allocation strategies is more than necessary, which is one of the motivations of this work. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work investigating the joint subchannel and power allocation problem of NOMA enhanced D2D communications scenarios, which motivates us to develop this treatise. We attempt to explore the potential of the NOMA enhanced D2D communications in underlay cellular networks and identify the key influence factors on system performance. More particularly, we strive to investigate the answers of questions which are listed as follows:</p><p>• Question 1: Will NOMA enhanced D2D communications bring sum rate gains compared to the conventional OMA based scheme? • Question 2: Will NOMA enhanced D2D communications significantly improve the number of accessed users compared to the conventional OMA based scheme? • Question 3: How the interference constraints of cellular users influence the sum rate and number of accessed D2D groups?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contributions</head><p>In this paper, we consider the setting of an uplink singlecell cellular network communications, where multiple D2D groups are allowed to reuse the same subchannel occupied by a cellular user to improve the spectrum utilization. We recognize that the spectrum allocation can be regarded as a many-toone matching process between the D2D groups and subchannels. Due to the co-channel interference among D2D groups occupying the same subchannel, D2D groups have peer effects with the interdependencies among each other. We then formulate the spectrum allocation as a many-to-one matching problem with peer effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Appropriate power allocation among receivers in the same D2D group is also taken into consideration. Note that allocating D2D groups to orthogonal subchannels with considering power allocation generally turns out to be a combinatorial non-convex problem. Therefore, we decouple the subchannel assignment of D2D groups and the power allocation for each D2D group. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• We develop a novel NOMA enhanced D2D scheme that introduces the concept of "D2D group", where each D2D transmitter is enabled to communicate with multiple D2D receivers simultaneously via NOMA protocol. Based on this scheme,we design a mechanism that jointly performs subchannel assignment to D2D groups and power allocation in each D2D group. • For the subchannel assignment, we first give the fixed power allocation in each D2D group, and then formulate the subchannel assignment as a many-to-one matching problem. To maximize the system sum rate, we propose a matching algorithm where the peer effects among the D2D groups are taken into consideration. It is analytically proved that the proposed algorithm is capable of improving the system sum rate and converging to a stable state within limited rounds of interactions. • Based on the proposed subchannel assignment algorithm, the power allocation problem for each D2D group is formulated as a non-convex problem because of the existence of intra-group interference. We apply the sequential convex programming to iteratively update the power allocation vector by solving the approximate convex problem. We prove that the proposed algorithm is convergent and the solution satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.</p><p>• We propose two approaches to jointly consider the subchannel and power allocation problems. The iterative Because of the high complexity of I-JSPA, we propose a low-complexity joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm (LC-JSPA). The result of LC-JSPA is shown to closely approach to that of the I-JSPA. • We show that the proposed joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm can achieve the near performance to the exhaustive-searching method at a low computational complexity. We also demonstrate that the NOMA enhanced D2D communications achieve higher system sum rate and larger number of accessed users than the OMA based D2D scheme.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Description</head><p>We focus on a single-cell uplink transmission scenario, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. We consider that M cellular users, i.e. C = {C 1 , . . . , C m , . . . C M }, communicate with one BS in the traditional cellular mode. Each cellular user C m is allocated in one subchannel SC m ∈ SC , SC = {SC 1 , . . . , SC m , . . . , SC M } and all the subchannels are orthogonal with each other. 1 There are N D2D groups D = {D 1 , . . . , D n , . . . , D N } communicating underlaying cellular 1 Considering subchannel assignment to cellular UEs is beyond the scope of this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. We may take this into consideration in our future work and model it as a bipartite graph and perfect matching. networks. Unlike the traditional D2D-pair communications, each D2D transmitter can send the superimposed mixture containing the required messages for the receivers in the D2D group by applying NOMA transmission protocol, which introduces the concept of "D2D group" (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>). It is worth noting that, when the number of receivers in each D2D group drops to 1, our model is the same as the conventional "D2D pair" case. In this paper, we assume that there are two NOMA receivers in each D2D group to limit the multiuser interference 2 and to ensure low hardware complexity and low processing delay. 3  In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b), the interference received at receiver 2 of the n-th D2D group is illustrated as follows:</p><p>• The intra-group interference (the black dashed line) refers to the interference of superposition signals to receiver 1 in the same D2D group; • The inter-group interference (the red dashed line) indicates the interference from the D2D transmitters of other D2D groups that reuse the same subchannel; • Last, the cellular interference (the blue dashed line) represents the interference from the cellular user reusing the same subchannel. 2 The multiuser interference in each D2D group increases as more receivers are multiplexed on the same subchannel which can degrade the performance of individual users. 3 NOMA requires SIC at the receivers. In practice, a user performing SIC has to demodulate and decode the signals intended for other users in addition to its own signal. Thus, hardware complexity and processing delay increase with the number of NOMA receivers multiplexed on the same subchannel.</p><p>It is assumed that the cellular users and D2D transmitters are uniformly distributed in the cell. The receivers in each D2D group are uniformly distributed within a disc with radius d max , and the origin of the disc is the corresponding DT n . All channels are assumed to undergo quasi-static Rayleigh fading, where the channel coefficients are constant for each channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Channel Model</head><p>We assume that each subchannel which is occupied by a cellular user can be reused by multiple D2D groups. As a consequence, the received signal at the BS corresponding to subchannel SC m is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y m = P c h m x m + n η n,m P d g n t n + ζ m ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where In this paper, we assume that all the cellular users have the same transmit power and so do all the D2D transmitters for simplicity. h m and g n are the channel coefficients including small-scale fading and path-loss between C m and the BS, and that between DT n and the BS, respectively. Based on (1), we obtain the received signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR) at the BS corresponding to C m as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">γ m = P c |h m | 2 n η n,m P d |g n | 2 + σ 2 , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">|h m | 2 = | ĥm | 2 (d m ) -α and |g n | 2 = | ĝn | 2 (d n ) -α .</formula><p>Here, ĥm and ĝn are small-scale fading with ĥm ∼ CN (0, 1) and ĝn ∼ CN (0, 1). d m is the distance from C m to the BS, and d n is the distance from DT n to the BS. α is the path-loss exponent.</p><p>The NOMA protocol requires the super-position coding technique at the D2D transmitter side and SIC techniques at the receivers.The vector a n = a n,1 , a n,2 represents the power allocation coefficients in each D2D group. The D2D transmitter D n sends superposed messages to the destinations based on the NOMA principle, i.e., D n sends a n,1 s n,1 + a n,2 s n,2 , where s n,1 and s n,2 are the messages for receiver 1 and 2, respectively. Therefore, the received signal at receiver 1 is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">z n,1 = f n,1 a n,1 P d s n,1 + a n,2 P d s n,2 + ζ n,1 + P c h m,n,1 x m + n * =n η n * ,n P d g n * ,n,1 t n * , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where NOMA systems exploit the power domain for multiple access, where different users are served at different power levels. For illustration, we assume that receiver 1 decodes and removes the signal to receiver 2 via SIC. The interference cancellation is successful if receiver 1's received SINR for receiver 2's signal is not smaller than the received SINR at receiver 2 for its own signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f n,1 , h m,n,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">f n,1 2 P d a n,2 I 2,in n,1 + I out n,1 + I c n,1 + σ 2 ≥ f n,2 2 P d a n,2 I 2,in n,2 + I out n,2 + I c n,2 + σ 2 , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">I 2,in n,1 = f n,1 2 P d a n,1 and I 2,in n,2 = f n,2 2 P d a n,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">I c n,1 = m η m,n P c h m,n,1 2 and I c n,2 = m η m,n P c h m,n,2 2</formula><p>is interference from cellular users received at 1 and 2, respectively.

PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this section, we first give the constraints of cellular users' received interference from the D2D groups, and then introduce the network sum rate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Interference Constraints</head><p>One of the key challenges in D2D communications underlaying cellular networks is the co-channel interference caused by the spectrum sharing between the D2D and traditional cellular links. To guarantee the service qualities of cellular and D2D users, we give the interference constraints expressed in the format of SINR as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">γ m = P c |h m | 2 n η n,m P d |g n | 2 + σ 2 ≥ γ thr m , (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">γ 2 n,2 = f n,2 2 P d a n,2 I 2,in n,2 + I out n,2 + I c n,2 + σ 2 ≥ γ thr n,2 , (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">γ 1 n,1 = f n,1 2 P d a n,1 I out n,1 + I c n,1 + σ 2 ≥ γ thr n,1 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where γ thr m , γ thr n,2 and γ thr n,1 are the given SINR thresholds for cellular user m, and that for receiver 2 and receiver 1 in D2D group n, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MATCHING THEORY BASED SUBCHANNEL ASSIGNMENT</head><p>In this section, we assume that the power allocated to the transmission from the transmitter to receivers in each D2D group is a fixed value, i.e., a n = a * n , ∀n ∈ {1, . . . , N}. Thus we can obtain the sub-problem of subchannel assignment as the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">max η R sum η, a * n , (16a) s.t.

The complexity of the exhaustive method increases exponentially with the number of D2D groups and subchannels, which makes it unpractical especially in a dense network. To describe the dynamic matching between the D2D groups and subchannels, we consider the subchannel assignment as a two-sided many-to-one matching process between the sets of D2D groups and subchannels. The D2D groups and subchannels act as two sets of players and interact with each other to maximize the sum rate. To solve this problem, we adopt the matching theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which provides mathematically tractable and low-complexity solutions for the combinatorial problem of matching players in two distinct sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We then formulate the subchannel assignment problem as a many-to-one matching problem and propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Many-to-One Matching With Peer Effects</head><p>To proceed with proposing the subchannel assignment algorithm, we first introduce some notations and basic definitions for the proposed matching model between the sets of D2D groups and subchannels.</p><p>Definition 1: In the many-to-one matching model, a matching is a function from the set SC ∪ D into the set of all subsets of SC ∪ D such that 1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">| (D n )| = 1, ∀D n ∈ D, and (D n ) = {D n } if (D n ) ⊂ SC ; 2) | (SC m )| ≤ q max , ∀SC m ∈ SC , and (SC m ) = ∅ if SC m is not matched to any D2D group; 3) (D n ) = {SC m } if and only if D n ∈ (SC m ).</formula><p>Note that a positive integer q max called quota is associated with each subchannel SC m , which indicates the maximum number of D2D groups that can be matched with each subchannel.</p><p>To better describe the competition behavior and decision process of each player, we assume that each player has preferences over the players of the other set. The preference of each player is based on the achievable utility, and we denote the set of preference lists of D2D groups and subchannels as PL = {P (D 1 ) , . . . , P (D N ) , P (SC 1 ) , . . . , P (SC M )}, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where P(D n ) is the preference list of D n over individual subchannels, and P(SC m ) is the preference list of SC m over sets of D2D groups. The preference lists of players are formed in descending order with respect to the utility of each side of the players. The utility definitions of D2D groups and subchannels are defined in the following.</p><p>For a D2D group D n , the utility on a subchannel SC m is defined as the achievable data rate of D n when it occupies SC m , which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">U n (m) = log 2 1 + γ 2 n,2 + log 2 1 + γ 1 n,1 .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, it is not difficult to find that the utility of a D2D group depends not only on the subchannel that it is matched with, but also on the set of D2D groups that are matched to the same subchannel, due to the existence of the co-channel interference I out n,k . Therefore, we have the following observation:</p><p>Remark 1: The proposed matching game has peer effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. That is, the D2D groups care not only where they are matched, but also which other D2D groups are matched to the same place.</p><p>This type of matching is called the matching game with peer effects, where each player has a dynamic preference list over the opposite set of players. This is different from the conventional matching games in which players have fixed preference lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In this matching model, the preference of players over the opposite set of players replies on the matching states. To this end, we need to define the new preference P * (D n ) of D2D group D n on the set of possible matchings rather than the P(D n ) which is simply the preference of D n on the subchannels. The relationship of "prefer" for a D2D group on subchannels under different matching states is expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where U n (m, ) is the utility of D2D group D n when it occupies the subchannel SC m under the matching state .</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">(m, ) n (m , ) ⇔ U n (m, ) &gt; U n (m , ),</formula><p>We define the preference values of subchannel SC m on a set of D2D groups S D as the sum rate of all the D2D groups and the corresponding cellular user, which is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">U m (S) = log 2 (1 + γ m (S)) + D n ∈S log 2 1 + γ 2 n,2 + log 2 1 + γ 1 n,1 ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where γ m (S) is the SINR of the cellular user C m when it shares the subchannel with the set of D2D groups S.</p><p>Based on the utility definition of the subchannel SC m , we can obtain the "prefer" relationship of SC m on the set of D2D groups S and S as</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">(S, ) m S , ⇔ U m (S, ) &gt; U m (S , ),<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where U m (S, ) is the utility of SC m on the set of D2D groups S under the matching state .</p><p>There is a growing literature studying many-to-one matchings with peer effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, these researches find that designing matching mechanisms is significantly more challenging when peer effects are considered. Motivated by the housing assignment problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, we propose an extended matching algorithm for the many-to-one matching problem with peer effects in the following.</p><p>Different from the traditional deferred acceptance algorithm solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the swap operations between any two D2D groups to exchange their matched subchannels is enabled. To better describe the interdependencies between the players' preferences, we first define the concept of swap matching as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">n n = { \ {(D n , (D n )), (D n , (D n ))}} ∪ {(D n , (D n ), (D n ), (D n ))}, (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">)</formula><p>where D2D groups D n and D n switch places while keeping other D2D groups and subchannels' matchings unchanged. It is worth noticing that one of the D2D groups involved in the swap can be a "hole" representing an open spot, thus allowing for single D2D groups moving to available vacancies of subchannels. Similarly, one of the subchannels involved in the swap can be a "hole" when</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">(D n ) = ∅.</formula><p>Based on the concept of a swap matching, the swap-blocking pair is defined in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">Definition 2: (D n , D n ) is a swap-blocking pair if and only if 1) ∀i ∈ {D n , D n , (D n ), (D n )} , U i ( n n ) ≥ U i ( ) and 2) ∃i ∈ {D n , D n , (D n ), (D n )}, such that U i ( n n ) &gt; U i ( ).</formula><p>Note that the above definition implies that if two D2D groups want to switch between two subchannels (or a single D2D group wants to switch with a "hole"), the subchannels involved must approve the swap. The condition (1) implies that the utilities of all the involved players should not be reduced after the swap operation between the swap-blocking pair (D i , D i ). The condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> indicates that at least one of the players' utilities is increased after the swap operation between the swap-blocking pair. This avoids looping between equivalent matchings where the utilities of all involved agents are indifferent. Through multiple swap operations, the dynamic preferences of players which depend on the entire matching of the others, and the peer effects of matchings are well handled.</p><p>As stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, there is no longer a guarantee that a traditional "pairwise-stability" exists when players care about more than their own matching, and, if a stable matching does exist, it can be computationally difficult to find. Bodine-Baron <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> focused on the two-sided exchange-stable matchings, which is defined as follows:</p><p>Definition 3: A matching μ is two-sided exchange-stable if there does not exist a swap-blocking pair.</p><p>The two-sided exchange stability is a distinct notion of stability compared to the traditional notion of stability of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, but one that is relevant to our situation where agents can compare notes with each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Proposed Subchannel Assignment Algorithm (SAA) Based on Many-to-One Matching</head><p>To find a two-sided exchange-stable matching for the matching game, we propose a matching-theory based subchannel assignment algorithm, i.e., SAA, between D2D groups and subchannels based on multiple swap operations, as shown in Algorithm 1. The input of the proposed algorithm includes the initial list of the number of D2D groups matched to each subchannel as well as the initial matching state. To initialize the matching state, we randomly match each D2D group with a subchannel or an empty set. If a D2D group is matched to an empty set, it indicates that no subchannel is allocated to the D2D group in the initial state. The main process of the proposed algorithm is the swap operation between different D2D groups, where each D2D group keeps searching for all the other D2D groups to check whether there is a swapblocking pair. Note that one of the D2D groups taking part in the swap operations can be an available vacancy of a subchannel. The swap operations continue until there are no more swap-blocking pairs, and the final matching state is the output.</p><p>Regarding the time scale of SAA, the signaling packet length required for the communication between the D2D groups and subchannels until the algorithm converges is very short. In particular, each D2D group is only required to send one bit to another D2D group indicating a swap-operation offer, and then the involved D2D groups each send a one-bit request to their occupying subchannels. Finally, the subchannels only need to send one bit back to the offering D2D groups indicating either accept or reject the request. The total amount of overhead from SAA thus can be quite small, which enables it to well perform in practical scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Property Analysis of SAA</head><p>To evaluate the performance of SAA, we analyze the properties in terms of effectiveness, stability, convergence and complexity in this subsection.</p><p>Theorem 1: The final matching * of SAA is a two-sided exchange-stable matching.</p><p>Algorithm 1 Matching-Theory Based Subchannel Assignment Algorithm (SAA)</p><p>1: -Input:</p><p>• Initial matching 0 : Randomly match each D2D group with SC ∈ {SC , ∅} satisfying the constraint that q m ≤ q max , ∀q m ∈ Q ; • Initial list of the number of D2D groups matched to each subchannel Q = {q 1 , . . . , q M }. end for 12: end for 13: until (D n , D n ) blocks the current matching. 14: -Output: Final matching * .</p><p>Proof: Assume that there exists a swap-blocking pair</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">(D n , D n ) in the final matching * satisfying that ∀i ∈ n, n , (D n ), (D n ) , U i ( * ) n n ≥ U i ( * ) and ∃i ∈ n, n , (D n ), (D n ) , such that U i ( * ) n n &gt; U i ( * ).</formula><p>According to SAA, the algorithm does not terminate until all the swap-blocking pairs are eliminated. In other words, * is not the final matching, which causes conflict. Therefore, there does not exist a swap-blocking pair in the final matching, and thus we can conclude that the proposed algorithm reaches a two-sided exchange stability in the end of the algorithm.</p><p>Lemma 1: The system sum rate increases after each swap operation.</p><p>Proof: Suppose a swap operation makes the matching state change from to n n . According to SAA, a swap operation occurs only when</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">U m ( n n ) ≥ U m ( ) as well as U m ( n n ) ≥ U m ( ). Given that U m ( (m), ) = R m ( (m), ) + n∈ (m) L n k=1 R n,k (m, ), we have → n n = U m n n (m), n n -U m ( (m), ) = R sum n n -R sum ( ) &gt; 0, (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_45">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">→ n n</formula><p>is the difference of the system sum rates under the matching state n n and that under the matching state . From <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, we conclude that the system sum rate increases after each successful swap operation.</p><p>Theorem 2: The proposed subchannel assignment algorithm converges within limited number of iterations.</p><p>Proof: In the proposed matching model, the number of players is limited and the maximum number of D2D groups can be allocated to each subchannel is restricted, which indicates that the number of potential swap operations is finite. Moreover, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, we find that the system sum rate increases after each successful swap operation. Since the system sum rate has an upper bound due to limited spectrum resources, the swap operations stop when the system sum rate is saturated. Therefore, within limited number of rounds, the matching process converges to the final state which is stable.</p><p>Theorem 3: The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is of the order O 0 → * min in the worst case. Proof: As shown in SAA, the complexity of the proposed algorithm mainly depends on the number of iterations in the swap-matching phase. Since it is uncertain that at which step the algorithm converges to a two-sided exchange stable matching, the number of iterations cannot be given in a closedform expression. We will analyze the number of total iterations for different numbers of D2D groups in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, and give more detailed analysis in section VI. Here, we give an upper bound of the complexity. As proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, the sum rate increases with the swap operations going on. We denote the difference of the sum rates of the final matching and the initial matching as 0 → * , and the minimum increase of each swap operation as min . Thus, in the worst case, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is of the the order O 0 → * min . Theorem 4: All local maxima of system sum rate corresponds to a two-sided exchange-stable matching.</p><p>Proof: Assume that the sum rate achieved by matching is a local maximal value. If is not a stable matching, there exists a swap-blocking pair that can further improve the sum rate, as proved in Lemma 1. However, this is inconsistent with the assumption that is local optimal. Hence, we conclude that is a two-sided exchange-stable matching.</p><p>However, not all two-sided exchange-stable matchings obtained from SAA can achieve the local maximum of system sum rate. The reason can be shown in a simple example. D2D group D n does not approve the swap operation with D n along with their current matched subchannels SC m and SC m , due to the fact that the utility of D n is decreased after the swap operation. However, SC m and SC m can benefit a lot from this swap operation, which causes that the optimal sum rate can not be achieved by the swap operations. Of course, we can force the swap operation to happen to further improve the sum rate, but this will obtain a weaker stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p></div>

Theorem 6: The convergent solution of PAA is a first-order optimal solution of the problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, which satisfies the KKT conditions.</p><p>Proof: Denote the power allocation indicator at convergence of PAA is a * n . Since a * n is the optimal solution of the concave problem in (35), a * n must satisfy the KKT conditions of (35). Actually, the problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and (35) share the same constraints but have different objective functions with R n,1 + R n,2 and n,1 (2 s n,1 ) + n,2 (2 s n,2 ) , respectively. However, when PAA converges, we have R n,1 + R n,2 = n,1 (2 s n,1 ) + n,2 (2 s n,2 ) . Therefore, a * n also satisfies the KKT conditions of the problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Joint Subchannel and Power Allocation Algorithm</head><p>Based on the two proposed algorithms, i.e., SAA and PAA, it is worth considering how to jointly consider subchannel and power allocation together. In the following, we demonstrate two approaches:</p><p>1) Iterative Joint Subchannel and Power Allocation Algorithm (I-JSPA): According to the optimization problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, the subchannel assignment indicator η and the power allocation coefficient a jointly influence the sum data rate. Therefore, we propose a joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm where the power allocation, i.e., PAA, is executed iteratively after each swap operation in SAA, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>. In this way, the power allocation coefficient a can be updated timely after any change of the subchannel assignment indicator η, which improves the system performance. However, the shortcoming of this approach is the high complexity, which increases exponentially with the number of swap operations.</p><p>2) Low-Complexity Joint Subchannel and Power Allocation Algorithm (LC-JSPA): Because of the high complexity of I-JSPA, we propose an alternative low-complexity approach, which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b</ref>). Without knowing the subchannel assignment result, we can not decide on the SIC order in each D2D group, and thus can not complete the power allocation. Therefore, we first solve the subchannel assignment problem via SAA based on random given initial values of the power allocation coefficients a n , ∀n. After the convergence of SAA, the BS can allocate power to receivers in each D2D group via PAA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>In this section, we investigate the performance of the proposed joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm through simulations. We give the performance of the joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm in I-JSPA and LC-JSPA, respectively. The performance of the exhaustive search and the one-to-one matching based algorithm are also provided as benchmarks for comparison, in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. More particularly, the exhaustive search enables searching for all possible subchannel allocation ways while the power allocation is also performed exhaustively for each given case. Since power is a continuous variable, it is not easy to search for all possible power allocation values. Therefore, we search approximately for the values of a n = {a n,1 , a n,2 } with an interval of , through which we can obtain the approximately global optimal solution. In the one-to-one matching algorithm, one D2D group can use no more than one subchannel, and one subchannel can only be allocated to one D2D group. We give random pairing between subchannels and cellular users. The specific parameter value settings are summarized in Table II unless otherwise specified.</p><p>The performance of the conventional OMA based D2D communications is also illustrated in an effort to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed NOMA enhanced D2D scheme. For OMA based D2D communications, the achievable data rates for receiver 1 and 2 in the n-th D2D group are 1  2 log 2 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">+ P d | f n,1 | 2 I out n,1 +I c n,1 +σ 2 and 1 2 log 2 1 + P d | f n,2 | 2 I out n,2 +I c</formula><p>n,2 +σ 2 , respectively, where 1  2 is due to the fact that the time/frequency resource is split among receivers 1 and 2, which is as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. II]</ref>. The many-to-one matching, one-to-one matching and exhaustive search are also applied to the OMA based D2D scenarios, respectively, with the aim of comparing the performance of the corresponding NOMA enhanced D2D scenarios with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Convergence of the Proposed Algorithm</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> plots the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of swap operations for the matching process, and thus demonstrates the convergence of the proposed subchannel assignment algorithm for different number of D2D groups in the network. The CDF shows that the proposed matching algorithm converges within a small number of iterations. For example, when there are 11 D2D groups in the network, on average a maximum of 40 iterations is required to ensure the proposed algorithm to converge. One can also observe that the number of swap operations increases with the increased number of D2D groups, which is due to the improved probability of the existence of swap-blocking pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. I-JSPA Versus LC-JSPA</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> investigates the total sum rate versus different D2D transmit signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The number of D2D groups is set to N = 6. As can be observed, the total sum rate increases with the D2D transmit SNR since the received SINR at the receivers are improved by allocating more power at the transmitters. For comparison, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the performance of the fixed power allocation algorithm, where the power allocation coefficients are set to a n,1 = 0.4, a n,2 = 0.6. It can be observed that the fixed power allocation algorithm achieves substantially lower sum rate compared to the proposed algorithm. Besides, it also shows that LC-JSPA closely approaches the performance of I-JSPA. As discussed before, since the complexity of I-JSPA increases exponentially with the number of swap operations, we adopt LC-JSPA in the remaining parts of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. NOMA-Enhanced Versus OMA-Based D2D Communications</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that, the number of accessed D2D groups increases as the number of D2D groups in the network increases. This is because as N increases, the probability of D2D groups with less interference to the cellular UEs being assigned to them increases, which leads to larger number of accessed D2D groups that can meet the SINR constraints of cellular UEs. This phenomenon is similar to the effect of multiuser diversity. It is worth noting that with the increase of the number of D2D groups in the network, the increasing rate of the number of accessed D2D groups becomes smaller due to the enhanced co-channel interference. One can also observe  that the number of accessed D2D groups can get saturated quickly in the one-to-one matching algorithm. This is due to the fact that each subchannel can be allocated to no more than one D2D group. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> plots the total sum rate versus different number of D2D groups in the network. One can observe that the sum rate increases with the number of D2D groups, which follows the intuition that more D2D groups contribute to a higher total sum rate. It is also observed that the proposed algorithm achieves much higher sum rate compared to the one-to-one matching algorithm. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm is capable of reaching around 94.3% of the result of the exhaustive search. Recall the complexity of the proposed algorithm, which is much lower than the exhaustive search, unequivocally substantiates the plausibility of the proposed algorithm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> also demonstrates that the NOMA enhanced D2D scheme achieves larger sum rate than the conventional OMA based D2D scheme, which demonstrates the performance gains of the prior one and provides a good answer to Question 1 in Section I. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> plots the number of accessed receivers versus different number of D2D groups in the network. It can be seen from the figure that the number of accessed receivers in the proposed algorithm is larger than that in the one-to-one matching algorithm. This is because more than one D2D groups are allowed to be allocated to one subchannel in the proposed algorithm, and thus the resource utilization is improved. It is also noted that the NOMA enhanced D2D communications achieves a larger number of accessed D2D receivers than the OMA based D2D communications, which further shows the merits of applying NOMA transmission protocol in D2D communications, and answers Question 2 in Section I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Impact of Interference Constraints for Cellular Users</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>(a) shows the number of accessed D2D groups versus different D2D transmit SNR and different SINR constraints of cellular users. It can be observed that the number of accessed D2D groups decreases with higher SINR constraint of the cellular users. This is because the maximum allowed interference for the cellular users gets smaller with the higher SINR constraint, and therefore the number of acceptable D2D groups for each subchannel is decreased. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>(a) further shows that the number of accessed D2D groups increases with the lower D2D transmit SNR. This is due to the fact that the interference caused to the cellular users and other D2D groups occupying the same subchannels gets smaller with the lower D2D transmit SNR, and thus the acceptable number of D2D groups on each subchannel is increased.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>(b) depicts the total sum rate versus different D2D transmit SNR and different SINR constraint of the cellular users. We can see that the total sum rate decreases with the higher SINR constraint of the cellular users. This can be easily understood because of the smaller number of accessed D2D groups, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>(a). Besides, it is easy to find that, when the D2D transmit SNR is small, the total sum rate increases with the larger SNR, which is caused by the increased transmit power. When the D2D transmit SNR increases to a certain value, the total sum rate starts to decrease with the higher value of D2D transmit SNR. This is because of the smaller number of accessed D2D groups as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>(a). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>(a) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>(b) illustrates how the interference constraints of cellular users influence the sum rate and number of accessed D2D groups, which gives an answer to Question 3 in Section I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the device-to-device (D2D) communications has been studied. With the objective of maximizing network sum rate while satisfying the interference constraints of cellular users, a joint subchannel and power allocation problem was formulated. Since the formulated problem was a mixed-integer non-convex problem, it was decoupled into two subproblems, i.e., subchannel assignment and power allocation problems. A novel algorithm invoking many-to-one matching theory was proposed for tackling the subchannel assignment problem. Based on the subchannel assignment result, the nonconvex power allocation problem for receivers in each D2D group was solved by applying the sequential convex programming, which was proved to be convergent. Simulation results showed that the proposed joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm approached close to the exhaustive-searching method. It was also shown that the proposed NOMA enhanced D2D scheme outperformed the conventional OMA based D2D scheme, in terms of both sum rate and number of accessed users.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
