<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A ring signature scheme can be viewed as a group signature scheme with no anonymity revocation and with simple group setup. A linkable ring signature (LRS) scheme additionally allows anyone to determine if two ring signatures have been signed by the same group member. Recently, Dodis et al. [19]  gave a short (constant-sized) ring signature scheme. We extend it to the first short LRS scheme, and reduce its security to a new hardness assumption, the Link Decisional RSA (LD-RSA) Assumption. We also extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>'s other schemes to a generic LRS scheme and a generic linkable group signature scheme. We discuss three applications of our schemes. Kiayias and Yung [23]  constructed the first e-voting scheme which simultaneously achieves efficient tallying, public verifiability, and write-in capability for a typical voter distribution under which only a small portion writes in. We construct an e-voting scheme based on our short LRS scheme which achieves the same even for all worst-case voter distribution. Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is essentially a ring signature scheme with certain linking properties that can be naturally implemented using LRS schemes. The construction of an offline anonymous e-cash scheme using LRS schemes is also discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A group signature scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> allows a member to sign messages anonymously on behalf of his group. The group manager is responsible to form the group and assign to the members the ability to sign. However, in the case of a dispute, the identity of a signature's originator can be revealed (only) by a designated entity.</p><p>A ring signature scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> can be viewed as a group signature scheme with no anonymity revocation and with simple group setup. Formation of a group is spontaneous: diversion group members can be totally unaware of being conscripted to the group. Applications include leaking secrets <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and anonymous identification/authentication for ad hoc groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>Linkable ring signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> are ring signatures, but with added linkability: such signatures allow anyone to determine if they are signed by the same group member (i.e. they are linked ).

If the user signs multiple times, anyone can tell that these signatures have been generated by the same group member. Applications include leaking sequences of secrets and e-voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Concepts similar to linkability also appeared in oneshow credentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, linkable group signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, and DAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Early constructions of (linkable) ring/group signature schemes have large signature sizes, which are usually O(n) where n is the group size. Subsequent results incorporating various techniques reduced the sizes of state-of-the-art group signatures to a constant independent of group size. Consult <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> for details. Essentially all ring signatures have sizes O(n). Recently, Dodis, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> gave a short ring signature scheme construction. In this paper, we extend their technique to construct a short LRS scheme. We also extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>'s generic ring (resp. group) signature scheme constructions to their linkable version.</p><p>Tracing-by-linking versus tracing-by-escrowing in group signatures. The following two papers came to our attention after the completion of this research: Teranishi, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Wei <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. They achieve tracing-by-linking, i.e. tracing the double signer's public key without identity escrowing to an Open Authority (OA). In comparison, tradtional group signatures use the tracing-by-escrowing technique, and give the Open Authority the unnecessary power to open an honest signer's identity even when there is no dispute to investigate. Comparing the two tracing-by-linking group signatures: <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>'s has smaller size. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>'s has larger, but still O <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>, size, but it is more flexible and supports features such as tracing the double signer's secret key, tracing the double signer's identity without going through the public key, etc. Another paper containing tracing-by-linking ring signature is due to Tsang, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Constant-sized LRS schemes have many applications. We describe three of them briefly in the following.</p><p>E-Voting. There are three basic paradigms for cryptographically secure ballot elections. Under the blind signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> paradigm, the voters obtain ballots from the authorities, certified but privacy-preserved. This enables them to embed any form of ballot (including write-ins). This approach requires the employment of an anonymous channel between the voter and the tallying authorities to hide the identity of the user at the "ballot casting stage." Note that universal verifiability is missing and robustness is usually achieved by thresholding the authority.</p><p>Under the homomorphic encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> paradigm, the ballots are encrypted and then "compressed" via a homomorphic encryption scheme into a tally. This compression property allows fast tallying, and is what makes this approach attractive. However the drawback is that pure "compressible" homomorphic encryption is not suitable to deal with write-in ballots.</p><p>Under the mix-net <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> paradigm, the tallying officials move the ballots between them and permute them in the process while changing their representation (e.g., partially decrypting them). Practical implementations of this approach in its fully robust form is still considered a slow tallying process.</p><p>Offline Anonymous Electronic Cash (E-cash). Most of the e-cash systems found in the literature makes use of blind signatures. In such systems, the users withdraw electronic coins, which consist of numbers generated by users and blindly signed by the bank. Each signature represents a given amount. These coins are then spent in shops which can authenticate them by using the public signature key of the bank. The users retain anonymity in any transaction since the coins they use have been blindly signed. Existing schemes of this category are fruitful, some of the important ones are: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>E-cash systems by group signatures recently received much attention. The idea is as follows: the group members in the group signature scheme forms a group of users. The bank (acting as the GM) is capable of issuing electronic coins (which are actually the ability to sign) to the users. When a user spends, he/she signs a group signature for the shop. The anonymity inherited from the group signature scheme provides privacy for the users. Examples: <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA). In the context of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), DAA is a solution to the following problem: The user of such a platform communicates with a verifier who wants to be assured that the user indeed uses a platform containing such a trusted hardware module, i.e., the verifier wants the trusted platform module (TPM) to authenticate itself. However, the user wants her privacy protected and therefore requires that the verifier only learns that she uses a TPM but not which particular one.</p><p>The first solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> has the drawback of requiring a TTP to be online in every transaction. Also, anonymity is lost when the TTP and the verifier collude. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> solves the problem by making use of a group signature scheme variant based on the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya group signature scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Among other differences from the original scheme, the two crucial ones are (1) disabling anonymity revocation and (2) including a pseudonym in the signatures.</p><p>Contributions.</p><p>-We extend the short ring signature scheme construction of Dodis, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to the first short LRS scheme construction, and reduce its security to a set of assumptions including a new hardness assumption, the Link Decisional RSA (LD-RSA) Assumption. -We also extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>'s generic ring (resp. group) signature scheme constructions to their linkable version. -Motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, who presented the first e-voting scheme that simultaneously achieved efficient tallying, universal verifiability, and write-in capability for typical voter distribution under which only a small portion writes in, we discuss that e-voting scheme constructed from LRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> schemes also achieve the same three properties even for all worst-case voter distributions. -We discuss an efficient implementation of direct anonymous attestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> using linkable ring signatures, and the construction of an e-cash scheme using linkable group signatures.</p></div>

We adopt the definition of this concept from Bellare, et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. In a nutshell, it is a three-move zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge system that is simulation sound, meaning that oracles specified in the security model can be successfully simulated, and that is computational zero-knowledge, meaning no PPT program can distinguish between real world and ideal world. For details, consult <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Accumulator with One-Way Domain. We adopt this concept introduced in Dodis, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Just a brief summary below. An accumulator family is a pair ({F i },{X i }) where F i is a family of functions whose member is s.t. f : U f × X i → U f and the accumulator family satisfies efficient generation, efficient evaluation, and quasi-commutativity. An accumulator is collision resistant if it is rare to have two different sequences accumulated to the same value.</p><p>An accumulator with one-way domain is a quadruple</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">({F i }, {X i }, {Z i }, {R i }) where ({F i }, {X i }) is a collision-resistant accumulator, each R i is a re- lation over X i × Z i satisfying efficient verification,</formula><p>efficient sampling, and onewayness.

Let N = pq = (2p + 1)(2q + 1) be a sufficiently large safe prime product. Let g ∈ QR(N ), with order p q . Let p 0 , q 0 , p 1 , q 1 be four sufficiently large and distinct primes. Let b be a fair coin flip, n 0 = p 0 q 1 , n 1 = p 1 q 1 . Given n 0 , n 1 , g p b +q b , the LD-RSA Assumption says that no PPT algorithm can compute b correctly with probability non-negligibly over 1/2.</p></div>

The Corruption Oracle, on input a public key pk i ∈ Y that is an output of LRKg, returns the corresponding secret key sk i ∈ X . -σ ← SO(gpk, s, M ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Generic Constructions without Accumulators</head><p>We present two generic LRS scheme constructions with signature size O(n). Let R ⊆ X × Y denote an efficiently-samplable, one-way NP-relation that is typical of sk-pk relations. Let θ d : X → Ỹ denote a one-way bijective mapping. Two LRS schemes are constructed as follows:</p><p>-LRKg: Upon input 1 λ , output a pair of n-vectors (gpk, gsk) where (gsk[i],</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">gpk[i]) ∈ R, each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.</formula><p>-LRSign: Upon inputs gpk, sk = gsk[s], message M , R, and a one-way bijective mapping θ d , produces a linkable ring signature following either Eq <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> or Eq (2) below (thereby resulting in two different constructions):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(LRS1) SP K{sk : (∨ 1≤i≤n (sk, gpk[i]) ∈ R) ∧ (ỹ = θ d (sk))}(M ), or<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">(LRS2) SP K{sk : ∨ 1≤i≤n (((sk, gpk[i]) ∈ R) ∧ (ỹ i = θ d (sk)))}(M ). (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>We adopt the notation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> in the above. -LRVf: Straightforward. Accepts if the corresponding PoK is verified to be correct. -Link: For LRS1, examine the linkability tag, ỹ, from each of the two input signatures and outputs linked if and only if they are equal. For LRS2, compare the lists of linkability tags of the signatures and outputs linked if and only if they contain at least one tag in common.</p><p>Theorem 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> implies the existence of efficient implementations of LRS1 and LRS2. The complexity of the signatures implied by the theorem is polynomially growing, but is high in practice. In Appendix A, we provide efficient instantiations of LRS1 and LRS2 that use two popular mechanisms to achieve 1out-of-n proof-of-knowledge, namely Cramer, et al.'s partial proof-of-knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Rivest, et al.'s ring structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Generic Construction with Accumulators</head><p>We construct a short LRS scheme, using methods motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f (u, {z 1 , • • • , z n }) . = f (• • • (f (f (u, z 1 ), z 2 ), • • • , z n ), the accumulation of z 1 , • • • , z n .</formula><p>The signing algorithm of the scheme is given by the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">-LRSign: Let gpk=(y 1 , • • • , y n ), and gsk[s] = x.

The signature is computed as σ = (LRS3) SP K{(w, y s , x) : (y s , x) ∈ R ∧ f (w, y s ) = v ∧ ỹ = θ d (x)}(M ) (3)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">The Short Linkable Ring Signature Scheme Construction</head><p>The generic construction in the previous section is further instantiated by the following parameter choices: Use the accumulator f (u, x) = u x mod N where N = pq = (2p + 1)(2q + 1) is a sufficiently large safe prime product.

We have in mind ≈ λ/2, µ sufficiently small, p and q at least λ/2 plus a few bits long. Let θ d (e 1 , e 2 ) = g e1+e2 θ , where g θ ∈ RQ(N ) and is fairly generated. Given the above instantiations, LRS3 becomes: (LRS3') SP K{(w, x, e 1 , e 2 ) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">w x = v mod N ∧ x = 2e 1 e 2 + 1 ∧ |e 1 -2 |, |e 2 -2 | &lt; 2 µ ∧ ỹ = θ d ((e 1 , e 2 ))}(M )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Writing down the Σ-protocol explicitly, LRS3' becomes (LRS4) SP K{(r, w, x, e 1 , e 2 ) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">T 1 = g r ∧ T 2 = g x h r ∧ T 3 = g e2 s r ∧T 4 = wy r ∧ T 5 = g e1 t r ∧ T x 1 = g a1 ∧ T e 2 1 = g a2 ∧ T x 4 = vy a1 ∧T 2e 2 5 g = g x t 2a2 ∧ |e 1 -2 |, |e 2 -2 | &lt; 2 µ ∧ ỹ = g e 1 +e 2 θ }(M ) (5)</formula><p>where a 1 = xr, a 2 = e 2 r. The above instantiates a O(1)-sized linkable ring signature scheme, provided the list of public keys y 1 , • • • , y n is not included in the signature.</p></div>

But they are too complex for practical system parameters. The linkable ring signature instantiation LRS4 is efficient even for practical system parameters. This construction closely followed the short ring signature of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and therefore inherits several of their properties. In particular, there is no rigorous proof of unforgeability and unlinkability. We have only been able to obtain the following security reduction of L-anonymity.  , then L-anonymity is lost because the proof system LRS4 Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is no longer computational zero-knowledge. However, a (probably) secure alternative choice is θ d,4 ((e 1 , e 2 )) = (g e 1 θ , g e 2 θ ). Note that θ d,2 while θ d,3 are not special PK-bijective.</p><p>A related security requirement is to that, given a random sample y 1 , it is hard to compute y 2 such that there exist x 1 , x 2 , satisfying (x 1 , y 1 ), (x 2 , y 2 ) ∈ R, θ d (x 1 ) = θ d (x 2 ). This stronger concept may be needed in further study of the current topic, but it is not needed in the present paper.</p><p>It is straightforward to extend our LRS's to linkable group signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Simply also escrow the user identity (or the user public key) to an Open Authority (OA) in the signatures. The escrow can be done by verifiably encrypt the identity (or public key) to the OA by methods in <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, for example.</p><p>Dynamic group setting. We have used the static group setting, where memberships to the group remain unchanged during the course of signature generation and verification. Our scheme and security model can be adapted for dynamic group settings. The Join operation can be implemented. The group membership manager maintains a list of all members' public keys.</p><p>Other kinds of user key pairs. LRS schemes in which user key pairs are from cryptosystems other than RSA can be similarly constructed. We have in mind modifications to the usual form of public key for added security against potential coalition attacks. E.g., for DL user key pairs R = {(x, y = 2g x + 1)}, for pairings R = {(x, first coordinate of P x )}, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Applications</head><p>We discuss in this section the application of LRS schemes to E-voting, offline anonymous electronic cash and direct anonymous attestation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">E-voting</head><p>Remarkable advances in group/ring signatures in recent years have given new options to e-voting scheme constructions. In fact, many papers on group/ring signatures have included e-voting as applications. Using group/ring signatures contributes to a new paradigm of e-voting construction.</p><p>Nevertheless, none of the existing group/ring signature schemes gives raise to a satisfactory construction. First, most group signature schemes are unlinkable, which means double-voting cannot be detected (an exception: the one-show credential system due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). Secondly, and more importantly, anonymity revocation is an inherited property in group signatures/credential systems. Note that anonymity is of prime concern in e-voting. Nothing justifies to open a vote.</p><p>Previously proposed linkable ring signature schemes partly solved the problem because they have (1) double-voting detecting capability and (2) no anonymity revocation. However, all existing schemes have signature sizes linear with the signing group, which makes them impractical when used in large-scale voting. Our short linkable ring signature scheme (LRS4) has constant signature size and is thus very practical in this sense.</p><p>Construction. We use the construction of an e-voting scheme from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The main contribution of the current paper w.r.t. this e-voting scheme is that we have an O(1)-sized signature whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> used an O(n)-sized signature, where n is the group size. We summarize the e-voting scheme below. For further details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>-(Registration.) Through a registration process, a list of the public keys of all eligible voters is published. Each voter can check if his public key is included.</p><p>A number of independent registrants can be used to ensure that no ineligible entity is listed. -(Vote Casting.) Each voter sends in a linkable ring signature on a message which states its selected candidate, from a prescribed candidate list or as a write-in candidate. The cast ballots can be listed in a public bulletin board for voter inspection. -(Tallying.) Simply verify all received linkable ring signatures, drop the invalid or linked ones, and tally the remaining according to their signed messages.</p><p>Kiayias and Yung <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> hybridized homomorphic encryption and mix-net to achieves simultaneously (1) efficient tallying, (2) universal verifiability and (3) write-in capability under typical voter distribution where only a small proportion of voters write-in. Our e-voting scheme above achieves the same even under worst-case voter distributions: the proportion of voters who write in can vary from negligible to overwhelming. To write-in in our scheme, a voter simply sends in a linkable ring signature on the message which includes its write-in candidate.</p><p>If one worries about the group manager having too much power from knowing the factoring of N , then Boneh and Franklin's <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> for generating N collaboratively among a number of servers, none of which knows the factoring of N , can be used. Nakanishi, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> presented e-voting from linkable group signature. Our version of the linkable group signature can also be used to construct e-voting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA)</head><p>In essence, DAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is a group signature without revocability, and with an additional feature of rogue tagging. Double signers can be detected, or linked, yet their identities are not revealed. When a double signer is detected, a rogue tag is produced to prevent it from signing again: future signatures (attestations) identified with a known rogue tag is not accepted. Double signers of different transactions with the same basename, bsn, are detected. But signing twice with different basename is not detected.</p><p>The linkable ring signature is ideally suited to implementing DAA. It is a group signature without revocation. Its linkability feature can be used to detect double signers, and when linked output the linkability tag, ỹ = g sk θ , as the rogue tag. Future signatures whose ỹ equals a known rogue tag is not accepted. The value g θ can be made a function of the basename but not the transaction, e.g. g θ = Hash(bsn, • • • ). Then double signing on different transactions with same basename is linked, while double signing on different basename will not be linked.</p><p>Below, we highlight a few important points in implementing DAA from linkable ring signatures. Further details are straightforward from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and omitted.</p><p>-(Setup for Issuer.) The issuer acts as the GM. He initializes our short linkable ring signature scheme. -(Join Protocol.) The TPM joins by first running LRKg of the linkable ring signature scheme in order to obtain a user key pair. It then submits the public key to the Issuer and retains the secret key. It also proves to the Issuer that the public key is correctly formed. -(DAA-Signing Protocol.) The TPM signs a linkable ring signature by invoking the LRS.Sign algorithm. -(Verification Algorithm.) This is exactly the same as LRS.Verify.</p><p>-(Rogue Tagging.) When a user secret key is found, it should be distributed to all potential verifiers. These verifiers can then put the key on their list of rogue keys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">E-cash</head><p>Our LRS scheme (LRS4) can also be used to construct an e-cash scheme. It serves as a new alternative to e-cash schemes of the "group signature approach", as described in the introduction.</p><p>Construction. The Bank takes the role of the GM. We adopt the "group of coins" model: each user key pair represents a coin; the knowledge of a user secret key means the ability to spend a coin; and anonymity is among the group of coins issued. The Bank initializes our short linkable group signature scheme. Assume the shops and the users have their accounts established with the bank.</p><p>-(Withdrawal) To withdraw a coin, the user first runs LRKg to obtain a key pair. He keeps the secret key with himself and gives the public key to the bank. The bank debits the user's account, and update the group public key by accumulating the new public key into the current group public key. -(Payment) The user signs a linkable group signature, using his secret key, on the payment transcript, on behalf of the most up-to-date coin group (i.e. using the most up-to-date group public key). The shop verifies against the signature and accepts the payment if the signature is valid. -(Deposit) The shop gives the bank the payment transcript, along with the associated linkable group signature. The bank verifies as the shop did and credits the shop's account if the signature is valid. To detect double-spending, the bank goes through the deposit database to look for signatures that are linked.</p><p>Double spenders of the e-cash are detected as double signers of the linkable ring signature scheme. However, methodologies differ after detection. In non-accusatory linkability, the suspect can only be tagged and prevented from further double spending afterwards. The drawbacks are time delay to effective tagging and small punishment for the offense. In accusatory linkability, the linking algorithm outputs a suspect. But there are issues of non-slanderability and deniability that can be quite subtle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have presented generic LRS scheme constructions with provable security and the first short LRS scheme construction, with security reducible to the LD-RSA problem. We have shown a generic LGS scheme construction with provable security. Also, we have given the first bandwidth-conserving e-voting scheme that simultaneously achieves efficient tallying, universal verifiability, and write-in capability, even in the worst case of voter distribution. We have discussed how to implement DAA and e-cash systems using LRS/LGS schemes.</p></div>
