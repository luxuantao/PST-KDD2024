<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper aims to provide a solution method for a real-world scheduling case from a welding process, which is one of the important processes in modern industry. The unique characteristic of the welding scheduling problem (WSP) is that multiple machines can process one operation at a time. Thus, WSP is a new scheduling problem. We first formulate a new multi-objective mixed integer programming model for this WSP based on a comprehensive investigation. This model involves some realistic constraints, controllable processing times (CPT), sequence dependent setup times (SDST) and job dependent transportation times (JDTT). Then we propose a multi-objective discrete grey wolf optimizer (MODGWO) considering not only production efficiency but also machine load on this real-world scheduling case. The solution is encoded as a two-part representation including a permutation vector and a machine assignment matrix. A reduction machine load strategy is used to adjust the number of machines aiming to minimize the machine load. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MODGWO, we compare it with other well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms including NSGA-II and SPEA2 on a set of instances. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MODGWO is superior to the compared algorithms in terms of convergence, spread and coverage on most instances. Finally, MODGWO is successfully applied to this real-world WSP. This implies that the proposed model is feasible and the proposed algorithm can solve this real-world scheduling problem very well.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Welding is one of the most crucial technologies of materials forming and processing in modern manufacturing sectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> , which has been widely applied in a variety of industrial fields such as petroleum chemical industry, mechanical industry, space flight and aviation, and microelectronic engineering. Welding process accounts for a noticeable portion of the total manufacturing process <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> . In general, a reasonable welding schedule scenario can effectively im prove production efficiency. Thus, welding scheduling problem (WSP) plays an important role in promoting an enterprise to be a manufacturing giant. However, studies on the WSP are relatively scarce in comparison with other real-world scheduling problems such as steelmaking scheduling issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> . The main reasons for few researches on the real-world WSP may be the following aspects.</p><p>(1) The main difference between WSP and the traditional scheduling problem is the number of machines required to process the operation of one job. In most scheduling problems, one job is usually handled by one and only one machine at a time. However, in a realistic welding situation, it is common to observe that multiple welding machines can process a job at the same time. This characteristic should be considered when modeling and solving WSP. Thus, it increases the difficulty of modeling. (2) WSP can be regarded as a special permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSP). Thus, WSP is also NP-hard due to NP-hard nature of the PFSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . Nevertheless, WSP is more sophisticated in the practical production since it involves some realistic constraints, sequence dependent setup times (SDST), job dependent transportation times (JDTT), and controllability of processing times at certain stages. However, most existing models are simplified versions ignoring some realistic assumptions, which cannot completely satisfy requirements of the real-word welding workshop. The above reasons increase the complexity of this study. Clearly, there still exists a significant gap between theoretical research and practical application <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> . Therefore, WSP is an important research topic in terms of both theory and application.</p><p>This paper investigates a multi-objective WSP from a realistic welding workshop in China, which has guiding significance on the modern welding industry. In this realistic workshop, the welding process mainly includes five stages (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ): (1) Splices of small pieces, in which many small pieces such as rib plate and cover plate are melted into several parts by the TIG welding machine, and then these parts are conveyed to the next stage. (2) Splices of large parts, in which several parts are melted into a complete part by the CO 2 shield semi auto welder. (3) Internal seam welding, in which continuously weld on the web, plate and so on. Turn over the part after the welding operation of one side of the web is completed, and perform the same operation on the other side of the web by the CO 2 shield semi auto welder. (4) Encapsulation, in which box beam is transferred down by the crane and fixed in a predetermined position. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) Outside seam welding, in which the both sides of the box beam are welded by the submerged arc automatic welder. Furthermore, the real-world WSP is a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) in nature. Purely single-objective scheduling problem cannot fully reflect the requirements of the real-world production system. Thus, this realworld WSP takes into account two main criteria, namely, makespan and machine load or interference. One simple strategy for addressing multiple objectives is to combine them into a scalar function by giving fixed weights to each objective function, and then an optimization algorithm is adopted to solve this scalar objective problem. Nevertheless, in most MOPs, objectives have different scales and thus it is difficult to determine weight values <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> . Therefore, it is better to handle multiple objectives with knowledge about Pareto dominance. Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is suitable for solving multi-objective scheduling problems since it can yield the non-dominated solutions in a single run <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . For example, Han et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> presented an improved NSGA-II and applied it to tackle the lot-streaming flow shop scheduling problem with four criteria. Ciavotta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> developed a new MOEA and provided a comprehensive study on multi-objective permutation flow shop with sequence dependent setup times. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> developed a multi-objective genetic algorithm based on the immune and entropy concept for flexible job shop scheduling problem. Amin-Tahmasbi and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed a multi-objective immune system to address a bi-objective flow shop scheduling problem with SDST. Zheng and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> developed a Pareto-based estimation of distribution algorithm to solve a production scheduling problem. Rifai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed a novel multi-objective adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm to address a distributed permutation flow shop scheduling problem. A recent review on the multiobjective permutation flow shop scheduling problem is provided by Yenisey and Yagmahan <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> . Based on the merits of Paretobased methods, they not only obtain non-dominated solutions in a single run but also reveal a tradeoff relation between several criteria. Therefore, we adopt a Pareto-based MOEA to address this considered problem.</p><p>Recently, many metaheuristics have been developed such as virus colony search <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> , whale optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> , ant lion optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> , grey wolf optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and backtracking search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> . Among them, grey wolf optimizer (GWO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is a new swarm intelligence algorithm inspired from mimicking the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves. GWO is proven to be superior or competitive to other classical metaheuristics such as differential evolutionary, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm. GWO has been successfully applied to many engineering fields, such as parameter estimation in surface waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> , optimization of controller's gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> , the optimal power flow problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> , hyperspectral image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and designing photonic crystal waveguides <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> . Based on the effectiveness of GWO and the nature of the multiobjective (MOP), a new multi-objective discrete grey wolf optimizer (MODGWO) is proposed to solve this multi-objective WSP. The main reasons for applying MODGWO in WSP are that the problem under study is NP-hard and GWO has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for tackling the flow shop problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> . In addition, GWO is easy to implement due to its a few parameters and simple mechanism. These motivations drive us to design a new multi-objective algorithm based on GWO for this scheduling problem. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no paper has been reported that addresses a real-world WSP using MODGWO. Although a multi-objective GWO (MOGWO) has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> , MOGWO is designed to deal with continuous MOPs rather than combinatorial optimization MOPs. In this paper, we have accomplished at least three things in order to narrow the gap between theoretical research and practical application. First, a new multiobjective mathematical model for this WSP is formulated. Second, an efficient MODGWO is developed to obtain a trade-off curve between the makespan and the penalty of machine load (or machine interference). Third, the proposed MODGWO is used to solve a realworld welding scheduling case, which achieves good results.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The mathematical model for this scheduling problem is formulated in Section 2 . Section 3 describes a new multi-objective optimization approach for this WSP. Sections 4 and 5 present experimental results and a case study, and Section 6 provides the conclusions and future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Problem statement and mathematical modeling</head><p>In this section, we first give a problem statement and then present a detailed multi-objective mathematical model for the WSP which derives from a realistic welding workshop. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Problem statement</head><p>The WSP under this study can be described as follows. A set of n jobs has to be processed through five stages in the same process. Each job has at most one operation at each stage. Preemption and interrupt are not allowed. Multiple welding machines can process the same job at a time, and each welding machine can handle at most one job at a time. Each operation has a normal processing time when only one machine is used to process the corresponding job. The normal operation processing times can be controlled (i.e., compressed) by allocating multiple welding machines at the stages of welding processes, which incurs additional machine load and machine interference. Clearly, this WSP is an extension of PFSP with controllable processing times (CPT), which is more complex than the traditional PFSP.</p><p>In addition, the main characteristics of the welding process can be summarized below.</p><p>• All the jobs go through the same stage or route in the welding workshop: splices of small pieces, splices of large parts, internal seam welding, encapsulation and outside seam welding.</p><p>• One and only one machine can process one job at a time at encapsulation stage. The processing duration of each operation can be controlled (i.e., compressed) by allocating additional welding machines to the operation at the other stages. • Setup times are taken into account in this welding workshop due to some preparation work such as cleaning and preheating, and the setup duration is associated with the similarities between the two adjacent jobs. Thus, setup times are sequence dependent.</p><p>• Release times of all the jobs at each stage are relatively short, and thus can be neglected in this welding shop. • Transportation times between two consecutive stages are also considered. In this welding workshop, transportation times depend not only on the distance between consecutive stages (i.e., stations) but also the job to be transported. Therefore, transportation times are job dependent. In addition, there are enough transporters to carry the job from one stage to another. The loading and unloading times are included in the transportation times. • When the setup times and transportation times are considered simultaneously, the overlapping of the setup times and transportation times is permitted. Thus, one operation cannot start until the setup times of the operation and transportation times of the preceding operations are completed (e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> ).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The proposed MODGWO for WSP</head><p>In this section, we first introduce an original GWO, and then present the proposed MODGWO for WSP in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The original GWO</head><p>GWO is a new metaheuristic inspired by the grey wolf hunting for the prey in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> . The main steps of GWO are provided in this subsection.</p><p>To establish a social hierarchy of wolves when developing GWO, all the grey wolves are classified into four kinds of the wolf according to fitness value. The best wolf (solution) in GWO is denoted as the alpha ( α). Similarly, the second and third best wolves are called beta ( β) and delta ( δ) respectively. The rest of wolves are considered to be omega ( ω). In GWO, the search process is primarily guided by α, β and δ. The ω wolves obey these three wolves.</p><p>Grey wolves tend to encircle the prey when the hunt. To model encircling behavior, the equation is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D = C • -→ X p ( t ) -X ( t ) (13) X ( t + 1 ) = -→ X p ( t ) -A • D (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where t represents the current iteration, -→ X P denotes the position vector of the prey and X denotes the position vector of a grey wolf. The vector A and C are formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">A = 2 a • r 1 -a (15) C = 2 -→ r 2 (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where a is linearly decreased from 2 to 0 during the search process, and it is used to emphasize exploration and exploitation respectively. r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in range [0,1]. The hunt is usually guided by the alpha. The beta and delta might also join in on the hunting. However, the position of prey (optimum) is unknown in an abstract search space. To simulate the hunting behavior of grey wolves, assume that the α, β and δ have better knowledge about the potential location of the prey. Therefore, the first three best solutions found so far are saved and guide the other wolves toward the potential location of the prey. The equation of hunting is formulated as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</p><p>-→</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">D α = -→ C 1 • -→ X α -X , -→ D β = -→ C 2 • -→ X β -X , -→ D γ = -→ C 3 • -→ X δ -X (17) -→ X 1 = -→ X α - -→ A 1 • -→ D α , -→ X 2 = -→ X β - -→ A 2 • -→ D β , -→ X 3 = -→ X δ - -→ A 3 • -→ D δ (18) X ( t + 1 ) = -→ X 1 + -→ X 2 + -→ X 3 3 (19)</formula><p>To sum up, the GWO is beginning with a random population of grey wolves. The search process is mainly guided by the α, β and δ. They diverge from each other to search for prey when | A | &gt; 1 and converge to attack prey when | A | &lt; 1 . Finally the optimal solution (i.e., the prey) is output if the stop criterion is satisfied. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The proposed MODGWO</head><p>As stated previously, we propose a MODGWO to tackle the above WSP. A basic flowchart of MODGWO is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> . The following subsections give a detailed explanation about the improvement steps of MODGWO. These improvement procedures mainly include the following steps: encoding and decoding scheme, initialization, social hierarchy, search for the prey, and reduction machine load strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Encoding and decoding scheme</head><p>The encoding and decoding scheme is an important procedure before applying the proposed MODGWO to a particular problem. It constructs a bridge between solution space of the considered problem and the search space of the search process. Therefore, designing an appropriate encoding and decoding scheme is a very essential issue that affects the performance of the algorithm.</p><p>Unlike other scheduling problems, this welding scheduling problem has to deal with the processing sequence of jobs and the machine assignment of each operation simultaneously. Thus, we propose a new encoding scheme which contains two parts. The first part is the job permutation denoted by notation π . The second part is the machine assignment matrix denoted by symbol N .</p><p>To illustrate this encoding scheme, we give an example with 4 jobs and 5 stages as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">π = [ 2 , 4 , 3 , 1 ] N = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 1 , 1 , 3 , 2 1 , 1 , 2 , 1 2 , 2 , 3 , 1 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 2 , 2 , 3 , 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ In this solution representation, the job sequence is [2-4-3-1].</formula><p>The element N ij in the machine assignment matrix denotes the number of the machine to process the operation of job j at the stage i . To further illustrate this solution representation, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> presents a Gantt chart of the above solution representation. For example, N 13 represents that the number of machines that are assigned to job 3 at stage 1 (i.e., O 13 ) is 3. The O 13 is the red box with two white bars that denotes the additional two machines to process the operation. The color box without white bars represents the operation with normal processing times (e.g., O 12 ), that is, the operation O 12 is processed by only one machine. The makespan is 255.83 and machine load is 32 in this Gantt chart (we assume that the coefficient of penalty for all machine load is equal to 1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Initialization</head><p>Based on the above encoding scheme, each solution (wolf) is constructed by a permutation vector and a machine assignment matrix. To ensure the high quality and good diversity of solutions, one-third of the initial population corresponding to different machine assignment matrixes are created by NEH method <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> . The other initial individuals are randomly generated based on the proposed encoding scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Social hierarchy</head><p>The core idea of the original GWO is that the search process is guided by the best three solutions (wolves). However, due to Pareto dominance nature of the MOP, the optimal result is usually not a single solution but a set of non-dominated solutions also called "trade-off solutions" in MOP. That is, for a trade-off solution, the improvement of one objective can cause the deterioration of at least another objective. Thus, each solution is related to a rank equal to the non-dominated level. The population can be divided into several level ranks according to Pareto dominance relationship. The solutions at the first level rank (non-dominated solution or trade-off solutions) can be denoted as α solutions followed by the second and third level rank as β and δ if the population exists more than three ranks. In this research, the first best three solutions are obtained by the following assumptions.</p><p>1 If the current population is at the non-dominated level or first rank, α, β and δ are randomly selected from the population. 2 If the current population only has two ranks, α and β are randomly obtained from the first and second rank, respectively. δ is randomly selected from solutions at the second rank.</p><p>3 If the current population has more than two ranks, α, β and δ are obtained from the first, second, and third rank, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.">Search for the prey</head><p>The search operator of GWO is originally developed for solving continuous optimization problems. Thus, it cannot be directly adopted to address combinatorial problems. To ensure the feasibility of the obtained solutions, the modified search operator is composed of two parts, which are formulated as follows.</p><p>For the first part, namely, job permutation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">π t+1 i = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ shi f t π t i , A • C • π t α -π t i if rand &lt; 1 3 shi f t π t i , A • C • π t β -π t i else if rand &lt; 2 3 shi f t π t i , A • C • π t δ -π t i otherwise</formula><p>where shift ( x, d ) function means that the element x can be moved to the right or left with | d | units, note that if the shift units are beyond the boundary range, the boundary element is connected to that in the opposite direction, rand is a uniform random value between [0,1], A and C are the control factor. In this paper, A and C are set to 1.0. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> gives an example of the proposed search operator.</p><p>For the second part, namely, machine assignment matrix: where the new machine assignment element N t+1 i, j is generated from two rules. (a) previous good solutions and (b) random selection. In the first rule, the trial element is selected from one of the first best machine assignment matrix elements with the probability of a ( a = 1t/ T max ), t and T max are the current iteration number and the maximum iteration number, respectively. In random selection, N t+1 i, j can be any feasible value not limited to the first rule with the probability of ( 1a ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">N t+1 i, j = N t i, j ∈ N ( α) t i, j or N ( β ) t i, j or N ( δ) t i, j if rand ≤ a N t i, j ∈ N t otherwise</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5.">Reduction machine load procedure</head><p>Local search approaches are usually embedded into the single and multi-objective metaheuristics for improving the quality of solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> . However, local search in a MOP is different from that in a single-objective problem. As a matter of fact, the improvement in one objective may lead to the deterioration in another objective in the MOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> . In this paper, therefore, any local search strategies are not applied in the proposed algorithm. Instead, one improvement procedure is designed to further enhance the quality of solutions. This procedure does not need to change the job sequence, but can reduce the total penalty value of machine load to some extent. The following algorithm states the reduction of machine load procedure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.</p><p>To explain this strategy 1 in the last stage, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows a procedure of strategy 1. As can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> , the schedule of the case (a) has a large enough idle time between the job 1 and job 2 at the last stage, while there is a smaller idle time in schedule of the case (b) by means of controlling processing times of job 1. That is, the processing time of the job 1 on the last stage can be expanded by decreasing the corresponding machine number, which leads to a reduction in machine load. On the other hand, the makespan maintains the same for different solutions, and thereby the old solution is dominated.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> illustrates the strategy 2. The schedule of the case (a) has a large enough idle time between two consecutive stages for the last job, while there is a smaller idle time in schedule of the case (b). The processing time of the last job on the former stage is expanded by decreasing machine number, which causes a reduction in machine load. On the other hand, the makespan maintains the same for two solutions, and thereby the old solution is dominated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.6.">Replacement scheme</head><p>This phase of the MODGWO is different from that of the original GWO when solving MOPs, the newly generated solutions are evaluated in terms of both fitness values considered (i.e., makespan and total penalty of machine load). In particular, all the solutions in the population are sorted according to the non-dominated sorting technique which favors simultaneously the population diversity and the convergence toward Pareto optimal solutions. Thus, each solution is associated with a rank equal to its non-dominance level. Then, within each front a crowding distance strategy is used to define an ordering among individuals. The crowding distance is an indicator of the density of the solutions surrounding a current solution and can be obtained by calculating the sum of the distances to the closest individual along each objective. To achieve wide-spread Pareto fronts (solutions differently balancing makespan and total penalty of machine load), individuals with a large crowding distance are superior to ones with a smaller crowding distance for solutions that belong to the same non-dominated level. The new generated population Q t is combined with existing parent population P t to form Q t ∪ P t solution vectors. Then non-dominated sorting strategy and crowding distance technique are performed on the combined population Q t ∪ P t . Finally, the best population with size N ( N is population size) is selected from the combined population based on ranking and crowding distance for the next generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Numerical experiment</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the proposed MODGWO, we compare it with two famous MOEAs: NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and SPEA2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . To make a fair comparison between these MOEAs. The same encoding scheme and reduction machine load strategy are used as MODGWO. Furthermore, in NSGA-II and SPEA2, the same operators are employed: binary tournament selection, partially mapping crossover (PMX) for the first part of solution representation and insert operation for the second part, swap operation for two parts in mutation. The details about these operators can be referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> . All algorithms are coded in Java. The experimental tests are implemented on a computer with Intel Core i5, 2.39 GHz, 4GB RAM, with Windows 8 operating system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Performance metrics</head><p>Three performance metrics are used to test the behavior of the MOEAs and are given as follows.</p><p>(1) Spread ( ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> . This metric is a diversity indicator that measures the extent of spread achieved in the front. The metric is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">= m j=1 d e j + n i =1 d i -d m j=1 d e j + n • d (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where d i denotes the Euclidean distance of each point in Pareto front (PF) to its closest point in the optimal Pareto front (PF * ), d is the average value of all d i , d e j is the Euclidean distance between the extreme solutions in the j -th objective and the boundary solutions of the obtained PF, n is the number of PF, and m is the number of objectives. If the spread value is zero, it means all the members of Pareto optimal front are evenly spaced. Lower values indicates better distribution and diversity.</p><p>(2) Generational Distance (GD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> . The GD metric indicates how far the obtained PF is from PF * . This metric is formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">GD = n i =1 d 2 i n (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where n is the number of Pareto front points found so far and d i is the Euclidean distance between the i -th member of PF obtained and the nearest member of PF * . A low GD value is desirable and denotes a good convergence performance. A normalization method is adopted in this metric. (3) Inverse Generational Distance (IGD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> . This is a variant of the GD but represents a combined or comprehensive indicator. It measures the distances between each solution consisting of the optimal Pareto front and obtained front. IGD can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">IGD = n i =1 d 2 i n (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where n is the number of the optimal Pareto front and d i is the Euclidean distance between each point of that front and the nearest member of the approximation. Fronts with a lower IGD value are desirable. This metric uses a normalization method. Note that the true PF * of the considered problem may be unknown, thus, the non-dominated solutions found using different MOEAs for each instance in all the independent runs are regarded as PF * (reference points) on that instance.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Test instances</head><p>To assess the performance of different MOEAs, test data for different configurations with regard to problem scale should be provided. The instances we randomly generate are defined as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> . Each instance can be labeled in the form of "n_s ". For example, "10_5" represents that the problem is featured by 10 jobs and 5 stages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Parameter settings</head><p>It is well known that that the parameter settings can affect the behavior of the algorithm. Thus, pilot experiments were conducted to assess different parameter configurations. Most parameters are constant in experiments. However, some parameters are sensitive to the problem scale. For example, a population with 100 size may be large for one 10-job instance, but may be small for one 100-job instance. Therefore, population size depends dynamically on the problem scale. To make a fair comparison, all MOEAs use the same maximum number of function evaluations (NFEs). More preciously, the parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> . Each experiment was conducted 30 independent times on each test problem for each algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Comparison MODGWO with other MOEAs</head><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, MOD-GWO is compared with other MOEAs including NSGA-II and SPEA2. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the obtained statistical results, where mean represents the average value, std denotes the standard deviation. The bottom rows of this table list the ratio of dominant performance for the corresponding metric. For example, 3/21 indicates that the corresponding algorithm outperforms its rivals on 3 out of 21 problems for a given metric. The optimal results are highlighted with bold in the Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> presents the statistical results of GD, Spread, and IGD. From this table, we can observe that the proposed MODGWO outperforms its counterparts for most instances. Especially on the comprehensive metric IGD and convergence metric GD, the advantage of the MODGWO is overwhelming except for several problems. MODGWO is also better than NSGA-II and SPEA2 with regard to Spread metric. The good performance of the proposed MODGWO can be attributed to the social hierarchy scheme. The adoption of the social hierarchy scheme can improve the quality of population since the search process is guided by three good solutions. Meanwhile, to maintain diversity of population, three good solutions may be selected from different non-dominated levels, which can improve search diversity. Thus, MODGWO can effectively maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation. By contrast, NSGA-II and SPEA2 do not contain this hierarchy scheme. Additionally, we can know from crossover operation that such defined crossover operator is possible to destroy a good operation sequence for NSGA-II and SPEA2.</p><p>Due to the stochastic characteristic of all MOEAs, the statistical test should be conducted. A wilcoxon signed rank test <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> is used to detect the significant difference between the results obtained by different MOEAs. The confidence level for all tests is set to 95% (corresponding to a α= 0.05). The signs "+ " or "-" indicate that the proposed MODGWO algorithm performs significantly better or worse than its compared one. The sign "= " denotes that there is no significant difference between MODGWO and its compared one. R + is the sum of ranks for the problems in which the MODGWO outperformed the compared one, and R -is the sum of ranks for the opposite. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> reports the test results based on the best metrics for each instance with 30 independent runs. The p -values of the wilcoxon signed rank test are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> . It can be observed from Table <ref type="table">4</ref> that MODGWO has clearly higher "+ " counts than other competitors. This implies that the MODGWO shows the statistically better performance than the two compared MOEAs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> summarizes the test results based on mean values for all metrics on 20 instances. The p -values of the wilcoxon signed rank test are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> . It means that MODGWO exhibits a significant improvement over NSGA-II and SPEA2 in terms of GD and IGD with α= 0.05.</p><p>To visualize the performance of these MOEAs, the obtained non-dominated solutions from the one run with the best IGD of each MOEA are selected to give graphical representation for the randomly selected small, medium and large scale instances in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> . These figures confirm some conclusions derived from the numerical analysis based on the performance criteria. As can be observed, the proposed MODGWO is capable of providing better solutions in comparison with NSGA-II and SPEA2 with regard to both quality and distribution.</p><p>Based on the above results and presentations. The results in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> show the MODGWO is able to achieve the best results on most instances in terms of all metrics. The p -value in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> denotes that the MODGWO outperforms significantly other MOEAs on most instances with regard to three met- rics, especially for IGD and GD metrics. The MODGWO is a little worse than the other two MOEAs on "40-3", "60-3", "80-3" and "100-3" in terms of Spread metric. The season for poor performance of MODGWO on these instances may be due to the hierarchy scheme. Although this hierarchy can improve the quality of solutions, it may contribute more to exploitation than exploration. Thus, the search agents take much time to search for the much more promising solution in neighborhood of the known good solution. However, it also lead to deterioration of exploration since this hierarchy also loses a larger chance to explore unknown areas of the search space. Consequently, it shows a poor performance on search diversity on these problems. Since the MODGWO exhibits significantly better performance compared with the other MOEAs on most instances, it seems that this behavior is not a major concern. It also reflects that hierarchy scheme has contributed most in searching for better results on this type of problem. It is concluded that MODGWO is much superior to NSGA-II and SPEA2 on the WSP. The major reasons for the superiority performance of the MOD-GWO can be explained as follows. First, the adoption of the social hierarchy scheme can improve the quality of population because the search process in the MODGWO is guided by three good solutions, and thus the MODGWO can quickly converge to the optimal (or near-optimal) solutions. This viewpoint has been supported by the above numerical experiment with regard to GD metric. Second, to maintain diversity of population, three good solutions may be selected from different non-dominated levels, which can improve search diversity. For Spread metric, MODGWO is also superior or competitive to the other MOEAs. Third, to further enhance comprehensive performance, the reduction machine load strategy is developed to improve solution quality. The effectiveness of this strategy has been verified in the following section. Therefore, the proposed MODGWO has a positive effect on solving WSP.</p><p>In the summary, the results in the above experiment verify that the MODGWO is much powerful than other well-known MOEAs on most instances. In addition, the statistical significant experiment between algorithms was conducted by the wilcoxon signed rank test. The superiority of the MODGWO is statistically significant on most instances. Therefore, it can be concluded that the MODGWO is very effective in solving this type of WSP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Performance analysis of reduction machine load procedure</head><p>As stated in Section 3.2.5 , the MODGWO has one main improvement strategy, namely, reduction machine load procedure. To evaluate the efficiency of the reduction machine load procedure, we test the MODGWO without reduction machine load procedure on a set of instances. In this experiment, MODGWO no denotes that MODGWO has no reduction machine load procedure. MODGWO itself includes reduction machine load procedure. The other parameter settings of both MOEAs are the same for a fair comparison. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> reports the statistical metrics on two strategies over 30 independent runs.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table">6</ref> , it can be observed that the MODGWO with reduction machine load procedure has a significantly better performance in comparison with the one without this procedure on most instances. This implies that the reduction machine load procedure can improve the behavior of the proposed MODGWO.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">7</ref> reports the test results based on the best metrics for each instance with 30 independent runs. It can be observed from Table <ref type="table">7</ref> that MODGWO has obviously higher "+ " counts than the other competitors. This implies that the MODGWO shows the statistically performance than MODGWO no . Table <ref type="table">8</ref> summarizes the test results based on mean values for all metrics on 20 instances. It is clearly shown in this table that MODGWO exhibits a significant improvement over MODGWO no in terms of IGD with α= 0.05. In other words, the reduction machine load procedure is not sensitive to distribution or convergence performance of MODGWO for solving this type of scheduling problem. However, this procedure can assist to improve the overall performance of production systems, and consequently it contributes more to the comprehensive performance of MODGWO. The reason lies in the procedure of the problem property. The controllability of machine number may provide additional flexibility in searching for a promising solution which can improve the overall performance of the production system. In this case, a little improvement in machine load criterion will make it dominate many other solutions. Thus, MODGWO can benefit from the machine load strategy that aims at reducing machine load by adjusting machine number. By contrast, MODGWO no doesn't include any heuristic rule developed to reduce machine load. Therefore, the reduction machine load procedure has a positive impact on MODGWO for solving the welding scheduling instances.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>In this paper, a real-world welding scheduling problem is studied from the theory and practical application perspectives. First, we proposed a bi-objective mathematical model which involves sequence dependent setup time, job dependent transportation times and controllable processing times. Then, we developed a new multi-objective grey wolf optimizer for solving this problem with the objective to minimize makespan and the total penalty of machine load simultaneously. Furthermore, we compared the proposed MODGWO with well-known MOEAs: NSGA-II and SPEA2. The effectiveness of this MODGWO is supported by experiments on some instances in terms of convergence, spread and coverage metrics. In addition, the superiority of the MODGWO is significant by conducting the wilcoxon signed rank test. Finally, the MODGWO is successfully applied to a real-world case, and the result has a considerable instructive value in real-world production. In conclusion, the main contributions of this work are as follows:</p><p>(1) A new scheduling model for welding process is formulated, which is easily extended to other types of scheduling problems.
