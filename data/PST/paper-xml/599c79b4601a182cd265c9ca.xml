<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper proposes and validates in the field an approach for position tracking that is based on LTE downlink signals measurements. A setup for real data live gathering is used for collecting LTE signals during a car drive in the town of Rapperswil, Switzerland. The collected data is then processed in order to extract the received LTE cell specific reference signals, which are exploited for estimating pseudoranges. More precisely, the pseudoranges are evaluated by using the "ESPRIT and Kalman filter for time of Arrival Tracking" (EKAT) algorithm, and by taking advantage of signal combining in the time, frequency, spatial and cell ID domains. Finally, the pseudoranges are corrected for base station's clock bias and drift, previously estimated, and used in a positioning filter. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of a position tracking system based on the reception of LTE downlink signals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>downlink signals has become a subject of recent research interest.</p><p>The LTE standard itself offers positioning capabilities, providing the positioning reference signal (PRS) and networkcentered procedures for localizing the user equipment by exploiting PRS time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Several works, based on computer simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> or experimental evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, have been published on the subject of TDOA based positioning systems that exploit LTE signals (either the PRS or other downlink signals) in harsh propagation environments. Recently, a few works recognized that newly deployed LTE commercial networks are not mature yet for TDOA based positioning, mainly because of a lack of PRS transmission and because of non-synchronized BSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The advancements in LTE positioning services are consequently limited by network operators' deployments. Fortunately, as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, other LTE downlink signals exist which may be exploited opportunistically for positioning measurements, with no constraints on the BSs' clocks synchronization. This enables LTE-based localization with limited operators' efforts in terms of additional infrastructure. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no works in the literature that demonstrate an experimental real-world validation of such a concept.</p><p>Against this background, this paper proposes and validates in the field an approach for positioning by means of LTE downlink signals' time of arrival (TOA) measurements. The proposed system is mobile-centered, it uses the signals transmitted by the currently deployed commercial LTE networks, and it relies on two assumptions. Firstly, the BS positions have to be known to the receiver. Secondly, each BS has to make its clock properties available to the positioning engine (PE) which performs the location estimation, enabling a reasonably approximate knowledge of each BS's clock offset and drift in respect to a reference time. The PE might be internal within the network, or located on the mobile receiver, and the clock properties of the BSs may be collected by appropriate location measurement units (LMUs). In the presented experiments, the BS positions were acquired from a public database, and the BSs' clock properties were estimated in a preliminary phase.</p><p>With respect to the state of art, the presented work demonstrates the feasibility of positioning by exploiting real LTE signals collected in the field from a commercial network and processed by means of a super-resolution algorithm (SRA) based ranging technique. The experimental system adopts the EKAT ranging framework described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which is able to effectively mitigate detrimental effects of multipath on LTEbased range estimations, and the positioning algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. By using the software defined radio (SDR) measurement setup of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the positioning system has been validated using the real LTE signals taken in a real environment from the commercial LTE network of the town of Rapperswil, Switzerland. Building on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where the transmitting LTE antenna ports were exploited for improving the measurement of the TOA, this work adds several contributions, particularly regarding the time-frequency combining of the LTE signals, the selection of range measurements from multiple cells pertaining to the same BS, and consideration on the effect of all these improvements on the estimation of the position. As a result, the pseudorange estimation performance is improved exploiting the combination of the signals in the time, frequency, spatial and cell ID domains.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II explains the LTE downlink signals exploited for ranging. Sec. III describes the measurement setup. Sec. IV-V illustrate the employed TOA estimation algorithm and the combination method used for exploiting measurements from multiple BS cells. Sec. VI describes the BSs' clock properties estimation process and how the TOA-based pseudoranges are corrected in order to obtain actual ranges. Sec. VII illustrates the adopted positioning algorithm. Finally, Sec. VIII comments the obtained ranging and positioning results, followed by some final considerations, in Sec. IX.</p><p>Notation: Matrices and vectors are denoted as upper case and lower case bold letters, respectively, e.g. A ∈ C M ×N and a ∈ C M . â, â and Â denote the estimates of a, a and A, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. LTE SIGNALS USED FOR RANGING</head><p>In this section, the characteristics of the exploited LTE downlink signals are briefly described. Moreover, details on the particular LTE parameters found during the measurements in Rapperswil are given. This does not limit the generality of the obtained results. More complete information about the LTE physical layer can be found in the specifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The downlink physical layer of the LTE standard for the frequency domain duplexing (FDD) scheme is organized in 10 ms long radio frames, each made of 10 sub-frames, which contain 2 slots (20 slots per radio frame, 0.5 ms per slot). Each slot contains N DL symb orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, each carrying N sc = N DL RB N RB sc sub-carriers. The parameter N DL RB , that ultimately determines the number N sc of sub-carriers per each OFDM symbol, is related to the cell channel bandwidth B. The same LTE BS can transmit on multiple cells, usually spatially multiplexed by means of directional antennas. In the following, LTE cells will be identified Ts/2048 l = 0 CP length T CP,0 160•T s,0 l &gt; 0 CP length T CP,l 144•T s,0 either by their cell ID N cell ID or, for notational simplicity, by an index i ∈ N. On each cell, the BS may transmit using multiple antennas, referred to as antenna ports, and identified by the index p. Finally, it is worth mentioning that LTE is designed to operate with a frequency reuse factor of one, meaning that neighbour cells can transmit on the same channel, enabling simultaneous non-orthogonal reception of multiple cells.</p><p>At the time of measurements 1 , the LTE network of Rapperswil was found to be set to FDD, to use a normal OFDM cyclic prefix (CP) and a two antenna port configuration, meaning that each BS was set up to transmit from two antennas, identified by p = {0, 1}. Table I summarizes all the other useful LTE parameters found during the measurements, in which 2 LTE operators were detected.</p><p>Each LTE signal can be defined using a time-frequency grid for each antenna port p, where each element of the grid S p l [k], referred to as a resource element (RE), corresponds to a particular sub-carrier k in the OFDM symbol l of a slot. The actual baseband analog signal is obtained with a classical OFDM modulation with empty DC sub-carrier, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s p l (t) = k=-1 k=-Nsc/2 S p l [k+N sc /2] e j2πk∆f t +<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">+ k=Nsc/2-1 k=0 S p l [k+N sc /2] e j2π(k+1)∆f t , t ∈ [-T CP,l , T s ],</formula><p>where T CP,l is the duration of the l th symbol CP, T s = 1/∆f is the duration of the actual OFDM symbol, l = 0, . . . , N DL symb -1, and t denotes here the continuous time variable. Usually, for reducing the implementation complexity, (1) is generated as a digital-to-analog conversion of a CP extended version of</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s p l [n] = IDFT{S p l [k]} 2</formula><p>, with an IDFT operator of length N fft . For the range measurements described in this work, the cell-specific reference signal (CRS) was exploited. This is a downlink reference signal intended for channel estimation for coherent data demodulation, and is particularly indicated for</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p = 0, N cell ID,1 p = 1, N cell ID,1 p = 0, N cell ID,2 p = 1, N cell ID,2 k 6 = 0 k 6 = 0 k 6 = 1 k 6 = 1 k 6 = 2 k 6 = 2 k 6 = 3 k 6 = 3 k 6 = 4 k 6 = 4 k 6 = 5 k 6 = 5 l = 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 ∆f ∆f CRS</formula><p>even slot -0.5ms odd slot -0.5ms our purposes since it fully occupies the available bandwidth, and, differently to the PRS, is mandatory to be transmitted. The CRS consists of a QPSK modulated Gold sequence mapped to the REs as shown in the grid of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where only 2 slots and N RB sc = 12 sub-carriers are represented. The complete frequency domain (FD) mapping of the CRS can be obtained repeating the grid N DL RB times vertically. A BS transmits a particular CRS for each cell it owns and each antenna port of the cell, with a mapping to REs that depends on both N cell ID and p. When using 2 antenna ports, a CRS transmission occurs twice per slot, in OFDM symbols l = 0 and l = 4: for each l ∈ {0, 4}, a different CRS is transmitted from each antenna port in the same OFDM symbol in non-overlapping sub-carriers, as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts. Since the CRS pilot tones occupy one sub-carrier every six through all the available bandwidth (with a spacing of ∆f CRS = 6∆f ), the total number of transmitted pilot tones is N tot = N sc /6 per antenna port per OFDM symbol. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, CRSs pertaining to different cell IDs differ for a FD shift, enabling orthogonal CRS transmission from the cells controlled by the same BS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MEASUREMENTS IN REAL CONDITIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Measurement setup</head><p>The proposed approach has been tested with a live data set of commercial LTE signals recorded in Rapperswil, Switzerland. The setup used to gather the live data is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and consists of two universal software radio peripheral (USRP) N210 software defined radios (SDRs), driven by a high precision 10 MHz reference clock from a GPS-locked Rubidium frequency standard. One USRP was used for each operator to cover the different downlink carrier frequencies f C . A conventional personal computer was used as a system controller and for data storage. The recorded data was GPS time stamped and therefore coherent known sampling of the two USRPs was guaranteed, allowing the LTE signals of the two different operators to be used in combination. Sampling at a rate of 25 MSPS generates 100 MB of data per second and per operator. To reduce this amount only 10 ms chunks of contiguous data were stored every second. The data recording equipment was installed on a trolley and energy was supplied by a battery-powered DC to AC converter, allowing field usage. The LTE signal data was gathered in the area of Rapperswil SG, Switzerland with the equipment installed in a van. The route was chosen such as to include urban, sub-urban, and open-field areas, as the GPS track in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> suggests. This routing allows the performance of the proposed system to be analyzed in different propagation environments. The time needed for driving the route shown was about 20 minutes at speeds up to 50 km/h. When available, the GPS fix corresponding to the reception position of each recorded chunk was saved, to be used as a ground truth. The complete GPS track has been visually inspected and superimposed on a map, and the correspondence between the GPS estimations and the actual path travelled by the van has been verified. Except for a few rare cases, the GPS track was always within the width of the actual street lane on which the receiver was located, indicating a tolerance for the GPS track of a maximum of roughly 4 m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Cell search and coarse synchronization</head><p>The first task in analysing the recoded data is to find and extract the LTE signals that have been received. The recorded dataset was searched for signals from available BSs by means of an exhaustive search against a list of cell identities of all BSs in the area. Since the BS locations were assumed to be known the location information provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM) was used <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. After discovering all available base stations including their frame and symbol timing, the 10 ms chunks which contain the signal of a certain BS were marked per BS. From every chunk of raw data, for every BS received in that chunk and every cell pertaining to each BS, a particular slot in the frame was selected, on the basis of the received SNR. Then, the two OFDM symbols containing the CRS in the selected slot were saved for further processing, together with the UTC timestamp t (U) of the chunk reception, and the offset ∆t i s introduced in respect to t (U) for synchronizing on the symbol timing of cell i.</p><p>The recorded data set contained signals from a total of 9 BSs, with 6 BSs from operator 1 and 3 BSs from operator 2. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the locations of the BSs used, except for a distant BS across the lake in south-southeasterly direction (BS 3 operator 2) and another BS situated on a hill to the north (BS 4 operator 1, not considered for positioning). All BSs have been found to be using a 2 antenna port configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ESTIMATING TOA-BASED PSEUDORANGES</head><p>The time of arrival of the LTE signals can now be estimated, ready for use for position estimation as described in the later Sec. VII. As explained in Sec. II, the time of arrival (TOA) of the LTE cell-specific reference signal (CRS) is used to measure a pseudorange from each received BS. These measurements are affected by the multipath experienced by the signal as a result of the propagation channel.</p><p>In a short observation window, the multipath channel encountered by a signal propagating from a BS to a mobile receiver may be modeled with the following channel impulse response (CIR) and channel frequency response (CFR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h(τ ) = L-1 l=0 h l δ(τ -τ l ) F {•} ⇒ H(f ) = L-1 l=0 h l e -j2πf τ l . (2)</formula><p>In (2), δ(•) denotes the Dirac delta function, h l ∈ C is the complex channel gain associated to the l th path, and τ l is the corresponding delay, with τ 0 &lt; • • • &lt; τ L-1 . Thanks to the OFDM modulation that underlies their physical layer, LTE downlink signals offer a very convenient way of estimating the CFR by exploiting the CRS pilot tones. This CFR estimation constitutes a convenient basis for the direct path (DP) TOA estimation, and is evaluated with the following procedure.</p><p>Let r i t,l [n], n = 0, . . . , N fft -1, be the result of the analog-todigital conversion of the l th OFDM symbol (after CP removal) received in the slot measured at time t from cell i. The index l can assume here the values l = 0 or l = 4, as just the two OFDM symbols of a slot carrying the CRS have been extracted from the signal data. The content of the sub-carriers in the received signal can be easily accessed with conventional OFDM demodulation techniques, as R i t,l [k] = DFT{r i t,l [n]}. Then, a simple least squares (LS) CFR estimation for each transmit antenna port is possible thanks to the knowledge of the corresponding CRS pilot tones S p l [k], e.g., as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. Hence, for each antenna port p = {0, 1} and OFDM symbol l = {0, 4}, the CFR LS estimation Ĥi,p t,l [k], k = 0, . . . , N tot -1, can be calculated, where each sample in Ĥi,p t,l [k] is displaced of 6∆f , as a consequence of the CRS pilots frequency domain spacing. This procedure leads to a total of four CFR LS estimates for every measurement index t, one per antenna port p = {0, 1} for each OFDM symbol l = {0, 4} carrying CRS. These CFR estimations are used in the presented framework for estimating the DP TOA τ 0 .</p><p>The use of the CFR for the TOA estimation is particularly useful because it permits a convenient integration of the proposed positioning approach into LTE communication modules, since the CFR estimation is commonly alredy performed by LTE receivers for coherently demodulating the user data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Time-frequency combination of multiple CFR estimates</head><p>The sets of CFR LS estimates obtained using the CRS pilot tones can now be combined with the aim of improving the TOA estimation performance. According to the mapping</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">⇒ Ĥi,0 t [k] p = 0 Ĥi,1 t [k] p = 1 p = 0, l = 0 p = 1, l = 0 p = 0, l = 4 p = 1, l = 4 k 6 = 0 k 6 = 0 k 6 = 1 k 6 = 1 k 6 = 2 k 6 = 2 k 6 = 3 k 6 = 3 k 6 = 4 k 6 = 4 k 6 = 5 k 6 = 5 l = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6</formula><p>∆f mCRS a slot -0.5ms depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the sub-carriers of the two CRSs of a slot are characterized by a relative FD shift of 3∆f . Thanks to the fairly low speeds involved in the considered test case, which determined a sufficient time correlation of the channel's phase and magnitude, this aspect of the CRS design may be exploited by merging the two estimates Ĥi,p t,0 [k] and Ĥi,p t,4 [k], as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. This time-frequency combination permits to obtain the length 2N tot CFR estimate Ĥi,p t [k], which is characterized by a frequency separation of ∆f mCRS = 3∆f between samples. Depending on the TOA estimation algorithm adopted, the increased number of samples for each CFR estimate Ĥi,p t [k] and the smaller frequency separation ∆f mCRS &lt; ∆f CRS may correspond to increased resolution and increased maximum TOA computable, respectively.</p><p>Five algorithms have been used in the presented work to estimate the DP TOA out of the channel estimates Ĥi,p t [k], each characterized by different timing error performance and complexity. In particular, four CIR-based TOA estimators are presented in Sec. IV-B, while a more complex but robust TOA estimator is described Sec. IV-C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. CIR-based TOA estimation algorithms</head><p>The starting point for practical TOA estimators is to use the CFR estimation Ĥi,p t [k], k = 0, . . . , 2N tot -1, to compute the corresponding discrete CIR as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ĥi,p t [n] = IDFT{ Ĥi,p t [k]}, n = 0, . . . , 2N tot -1.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This CIR spans the time interval -1 2∆fmCRS , 1 2∆fmCRS = -11.11 µs, 11.11 µs , and can be exploited for realizing practical TOA estimation algorithms.</p><p>The simplest approach may be the one of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, where the TOA is obtained with a parabolic interpolation around the maximum of | ĥi,p t [n]|. Throughout the paper, this method is referred to as IDFT-MAX (IM). Although attractive for its computational simplicity, the IM method is not robust against multipath, because harsh propagation environments are typically characterized by a DP which is not necessarily the strongest path. A simple countermeasure may consist in the adoption of a non line of sight (NLOS) rejection mechanism, such as that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This consists in the evaluation of the N IL highest CIR peaks, where N IL is a parameter subject to empirical tuning. Then, the measure is considered as a line of sight (LOS) case only if the maximum of the CIR is the earliest peak between the N IL , in which case it is passed on for use in the positioning engine (PE). Conversely, if one of the N IL peaks appear before the CIR maximum, the measurement is labelled as a NLOS case, and is discarded and not used in the PE. This method is referred to as IDFT-LOS (IL). It is quite robust in identifying NLOS measurements, but it has the drawback of discarding NLOS cases without producing TOA estimates, resulting in a smaller number of available pseudoranges, and ultimately in a reduced accuracy and a reduced positioning yield. As an example, in the case of 3 BSs visible, two in LOS and one in NLOS conditions, IL will pass to the PE only two pseudoranges, resulting in a reduced positioning accuracy. IM and IL have been considered since they are estimators that can be realized on an LTE communication module with limited additional processing cost, since the CIR computation is usually performed already for communications purposes.</p><p>Two other practical TOA estimators have been considered, which are based on the assumption that the estimated CIR is made up of the sum combination of a signal component and of a complex Gaussian noise component. As a consequence, the samples of the power delay profile (PDP) pi,p</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">t [n] = | ĥi,p t [n]</formula><p>| 2 can be considered as random variables having a χ 2 distribution. Based on this assumption, the TEMOS-E estimator of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> and the TNR-based estimator of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> have been used in the presented experiments. The "TOA estimation based on model order selection" (TEMOS) algorithms use the theory of model order selection to find the most likely partitioning of the samples of pi,p t [n] into samples comprising just noise and samples containing signal and noise. TEMOS then assumes the DP TOA estimate to be the first sample in the signal plus noise sub-set <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. Throughout the paper, this method is referred to as TE. Differently, the TNR-based estimator sets a threshold according to an estimated noise variance and to a threshold-to-noise ratio (TNR) that determines a target early probability detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. This method is referred to as TN. For exploiting the multiple signals available thanks to the transmission of multiple antenna ports, the combined PDP pi t</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">[n] = 1 2 (p i,0 t [n] + pi,1 t [n]</formula><p>) has been considered as the input of the TE and TN estimators. Moreover, the TE and TN estimators are originally intended for ultra-wide bandwidth signals, hence proper windowing is required on the PDP for reducing the biasing effect of side-lobes. Compared to the previous IM and IL estimators, these χ 2 statistic based estimators can deal with NLOS conditions.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, an example of the results given by the CIR-based TOA estimators described above is given, using the signals received from the two antenna ports of cell N cell ID = 51, BS 1, operator 2 at t = 2561. The two upper plots show the CIRs corresponding to the two antenna ports, and the corresponding IM and IL TOA estimates. The ESPRIT multipath TOA estimates are also shown as a more accurate reference, computed as described later in Sec. IV-C1. As one can note, the CIRs pertaining to different antenna ports exhibit different multipath, but similar DP TOA. The IM estimations fails to locate what appears to be the DP (i.e., the path at offset around 500 m), while the IL estimator correctly recognizes the measurement as a NLOS case, and discards it. The bottom plot also shows the PDP pi t [n] together with the TE and TN TOA estimates. This illustrates how TE and TN produce a TOA estimate which is on a rising edge of the PDP, instead of on a PDP peak, hence a proper constant offset correction ∆t o is needed, which depends on the adopted windowing technique. Moreover, the widening effect of windowing on the lobes of the PDP is visible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The EKAT algorithm</head><p>Besides the DP TOA estimation algorithms directly based on the CIR considered in Sec. IV-B, an estimator which is more robust against multipath is considered, at the cost of an increase in the complexity. More particularly, the "ESPRIT and Kalman filter for time of Arrival Tracking" (EKAT) ranging algorithm is employed. This algorithm has been developed mainly for assessing the feasibility of ranging with realistic LTE signals, for studying the influence of multipath on the achieved ranging performance, and for obtaining a reference best case performance for future developments of multipathrobust practical TOA estimators, suitable for real-time implementation. The algorithm was partially described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and its working principles will be reported here with more details.  Briefly, the EKAT algorithm consists of the following steps. Firstly, the multipath is separated by means of a superresolution algorithm (SRA), as described in Sec. IV-C1, and the uncertainties corresponding to the estimated multipath TOA are evaluated thanks to a bound-based approach, reported in Sec. IV-C2. Then, the direct path is selected from the estimated set of multipath TOA with the heuristic approach of Sec. IV-C3, and passed, together with the corresponding uncertainty, to a conventional Kalman filter (KF). Finally, the KF tracks the direct path by exploiting the received measurements and the model discussed in Sec. IV-C4. The flow graph of the EKAT algorithm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, with the numbered blocks described in the following sections.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R i t,0 [k], R i t,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">P(t 0 ) ζ(t 0 ) Li,0 (t) Li,1 (t) Υ i,0 (t) Υ i,1 (t) ẑE (t) ζ(t) P(t) P(t -1) ζ(t -1) ζ0 (t -1) R(t)</formula><p>1) TOA estimation with super-resolution algorithms: SRAs are a well known approach for multipath TOA estimation, e.g., documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> and the references therein, which exploits the fact that a multipath channel frequency response is modeled as an harmonic model, i.e., as a sum of complex sinusoids. The EKAT algorithm exploits the minimum description length (MDL) criterion for the estimation of the number of received multipath components L, and the ESPRIT SRA for the estimation of the multipath delays τ l , ∀l. In the presented experiments, this estimation is performed for each detected cell i, measurement instant t, and antenna port p, by exploiting each CFR estimate Ĥi,p t [k], k = 0, . . . , 2N tot -1, computed as in Sec. IV-A, as follows.</p><p>The samples of Ĥi,p t [k] are arranged in length M snapshots x i,p t [k], which are used to build the so-called data matrix X i,p t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">X i,p t = 1 √ N x i,p t [0], • • • , x i,p t [N -1] ∈ C M ×N ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">x i,p t [k] = Ĥi,p t [k], • • • , Ĥi,p t [k + M -1] T ∈ C M ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where N = 2N tot -M+1 is the number of snapshots used and M is a design parameter of the SRA. M is usually chosen as M = m2N tot , with m ∈]0, 1[ being a parameter subject to empirical tuning. A value of m closer to the unity ensures increased resolution in multipath separation, at the cost of decreased averaging of noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. In the presented work, m has been determined with a set of experiments on a preliminary continuous LTE signals dataset, in order to minimize the variance of the estimated multipath TOA.</p><p>A singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> X is computed as X = U•Σ•V H , with the matrices U ∈ C M ×M and V ∈ C N ×N being unitary, and Σ ∈ C M ×N being a diagonal matrix with the singular values σ 1 ≥ • • • ≥ σ M in the main diagonal. This permits to evaluate the parameters (σ m ) 2 , m = 1, . . . , M , which are the eigenvalues of the autocorrelation matrix Rx = X • X H ∈ C M ×M , and are used in the MDL criterion for the estimation of the number L of multipath components in the considered CFR, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. Then, a classical ESPRIT approach is used for the estimation of the multipath delays, based on the following matrix manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">U s = U•[I L0 L×(M -L) ] T ∈ C M × L,<label>(6a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">U s,1 = [I M -1 0 M -1 ]•U s ∈ C M -1× L,<label>(6b)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">U s,2 = [0 M -1 I M -1 ]•U s ∈ C M -1× L,<label>(6c)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">Ψ = U † s,1 •U s,2 ∈ C L× L.<label>(6d)</label></formula><p>Finally, the L eigenvalues ψ 0 , . . . , ψ L-1 of Ψ are computed, and then used to evaluate the multipath TOA as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">τl = - 1 2π∆f mCRS arg {ψ l } , l = 0, • • • , L -1.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>From the fact that arg{ψ l } ∈ [-π, π], ∀l, it follows that ESPRIT is capable of estimating a TOA in the interval -1 2∆fmCRS , 1 2∆fmCRS = -11.11 µs, 11.11 µs around the instant of measure t.</p><p>As a result of the whole procedure described above, a set of Li,p (t) multipath TOA Υ i,p (t) = {τ i,p 0 (t) &lt; • • • &lt; τLi,p (t)-1 } is produced using the CFR estimation Ĥi,p t [k] corresponding to the antenna port p of the i th sector at each measurement time t. It has to be noted that a well known shortcoming of the MDL criterion is that it tends to overestimate L in case of large snapshot lengths M and high SNR values <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. Hence, overestimated values of L may cause ESPRIT to produce TOA outliers, which may be even smaller than the actual DP TOA. EKAT overcomes this weakness using the measurement selection strategy described in Sec. IV-C3.</p><p>An example of the results obtained with the described multipath TOA estimation procedure is depicted in the two plots of Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. There, for each measurement index t, up to the first 4 paths estimated using the CRSs of cell N cell ID = 52 operator 2 are shown for each antenna port. All the values are expressed as actual ranges, obtained applying the offset correction described in Sec. VI, to the pseudorangeas c•(τ i,p l (t) + ∆t i s ), where ∆t i s is the time offset introduced in respect to t for cell i symbol timing. As one can see, the first detected path has almost the same TOA for the two antenna ports, while the other paths are different. 2) Measurement uncertainty evaluation: EKAT evaluates the uncertainty associated with each estimated multipath TOA with the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, where it is demonstrated that the error affecting each ESPRIT outcome is a Gaussian random variable with a variance that can be expressed in closed form <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . More particularly, the ESPRIT error variance is expressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> as a function of the true number of incoming waves, and of the singular vectors and singular values of the exact data matrix X, which is built in the same way as ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">5</ref>), except that the exact data values are used instead of the noisy ones. However, this approach is not feasible for real scenarios, since the exact data and the actual number of incoming multipath components are unknown. Hence, EKAT relies on the use of the noisy data matrix X and of the estimated value L. More particularly, to estimate the variance Var( l ) of the measurement error l = τ l -τ l relative to the l th TOA estimated with the ESPRIT, consider, in addition to the matrices (6a)-(6d), the following matrix decompositions of U and Σ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">U o = U•[0 (M -L)× LI M -L] T ∈ C M ×(M -L) ,<label>(8a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">U o,1 = [I M -1 0 M -1 ]•U o ∈ C (M -1)×(M -L) ,<label>(8b)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">U o,2 = [0 M -1 I M -1 ]•U o ∈ C (M -1)×(M -L) ,<label>(8c)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">Σ = Σ L * * * , Σ L ∈ C L× L.<label>(8d)</label></formula><p>Then, the error variance relative to the l th ESPRIT estimate can be expressed exploiting the results of the study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Var ( l ) = C 2 l σ2 w 2 v l U † s,1 U o,2 -ψ l U o,1 2 Σ -1 L u l 2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where σ2 w is an estimate of the variance of the noise affecting the CFR samples Ĥ[k] and u l , v l , ψ l are respectively the 10 -6 l th left eigenvector, right eigenvector and eigenvalue of Ψ.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">1/σ 2 w [dB] RMSE [s] RMSE(τ l ) Var( ˜ l ) E[Var( l )] l = 0 l = 0 l = 0 l = 1 l = 1 l = 1 l = 2 l = 2 l = 2 l = 3 l = 3 l = 3</formula><p>Following the procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, it can be easily demonstrated that C l = -1/(2π∆f mCRS ), ∀l. In the proposed algorithm, σ2 w is obtained using the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, by exploiting the M -L smaller eigenvalues of Rx , as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">σ2 w = 1 M - L M m= L+1 (σ m ) 2 . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>The error variances Var( l ) are evaluated using <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> for each ESPRIT multipath TOA estimation τ i,p l (t) ∈ Υ i,p (t) obtained from antenna port p, sector i, at time t.</p><p>Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the effectiveness of this approach. The simulations showed a substantial agreement between the values of error variance calculated using the exact data matrix X, denoted with Var( ˜ l ), and the values Var( l ) obtained using the noisy data X, provided that the noise variance σ 2 w determines a signal-to-noise ratio corresponding to an above-threshold estimation. Since Var( l ) is evaluated using a noisy data matrix, its value depends on the particular noise realization, and hence the average value E[Var( l )] has been considered in the simulations. As an example, consider Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, where the values of error variance are calculated for different noise variances σ 2 w in the case of the L = 4 paths channel defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">τ 0 = -1.075 µs, h 0 = 0.4 + j0.5 , (11a) τ 1 = 0.006 µs, h 1 = 1 + j0.39 , (11b) τ 2 = 0.358 µs, h 2 = 0.2 + j0.1 , (11c) τ 3 = 1.369 µs, h 3 = 0.15 .<label>(11d)</label></formula><p>The root mean square estimation error RMSE(τ l ) = (E[(τ lτl ) 2 ]) 1/2 obtained with an ESPRIT estimation of the multipath TOA is also shown, revealing the correctness of the error variance estimation.</p><p>3) Passing DP TOA measurements to the KF: As a third phase of the EKAT algorithm, the direct path has to be selected between the multipath components estimated with ESPRIT. Indeed, for each cell i and measurement time t, ESPRIT produces one set of TOA estimates per antenna port, i.e. Υ i,0 (t) and Υ i,1 (t). Each set of multipath TOA estimates contains Li,p (t) TOA measurements. Hence, a selection mechanism which chooses the DP TOA among the Li,p (t) time measurements in each set Υ i,p (t) has to be implemented. Unfortunately, the selection mechanism cannot be a simple choice of the earliest TOA because of the possible estimated TOA outliers mentioned in Sec. IV-C1. For this reason, the direct path TOA is selected in each set Υ i,p (t) as the earliest TOA estimate that, compared with the previous tracked DP TOA ζ0 (t -1) produced by the EKAT KF, does not determine a receiver speed higher than v <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> max . This measurement selection strategy permits to discard the possible TOA outliers.</p><p>The selected ESPRIT estimations are passed to the EKAT KF by filling the entries of the measurement vector ẑE (t) ∈ R 2 with a DP TOA estimation for each antenna port. The TOA estimations taken from Υ i,p (t), p = {0, 1}, and inserted in ẑE (t) are added to the synchronization delay ∆t i s evaluated in the preprocessing phase for the particular considered cell.</p><p>Finally, the uncertainties of the ESPRIT TOA estimations are also passed to the KF, by filling the diagonal of the noise covariance matrix R(t) ∈ R 2×2 with the values evaluated as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and corresponding to the particular TOA selected from the ESPRIT outcome Υ i,p (t), for each antenna port p = {0, 1}.</p><p>4) DP TOA tracking: The ESPRIT TOA estimation of Sec. IV-C1 is needed for separating the multipath and identifying the DP TOA. The EKAT algorithm takes this DP TOA estimation and tracks it with the aid of a classical KF, according to the procedure described in the following.</p><p>For each detected cell i, EKAT performs the tracking of the DP TOA along the different measurement times t using a state space approach similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. More specifically, a state vector ζ(t) ∈ R 2 and a measurement equation z E (t) ∈ R 2 are defined for each received cell. The two dimensions of ζ(t) represent respectively the DP TOA τ 0 and its rate of change ∆τ 0 , i.e., ζ = [τ 0 ∆τ 0 ] T . Each of the two dimensions of z E (t) represents the DP TOA measurement performed from each received antenna port p = 0 and p = 1. As explained in Sec. IV-C3, this permits to fill the estimated measurement vector ẑE (t) with the two DP TOA previously evaluated with ESPRIT, one per antenna port. This is the strategy used by EKAT to combine the TOA estimates evaluated from the two transmit antenna ports.</p><p>The evolution in time of the state ζ(t), and its relation to the measurement equation z E (t), are determined by the following recursive equations, inspired by the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">ζ(t) = F•ζ(t -1) + q(t -1), (12) z E (t) = H•ζ(t) + r(t),<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">F = 1 1 0 1 and H = 1 0 1 0 . (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>The system equation of ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) defines a constant rate of change for the DP TOA, which implies a constant speed model, perturbed by the process noise vector q(t) ∈ R 2 . According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, the entries of q(t) are assumed to be zero mean Gaussian random variables, with time invariant covariance matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">Q(t) = Q = q 1 3 1 2 1 2 1 , ∀t,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where q may be set empirically during the KF tuning. Similarly, the entries of the measurement noise vector r(t) ∈ R 2 are assumed to be zero mean Gaussian random variables, as a consequence of the fact that ẑE (t) is filled with ESPRIT outcomes, which are affected by Gaussian noise, as mentioned in Sec. IV-C2 and demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. Moreover, since ẑE (t) is filled with estimations corresponding to different antenna ports, these are assumed as affected by independent noise, resulting in a diagonal covariance matrix R(t) ∈ R 2×2 , filled as described in Sec. IV-C3.</p><p>Having defined the space state model of ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">13</ref>), and exploiting a conventional KF, it is possible to evaluate an estimate of the state vector ζ(t), and ultimately track the DP TOA. The Kalman filter recursive equations used for the DP TOA tracking are <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">ζ- (t) = F• ζ(t-1),<label>(16)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">P-(t) = F• P(t-1)•F T + Q,<label>(17)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_33">W(t) = P-(t)•H T • R(t) + H• P-(t)•H T -1 ,<label>(18)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">ζ(t) = ζ- (t) + W(t)• ẑE (t) -H• ζ- (t) ,<label>(19)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_35">P(t) = I 2 -W(t)•H • P-(t),<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where ẑE (t), ζ-(t), P-(t), ζ(t), P(t) and W(t) correspond to the estimated measurement vector, the predicted state, the predicted state covariance, the estimated state, the estimated state covariance, and the KF gain, respectively.</p><p>As a small recap for the EKAT flow, consider again Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. As one can see, the KF takes as an input ẑE (t), which is made of a selection of the TOA measurements performed with ESPRIT, together with the covariance matrix R(t), that quantifies the accuracy of the measurements in ẑE (t). The state estimated by the KF, denoted with ζ(t) = [ ζ0 (t), ζ1 (t)] T , contains the tracked DP TOA ζ0 (t), having a variance given by the upper left element of the state covariance matrix P(t). Further details on the implementation and initialization of the KF used in the EKAT algorithm can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>As a final remark, consider that the reception of the CRSs of a particular cell is not continuous, e.g., due to signal obstruction, or due to the BS being too far for being detected. If the CRSs of a certain cell are not received for more than D max consecutive measurements, the EKAT KF is stopped and re-initialized at the next available measurement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Pseudoranges evaluation</head><p>The DP TOA estimation algorithms considered so far in the paper can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• IM, IL: CIR-based TOA estimators, not capable of dealing with NLOS cases, characterized by limited computational cost; • TE, TN: CIR-based TOA estimators with reasonable computational cost and capability of dealing with multipath in both LOS and NLOS scenarios; • EKAT: estimator particularly robust against multipath and intended for feasibility studies and analysis of the effects of multipath. By using the direct path TOA estimated with the considered algorithms, the pseudorange for the i th detected cell ID at measurement time t was evaluated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">ρi (t) = c •      ∆t i s + τ i x (t) x ∈ {IM, IL} (Sec.

IV-B, and ∆t o is the constant offset correction needed for the TE and TN estimators. For the IM and IL estimators, τ i x (t) is obtained selecting the earliest estimate between the two antenna ports, as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">τ i x (t) = min p∈{0,1} τ i,p x (t) , x ∈ {IM, IL},<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where τ i,p x (t) denotes the IM or IL TOA estimate at time t from antenna port p. Note that ∆t i s is not added in the case of the EKAT estimator because it is already considered during the DP tracking, as highlighted in Sec. IV-C3.</p><p>The two plots of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> depicts the results of a range estimation using the five considered methods on the CRSs of cell N cell ID = 52 operator 2, for the same representative interval depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. For a clearer understanding of each estimator's performance, all the plotted values are actual ranges, thanks to the application of the clock correction explained in Sec. VI. The GPS measured distance is also shown as a reference. As one can see, the benefits of the EKAT algorithm are evident, since it correctly tracks the DP, determining a consistent range estimate, which is almost equal to the GPS range measure. Conversely, the IM estimator is biased by multipath, especially in the interval <ref type="bibr">[2250,</ref><ref type="bibr">2300]</ref>, where the fourth received path (clearly visible in the plots of Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>) is mismatched with the DP. Moreover, it is evident that the IL estimator gives substantial benefits compared to IM, being more robust against multipath detrimental effects, at the serious cost of discarding suspect NLOS measurements and hence producing fewer estimates (again evident in the interval <ref type="bibr">[2250,</ref><ref type="bibr">2300]</ref>, where IL does not produce any outcome). Finally, the TE and TN estimators show a good robustness in detecting the DP TOA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. COMBINING PSEUDORANGES FROM MULTIPLE CELLS OF THE SAME BASE STATION</head><p>Since the aim of the performed pseudorange measurements is to calculate a position fix based on the BS position knowledge, a single range per BS is needed, instead of multiple ranges corresponding to each cell controlled by every BS. Hence, a method is needed for selecting a single pseudorange ρBS j (t) for each BS j out of the pseudoranges evaluated on a per cell basis as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(21)</ref>.</p><p>More particularly, let Kj be the set of the cell IDs controlled by BS j, and let K j (t) ⊆ Kj be the set of cell IDs controlled by BS j that are visible by the receiver at the measurement time t. Then, consider the set Λ j (t), defined as the collection of cell IDs corresponding to the cells having pseudoranges that, compared to the previous estimation of the per-BS pseudorange ρBS j (t -1), do not imply a receiver movement with a speed higher than v</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">(2) max , i.e. Λ j (t) = i ∈ K j (t) : 1 T |ρ BS j (t -1) -ρi (t)| &lt; v (2)</formula><p>max , where T is the interval between two measurements (T = 1 s in the proposed setup). The parameter v</p><p>(2) max has to be set according to the expected receiver's maximum speed, which is determined by the environment and type of mobility (e.g., pedestrian, vehicular). If the per-BS pseudorange is selected using the pseudoranges of the in Λ j (t), robustness against estimated earlier-than-LOS TOA outliers is guaranteed.</p><p>A simple selection method is to choose the cell corresponding to the earliest estimated pseudorange. This method is the intuitive, and it is used for combining pseudoranges evaluated with the IM, IL, TE and TN algorithms. It has the drawback of not being robust against earlier-than-LOS TOA outliers. Another method, which is used for combining the EKAT pseudoranges, is based on the exploitation of the estimated variance of the tracked DP TOA. At every measurement time, for each BS, the cell corresponding to the measured range with the smallest estimated variance at that particular time is selected, where the estimated DP TOA variance is the upper left element P0,0 (t) of the state covariance matrix P(t). This method may be more robust against TOA outliers, since usually they have a high estimated variance.</p><p>An example of the combination of multiple cell estimates is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> for BS 1 operator 2 in a representative time interval, using the variance method on the EKAT estimates. Again, for a clearer understanding of the combining performance, all the plotted values are actual ranges, corrected for time offset as explained in Sec. VI. The EKAT estimates pertaining to N cell ID = {51, 52, 53}, shown in the upper plot, are selected on the basis of their variance P0,0 (t), which is shown in the form of distance standard deviation in the bottom plot. The result constitutes the EKAT range estimate from BS 1 operator 2. As one can see, the earlier-than-LOS TOA outliers are discarded, e.g., at t 2610 and t 2635.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. FROM PSEUDORANGE TO RANGE</head><p>this section, the relation between the measured pseudoranges and the actual distance estimates is explained. Suppose that the propagation channel is observed at the receiver, thanks to a LTE CRS transmissions from BS j, at the UTC epoch t (U) . The corresponding estimated pseudorange is ρBS j (t), which is evaluated in respect to t (U) , and hence corresponds to the UTC estimated DP TOA:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">TOA j (t) = t (U) + ρBS j (t)/c.<label>(23)</label></formula><p>Consider then the unknown UTC epoch at which the CRS exploited for the TOA estimation was transmitted from the BS j, referred to as time of transmit (TOT), that can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">TOT j (t) = t (U) + j (t)/c + k•∆T CRS ,<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where the parameter j (t)/c is the unknown offset of the BS clock in respect to UTC time t (U) , and k • ∆T CSR = k • 10 ms, k ∈ Z, is the ambiguity due to the CRS transmission periodicity. This ambiguity can be easily solved since the introduced offset is very large, i.e., c•∆T CRS = 3•10 6 m, and hence the value k = 0 was set. Finally, the actual distance estimate between the receiver and the transmitter, referred to as range, is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">dj (t) = c•(TOA j (t) -TOT j (t)) = ρBS j (t) -j (t).<label>(25)</label></formula><p>Hence, the clock offset j (t)/c of the BS j must be known to the receiver in order to calculate the actual range estimate dj (t). The proposed approach assumes that the BSs' clock offset in respect to UTC is available to the PE, enabling the correction of the pseudoranges ρBS j (t) to actual ranges estimations dj (t).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. BSs' clock measurements in real implementations</head><p>In a realistic implementation, several methods can be used for acquiring the knowledge of the BSs' clock properties, and ultimately of the clock offset j (t)/c. As an example, the concept of location measurement units (LMUs) may be employed. An LMU is a device with a known location that periodically performs TOA measurements from the received BSs. The knowledge of the LMU position together with the position of each received BS, enables the evaluation of the BSs' clock offset j (t)/c. These clock offset periodic measurements may be collected in a database, and exploited for the evaluation of the BSs' clock properties such as bias and drift, which can be passed to a PE that has to calculate the actual ranges on the basis of the TOA based pseudoranges. These LMUs may be fixed position devices spread in areas covered the cellular network, or may be installed on the BSs themselves, or may also be mobile devices with known precise location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. BSs' bias and drift estimation</head><p>Unfortunately, in our real field test, each BS clock offset j (t) was unknown, so it was estimated by exploiting the GPS position fixes available for the receiver. Indeed, the knowledge of both the BS and the receiver position permits a straightforward calculation of the distance d j (t), which can be used to estimate j (t).</p><p>The instantaneous BS clock offset (expressed as a distance) j (t) is an unknown function of time t, and depends on several parameters, including the deviation of the BS clock from the frequency, and environmental parameters such as temperature, power voltage, and pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. The BS clock offset was estimated by assuming an underlying linear model, i.e., j (t) = D j + t•d j , where D j represents the clock bias (measured in meters) and d j represents the clock drift (measured in meters per second), assumed constant. The linear model for the BSs' clock has been chosen as a first order approximation, realizing a trade-off between correct modelling simplicity in the estimation of the BSs' clock parameters. Let Tj be the set of all measurement times in which both a receiver GPS fix (and hence the distance d j (t)) and an LTE pseudorange ρBS j (t) from BS j were available during the real field test. Then, an estimate of D j and d j can be evaluated for any sub-set T j ⊆ Tj as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">( Dj , dj ) = arg min d,D t∈Tj d j (t)-ρBS j (t)+D+t•d 2 . (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_43">)</formula><p>The accuracy of the above estimation depends both on the accuracy of the LTE pseudoranges ρBS j (t) and on the number of considered measurements, i.e., on the cardinality of T j . The whole set Tj and the EKAT pseudoranges were used in order to obtain the most precise bias and drift estimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. TRACKING THE RECEIVER POSITION</head><p>Several solutions may be chosen for the estimation of the position solution from the estimated LTE ranges. However, the proposal of a powerful positioning engine is beyond the scope of this work. A reader interested in powerful position tracking techniques and in their influence on the position solution may refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> and references therein. In the presented work, a classical extended Kalman filter (EKF) is adopted to estimate the receiver position.</p><p>An analysis of the geographical properties of the base stations used showed that their heights differ only slightly. In conjunction with the base station spread, which is large compared to the height differences, the situation is close to all base stations lying in one plane, and hence the rover position is solved in two dimensions only. The problem space is constrained to two dimensions by using local east-northup coordinates (ENU), with the up component set to zero. A second order model is used to describe the rover position. Hence, the state vector is ξ(t) = [p(t), ṗ(t), p(t)] T ∈ R 6 , containing the 2D rover position p(t) ∈ R 2 , the 2D rover speed ṗ(t) ∈ R 2 and the 2D rover acceleration p(t) ∈ R 2 . Whenever measurements to at least two base stations are available a measurement update is performed. The constant acceleration second order model leads to the following state transition model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">ξ(t) =     1 0 ∆tp 0 1 2 ∆t 2 p 0 0 1 0 ∆tp 0 1 2 ∆t 2 p 0 0 1 0 ∆tp 0 0 0 0 1 0 ∆tp 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1     • ξ(t -1) + q p (t -1)<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where ∆t p is the elapsed time since the last position estimate at t -1, and q p (t) ∈ R 6 is the zero mean white Gaussian process noise of the position state equation, having constant covariance matrix Q p = E q p (t)q H p (t) . The measurement vector is z p (t) = [z p,1 (t), . . . , z p,N (t) ] T , where N (t) is the number of received BSs at time t, and each component z p,n (t) is the measured range between the receiver and the n th BS, which is given by the non-linear observation model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">z p,n (t) = p n BS -p(t) , n = 1, . . . , N (t -1),<label>(28)</label></formula><p>with the vector p n BS ∈ R 2 representing the known 2D location of the n th received BS. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, the linearization of (28) around the predicted position p-(t), which is produced by the EKF, leads to the following linear observation model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">H p (t) =     (p -(t)-p 1 BS ) T / p 1 BS -p -(t) 0 T 4 (p -(t)-p 2 BS ) T / p 2 BS -p -(t) 0 T 4 . . . . . . (p -(t)-p N (t) BS ) T / p N (t) BS -p -(t) 0 T 4     ∈ R N (t)×6 . (<label>29</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_47">)</formula><p>The matrix of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_46">29</ref>) is evaluated at every iteration of the EKF, which produces at each step an estimate p(t) of the receiver position. The measurements are supposed to be corrupted by a zero mean Gaussian noise vector r p (t) ∈ R N (t) , having covariance matrix R p = E r p (t)r H p (t) . The matrices Q p and R p were supposed time invariant and were tuned empirically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. RESULTS</head><p>This section summarizes the ranging and positioning results obtained with the live data captured by using the setup of Sec. III. Pseudorange estimations were firstly performed from the detected cells with the algorithms of Sec. IV, namely IDFT-MAX (IM), IDFT-LOS (IL), TEMOS (TE), TNR (TN) and EKAT (E). Then, cell pseudoranges were combined with the method of Sec. V, in order to obtain a single pseudorange for each BS, which was corrected for clock bias and drift, according to the procedure of Sec. VI. Finally, these range estimates were used in the position tracking filter of Sec. VII to evaluate a position estimate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Parameters used</head><p>The IM estimator was run as described in Sec. IV-B, while for the IL algorithm the number of searched CIR peaks was set to N IL = 3. The TEMOS algorithm was run in its TEMOS-E flavour, i.e., by only considering the PDP samples between the first and the highest, and the simplified CAICF penality function was employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. The TNR based TOA estimation employed a target early detection probability of 10 -3 in order to evaluate the TNR based on the procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. The used TNR depends also on the number 2N tot of PDP samples available, which is ultimately determined by the LTE bandwidth configuration. The EKAT algorithm was run with parameters similar to those used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, in particular:</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">D max = 3, m = 0.48, v<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_49">max = 70 m/s, v<label>(2)</label></formula><p>max = 30 m/s, q = 5 • 10 -19 . Finally, the position tracking EKF used the following process and measurement noise covariance matrices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">Q p = diag{[q 1 ∆t 2 p , q 1 ∆t 2 p , q 2 ∆t 2 p , q 2 ∆t 2 p , q 3 , q 3 ]}, (30) R p = diag{[r, r, ..., r]} ∈ C N (t)×N (t) ,<label>(31)</label></formula><p>where q 1 = (6 m) 2 , q 2 = (0.5 m/s) 2 , q 3 = (0.0092 m/s 2 ) 2 . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(31)</ref>, the values of r differ depending on the adopted ranging algorithm. The value of r = (40 m) 2 was set in the IM, IL, TE and TN cases. In the EKAT case, a smaller value of r = (10 m) 2 was used, in order to give more trust to the ranges evaluated by this algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Ranging results</head><p>The range estimates dj (t) were compared to the GPS-based ranges d j (t) in order to produce error statistics, and ultimately to evaluate the performance of each used pseudorange estimator. Empirical cumulative density functions (CDFs) of the ranging absolute error were evaluated as P (|E d | &lt; ε) for each BS and each estimator, where E d = d -d. Two different error definitions were adopted for evaluating the CDFs.</p><p>The first type of error considered, denoted with E est d , is calculated considering separately all the estimates produced by the five ranging algorithms. The corresponding error probability abscissas, defined as the value ε p such that P (|E est d | &lt; ε p ) = p, for p = {0.5, 0.95}, were also evaluated. The results are shown for selected BSs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11a</ref>. The best error performance is always obtained by the EKAT estimator, which exhibits an ε 0.5 and an ε 0.95 that are always smaller than the corresponding values of the other estimators. Moreover, it is evident that the IL estimator obtains a better estimation of the range than the IM estimator, sometimes even comparable with that of EKAT (e.g., for BS 5 operator 1). The ε 0.95 performance of TE and TN when calculated on the basis of E est d is better compared to that of IL, but always worse than that of EKAT. A complete comparison is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>, where  the values of ε p obtained for all the BSs are reported for all the estimators. The results show that the p = 0.5 performance of EKAT and IL are comparable, while at p = 0.95 IL presents a higher error, probably because it cannot completely handle multipath effects. Similarly, TE and TN perform better than IL and worse than EKAT at p = 0.95, but also worse than IL at p = 0.5. Finally, as expected, the IM estimator shows the worst results, since by definition it cannot face multipath. The CDFs for the second type of error, denoted with E in d , are calculated similarly to the ones of E est d , with the exception that they are plotted as a percentage of the common number of input data. This kind of comparison is needed for including in the error statistics the fact that, differently from IM, TE, and TN, EKAT and IL do not produce an estimate for each input measurement. EKAT requires some measurements to be initialized, and it may be restarted in case of more than D max missing measurements, hence it may happen that a measure-  x , x ∈ {IL, E} can be defined, for the likelihood that the particular algorithm will produce a range estimate when a measurement is available. Note that the number of estimates produced by IM, TE and TN is always equal to number of input measurements, hence P r IM = P r TE = P r TN = 1. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11b</ref> for the same cases considered in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11a</ref>. As one can see, EKAT obtains the best trade off between small error performance and an unlikely outage, while IL seriously suffers of a performance reduction due to the high number of discarded measurements. As an example, consider the case of BS 5 operator 1, represented in the middle plots of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">IM 0.5 [m] ε IM 0.95 [m] ε IL 0.5 [m] ε IL 0.95 [m] ε E 0.5 [m] ε E 0.95 [m] ε TE 0.5 [m] ε TE 0.95 [m] ε TN 0.5 [m] ε TN 0.</formula><p>According to E est d (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11a</ref>), IL and EKAT exhibit almost the same performance. Considering E in d (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11b</ref>), it is evident that the statistics of IL pertain just to 58% of the possible range estimations, while EKAT produces estimates of the same quality in 96% of cases. The values of P r</p><p>x , x ∈ {IL, E}, for all the received BSs are reported in the two right columns of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Positioning results</head><p>The evaluated ranges were used in the positioning algorithm described obtaining results depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>. Each plot corresponds to a different ranging technique. Each marker in each plot is a position estimate, where the different marker types represent the number of BSs N (t) used for evaluating that particular position fix. By using the GPS position fixes gathered during the live measurements as the true positions p, a positioning error was defined as E p = pp . Error CDFs were evaluated as P (E p &lt; ε), which are shown in 12. The same two error definitions of the ranging results section are adopted, namely the error E est p , that considers all the estimates produced by the positioning algorithm, and the error E in p , that represents the results as a percentage of the common number of inputs. Using the error definition of E est p , error probability abscissas were also evaluated as (E est p &lt; ε p ) = p, p = {0.5, 0.95}, and a root mean square (RMS) positioning error was evaluated as (E[(E est p ) 2 ]) 1/2 . As usually done in positioning contexts, ε 0.5 and ε 0.95 are referred to as circular error probability (CEP) and 95% radius (R95), respectively. Similarly to Sec. VIII-C, the error definition E in p permits to highlight a position fix probability P p . The positioning result obtained with the IM range estimator, not shown for space reasons, gave a CEP of 54 m, an RMS of 175 m and an R95 of 460 m. As explained in Sec. IV-B, the IM estimator produces the typical timing outputs of a communications module. Hence, the poor positioning results of IM demonstrate the need for appropriate processing at the receiver in order to correctly extract the TOA of a signal for positioning purposes.</p><p>The positioning result obtained with the IL range estimator is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13a</ref>, and demonstrates that a simple NLOS rejection algorithm is sufficient to drastically improve the quality of the position fixes provided, resulting in a good CEP figure of 25.53 m. However, this comes at the cost of a consistent decrease in the positioning yield, which can seriously impact the positioning result, especially in situations where very few BSs are visible and most of them presents a NLOS propagation. This is the case for the regions highlighted by the orange dashed ellipses of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13a</ref>. There, IL probably discards the majority of the measurements because of suspect NLOS cases, passing to the positioning engine only a limited number of pseudoranges, resulting in a poor or totally absent positioning fix. The reduced positioning yield of IL is evident in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13a</ref> from the low number of position fixes produced with N (t) ≥ from its small position fix probability P p IL = 0.72, as shown in the bottom plot of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>.</p><p>The positioning results obtained with the TE and TN estimators are shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13b-13c</ref>. The quality of the estimates in the regions where IL fails is improved in both cases, with the position fixes of TE and TN achieving a CEP similar to IL, and with TN achieving an improved RMS of 48.47 m. In contrast to IL, these estimators are capable of dealing also with NLOS cases, and hence their positioning performance presents a greater yield, as the bottom plot of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> depicts. The regions where TE and TN have positioning problems are highlighted with green dash-dotted ellipses, and these are mainly due to signals from too few BSs being available.</p><p>Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13d</ref> illustrates the positioning results obtained using the ranges estimated with the EKAT algorithm. As one can see from the top plot of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>, EKAT achieves the best performance among the considered ranging techniques, with a CEP of 20.96 m, an R95 of 63.71 m, and an RMS of 31.09 m. Moreover, EKAT offers the best coverage, achieving a null outage probability in the considered scenario, and the highest number of position fixes obtained with N (t) ≥ 4 BSs. The quality of the position fixes achieved by EKAT in the regions where IL fails is remarkable, thanks to the ability of EKAT to cope with the detrimental effects of multipath. Finally, most of the regions where the positioning fixes produced with the ranges have a low quality, are characterized by a low number of BSs visible, as the green dash-dotted ellipses of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13d</ref> highlight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>A localization method that exploits the LTE downlink signals has been proposed and validated in the field for tracking the position of a receiver in a vehicle. A data gathering platform has been developed for opportunistically collecting the LTE signals throughout the test route. Time of arrival measurements of the LTE cell specific reference signal have been exploited to calculate the pseudoranges from the received base stations. The EKAT algorithm, which is capable of reducing the detrimental effects of multipath, has been used for performing the estimation of the LTE signals time of arrival. Moreover, a combination of the received signals in the time, frequency, spatial and cell ID domains has been exploited for improving the timing estimates. The pseudoranges have been corrected for base stations' clock bias and drift, previously estimated, and used in a positioning filter. A CEP of 25.53 m and an RMS of 59.83 m with a coverage of the 72% have been obtained using a simple CIR-based timing algorithm with NLOS rejection, while a CEP of 24.01 m and an RMS of 48.47 m with full coverage have been obtained using a TNR based TOA estimator. This demonstrates the feasibility of LTE-based positioning systems, even with simple signal processing at the receiver. Improved CEP, RMS (20.96 m and 31.09 m, respectively), and universal coverage throughout the test have been obtained with the more powerful EKAT algorithm, demonstrating its benefits in correctly detecting the direct path in environments characterized by multipath propagation. The proposed approach demonstrates that positioning with LTE signals is possible, even without transmission of the LTE positioning reference signal. Improvements are easily achievable in the positioning performance, e.g. employing a better navigation filter, and exploiting the forthcoming wider deployment of LTE cells/micro-cells/pico-cells, and the transmission of LTE channels with a wider bandwidth. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first contribution proposing a real field validation of a positioning approach that uses opportunistically the LTE downlink signals.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
