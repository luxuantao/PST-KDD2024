<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sports have worldwide appeal. Professional sport leagues involve significant investments in players. Events such as the Olympics Games, the Football World Cup and the major golf and tennis tournaments generate huge worldwide television audiences and many sports are multi-million dollar industries. A key aspect of sporting events is the ability to generate schedules that optimize logistic issues and that are seen as fair to all those who have an interest. This is not just restricted to generating the fixtures, but also to other areas such as assigning officials to the games in the competitions. This paper provides an annotated bibliography for sports scheduling articles. This area can be traced back over 40 years. It is noticeable that the number of papers has risen in recent years, demonstrating that scientific interest is increasing in this area.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Sports have become a big business. In a globalized economy, many countries and cities battle for the rights to organize major events such as the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup, which often bring thousands of jobs, urban regeneration and economic opportunities to their hosts. Tournaments are followed by millions of people across the world, eager for information on their teams progress in each competition. Fans check newspapers, radio, television and, more recently, the Internet in their quest for information.</p><p>Professional sport leagues involve millions of fans and significant investments in players, broadcast rights, merchandizing, and advertising. Multiple agents, such as the organizers, media, players, fans, security forces, and airlines, play an important role in the leagues and tournaments. Professional sports leagues are therefore part of a major economic activity and face challenging optimization problems, such as revenue maximization and logistic optimization. On the other side, amateur leagues usually do not have access to the same amounts of money, but the number of tournaments and competitors can be very large, also requiring coordination and logistical efforts.</p><p>Sports scheduling and management has been attracting the attention of an increasing number of researchers in multidisciplinary areas such as operations research, scheduling theory, constraint programming (CP), graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and applied mathematics. Different optimization techniques have been applied to solve problems arising from sports scheduling and management. The difficulty of the problems in the field lead to the use of a number of exact and approximate approaches, including integer programming (IP), constraint programming, metaheuristics, and hybrid methods.</p><p>Teams and leagues want to optimize their investments by playing a good schedule which seeks to meet various criteria. Good fixtures are important in order to maximize revenues, ensure the attractiveness of the games, and to keep the interest of both the media and the fans. Good schedules can have significant financial implications and interfere (for the bad and the good) in the performance of every team participating in a tournament. Finding the best schedule of games is a difficult task with multiple decision makers, constraints, and objectives (involving logistics, organizational, economical, and fairness issues).</p><p>The general problem of scheduling the games of a tournament is certainly the most studied area of sports scheduling. It consists in determining the date and the venue in which each game will be played. Applications to real-life problems in the scheduling of tournaments of sports such as football, baseball, basketball, cricket, hockey, and others are common in the literature. However, there are also other relevant scheduling problems in sports. One of them is that of assigning referees to games, which also involve multiple objectives.</p><p>Whilst the above motivations, by themselves, entirely justify the study of scheduling problems in sports, we also remark that they are very interesting and, arguably, more interesting and motivating than other scheduling problems. Most people can relate to sporting events. Even if they do not participate or watch sport, either live or on TV, everybody has some relationship with sport. It might be the fact that one can hardly avoid the coverage that is given to events such as the Olympic Games, the Football World Cup or the Super Bowl. Or it could be that parents need to organize their personal schedules around their children's sporting endeavors. Sporting events (and therefore their schedules) are part of everybody's life and one cannot avoid them. As a single illustrative example of the role played by amateur sport leagues, in the MOSA (Monmouth &amp; Ocean Counties Soccer Association) league, New Jersey, children of ages 8-18 make up six divisions per age and gender group with six teams per division, making a total of 396 games every Sunday. These games are officiated by hundreds of certified referees and attended by thousands of parents, relatives, and friends, who travel to support the players and to enjoy the games.</p><p>Due to our daily and continuous involvement with sports, most sports scheduling problems are very easy to explain and understood by researchers, developers, and practitioners. Sports applications tend to motivate students and can be successfully used in Operations Research courses and classrooms (see <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>).</p><p>Sports scheduling covers an extremely wide range of problems and there are many possible ways to survey the area or to view the different classes of problems. For example, we could be interested in the underlying theoretical fundamentals (such as graph theory, factorizations, or latin squares) of the problems, or in the solution of real world applications in different sports and leagues. Or we could look at different types of problems that are faced by different competitions (such as scheduling fixtures and officials, or maximizing gate receipts). In fact, the way we view sports scheduling depends on the motivation for the individual researchers and practitioners involved.</p><p>This annotated bibliography has two main goals. Firstly, to present a comprehensive list of sports scheduling papers. Although we understand that it is almost impossible to provide a complete coverage of all the work in the area, we hope this bibliography will be as broad as possible and will serve as a starting point for those requiring information about this area, or for those simply wishing to bring their knowledge up to date. This would be beneficial, not only for researchers, but also for potential users responsible for real-life applications. We would be glad to hear from the readers with suggestions and additional references to those presented here, with a view that we can include any omissions in any subsequent revision. The second aim is to present the methodologies that have been utilized in solving these types of problems, so that other researchers and practitioners are able to make an informed choice in case of need.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the main definitions, principles, and fundamentals. Section 3 gives an account of the use of different approaches in the solution of scheduling problems in sports: decomposition strategies; integer programming; constraint programming; heuristic search, metaheuristics and their hybrids. Finally, Section 4 surveys applications in different sports disciplines like football, baseball, basketball, cricket, and hockey. This section closes with references on further problems such as referee assignment. Finally, the last section summarizes some conclusions. Some remarks on the style and organization of this annotated bibliography should be made:</p><p>• We refer to football as the sport regulated by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), at which countries such as Argentina, Brazil, England, and Germany excel and have won 11 out of the 18 preceding world cups (it is not by chance that these are the countries of the coauthors of this bibliography). We also use soccer as a synonym, to maintain consistency with the citations. We use American football to refer to the sport played in the United States. • Some papers are relevant for different sections of this annotated bibliography. Papers in this situation are usually discussed in one of the relevant sections and merely cited elsewhere. A few papers are discussed twice under different points of views. • Due to space limitations, we mainly limit this annotated bibliography to final versions of journal papers or full papers that appeared in conference proceedings. Except for some relevant exceptions, we do not cite unrefereed papers, abstracts, and theses. • We have limited ourselves to scheduling problems in sports. There are other optimization problems in sports that do not fall in this category and, consequently, are not reviewed here. Some of them are briefly cited in Section 4.8.</p><p>We conclude this section by presenting a short list of some seminal, introductory, relevant, or survey papers in the area.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Fundamentals, problems and definitions</head><p>Scheduling problems in sports leagues may be divided into two main classes: temporally constrained and temporally relaxed problems. In the time-constrained case, the planning horizon consists of the minimum number of periods (so-called rounds) required to schedule all the games and, hence, each team has to play exactly one game in each round. Tournaments following this pattern are said to be compact. On the other hand, in the time-relaxed case the number of periods is generally larger than the minimum number of rounds needed for scheduling all games. In this situation not every team necessarily plays in each round and thus teams may have some periods without a game.</p><p>The basic temporally constrained problem for scheduling a sports league may be formulated as follows. The league consists of an even number n of different teams indexed by i ∈ {1, ... , n}, where each team has to play against each other team exactly Ն 1 times. The number of rounds available to schedule these n 2 = n(n -1)/2 games is equal to (n -1), where each team has to play exactly one game in each round. Thus, one has to determine which teams i, j ∈ {1, ... , n} play against each other in each round t = 1, ... , (n -1) and, for each of these pairings, whether it is played in the home stadium of team i (home game for team i) or in the home stadium of team j (away game for team i).</p><p>In most cases we have = 1 (single round-robin tournament, SRRT) or = 2 (double round-robin tournament, DRRT). For double round-robin tournaments the season is often partitioned into two half series, where each pairing has to occur exactly once in each half (with different home rights). The second half series is usually not scheduled independently from the first. In a so-called mirrored schedule, the second series is planned complementarily to the first, i.e. the pairings of round t = 1, ... , n -1 in the second half are exactly the same as in round t of the first half, but with exchanged home rights. Another possibility is the so-called "English" system, where the pairings in the first round of the second half are the same as in the last round of the first half and rounds 2, . . . , n -1 in the second half equal rounds 1, . . . , n -2 of the first half.</p><p>If the league consists of an odd number of teams, in each round one team has a bye, i.e. does not play. This situation may be reduced to the previous case with an even number of teams by adding a dummy team n + 1. Then, in each round the team playing against n + 1 has a bye.</p><p>Usually, a schedule for a sports league is described by a so-called opponent schedule and a so-called home-away pattern (HAP). An opponent schedule may be represented by an n×(n-1)-matrix where the entry opp it ∈ {1, . . . , n}\{i} specifies the opponent of team i in round t. If this matrix is enlarged by an additional column containing the teams 1, . . . , n, its structure is a latin square (each column and each row is a permutation of 1, . . . , n such that in any column or row no number occurs twice). Additionally, the latin squares fulfill the symmetry condition that opp it = j if and only if opp jt = i (i.e. if team i plays against team j in round t, also team j plays against team i in that round).</p><p>A home-away pattern is defined as n × (n -1)-matrix H = (h it ), where h it equals "H" (resp. "A") when team i has a home (resp. away) game in round t. If two consecutive entries h i,t-1 and h it in a row i are equal for some t = 2, ... , n -1, then team i has a so-called break in round t (i.e. the alternating sequence of home and away games is broken).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Graph coloring and factorizations</head><p>Traditional models for constructing sports league schedules are based on graphs. The complete graph K n on n nodes is used to represent single round-robin tournaments. Its nodes i = 1, . . . , n represent the teams, while the edge i -j represents the game between teams i, j ∈ {1, ... , n}. An edge coloring with n -1 colors, i.e. a partitioning of the edge set into 1-factors F 1 , ... , F n-1 (each consisting of n/2 non-adjacent edges), corresponds to the games scheduled in the rounds t = 1, ... , n -1. If additionally home and away games have to be distinguished, the edges are directed into arcs (i, j) for a game in the home stadium of team j or (j, i) for a game in the stadium of team i.</p><p>[11] de Werra D. Geography, games, and graphs. Discrete Applied Mathematics 1980;2:327-37.</p><p>Graph theoretical models are used to deal with geographical constraints for teams located in different cities. For the situation that the number of teams is a multiple of four and the teams are partitioned into two subsets of equal, size schedules with n -2 breaks are constructed where each round is either "internal" (i.e. each team plays against a team belonging to the same subset) or "external" (i.e. each team plays against a team belonging to the other subset).</p><p>[12] de Werra D.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Model development</head><p>Most of the sports scheduling problems discussed in this paper present some form of objective function, together with a set of constraints. Some of these models are presented formally (e.g. as an integer program formulation) and some are simply descriptive.</p><p>It is not possible to provide standard objective functions and sets of constraints for what may first appear to be very similar problems; at least for real world problems. A good example is provided by the referee assignment. Yavuz et al. <ref type="bibr">[156]</ref> (see Section 4.7) assigns referees in the context of professional football leagues. The objective function is a summation of five soft constraint violations which capture the following aspects: (1) a fair dispersion of referees to games throughout the season, (2) the number of times a referee is assigned to a fixture throughout the season, (3) the number of times a referee is assigned a team when it is playing at home, (4) the higher skilled referees should be assigned more games than lesser qualified referees, and (5) the same referee does not officiate both games between the same pair of teams. In Duarte and Ribeiro <ref type="bibr">[145]</ref> (see Section 4.7) the problem is essentially the same, however, the objective functions (and constraints) are quite different. The objective is to allocate each referee to an agreed number of games (which might be different for each referee), penalizing both over and under assignments, and to provide the referees with a good spread of games throughout each round (actually defined as minimizing the sum of the idle times between consecutive games assigned to the same referee). It is apparent that for seemingly similar problems the objective functions and constraints can have similarities (e.g. give a fair spread of games), but they are essentially tailored for the problem at hand and their formulations are presented in different ways. Some problems do not tackle a real world application, but have been introduced for the benefit of researchers to enable them to use a common model. Perhaps the most useful of these is the traveling tournament problem, which aims to minimize the total distance traveled (see Section 2.8). It provides a simplified objective of a real world problem, together with a set of benchmark instances. The TTP also provides researchers with the ability to compare their methodologies with those that have been previously reported. Kendall <ref type="bibr">[120]</ref> (see Section 4.1) handles the same objective, but the problems are distinctly different. While the TTP assumes that teams go on road trips and the distance traveled is minimized across the entire season, Kendall [120] aims to minimize travel distances for English football teams for just two days of the season. As such, the objective is slightly different and the constraints which must be respected are different for each problem. For example, the constraints in the TTP are limited to playing three consecutive home or away matches and not playing the same team in consecutive rounds, while many more constraints have to be respected in a real world problem.</p><p>It is apparent that sports scheduling is as much about developing an appropriate model of the problem, as it is about the solution methodology that is employed. Researchers are able to draw upon previous work to provide inspiration, and may be able to use existing work for some parts of the problem but, to solve a real world problem, model development is as much of an issue as the choice of solution methodology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Breaks optimization</head><p>The first objective in sports league scheduling (and perhaps the most studied subject in this area) is the minimization of breaks. A lot of league organizers restrict themselves to schedules having a minimum number of breaks (i.e. n -2 for a league with an even number n of teams, and 0 for an odd number n). De Werra was the first who did a lot of pioneering work concerning breaks, cf. de Werra [11] in Section 2.1, de Werra [12] in Section 2.1, de Werra [13] in Section 2.1, and de Werra [15] in Section 2.1.</p><p>In connection with "first-schedule, then break"-approaches (cf. Section 3.1) especially the problem of finding a good home-away pattern for a given opponent schedule was studied <ref type="bibr">(</ref> Finally, Urrutia and Ribeiro [74] in Section 2.8, showed that sometimes also a large number of breaks is advantageous since then travel distances are minimized in the traveling tournament problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Carry-over effects</head><p>For a given single round-robin schedule with n teams, it is said that team i gives a carry-over effect to team j if some other team plays consecutively against teams i and j, i.e. some team plays against i in round t and against j in round t+1 for some t ∈ {1, . . . , n-1}, where the rounds are considered cyclically (i.e. round n corresponds to round 1). If team i is a very strong or very weak team and several teams play consecutively against teams i and j, team j may be, respectively, handicapped or favored compared with other teams. In an "ideal" schedule with respect to carry-over effects, no teams i, j, x, y should exist such that teams x and y both play against team j immediately after playing against team i.</p><p>The carry-over effects n × n-matrix C = (c ij ) has been introduced in order to measure the balance with respect to this criterion. Each entry c ij of this matrix counts the number of carry-over effects given by teams i to j. It can be seen that c ii = 0 and n j=1 c ij = n i=1 c ij = n -1 for all rows and columns i, j = 1, ... , n. The quality of a schedule with respect to carry-over effects is measured by the carry-over effects value coe = n i=1 n j=1 c 2 ij . An ideal or balanced schedule is one in which the lower bound value n(n-1) is achieved, i.e. all non-diagonal elements of the corresponding matrix C are equal to 1.</p><p>More generally, it is said that team i gives a carry-over effect to team j at level Ն 1 if some other team plays against team i in round t and against team j in round t + (the carry-over effect introduced above corresponds to =1). A schedule is called completely balanced if it is balanced for all levels = 1, ... , n -2.</p><p>[25] Anderson I. Balancing carry-over effects in tournaments.

For n = 20 and 22 even balanced schedules are found, which implies that Russell's conjecture in Russell [32] is false.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Group-changing schedules</head><p>For sports leagues in which the teams are partitioned into g Ն 2 different strength groups, the objective is to avoid that a team plays against extremely weak or extremely strong teams in consecutive rounds. Two concepts have been introduced assuring a certain degree of fairness with respect to groups. A schedule for a SRRT is called group-changing if no team plays against teams of the same group in two consecutive games. It is called group-balanced if no team plays more than once against teams of the same group within g consecutive games.</p><p>The second property implies the first one, since each groupbalanced schedule (where each team plays against each group exactly once within g Ն 2 consecutive matches) is also group-changing.</p><p>[33] Briskorn D.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Problems with venues and balanced tournament designs</head><p>Special requirements regarding the venues (courts, fields, stadiums, locations) have to be taken into account for some sports scheduling problems. In the so-called balanced tournament problem, 2n teams (or players) have to play a single round-robin tournament in 2n -1 rounds using n different courts in each round. In order to balance the effects of the different courts, it is required that no team plays more than twice on any court (i.e. each team plays twice on n -1 courts and once on the remaining court). Such a schedule is also called a balanced tournament design BTD(n) of order n. It may be represented by a matrix where the columns correspond to the rounds and the rows to the courts. In some versions of the problem instead of courts the assigned time slots in the rounds (starting times for the games) have to be balanced. This problem is also known as prob026 of the CSPLib in the constraint programming community. In the BTD*(n) variant of the balanced tournament design problem, each of the 2n teams plays 2n games (implying that each team plays against one opponent twice) and each team plays exactly twice on any court.</p><p>A factored balanced tournament design FBTD(n) is a BTD(n) with the property that each team plays exactly once on each court in the first n rounds. A partitioned balanced tournament design PBTD(n) is a FBTD(n) where each team additionally plays exactly once on each court in the last n rounds.</p><p>Although it has been shown that a BTD(n) or even an FBTD(n) exists for every integer n 2 (cf. Schellenberg et al.</p><p>[60], Lamken and Vanstone [54]), the proofs do not lead to a concrete constructive method for building such schedules. Therefore, besides some construction schemes for specific values of n, several procedures have been developed for the general case using tabu search, constraint programming, or integer programming.</p><p>[38] Blest D, Fitzgerald D.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.">Traveling tournament problem</head><p>The traveling tournament problem was introduced by Easton et al. <ref type="bibr">[67]</ref>. It is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem in sports scheduling that abstracts the most important aspects in creating timetables where team travel is an important issue. Given two integer numbers L and U, and an even number n of teams whose distances between their sites are known beforehand, the problem calls for the schedule of a double round-robin tournament minimizing the total distance traveled by the teams and respecting a set of constraints. Every team begins the tournament at home and must return to home after its last away game. Whenever a team plays two consecutive away games, it goes directly from the site of the first opponent to that of the second, without going back to home. No repeaters are allowed, i.e. no two teams can face each other in two consecutive rounds. Furthermore, every sequence of consecutive home games (or consecutive away games) played by any team is formed by at least L and at most U games. Research on the TTP was inspired by work done for the Major League Baseball in the United States. The complexity of the traveling tournament problem is still open to date.</p><p>The mirrored traveling tournament problem and the traveling tournament problem with predefined venues (TTPPV) are two variants of the traveling tournament problem, described in Ribeiro and Urrutia [73] and Melo et al. <ref type="bibr">[71]</ref>, respectively. The mirrored traveling tournament problem has the additional constraint that games played in round t are exactly the same played in round t + (n -1) for t = 1, ... , n -1, but with reversed venues. Such tournaments are a common tournament structure in Latin America.</p><p>The traveling tournament problem with predefined venues is a single round-robin variant of the TTP, in which the venue of each game to be played is known beforehand.</p><p>The TTP and its variants have been tackled by different exact and approximate solution methods. Three sets of test instances available from the literature are widely used for benchmark studies: circle instances CIRCn, National League instances NLn, and constant instances (for which the minimization of the travel distance is equivalent to the maximization of the number of breaks). The two first sets were created by Easton et al. <ref type="bibr">[67]</ref> and the third by Urrutia and Ribeiro <ref type="bibr">[74]</ref>. Instances derived from the National Football League and from the Brazilian national football championship are also available. Input data, together with the best lower and upper bounds considering L = 1 and U = 3 for all these instances can be found at http://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/TOURN/.

The Lagrange multipliers are adjusted by solving one subproblem for each team.

A new class of constant instances of the TTP is proposed, in which the distance between any pair of venues is equal to one. In this case, the total distance traveled is equal to the number of trips. Lower bounds to the number of trips are derived for several tournament types.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Decomposition approaches</head><p>Sports scheduling problems are often decomposed into subproblems which are solved sequentially by exact or heuristic algorithms. Mainly, the following two approaches can be distinguished:</p><p>(1) "First-schedule, then-break": At first only the pairings are determined for each round (i.e. which teams play against each other in this round). Afterwards, a corresponding home-away pattern is calculated for these pairings (often with a minimum number of breaks). (2) "First-break, then-schedule": At first a feasible home-away pattern (often with a minimum number of breaks) is determined. Afterwards, the pairings for the corresponding pattern are fixed.</p><p>In this case, sometimes placeholders are used at first to determine the pairings and specific teams are assigned to the placeholders afterwards.</p><p>Both approaches have been studied in the literature for different problem settings. They are often used in combination with integer linear programming or constraint programming formulations.</p><p>In a "first-schedule, then-break" approach, the subproblem of the second stage is to find a home-away pattern (with a minimum number of breaks) corresponding to the pairings determined in the first stage. The complexity status of this problem is unknown, but it is conjectured to be NP-complete. On the other hand, it can be decided in polynomial time whether the given pairings can be scheduled with at most n breaks or not.</p><p>[76] Brouwer A, Post G, Woeginger G.

The same idea can be applied in order to check whether a pattern with n breaks exists. Furthermore, it is proved that break maximization is equivalent to break minimization by showing that each home-away pattern with k breaks can be con-verted into a pattern with n(n -2) -k breaks and vice versa. The idea of the transformation is to convert each break into a non-break and vice versa by keeping the home rights in the odd-numbered rounds 1, 3, . . . , n -1 and flipping the home rights in the even-numbered rounds 2, 4, . . . , n -2.</p><p>[79] Miyashiro R, Matsui T.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Integer programming</head><p>Integer programming is a useful tool to model and solve sports scheduling problems. Some round-robin tournament scheduling problems can be solved by directly applying an integer programming solver to the model. In most cases, decomposition schemes are used to tackle each stage of the problem by integer programming or other techniques such as constraint programming, complete enumeration, or heuristics.</p><p>If n denotes the number of teams and r the number of rounds, most models usually make use of the following variable definition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x ijt =</formula><p>1 if team i plays at home against team j in round t, 0 otherwise, for teams i, j=1, . . . , n (with i j) and rounds t=1, ... , r. The constraints of a double round-robin tournament may be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r t=1 x ijt = 1, ∀1 Յ i, j Յ n, i j, n j=1 x ijt Յ 1, ∀1 Յ i Յ n, 1Յ t Յ r.</formula><p>The first set of constraints imposes that every team must play against every other team at home. The second set establishes that no team plays more than once in each round. In the case of a compact schedule (where every team has to play in each round), the last inequality constraints turn into equalities. Traveled distances cannot be directly modeled by variables x ijt . If they are an issue in the problem, then new binary variables have to be used, e.g.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">z kijt = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1 if team k</formula><p>travels from the venue of team i to that of j in round t, 0 otherwise. When the length of the round trips and the length of the home stands are limited, the number of distinct round trips and home stands a given team may be involved in is polynomial with respect to the numbers of teams. This fact usually allows the use of more descriptive variables defining entire round trips or home stands, see e.g. Melo et al. <ref type="bibr">[71]</ref> in Section 2.8, and Costa et al. [66] in Section 2.8. Exponentially many variables representing e.g. the entire sequence of games of a given team during the tournament are also used in some cases.</p><p>Integer programming methods applied to sport scheduling problems include branch and bound, branch and cut, Benders decomposition, and column generation. These methods are used to deal with real leagues scheduling problems as well as to tackle theoretical problems such as the traveling tournament problem or break minimization.</p><p>Hybridization with other methods is common in the literature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Constraint programming</head><p>In order to apply constraint programming techniques to an optimization problem, the problem must be modeled by inter-related sets of variables and constraints. Each variable has a finite domain of possible instantiation values. Constraint programming derives new constraints and fixes variable values by manipulating the original sets of constraints and variable domains. Furthermore, variables are fixed from logical conclusions. In defining a constraint satisfaction problem, typically (at least) the following questions have to be settled:</p><p>• Which variables are used to model the problem? • Which values are those variables allowed to take?</p><p>• What are the constraints of the problem?</p><p>• What are the relationships between the variables so that only valid solutions are allowed once all the variables have been instantiated? • How can decisions be propagated in order to derive new constraints?</p><p>There are many references describing constraint satisfaction methodologies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Heuristic search and metaheuristics</head><p>Most optimization problems in scheduling are very hard in computational terms, in the sense that no polynomial-time algorithms are known for their solution. Although some scheduling problems in sports are amenable to be exactly solved by integer programming due to their small size or intrinsic structure, this is not the general case. Therefore, heuristics (or approximate algorithms) that find suboptimal solutions in reasonable computation times are often used in practice. Research in heuristics started with the pioneering work of Hart et al.</p><p>[96] on algorithm A*, which follows a scheme very similar to a branch-and-bound algorithm using a best-first strategy:</p><p>[96] Hart PE, Nilsson NJ, Raphael B. A formal basis for the heuristic determination of minimum cost paths. IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics 1968;4:100-7.</p><p>Algorithm A* is a graph-search based on heuristic information and lower bounds to speedup the search. It extends the less-informed breadth search strategy which corresponds to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm when every edge has a unit weight. This is the seminal work describing algorithm A*, its principles and properties.</p><p>[97] Nilsson NJ. Problem-solving methods in artificial intelligence.

Berlin: Springer; 1982.</p><p>This book is an extended and updated version of Nilsson <ref type="bibr">[97]</ref>.</p><p>Constructive heuristics build feasible solutions from scratch and are often based on quick greedy choices. The use of fast constructive algorithms to provide initial solutions to more sophisticated procedures often leads to impressive improvements in solution quality and computation times. Local search heuristics are based on the investigation of solution neighborhoods, successively replacing the current solution by a better one within its neighborhood and terminating when no better solution can be found. Metaheuristics are general high-level procedures that coordinate simple heuristics and rules to find good (often optimal) approximate solutions to computationally difficult combinatorial optimization problems. Among them, we find simulated annealing, tabu search, greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, genetic algorithms, iterated local search, variable neighborhood search (VNS), ant colonies, and others. They are based on distinct paradigms and offer different mechanisms to escape from locally optimal solutions, contrarily to greedy algorithms or to pure local search methods. The customization (or instantiation) of some metaheuristic to a given problem yields a heuristic to the latter. We provide below some references focusing on local search and the metaheuristics which are often applied to scheduling problems in sports:</p><p>[99] Aarts E, Korst J, Michiels W.

Berlin: Springer; 2007. for solving combinatorial optimization problems in practice. Hybridizations combining principles from different metaheuristics often produce the best results. In particular, metaheuristic implementations strongly benefit from good initial solutions such as those obtained by greedy randomized constructive heuristics and repair methods, as shown by numerical results reported e.g. in Ribeiro and Urrutia <ref type="bibr">[77]</ref>  [109] Anagnostopoulos A, Michel L, Van Hentenryck P, Vergados Y.

The heuristic buys some principles from other metaheuristics: it uses a large neighborhood with complex moves and includes advanced techniques such as strategic oscillation and reheats to balance the exploration of the feasible and infeasible regions and to escape local minima at very low temperatures. It matches the best-known solutions on the small instances and produces significant improvements over previous approaches on the larger instances. The algorithm is claimed to be robust, because the worst solution value it produced over 50 runs is always smaller than or equal to the best known solutions.</p><p>[110] Costa D.

The search space is divided into a timetable space and a team assignment space. The timetable space is explored by a simulated annealing algorithm, while the team assignment space is explored by a hill-climbing algorithm. A controller fixes team assignments and calls on the simulated annealing component to generate better timetables. The timetable with best schedules is passed on to the hill-climbing component, which searches for better team assignments. Team assignments that give best schedules for the given timetable are then passed back to the simulated annealing component. The process continues until there is no improvement for a specified fixed number of consecutive cycles or when a time limit is reached. The underlying idea is to look for better team assignments only for timetables with a higher chance of giving better schedules, and to search for better timetables only for team assignments that have a higher chance of giving better schedules.</p><p>[113] Ribeiro CC, Urrutia S.

The venues of the games are set round by round and local search is used to repair possible infeasibilities in the last step of the constructive heuristic. The hybrid heuristic makes use of four simple neighborhoods for local search and one ejection chain neighborhood for perturbations. The results obtained by the hybrid heuristic were even better than the best known at the time of writing for some instances of the less constrained TTP produced by Anagnostopoulos et al. <ref type="bibr">[108]</ref>, with execution times limited to 15 min.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Applications</head><p>Exact and approximate optimization methods have been widely applied to scheduling problems in sports. In this section we review some of these applications, classified by their corresponding fields or sports of application. Football and basketball are the sports with more applications. The creation of suitable schedules for national top soccer league in Europe has to address other constraints, besides numerous conflicting inner-league requirements and preferences. Additionally, the games of the European Cup matches (Champions League, UEFA Cup, National Cup Winners) have to be taken into account. This paper considers the case of Austria and Germany, that is the planning problem the Deutsche Fuball-Bund (DFB) and the Österreichische Fuball-Bund ( ÖFB) are confronted with. For both leagues, models and algorithms are developed which yield reasonable schedules quickly. Heuristics and branch and bound are applied. The proposed approach generates schedules which have been accepted for play once by the DFB and six times by the ÖFB.</p></div>

A solution procedure is presented which is able to derive feasible schedules that are also balanced with respect to additional cable televisions requirements. This procedure adapts the approach of Nemhauser and Trick [129] to schedule a college basketball conference that considers, however, only half of the teams involved here. The proposed procedure is divided into three phases: the first phase generates a pattern set respecting the cable televisions requirements and several other constraints; the second produces a feasible round-robin schedule compatible with the above pattern set; and the third phase generates the actual calendar assigning teams to patterns. The procedure allows to generate within short time several different reasonable calendars satisfying the cable television companies requirements and satisfying various other operational constraints, while minimizing the total number of violations of the home-away matches conditions.</p><p>[117] Durán G, Guajardo M, Miranda J, Sauré D, Souyris S, Weintraub A, et al.

At these tournaments, chief umpires assign and schedule line umpires for every match. This task is performed manually for most tournaments. For large tournaments, such as the US Open, they can use software developed to facilitate scheduling, which often creates suboptimal or infeasible schedules that must be manually adjusted. The authors developed a program based on optimization that automates the scheduling procedure. They claim that their program consistently provides high-quality schedules in as little as 25% of the time taken with other methods. The problem is formulated by integer programming. The objective includes components for which the user can use a subjective weighting scheme to set priorities. The user can thus assign umpires with lower skill ratings to some lines for training purposes instead of umpires with better skill ratings. Since all feasible schedules may have gender shortages, an arbitrarily high penalty factor is used in the objective function to heavily penalize shortages.</p><p>[152] Lamghari A, Ferland JA.

European Journal of Operational Research, 2007, in press. Timetables for a time-relaxed scheduling problem in a nonprofessional table-tennis league are calculated, where especially constraints on team availabilities have to be taken into account. The problem is modeled as an integer linear program and a multimode resource-constrained project scheduling problem. Based on the second model a heuristic solution algorithm is proposed, which proceeds in two stages using local search and genetic algorithms. [143] Sch önberger J, Mattfeld DC, Kopfer H. Memetic algorithm timetabling for non-commercial sport leagues. European Journal of Operational Research 2004;153:102-16. Timetables for a time-relaxed scheduling problem in a nonprofessional table-tennis league are constructed by memetic algorithms and constraint programming. Additionally, Farmer et al. [151] in Section 4.7 study the scheduling of tennis umpires.</figDesc><table /></figure>

In fact, sporting events continue to generate a lot of public interest, with fairness and technical criteria to be respected and logistic issues to be optimized. For researchers and practitioners who are interested in this area, the articles that are discussed in this work provide access to all the important contributions over the past 40 years. They may also provide inspiration for teachers of Operations Research courses, who may be able to use successful case studies to motivate students and to illustrate in classroom the use of different formulation tools and solution methods (see <ref type="bibr">Trick [10]</ref> in Section 1).</p><p>The hardness of the optimization problems in sports scheduling has led to the use of different techniques in their solution: decomposition strategies, integer programming, column generation, Benders cuts, constraint programming, heuristic search, metaheuristics, and their hybrids. The best results are often obtained by methods derived from the hybridization of integer programming, constraint programming and metaheuristics. Optimal solutions can be found by exact methods for some medium-size problems in professional leagues.</p><p>Interest by problems in this area has risen, in particular, since the introduction of the traveling tournament problem and its benchmark instances in the seminal paper by Easton et al. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, discussed in Section 2.8. TTP benchmark instances and real-life instances are in- trinsically difficult to solve: for many years, the largest TTP instance exactly solved to optimality had only six teams. Only recently, in June 2008, the 8-team NL8 benchmark TTP instance was solved to optimality by an intricate branch-and-price algorithm described in Irnich [70] (see Section 2.8).</p><p>The hardness of optimization problems in sports scheduling is also driving research on new algorithmic directions for clusters and computational grids, as outlined by Araújo et al. <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref> (see Section 2.8). A hierarchical distributed implementation of cooperative metaheuristics such as GRASP and ILS on a medium-size grid lead to improved results for several TTP benchmark issues. However, in spite of its hardness, it is noticeable that the decision version of the traveling tournament problem is not proved to be NP-complete at the time of writing.</p><p>The literature reports real-life applications of optimization methods to the scheduling of baseball, basketball, and hockey tournaments in the North America, as well as to soccer leagues in Austria, Chile, Denmark, England, Germany and Japan, to volleyball tournaments in Argentina and The Netherlands, and to the rugby World Cup. The Brazilian Soccer Confederation also used an optimized fixture constructed by a decision support system powered by an integer programming model for the 2009 edition of its annual tournament.</p></div>			</div>
