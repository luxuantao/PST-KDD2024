To achieve this mission efficiently, we implemented a simple and decentralised task allocation mechanism based on individual activation-thresholds, i.e. the energy level of the nest under which a given robot decides to go collect food-items. The experiments show that such a mechanism -already studied among social insects -results in an efficient dynamical task allocation even under the noisy conditions prevailing in real experiments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In human and other social groups with advanced labour division, life is organised around a series of concurrent activities. For a society to function efficiently, the number of individuals (team size) involved in these activities has to be continuously adjusted such as to satisfy its changing needs. The process regulating team size -and thus modulating labour division -is called task allocation. It can be evident when centralised and embodied in a special agency (like a foreman dispatching men on a working site) or it can its regulation are organised by surprisingly simple and robust means. Task allocation within insect colonies was considered a rigid process. The different activities were associated with different castes and caste polymorphism was related to genetic or internal factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. At the same time, other observations indicated that individuals could change activity during their life span <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, suggesting other than genetic factors being relevant for task allocation. These findings have let to reformulate the caste definition based purely on morphological or genetic criteria to incorporate age or simple behavioral differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Thus, recent research on task allocation in social insects concentrates on behavioral flexibility and stresses the importance of external and decentralised factors like pheromones or individual encounters <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. One of the most inspiring models to explain this decentralised and flexible task allocation found in social insects is the activation-threshold model.</p><p>In the activation-threshold model, individuals react to stimuli that are intrinsically bound to the task to be accomplished. For instance, neglected brood or the corpse of dead ants diffuse an odour of increasing strength. When this stimulus reaches an individual's threshold value, the individual reacts by adopting the relevant activity (in our example: grooming the brood or carrying the corpse out of the nest) or by increasing its likelihood to do so. This is a proximal mechanism: individuals closer to the work to be done are most likely to be recruited. Moreover, if the individuals do not have the same threshold value, the recruitment is gradual, which may allow regulation of the teams' sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Indeed, Bonabeau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have shown that such a simple activation-threshold model ". . . can account for the workers' behavioral flexibility". 4  Similarly, models in sociology have shown that simple reaction-threshold differences among individuals may lead to complex social dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. The purpose of the experiments described below was to test the efficiency of the activation-threshold mechanism for task allocation in practical robotics.</p><p>The regulation of a group of robots engaged in several concurrent activities involves regulating the team members' activity in real time (dynamical task allocation). A variety of mechanisms may achieve task allocation, however, when working with real mobile robots whose perceptions, communication and actions are reckoned to be limited, it is advisable to select a mechanism for its simplicity and its robustness. A good candidate for a robust and simple task allocation mechanism is the activation-threshold mechanism described above <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Its task-related recruiting stimuli increase when the tasks to be accomplished are neglected, acting as a feed-back. In a team of N agents whose choice of activities is limited to two, neglecting the first activity (because too many individuals are engaged in the second activity) causes the stimulus for the first activity to increase, prompting individuals to change from the second to the first activity; and conversely (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Choosing appropriate activation-thresholds is crucial for the performance of the robot team since individuals with the same activation-thresholds and exposed to the same stimuli switch activity at the same time, yielding generally a poor regulation. Hence, one of our objectives was to show that simply implementing different activation-thresholds is sufficient for an effective task allocation mechanism in robotic experiments. 4 The idea of activation-threshold might seem a truism since any change can be brought back to the fact that a variable crossed a threshold! What the model wants to stress is the origin and the simplicity of the activation variable directly tied to the recruiting activity. In the case of corpse carrying witnessed among some ant species, the stimulus is a natural by-product of the corpse decomposition, namely oleic acid. We are all familiar with this type of mechanism: when there is a smell of gas, we go check the gas-range; when there is a smell of cheese, we put the cheese away into the refrigerator. The point, however, is that social insects seem to regulate all their colony activities in this way, whereas, among humans, the dynamical allocation of workforce between the different trades is a rather complex procedure including considerations of aptitudes, tradition, interest, openings, wages, etc. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Individual choice between two activities with a fixed activation-threshold. Neglecting activity 1 causes the stimulus for activity 1 to increase, prompting individuals to change from activity 2 to activity 1; and conversely.</p><p>From the biologist's point of view, the purpose of these experiments is to contribute a piece of heuristic evidence that complex social systems may be organised on decentralised organisation principles. Central to sociality is labour division, with its correlates of specialisation, cooperation and task allocation. As we have seen above, social insects are thought to organise an important aspect of labour division, i.e. task allocation, in a decentralised manner where each individual's decision is made according to a simple set of rules based on local information only. Many complex patterns and collective behaviours observed at the colony (macroscopic) level emerge as the aggregated result of the decentralised interactions at the individual (microscopic) level. This mode of organisation, termed self-organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, could account for many collective phenomena found in social insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Other authors used successfully mathematical models of self-organisation to model either specific behaviours (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>) or whole insect colonies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref>]. Yet it is difficult to prove unequivocally that self-organisation is the main mechanism operating in social insect societies and that all complex collective behaviours emerge from interactions among individuals with simple stereotyped behaviours.</p><p>Our experiments intend to bring heuristic evidence, and thus shed some light on two questions: first, can we imagine plausible mechanisms of automatic and decentralised control for insect societies; and secondly, do these mechanisms account for or lend themselves to the gradual evolution from a solitary individual systems to sociality? Such a gradual evolution implies that the transition from the ancestral, solitary state to a social system is beneficial. Hence, individuals in simple aggregations have to have a better pay-off than solitary individuals, and individuals in groups with cooperative interactions have to outperform individuals in aggregations. Since not all animals live in social systems it follows that these conditions are not always given. One element which has proven to influence social organisation are environmental factors. Among them, the distribution of food and its availability was identified as one of the key features <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Therefore, we also examined the influence of different food distributions on social organisation. However, it should be stressed that our robots do not mimic any specific social insect species and therefore, no binding conclusion can be obtained by the comparative study of our robots' behaviour and the behaviour of social insects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The mission</head><p>The robots' mission was to search and collect "food-items" in a foraging area (Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>) and bring them back to the "nest" (Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>) in order to keep the nest-energy at a safe level. Their energy consumption was activity-related: it was low when they were inactive in the nest, increased when they moved around and reached a maximum when they were carrying a food-item. For the robots to achieve their mission efficiently, i.e. using globally as little energy as possible, we dispersed their individual activation-thresholds to avoid that the robots leave the nest simultaneously (for comments on the activation-threshold distribution, see Section 5.1). The activation-thresholds were equidistributed between 3/4 and full initial nest-energy. This simple task allo-Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The experimental set-up. Experiments were carried out on a 9.24 m 2 surface with a nest and a foraging area. The entrance of the nest was signalled by a light beacon. Next to the entrance, the robots unloaded the collected food-items into a basket. Depending on the experiment, the food-items were either grouped in two patches of 12 food-items each (clumped food-items) or placed singly at six locations (isolated food-items). cation mechanism resulted in a good modulation of the number of individuals engaged in the two possible activities: staying in nest (inactive), and foraging (active). All robots were able to execute either of the two tasks and, depending on the situation, were able to switch from one to the other. They had no prior knowledge about the number and the distribution pattern of the food-items, or about the robot team's size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Basic mission cycle</head><p>The basic mission (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>) can be described with the following pseudo-procedural instructions: 1. Wait in nest</p><p>• If a robot ahead leaves the waiting line, compact the waiting line by moving forward. • Keep listening to control-station's radio messages that periodically update the nest-energy level. • Radio to the control-station the energy you have been consuming while waiting in the line. In the same time refill your personal energy store.</p><p>• Leave the nest when the radioed nest-energy level is lower than your personal activationthreshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Leave nest</head><p>• Leave the waiting line and move to the exit-lane.</p><p>• If there are other robots, slow down and give way.</p><p>• Follow the exit-lane; at its end turn left and leave the nest. (Once the robot has left the nest, it is not updated anymore about the current nest-energy level, nor can it inform the control-station about its energy consumption. During this time the robot depends entirely on the energy of its personal energy store. At the same time the robot keeps track of its energy consumption.) 3. Look for food-items</p><p>• Start a random search for food-items. Or, if you already know where to find one, try to return to the spot using odometry (a helpful but not a very robust localisation method, since any free spinning of the wheels will cause the odometry   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Mission cycle with information exchange</head><p>In a second series of experiments, we introduced a simple coordination among the robots. Robots that detected a food source were able to recruit and guide other robots to this food source (robots can record the position of food-item patches with their odometry). This was inspired by the tandem recruiting-behaviour observed in the ant Camponotus sericeus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Two reasons lead us to chose such a behavior based recruitment: first, it represents a type of communication without symbolisation which probably established itself very early during social evolution and secondly, such a mechanism scales up without problems (i.e. can be used with larger groups), whereas radio transmissions relaid by a central base create communication bottlenecks.</p><p>Recruitment was executed just before the robot was about to return to the food patch where it previously found food-items. The recruiting itself was rather simple; the recruiting robot approached the robot at the head of the waiting line, which was the signal for the waiting robot to follow (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). To incorporate information exchange among the robots the following additions to the mission cycle were made: • To the robots waiting in the nest:</p><p>-If you are heading the waiting line, you are a potential follower: be ready to be asked to tandem. -Once you have been asked to tandem, follow the leading robot until you lose it. When you have lost it, start a local search for the food-items. • To the recruiting robots:</p><p>-If you know where to find more food-items, try recruiting the robot heading the waiting line, by approaching the one to be recruited to a close distance (about 5 mm). -Go slowly toward the food source. When you have reached it, decouple the tandem by making a fast move forward, wait a while and go back to collect food-items. (By making a fast move forward the leading robot gets out of the sensory field of the follower, which serves as a signal to indicate the arrival at the food patch.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental setup</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data acquisition</head><p>Radio communication was strictly used for controlling the experiment and for sending data from the robots to the control station for later analysis. The operator could initialise the robots from his computer, as well as start, suspend, resume or stop an experiment. The messages were not broadcast simultaneously to all robots: every robot was individually addressed and a message was considered received only when echoed properly to the radio base and displayed on the control station screen. Every 10 to 20 seconds a data request was initiated from the control station to the robots. The request signal was radioed together with nest-energy, the only information used by the robots to allocate tasks. The robots were programmed to consider and update this external variable while inside the nest, but to ignore it when outside, reflecting the fact that they do not know the evolution of nest-energy while working outside the nest. In return, the robots updated the control station on their current activity and energy consumption for the statistical analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Experimental procedure</head><p>The experiments were carried out on a 9.24 m 2 surface tiled with 64 printed boards (0.38 m × 0.38 m) (Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>) with copper strips alternatively connected to the two poles of a direct current power supply. The floor was bordered by a wall. Along the wall, a black line was painted on the floor to facilitate the distinction between the wall and the food-items (for a detailed description see Section 3.5). The nest, whose entrance was signalled by a lamp, was also enclosed with black footed walls. Inside the nest and in its close proximity, black lines were used as tracks for easy navigation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). Next to the entrance, the robots unloaded the collected food-items into a basket (Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). The food-items were small plastic cylinders (3 cm diameter × 3 cm height) with narrow strips of infrared reflecting tape. Depending on the experiment, they were either grouped in two patches of 12 food-items each (clumped food distribution), or placed singly at six locations (dispersed food distribution). All food-items were replaced soon after they were seized by the robots.</p><p>We conducted three types of experiments (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>): food search in an environment with a dispersed food distribution, food search in an environment with a clumped food distribution both without recruitment and finally food search in an environment with a clumped food distribution with recruitment. Each type of experiment was carried out with groups of one, three, six, nine and twelve robot teams, with the exception of the experiments with recruitment, where the experiments with group size of one were omitted since recruitment involves at least two robots. All experiments were repeated eight times (112 experiments in total) and had a duration of 30 minutes. Before the start of the experiment, all robots were positioned inside the nest. The only deliberate difference among them was their activation-threshold whose values were equidistributed between 3/4 of and full initial nest-energy level. In order to allow comparisons between different team sizes, the initial nest-energy was proportional to the number of robots participating in the experiment. A typical experiment with six robots is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Statistical data analysis</head><p>Two series of analysis were carried out. First, the effect of the two different food distributions (clumped versus dispersed) was investigated using the two types of experiments without recruitment and, secondly, the effect of recruitment (recruitment versus non-recruitment) was investigated using the two types of experiments carried out in the environment with a Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. A typical experiment with six robots. (a) Nest-energy; (b) number of active and inactive robots. At the beginning (a), none of the robots is active. As nest-energy decreases (b), the robots progressively leave the nest. At time 800 s (c), all six robots are active. Their harvest is good, which results in a nest-energy higher than the initial nest-energy (d). As a consequence the robots switch to the inactive mode and stay in nest, as all of them have done by time 1200 s (e). But as nest-energy decreases again (f), the robots resume their food search. At the end of the experiment all but one robot are inactive in the nest (g). clumped food distribution. Statistical tests were conducted with ANOVAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Performance was calculated as the inverse of the total energy used during the course of the experiment. Robustness was measured as the lowest nest-energy recorded during the experiment. Values closer to zero indicate a higher risk of system collapse since the system was considered to have crashed when nest-energy dropped below zero. To assess the relative amount of work done by each team member a skew measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> was used. This measure allows to quantify the skew in individual contributions to a global task and ranges from zero to one. A skew of one indicates that one team member was doing all the work whereas a skew of zero means that all team members contributed equally to the global task. The skew can be calculated with the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = N - 1 p 2 i (N -1) ,</formula><p>where N is the number of individuals in the group and p i the relative contribution of team member i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">The robots</head><p>We used Khepera<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">5</ref> robots with three additional modules: a gripper turret, a custom-made detection module, and a radio turret (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>). The Khepera's basic module is a miniature mobile robot designed as a research tool at the Laboratoire de Micro-informatique of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Lausanne <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and now produced by K-Team SA. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">6</ref> For our experiments, we redesigned the Khepera's basic module, adding four floor contacts plus a regulator for continuous power supply (allowing long experiments with additional turrets) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, three floor-oriented IR sensors for floor readings and a castor wheel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>). The main specifications of the Khepera's basic module are: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Diameter</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Additional modules</head><p>The gripper turret is a standard Khepera module with an arm moving from the front to the back, plus the gripper whose jaw can seize objects up to about 55 mm. An optical barrier detects the presence of objects between the jaws, and conductive surfaces (not used in our experiments) measure the electrical conductivity of the object seized.</p><p>The detection module was custom-made featuring two detection units: an ambient light detector and an optical barrier (light modulation photo IC). The ambient light detector was used by the robots to navigate back to the nest which was signalled by a light beacon. The optical light barrier was used to distinguish the three basic objects present in our experiments: walls, food-items and other robots. Distinction between the three basic objects was achieved in the following way: When the standard IR sensors detected the presence of an object, the robot made two additional readings: floor reflection and optical barrier status. If the floor reflection was low, signalling black painting, the robot was near a wall. An unbroken optical barrier indicated that another robot -the only object high enough to reflect its beam -was facing the robot. If the floor reflection was high (absence of black painting), and the optical barrier was broken (absence of other robots), the robot was facing a food-item. The programs used to detect the three basic objects were run continuously and in parallel, occasional misinterpretations were usually resolved by the frequent double-check procedures included in the program.</p><p>The radio module is a standard Khepera turret using a low power 418 MHz transceiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A communication protocol allows complete control of the robot's functionality through an RS232 serial line.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Control architecture</head><p>Goal of the robots' control architecture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>) was to achieve the desired functionality by the proper connection of the three units: Sensory, Motor and Processing unit. It can be considered as a black box and does not claim any biological relevance to social insects.</p><p>The Sensory unit took measurements in the environment and sent associated signals to the Processing unit. Apart from the sensors described in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, the robot also received sensory feed-back from its own motor actions through incremental encoders for the wheel motors, and potentiometers for the arm and gripper. The Motor unit executed the commands sent by the Processing unit. Four different motors were addressed: left wheel, right wheel, gripper's arm and gripper itself. Motor actions were associated with an energetic cost -purely mathematical -which was subtracted from the robot's energy  level (physiology). The Processing unit consisted of two parts, the Decision unit for activating and deactivating small programs, and the programs themselves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>). The Decision unit receives inputs from three sources:</p><p>• the physiological variable set;</p><p>• the conceptual tags (= classified sensor inputs); • the drives.</p><p>The only physiological variable considered in our experiments was the robot's energy level, and the only drive used was hunger.</p><p>At anytime, depending on the inputs, the Decision unit decided to either activate or deactivate a program. For instance, when a robot had left the nest, the program "Follow nest tracks" was deactivated and "Search for food" was activated or when a robot reached the nest "Return to nest" was deactivated and "Follow nest tracks" was activated. The programs themselves had one or several inputs and generated a corresponding output (for details, see below). Once a program was activated, it ran concurrently with all other activated programs until deactivated (this is facilitated by the multi-tasking capabilities of the Kheperas). Some programs had a higher priority and under certain conditions could override other running programs. The programs were categorised into four distinct classes depending from which unit they received their inputs and to which unit they sent their outputs. 1. Input: Sensory unit, output: Processing unit ("Perception") These programs classified the inputs they received from the Sensory unit into conceptual tags like "obstacle", "dark floor" or "object in the gripper". Each conceptual tag was considered a user pre-defined concept. 2. Input: Processing unit, output: Processing unit ("Thoughts")</p><p>These programs received one or several conceptual tags as an input and generated another conceptual tag as an output. Example: When both the propositions "there is an obstacle" and "the floor is dark" are confirmed, the Processing unit generates the concept "wall". 3. Input: Processing unit, output: Motor unit ("Intentional Actions") These programs used conceptual tags from the Processing unit to engage specific motor actions. For example, after having positively checked the proposition "there is a food-item in the gripper", the robot closed its gripper and lift its arm to transport position. 4. Input: Sensory unit, output: Motor unit ("Reflexes") Reflexes were programs which had to be executed fast. They received inputs directly from the Sensory unit and generated immediate motor action. No concepts were generated. Example: The obstacle avoidance routine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>Our experiments showed that an artificial, complex system can be regulated using a simple activation-threshold as the only control parameter. Nest-energy, the variable to be regulated, was stable and stayed in the experiments with the three, six and nine robot teams well above the activation-threshold of the robot with the lowest activation-threshold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>). Only in the experiments with the teams of 12 robots, a steady decrease in nest-energy was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>). Moreover, the activation-threshold allows shifting from a single individual to a multi-individual system without any additional changes. This mechanism has proven well adapted to task allocation in robot teams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Effect of group size and food distribution on performance</head><p>The effect of the group size and food distribution was tested using a 2-way ANOVA. The size of the robot team had a significant effect on their performance (2-way ANOVA, group size: df = 4,1, F = 4.72, P = 0.002). The relative performance, where the best robot team has a performance of 100%, was 88.9%, 99.5%, 100%, 91.5% and 91.6% for teams of one, three, six, nine and twelve robots, respectively. In both environments the one robot teams had the lowest performance whereas the three and the six robot teams had the highest performance. Performance among the groups of one, nine and twelve as well as between the groups of three and six was however, not significantly different (Fisher's PLSD, 5%). When the food-items were grouped in patches the robots had a significantly better performance (2-way ANOVA, food distribution: df = 4,1, F = 12.87, P &lt; 0.001). The relative decrease in performance in the environment with dispersed food-item was 7.7%. Yet the difference in performance among the various group sizes was different for the two food distributions. The relative increase in performance for robot teams of three and six was more pronounced in the environment with dispersed food-item distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. Performance relative to the one robot teams in an environment with clumped and a dispersed food distribution with no information sharing. Performance was measured as the inverse of the total energy used and the normalised for the number of robots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Effect of information sharing and group size on performance</head><p>When the location of the food patches were transmitted by recruiting and guiding a team member to the patch, the performance of the group increased significantly (2-way ANOVA, information sharing: df = 3,1, F = 39.93, P &lt; 0.001). The increase in performance was 13%. Again, group size had a significant effect on performance (2-way ANOVA, group size: df = 3,1, F = 6.87, P &lt; 0.001) with the best performance in the three and the six robot teams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Interferences in an environment with clumped food-item distribution</head><p>Interferences among robots was defined whenever a robot tried to perform a task, but was hindered by another robot. The proportion of time spent in such interferences increased significantly with increasing group size (2-way ANOVA, group size: df = 3,1, F = 6.33, P = 0.003). The mean proportion of time spent in an interference was 0.4%, 0.6%, 1.0%, 2.3% for teams of three, six, nine and twelve robots, respectively. However, a post hoc analyses revealed (Fisher's PLSD, 5%) that only the twelve robot team spent significantly more time in interferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Effect of group size and food distribution on robustness</head><p>The size of the robot team had a significant effect on the minimal nest-energy recorded (2-way ANOVA, group size: df = 4,1, F = 5.41, P &lt; 0.001). Groups with a larger number of robots had a higher minimal nest-energy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">13</ref>). Except for the twelve robot team, which had a higher minimal nest-energy than the minimal nest-energy recorded for one robot team but a lower compared to all other group sizes. The effect of the food distribution on the minimal nest-energy recorded was not significant (2-way ANOVA, food distribution: df = 4,1, F = 3.18, P = 0.079). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Effect of information sharing and group size on robustness</head><p>Information sharing had a positive effect on the robustness of the robot teams. The minimal nest-energy recorded during the experiment was higher in teams with information sharing, with an average of 2147 and 1870 in the experiments with and without information sharing, respectively. This difference was highly significant (2-way ANOVA, information sharing: df = 3,1, F = 11.77, P = 0.001). Again, groups with a larger number of robots had higher minimal nest-energies with the exception of the twelve robot teams (2-way ANOVA, group size: df = 3,1, F = 3.10, P = 0.034).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Work skew among the robots</head><p>Due to their different activation-thresholds, the robots spent unequal amounts of time in the active foraging state. This skew in activity among the team members was expressed using the skew index. Larger groups had better share-out of their work load indicated by the mean work skew of 0.370, 0.345, 0.197 and 0.172 for the three, six, nine and twelve robot teams, respectively. This difference in work skew among the teams of different group sizes was significant (2-way ANOVA, group size: df = 3,1, F = 13.03, P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, information sharing had no significant effect on the work skew (2-way ANOVA, information sharing: df = 3,1, F = 0.421, P = 0.519).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Time active</head><p>Information sharing decreased significantly the total time the robots spent in the active (working) state (2-way ANOVA, information sharing: df = 3,1, F = 6.86, P = 0.009). Robots with information sharing spent on average 48% of their time in an active state whereas the robots without information sharing 56%. However, this was not true for all team members (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">14</ref>). When the robots were categorised according to their activation-threshold into three threshold classes (high, middle and low) the robots with the lowest thresholds spent significantly more time in the active state as the robots of the same threshold class with no information sharing (ANOVA, df = 1, F = 4.76, P = 0.031). This was due to recruitment from other team members when inactive in the nest. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Threshold control</head><p>During our experiments the nest-energy never decreased below zero. This held under a variety of different experimental settings such as various group sizes, different food distributions and presence or absence of information sharing. This result suggests that complex systems as our artificial ant colony can be regulated with a single control parameter in a decentralised way; it also indicates that this mode of task allocation can be favourably used in practical robotics.</p><p>Apart from its efficiency and simplicity, the activation-threshold mechanism presents a second advantage: it allows to control single as well as groups of robots. Simply choosing a different activation-threshold for each robot results in an automatic adjustment in number of active robots to the current work load. This has positive implications for future robot applications. Imagine a system where several robots could work collectively on a given task. Due to financial or other reasons, only one robot is engaged at the beginning. Later, when more robots are added to the system, no special arrangements beside choosing different activation-thresholds have to be made to move from a single to a multi-robot system. Likewise, when the number of robots is reduced either by individual failures or by allocation of some robots to other work areas, no changes have to be made in the control program of the robots. This might even represent a more substantial advantage since robot teams could be left unsupervised, individual breakdowns having little effect on such a coordination scheme.</p><p>As already mentioned, the individual activationthresholds were equidistributed between a lower and an upper value. Using other distributions between these two limits might modify the regulatory characteristics of the mechanism. Although we did not pursue the experiments in this direction, we speculate that any reasonable distribution of activation-thresholds would yield equivalent results. There is no reason to consider equidistribution best; we chose it for its simplicity. Also, on account of the noisy context of practical robotics, the exact values of activation-thresholds are but of minor interest. Among other possible activation-threshold distributions, the random distribution is of special interest since there is no need to preset the thresholds by an operator. In our experiments, we had to preset a specific activation-threshold for each robot at the beginning of the experiments. In contrast, a random distribution of activation-thresholds would allow to fix a same lower and upper limit for all robots from which each robot draws individually its activation-threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Performance</head><p>The size of the robot team had a significant effect on their performance, with teams of three and six performing better than single robots or larger groups. This finding is caused by a trade-off between the positive and the negative effects of robot-robot interactions. Robots were programmed to avoid each other which results in better coverage of the foraging arena when several robots are present. This is because each robot will avoid an area where another robot is already foraging. This effect caused single robots to perform less efficiently than small groups of robots. However, when the number of robots increases, those robot-robot encounters have also negative consequences. First, robots avoided more often areas with food-items because on average more robots were already present at locations with food-items. This was especially important in the environment where the food-items were grouped in patches. Secondly, robots seized simultaneously the same food-item more often, causing one of the robots to leave empty handed. Finally, larger groups spent more time in interferences at the entrance or inside the nest (see also <ref type="bibr">Section 4.3)</ref>. Thus, single robots could not benefit from the positive effect of robot-robot interactions found in small groups, whereas in large groups the negative effect of the robot-robot interactions overthrew the positive ones.</p><p>A second result was that the optimal group size was different for each of the two food distributions. This suggests that under some environmental conditions the benefit of living in group of a particular size is large whereas under other conditions the benefit is modest. Observed animal groups' sizes, which are assumed to have evolved and optimised, can be correlated to ecological factors (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>). Furthermore, the relative increase or decrease in performance from one group size to another was different in the two environments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>). For example the decrease in performance from a six to a nine robot team was large with the dispersed food distribution but relative small with the clumped food distribution. This indicates that under some ecological conditions, a change in group size is very likely to happen whereas under other conditions this shift is unlikely to occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Robustness</head><p>The risk of mission failure was measured as the minimal nest-energy recorded during the experiments, since a nest-energy below zero would have ended the experiment. Our results show that the larger the size of the team, the lower the risk of mission failure. This result holds for all group sizes with the exception of the twelve robot team. The twelve robot team had a lower risk than the one robot team but a higher risk than the three, six and nine robot teams (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">13</ref>). The risk of mission failure however, should not be confounded with the performance of the system. Performance was measured as the inverse of the total energy used and hence measures the teams' efficiency of accomplishing the task (keeping the nest-energy at a safe level). In contrast, the risk of mission failure indicates how close the system was to a nest-energy of zero anytime during the experiment. The apparent contradictory result of the three and six robot team having the best performance but not the lowest risk of mission failure stems from the fact that smaller teams' nest energies fluctuate more widely.</p><p>In the experiments with groups of three, six and nine robots, the nest-energy usually stayed above the lowest activation-threshold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>). As a result, at least one of the robot was still inactive in the nest and hence, the system did not reach its full capacity. A different picture emerged in the experiments with twelve robots. Even if the final nest-energy never fell under half the initial nest-energy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11 (a)</ref>), the energy curve showed in all three experimental set-ups a tendency to steadily decrease. This suggests that in longer experiments the nest-energy would have reached zero and hence the system would have crashed. From our observations it was the interferences between the robots that made the system less effective. Indeed, a detailed analysis of the robot's behaviour in the patchy environment (with and without information sharing) revealed that the time spent in interferences increased with increasing group size. This shows that a given experimental set-up (size of the environment, number of food-items) supports only a limited number of robots, around 12 with the mission we chose for our experiments. This is similar to a phenomenon found in ecology termed carrying capacity, which is defined as the maximum population size that can be supported by a given environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Information sharing</head><p>Sharing the information of the location of the food patches by recruitment had a positive effect on performance, resting time and robustness. The increased performance was due to the fact that not all robots had to search for their own food patch, which resulted on average in more efficient food retrievals. Thus, the robot teams needed less time to maintain the nest-energy. However, this was not the case for all team members. The robots with a low activation-threshold had to work significantly more under this scheme since they were more likely to be recruited for work when inactive in the nest. This phenomenon is useful since it allows teams organised with gradual activation-thresholds to distribute the work load more evenly among their members.</p><p>The increased robustness originated from the early recruitment of inactive robots. In the experiments without recruitment the robots left the nest only when the nest-energy was below their personal activation-threshold. This mechanism caused a large delay between the signal (low nest-energy) and the response (retrieving a food-item) which in turn resulted in greater fluctuation of the nest-energy. This delay was much smaller in the experiments with recruitment since some robots became already active (by recruitment) at nest energies where they normally would have stayed inactive in the nest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Scaling up</head><p>As mentioned above (Section 2.3) information exchange by tandem recruitment scales up easily with the number of robots. The same holds for the fixed-threshold dynamical task allocation, especially if the activation-thresholds are drawn randomly between two preset limits. Whether the number of activities scales up as easily as the tandem recruitment and the activation-thresholds remains to be investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Why not settle for a simulation?</head><p>Demonstrating by simulation that a fixed activationthreshold mechanism can properly regulate teams of simulated robots is not enough for practical robotics. Computer simulation is a powerful and essential tool for robotics. Still there is no warranty that an algorithm tested with simulation will work practically with robots. First, real robot-robot and robot-environment interactions are more complex and unpredictable than their simulation. Secondly, a real environment, however simple, is subjected to its own dynamics and puts the robots up to a set of constraints usually impossible to list and model. Sometimes, especially when the robot's activities are restricted to moving on a smooth surface, simulation yields excellent results. But as soon as the interactions between robots and their environment increase, for instance when the robots seize objects or when the lighting conditions are not constant, practical experiments rapidly diverge from their simulations. Even if not mentioned by technical articles, nor seen on videos, autonomous robotics experiments are frequently marked by technical problems. Only mechanisms proven effective in such difficult environments should be considered. The ultimate test, in experimental robotics, is the practical test. In addition, experimentation is rich in unanticipated interactions which will not occur in simulations, most of them negative, some of them positive. The latter can prove useful enough to be integrated into the mission's strategy. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">7</ref> However, it should be mentioned that exploitable unexpected phenomena remain rare. Emergences -their noblest variety -do not pop up on request.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Related work</head><p>In her seminal work, Parker <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> studied dynamical task allocation in a group of robots whose mission was to collect pucks in an arena. To choose between the various tasks involved in their mission, the robots consulted their individual "motivation" which integrated five factors: sensory feedback, inter-robot communication, inhibitory feedback from other active behaviours, robot impatience and robot acquiescence. This general purpose architecture, called ALLIANCE, lends itself to many variations since every motivation factor may be further developed including learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In our research, we took a more restrictive approach, using the simplest possible mechanism to achieve task allocation. The mechanism we propose functions with a single parameter, the activation-threshold. The only broadcasted information used by our robots was the periodical update of the nest's energy.</p><p>The question of labour division in collective robotics <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">8</ref> was also studied by Schneider-Fontan and Mataric <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> who engaged two, three and four robots in an arena divided in as many equally-sized contiguous regions. Each robot is territorially attached to region i, where it collects and carries the pucks to region i-1, where robot i-1 will then transport them to region i-2, and so on. Eventually, the pucks reach region 1 where robot 1 will carry them to their final destination, a spot in region 1. The goal of this mission was to clean all regions of their pucks and move them all to their final destination (a spot in region 1). The authors compare the efficiency of accomplishing this task in relation to the different group sizes used in their experiments. Their best results were achieved with three robots, which shows "that increased group sizes can, in embodied agents, negatively impact the effectiveness of the territorial solution". We witnessed a similar phenomenon in our experiments: the best results were achieved with intermediate team sizes. Territoriality, which "produces a physical division of space and all associated resources", seems to be an effective way to reduce interferences between robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>From the robotics point of view, we demonstrated that dispersing the individual activation-thresholds of robots is an efficient way of allocating tasks in teams of real robots.</p><p>From the biological point of view, we demonstrated that complex social systems can be regulated in decentralised way. This adds further evidence to the hypothesis that social insect colonies are regulated in a self-organised manner. Moreover, groups of three and six robot teams had a better performance than a single robot illustrating that a transition from a solitary individual to a social group would have been favoured in our experimental set-up. Even though the relative advantage of a given group size depends entirely on the system we demonstrated that there are favourable conditions where such a transition is possible.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
