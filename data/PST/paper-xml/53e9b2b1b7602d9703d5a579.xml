<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1I ntroduction</head><p>The concept of goal has been used in manya reas of Computer Science for quite some time. In AI, goals have been used in planning to described esirable states of the world since the 60s <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. In AI planning problems, an agenti sg iven a description of the environmenta nd as et of admissible actions, and searches for a plan -i.e., asequence of actions and intermediate sub-goals-whichallows for achieving afinal goal from agiven initial state. Very efficientplanning algorithms and tools, including those based on graph-based planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and on SATc onversions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have been conceived (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> for an overview). More recently, goals have been used in Software Engineering to model (early) requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and non-functional requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for as oftware system. Fori nstance, an early requirementf or al ibrary information system mightb e" Every bookr equest wille ventually be fulfilled ", while " The new system willb eh ighly reliable" is an example of an on-functional requirement. Goals are also useful for knowledge managements ystems whichf ocus on strategic knowledge, e.g., " Increase profits", or " Become the largest auto manufacturer in North America " <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[ 7]</ref>.</p><p>Traditional goal analysis consists of decomposing goals into subgoals through an AND-or OR-decomposition. If goal Gi sA ND-decomposed (respectively, OR-decomposed) into subgoals G 1 ,G 2 ,...,G n ,t hen if all (at least one) of the subgoals are satisfied so is goal G. Given ag oal model consisting of goals and AND/OR relationships among them, and as et of initial labels for some nodes of the graph (S for Satisfied, Df or Denied) there is as imple label propagation algorithm whichc an generate labels for all other nodes of the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately,this simple framework for modeling and analyzing goals won't work for manyd omains where goals are not formalizable and the relationships among them can't be captured by semantically well-defined relations sucha s AND/OR ones. Forexample, goals suchas"Highly reliable system"have no formally defined predicate whichp rescribes their meaning, though one mayw ant to define necessary conditions for suchag oal to be satisfied. Moreover, such ag oal mayb er elated to other goals, sucha s" Thoroughly debuggeds ystem", " Thoroughly testeds ystem"i nt he sense that the latter obviously contribute to the satisfaction of the former, but this contribution is partial and qualitative. In other words, if the latter goals are satisfied, they certainly contribute to the satisfaction of the former goal, but don't guarantee its satisfaction. This framework will also not work in situations where there are contradictory contributions to ag oal. Fori nstance, we mayw antt oa llowf or multiple decompositions of a goal Gi ntos ets of subgoals, where some decompositions suggest satisfaction of Gw hile others suggest denial.</p><p>We are interested in amodeling framework for goals whichincludes AND/OR relationships among goals, but also allows for other, more qualitativeg oal relationships and can accommodate contradictory situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>. We accomplish this by introducing goal relationships labelled "+" and "-" whichm odel respectively as ituation where ag oal contributes positively or negatively towards the satisfaction of another goal.</p><p>Amajor problem that arises from this extension is giving aprecise semantics to the new goal relationships. This is accomplished in two differentw aysi nt his paper. In section 3w eo ffer aq ualitativef ormalization and al abel propagation algorithm whichi ss hown to be sound and complete with respect to the formalization. In section 4, we offer aq uantitatives emantics for the new relationships whichisbased on aprobabilistic model, and alabel propagation algorithm that is also shown to be sound and complete. Section 5presents experimental results on our label propagation algorithms using medium-to large-size goal models, while section 6s ummarizes the contributions of the paper and sketches directions for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2A nE xample</head><p>Suppose we are modeling the strategic objectives of aUScar manufacturer, such as Ford or GM. Examples of sucho bjectives are increase return on investment or increase customer loyalty .O bjectives can be represented as goals, and can be analyzed using goal relationships sucha sA ND, OR, "+" and " -". In addition, 2P. Giorgini et al. we will use "++" (respectively " --") as ab inary goal relationship sucht hat if ++(G,G') ( --(G,G')) then satisfaction of Gi mplies satisfaction (denial) of G'.</p><p>Fori nstance, increase return on investment mayb eA ND-decomposed into increase sales volume and increase profit pervehicle.Likewise, increase sales volume mightbeOR-decomposed into increase consumer appeal and expand markets.This decomposition and refinemento fg oals can continue until we have goals that are tangible (i.e., someone can satisfy them through an appropriate course of action) and/or are observable (i.e., they can be confirmed satisfied/denied by simply observing the application domain).</p><p>Forv aguely stated goals, sucha s increase customer loyalty we mayw antt o simply model other relevantgoals, suchas improve carquality , improve carservice and relate them through "+" and " -"relationships, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. These goals mayi nfluence positively or negatively some of the goals that have already been introduced during the analysis of the goal increase return on investment. Suchl ateral goal relationships mayi ntroduce cycles in our goal models.</p><p>Examples of observable goals are Yenr ises, gas prices rise etc. When sucha goal is satisfied, we will call it an event (the kind of eventy ou mayr ead about in an ews story) and representi ti no ur graphical notation as ar ectangle (see lowerp ortion of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1shows</ref> apartial and fictitious goal model for GM focusing on the goal increase return of investment.Inorder to increase return of investment,GMhas to satisfy both goals increase sales and increase profit perv ehicle.I nt urn, increase sales volume is OR-decomposed into increase consumer appeal and expand markets, while the goal increase profit perv ehicle is OR-decomposed into increase sales price, lowerp roduction costs, increase foreign earnings,a nd increase high margin sales.A dditional decompositions are shown in the figure. Fori nstance, the goal increase consumer appeal can be satisfied by satisfying lowere nvironment impact, trying to lowerp urchase costs,o rr educing the vehicle operating costs ( reduce operating costs).</p><p>The graph shows also lateral relationships among goals. Fore xample, the goal increase customer loyalty has positive( +) contributions from goals lower environment impact, improve carq uality and improve cars ervices,w hile it has a negative( -)c ontribution from increase sales price.T he root goal increase return on investment (GM) is also related to goals concerning others auto manufacturer, sucha sT oyota and VW. In particular, if GM increases sales, then Toyota loses as hare of the North American market; if Toyota increases sales (increase Toyota sales), it does so at the expense of VW; finally,i fV Wi ncreases sales ( increase VW sales), it does so at the expense of GM. These lateral contributions introduce ac ycle in the GM goal model.</p><p>So far, we have assumed that every goal relationship treats Sa nd Di na dual fashion. Fori nstance, if we have +(G,G'), then if Gi ss atisfied, G' is partially satisfied, and (dually) if Gi sd enied G' is partially denied. Note however, that sometimes ag oal relationship only applies for S( or D). In particular, the -c ontribution from increase sales (GM) to increase sales (Toyota) only applies when increase sales (GM) is satisfied (i.e., if GM hasn't increased sales, this doesn't mean that Toyota has.) To capture this kind of relationship, we introduce -S , -D ,+ S ,+ D (see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Details about the semantics of these relationships are given in the next section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Label Propagation Algorithm</head><p>Based on the logic framework of Section 3.1, we have developed an algorithm for propagating through a goal graph G, R labels representing evidence for</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">( G 2 ,G3 ) and -→ G 1 G 2 + S -→ G 1 G 2 -S -→ G 1 G 2 ++ S -→ G 1 G 2 --S -→ G 1 Sat ( G 1 ) min Sat ( G 2 ) , Sat ( G 3 ) min Sat ( G 2 ) , P N Sat ( G 2 ) N Den ( G 1 ) max Den ( G 2 ) , Den ( G 3 ) N min Sat ( G 2 ) , P N Sat ( G 2 ) ( G 2 ,G3 ) or -→ G 1 G 2 + D -→ G 1 G 2 -D -→ G 1 G 2 ++ D -→ G 1 G 2 --D -→ G 1 Sat ( G 1 ) max Sat ( G 2 ) , Sat ( G 3 ) N min Den ( G 2 ) , P N Den ( G 2 ) Den ( G 1 ) min Den ( G 2 ) , Den ( G 3 ) min Den ( G 2 ) , P N Den ( G 2 ) N</formula><p>the satisfiability and deniability of goals. To each node G ∈G we associate two variables Sat ( G ) ,Den( G ) ranging in { F, P, N } (full, partial, none) such that F &gt; P &gt; N , representing the current evidence of satisfiability and deniability of goal G . For example, Sat ( G i ) ≥ P states that there is at least partial evidence that G i is satisfiable. Starting from assigning an initial set of input values for Sat ( G i ), Den ( G i ) to (a subset of) the goals in G , we propagate the values through the goal relations in R according to the propagation rules of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The schema of the algorithm is described in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>. Initial, Current and Old are arrays of |G| pairs Sat ( G i ) ,Den( G i ) , one for each G i ∈G, representing respectively the initial, current and previous labeling states of the graph. We call the pair Sat ( G i ) ,Den( G i ) a label for G i . Notationally, if W is an array of labels Sat ( G i ) ,Den( G i ) , by W [ i ] .sat and W [ i ] .den we denote the first and second field of the i th label of W .</p><p>The array Current is first initialized to the initial values Initial given as input by the user. At each step, for every goal G i , Sat ( G i ) ,Den( G i ) is updated by propagating the values of the previous step. This is done until a fixpoint is reached, in the sense that no further updating is possible ( Current == Old ).</p><p>The updating of Sat ( G i ) ,Den( G i ) works as follows. For each relation R j incoming in G i , the satisfiability and deniability values sat ij and den ij derived from the old values of the source goals are computed by applying the rules of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The result is compared with the old value, and the maximum is returned as new value for G i .</p></div>

Fori nstance, when we have G 2 + S -→ G 1 , from PS( G 2 ) we can deduce PS( G 1 ), whilst one may argue that the satisfiability of G 1 is in some way less evident than that of G 2 . For example, in the goal graph of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the satisfaction of the goal lower environment impact may not necessarily imply satisfaction of increase customer loyalty , so it may be reasonable to assume "less evidence" for the satisfaction of the latter compared to the former.

For each experiment, we assigned a set of labels to some of the goals and events of the auto manufacturer graph (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and see their consequences for other nodes. The label propagation algorithm reached a steady state after at most five iterations.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> reports the results of four different experiments (Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4).</p><p>For each goal/event, the table shows the initial (Init) label assignment to the variables S and D, also their final (Fin) value after label propagation. For instance, in the first experiment, the initial assignment for the goal expand markets is S=P and D=N, while the final values for increase return on investment (GM) are S=N and D=P.</p><p>In the first experiment, we start with goals lower environment impact, improve mileage and lower sales price totally satisfied (S=F), goals expand markets and offer rebates partially satisfied (S=P), goals increase foreign earnings and keep labour costs low totally denied (D=F), and goals increase sales price and increase high margin sales partially denied (D=P). The propagation of such values produces a final state in which the main goal increase return on investment (GM) is partially denied.</p><p>In the second experiment we start with the same initial assignment of the first experiment, except that the event Yen rises is now totally satisfied. As reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, this new assignment produces a different result for the root goal. Now, it is both partially satisfied and partially denied, namely we have a contradiction. Since the analysis is qualitative, it is not possible to distinguish between the two values S=P and D=P and we cannot say anything about this contradiction.</p><p>For the third experiment, we assume that goals keep labour costs low and reduce raw material costs are totally satisfied. This new assignment produce a contradiction for the root goal (totally satisfied and partially denied). Unlike from the previous experiment, we have now more evidence for the satisfaction of this goal, rather than its denial.</p><p>Finally, in the fourth experiment, though goals increase Toyota sales and increase VW sales are totally satisfied, for the root goal we still have the same contradictory result.
