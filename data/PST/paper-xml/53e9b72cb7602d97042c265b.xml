<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) are used in computer science to design algorithms for estimating the size of large combinatorially defined structures. In statistical physics, they are used to study the behavior of idealized models of physical systems in equilibrium. In the latter case, the models of interest are usually defined on regular, finite-dimensional structures such as the hypercubic lattice Z d . In both applications, it is necessary to run the chain, M, until it is close enough to its steady state. Thus it is important to design rapidly mixing algorithms, i.e. algorithms for which the mixing time, τ M , is small.</p><p>In this paper, we study two statistical physics models, the q-state Potts model and the independent set problem. We consider these models on the graphs on which they are most often studied in physical applications, namely on subsets of Z d . For the Potts model, we study two types of Monte Carlo Markov chains -Glauber dynamics, and the empirically more rapid Swendsen-Wang dynamics.</p><p>Both the Potts model and the independent set model are characterized by non-negative parameters, the former by a so-called inverse temperature β, and the latter by a so-called fugacity λ (see definitions below). Both models are known to undergo phase transitions from a so-called disordered phase with a unique equilibrium state to an ordered phase with multiple equilibrium states. Due to the multiple states, the ordered phase is also known as the region of phase coexistence.</p><p>The point of this work is to relate the mixing times of the MCMCs to the phase structures of the underlying equilibrium models. In particular, we show that Glauber dynamics is slow, or torpid, for both models in their regions of phase coexistence, while Swendsen-Wang for the Potts model is torpid at the phase transition point. This latter result has apparently come as a surprise to some physicists who use the Swendsen-Wang algorithm to simulate the Potts model, and who have tacitly assumed that it mixes rapidly for all values of the inverse temperature.</p><p>In addition to this "physically surprising" result, our work is new in a number of respects. While there has recently been a good deal of work in the theoretical CS community on slowness of Swendsen-Wang dynamics for the Potts model (see citations below), this is one of the first works to consider the physically relevant case of the hypercubic lattice Γ d = Z d and finite portions thereof. (In Γ d , two lattice points are joined by an edge if they differ by 1 in one coordinate.) From a technical point of view, the hypercubic lattice is much more challenging than the complete graph. However, these technical difficulties give us the opportunity to use some beautiful and deep results. In particular, our work brings to bear, and to some extent extends, statistical physics expansion techniques for the problem of controlling the number of cutsets in graphical expansions of these models. Specifically, we use so-called Pirogov-Sinai theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> from the statistical physics literature, in the form adapted to the Potts model by Borgs, Koteck ý and Miracle-Sole ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). We also use the new and powerful combinatoric estimates of Lebowitz and Mazel <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> for controlling the number of cutsets. Finally, we use the lovely isoperimetric inequalities of Bollobás and Leader <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In this introduction, we will first describe our work on MCMC for the Potts model, and then for the independent set problem.</p><p>The q-state Potts Model (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>) on an arbitrary graph G = (V, E), |V | = n is defined as follows: a coloring σ is a map from V → [q] = {1, 2, . . . , q}. Let D(σ) be the set of edges with endpoints of a different color and let d(σ) = |D(σ)|. The weight of a coloring w(σ) is e -βd(σ) . We turn this into a probability distribution µ by normalizing with the partition function Z = σ w(σ). To study this model empirically, one needs to be able to generate σ with probability (close to)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">µ(σ) = w(σ) Z .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The model is said to be ferromagnetic if β ≥ 0, otherwise it is anti-ferromagnetic. Note that β = -∞ corresponds to random proper colorings. The widely used Swendsen-Wang algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> for the ferromagnetic model uses a Markov chain with state space [q] V which has steady state µ -see Section 3. Gore and Jerrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> proved that on the complete graph K n with q ≥ 3, there is a certain value of β (inverse temperature) such that the mixing time of the algorithm is exponential in n. Jerrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> has coined the phrase torpid mixing to describe this phenomenon. Cooper and Frieze <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> extended their arguments to show that in the Potts model on the random graph G n,p , this phenomenon persists with high probability for p = Ω(n -1/3 ). Li and Sokal <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> proved a linear (in the number of sites) lower bound for finite boxes in Z d . (For positive results on this algorithm see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Cooper, Dyer, Frieze and Rue <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Huber <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, Martinelli <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.)</p><p>Our first result concerns this algorithm and the simpler Glauber dynamics -see Section 3. Let T = T L,d = (Z/LZ) d be the d-dimensional torus of side L. We view this as a graph where two points are connected by an edge if they differ by 1 (mod L) in one component. It has vertex set V = V L,d and edge set E = E L,d . Using the results of Borgs, Kotecký and Miracle-Solé <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we prove the following negative result: Theorem 1 For d ≥ 2 and sufficiently large q, there exists for some absolute constant K 2 &gt; 0.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">β c = β c (q, d) such that: (a)</formula><p>For an arbitrary graph G = (V, E), an independent set is a set of vertices I ⊂ V such that no pair of vertices i, j ∈ I is incident to the same edge e ∈ E. Dyer, Frieze and Jerrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> considered the problem of generating a nearly random independent set of a bipartite graph. They prove that Glauber dynamics exhibits torpid mixing on almost all regular graphs of degree 6 or more and that the problem is NPhard for regular graphs of degree 25 or more. In statistical physics, the independent set problem is called the hard-core gas model. In general there is a parameter λ &gt; 0 called the fugacity and one wants to generate independent sets I with probability proportional to λ |I| i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">µ(I) = λ |I| J independent λ |J| .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Our second result concerns this problem. The Glauber dynamics chain is a simple chain on the independent sets of graph G that selects a random vertex and adds/deletes it to/from the current independent set with some probability dependent on λ -see Section 3. Dyer and Greenhill <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, Luby and Vigoda <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> have proved that this chain is rapidly mixing for λ &lt; 2 ∆-2 , where ∆ denotes the maximum degree of G.</p><p>We also prove bounds on more general Markov chains. To define this class, let I, I be independent sets, and let D(I, I ) = |I \ I | + |I \ I|. For an ergodic Markov chain M L on T L,d , let D ML be the maximum of D(I, I ) over all I and I for which the transition probability is non-zero. We say that M L is local if D ML is bounded uniformly in L, and we say that it is ρ-quasi-local if D ML ≤ ρL d for some ρ &lt; 1 which is independent of L.</p><p>Theorem 2 For d ≥ 2 and λ sufficiently large, the mixing time τ GD of the Glauber chain on T L,d satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">τ GD ≥ e K3L d-1 /(log L) 2</formula><p>for some constant K 3 &gt; 0 depending only on the dimension d. More generally, let τ L be the mixing time for any ergodic Markov chain on T L,d which is ρ-quasi-local for some ρ &lt; 1. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">τ L ≥ e K4L d-1 /(log L) 2</formula><p>for some constant K 4 depending only on d and ρ.</p><p>Finally, we want to point out that our techniques for proving slow mixing are quite robust, and can be applied to many models exhibiting the phenomenon of phase coexistence. All that we require is that the equilibrium model have energy barriers between different phases that is high enough to apply the techniques of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and that the dynamics is not sufficiently global to permit jumps over these barriers. (An example of a Markov chain which "jumps over" energy barriers is the Swendsen-Wang algorithm at temperatures below the transition temperature.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Mixing Time</head><p>Let M be an ergodic Markov chain on a finite state space Ω, with transition probabilities P (x, y), x, y ∈ Ω.

It is therefore both necessary and sufficient that chains be run for some multiple of mixing time in order to get a sample which is close to a sample from the steady state. For our purposes, the Swendsen-Wang algorithm is rapidly mixing if its mixing time τ SW is bounded by a polynomial in n, the number of vertices of G. Similarly for the Glauber chain.</p><p>Jerrum and Sinclair <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> introduced the notion of conductance to the study of finite time reversible Markov chains. A chain is reversible if it satisfies the detailed balance equations: π(x)P (x, y) = π(y)P (y, x), for all x, y ∈ Ω.</p><p>Putting Q(x, y) = π(x)P (x, y) and Q(A, B) = (x,y)∈A×B Q(x, y), we define the conductance of a set of states ∅ = S ⊂ Ω as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Φ S = Q(S, S) π(S)π( S) where S = Ω \ S.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The conductance Φ M of the chain itself is simply min S =∅ Φ S .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MCMC Algorithms</head><p>There are several MCMC algorithms that are used to generate a random sample from these distributions corresponding to the hard-core model and ferromagnetic Potts model. The Glauber dynamics is perhaps the simplest such Markov chain. Its transitions are as follows: Choose a vertex at random, and modify the spin of that vertex by choosing from the distribution conditional on the spins of the other vertices remaining the same. We will detail the algorithm for the hard-core model on independent sets. Glauber Dynamics: From an independent set σ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">G1 Choose v uniformly at random from V .

The relationship between the two models is elucidated in a paper by Edwards and Sokal <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.

Applying the previous lemma, we have three cases:  In the following, we will call cutsets with one cocomponent topologically trivial, and cutsets with more than one co-component topologically non-trivial. Small components which can be embedded in Z d give rise to cutsets with only a single co-component, which are therefore topologically trivial. Topologically non-trivial cutsets arise from certain components which are large enough to "feel" the non-trivial topology of the torus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof:</head><p>(a) This follows from the observation that the proofs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> may be applied without changes to the torus.</p><p>(b) We need some notation. Consider a set of edges X and its dual X * . Define the boundary ∂X * of X * as the set of (d -2)-dimensional hypercubes which belong to an odd number of (d -1)-dimensional cells in X * . If ∂X * = ∅, define the Z 2 winding vector of X * as the vector N(X * ) = (N 1 , . . . , N d ), where N i is the number of times X * intersects an elementary loop in the i th lattice direction mod 2.</p><p>Let X be a cutset, X = (W : W ), where W ⊂ V . Let W ⊂ (R/Z) d be the union of all closed unit cubes with center w ∈ W . Then X * is the boundary of the set W, and hence ∂X * = ∅. Obviously, each elementary loop must leave and enter the set W the same number of times, implying that the winding vector of X * is 0. On the other hand, it is not difficult to prove that each set of edges X with ∂X * = ∅ and N(X * ) = 0 is a cutset for some set of points W ⊂ V , X = (W : W ). Indeed, the assumptions ∂X * = ∅ and N(X * ) = 0 imply that every closed loop in T L,d intersects X * an even number of times. Considering an arbitrary vertex w 0 ∈ V and the set of all "walks" of the form (w 0 , w 1 , . . . , w k ), {w i , w i+1 } ∈ E L,d , we then define W as the set of points which can be reached from w 0 by a walk which intersects X * an odd number of times.</p><p>Consider now a non-trivial minimal cutset γ and one of its co-components γ. Since γ is a cutset, ∂γ * = ∅. This property is inherited by all its co-components, implying that ∂γ * = ∅. Obviously, N(γ * ) is different from zero, since otherwise γ would be a cutset itself, in contradiction to the assumption that γ is minimal. Let j be a direction for which N j (γ * ) = 0. Then γ * intersects any fundamental loop in the j-direction an odd number of times, giving that γ * contains at least L d-1 dual (d -1)-dimensional cells. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Independent Sets</head><p>In this section, we give a proof of Theorem 2. We start with some notation. For a bipartite graph G = (V, E) we arbitrarily call the vertices in one partition even, and those in the other partition odd. We write V even for the set of even vertices in V , and V odd for the set of odd vertices in V . We denote the collection of independent sets of G by Ω. Let I be an independent set in Ω. We then define W odd (I) as the set of vertices in or adjacent to a vertex in the set I ∩ V odd . Similarly W even (I) is defined for I ∩ V even . We define the set Γ odd (I) as the set of minimal cutsets corresponding to W odd (I), Γ odd (I) = Γ(W odd (I)), and similarly for the set Γ even (I).

On the graph Z d , d ≥ 2, this model is known to undergo a phase transition as the inverse temperature, β, passes through a certain critical temperature β c = β c (q, d).</p><p>To make this statement precise, we introduce finite-volume distributions with boundary conditions. We consider the graph G = (V, E), where V = [L] d and E consists of all pairs of vertices in V whose coordinates differ by 1 in one coordinate. We say that a vertex lies in the (inner) boundary of V if one of its coordinates is either 1 or L. For a coloring σ of V , we then introduce the weights w L,k (σ) = e -βd(σ)+βn k (σ) , where n k (σ) is the number of vertices in the boundary of V that have color k. With Z L,k = σ w L,k (σ), the finite-volume distributions µ L,k with boundary condition k are then defined as µ L,k (σ) = w L,k (σ)/Z L,k , and the spontaneous magnetization m * (β) is defined as the L → ∞ limit of the finite-volume magnetizations m L (β) = L -d x∈V (µ L,1 (σ x = 1) -1/q). The above-mentioned phase transition can then be characterized as a transition between a high-temperature, disordered region β &lt; β c where the spontaneous magnetization is zero, and a low-temperature, ordered region β &gt; β c where the spontaneous magnetization is positive.</p><p>As a first step towards proving Theorem 1, we define the contours corresponding to a configuration A ∈ Ω = 2 E . To this end, we embed the vertex set V of the torus T = (V, E) into the set V = (R/(LZ)) d . For a set X ⊂ V, we define its diameter diam(X) = inf y∈V sup x∈X dist(x, y), where dist(x, y) is the ∞ -distance between the two points x and y in the torus V. For an edge e = {x, y} ∈ E, let e be the set of points in V that lie on the line between x and y. Given A, we call a closed k-dimensional unit hypercube c ⊂ V with vertices in V occupied if all edges e with e ⊂ c are in A. We then define the set V(A) ⊂ V as the 1/3-neighbourhood of the union of all occupied kdimensional hypercubes, k = 1, . . . , d, i.e., V(A) = {x ∈ V : ∃c occupied, such that dist(x, c) &lt; 1/3}, and the set V (A) as the intersection of V(A) with the vertex set V of the discrete torus T . Note that V (A) = {x,y}∈A {x, y}. The set Γ(A) of contours corresponding to a configuration A ∈ Ω are then the components of the boundary of V(A).</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we decompose the set of configurations Ω into three sets Ω ord , Ω dis and Ω Big . To this end, we define a contour γ to be small if diam(γ) ≤ L/3. The set Ω Big is then just the set of configurations A ∈ Ω for which Γ(A) contains at least one contour that is not small. Next, restricting ourselves to small contours γ, we define the set Ext γ as the larger of the two components of V \ γ, the set Ext γ as the intersection of Ext γ with V , and the set Int γ as V \ Ext γ. For A ∈ Ω \ Ω Big , let Int A = γ∈Γ(A) Int γ and Ext A = V \ Int A.

Also, we define the size γ of a contour γ as the number of times γ intersects the set e∈E e. In order to motivate this definition, assume for a moment that the definition of the set V(A) had involved an -neighborhood, instead of the 1/3-neighborhood used above. With such a definition, the (d -1)-dimensional area of a contour γ would actually converge to γ as → 1/2.</p><p>Lemma 12 For all d ≥ 2 there are constants c &gt; 0 and q 0 &lt; ∞ such that the following statements hold for q ≥ q 0 .

Hence, there exists a unique D ∈ C(C ) such that C ⊂ D . For all D ∈ C(C), C ⊂ D. Therefore, if there exists a D ∈ C(C ) with D ⊂ D , D must be the unique component containing C. The uniqueness of D is proved similarly. Next, we prove existence. Let D be as above, so that D ⊂ C. Since C ∪ D is connected for all D ∈ C(C ), the set D = C ∪ {D ∈ C(C ) : D = D } is connected. As a consequence, D ⊂ C must lie in one of the components D of C. (b) Obviously, ∂C = ∪ γ∈ΓC is a decomposition of ∂C into minimal cutsets of G.

Together with X ⊂ Y , this implies X = Y in contradiction to our assumption X ∩ Y = ∅. (b) We consider two cases. Suppose that for every C ∈ C(W ) there is a cutset γ ∈ Γ(W ) with C ⊂ Int γ.

(In dimension d = 3, the twodimensional dual cells are referred to as plaquettes). We define a graph Γ * = (γ * , E * ) where γ * = {e * : e ∈ γ} and (e * 1 , e * 2 ) ∈ E * iff e * 1 ∩ e * 2 is a cube of dimension d -2. The components of Γ * are called the co-components of γ.

Thus an odd vertex v ∈ W odd (I) cannot be incident to an edge in ∂W odd (I). As a consequence, the vertices of V (γ) ∩ Int γ are even if (V (γ) ∩ Int γ) ⊆ W odd (I) and odd otherwise.

To complete our proof by estimating Φ S (see (3)) for S = Ω odd , first notice µ(S)µ(S) ≥ 1/5.
