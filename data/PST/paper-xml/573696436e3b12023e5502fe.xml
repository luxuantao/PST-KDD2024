<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>As a member of the single-radio-frequency (RF) large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) family, spatial modulation (SM) has been receiving significant attention recently due to its potential to strike an attractive tradeoff between the spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency of a wireless network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The basic idea of SM is to activate a subset of antennas to transmit information symbols and meanwhile use indices of the active antennas to implicitly convey information. SM is also well known for its special case, space shift keying (SSK), which transmits information by antenna activation only <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Several experimental studies have substantiated the potential benefits of SM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and it has been widely acknowledged that SM is an alternative to the well-known MIMO solutions, such as Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) and space-time coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is another promising technique, which has been already integrated into modern wireless communication standards, such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>OFDM is favorable for broadband wireless communications since it has high spectral efficiency and can effectively combat the intersymbol interference caused by the frequency-selective fading channel.</p><p>Attentive to the potential of SM and OFDM, researchers have devoted significant recent effort to their combination. Generally, these existing work can be classified into two categories. In the first category, SM is simply applied to OFDM transmission (SM-OFDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In particular, SM-OFDM groups the OFDM subcarriers occupying the same frequency band at all transmit antennas so that SM can operate on those subcarriers subject to independent fading due to sufficient spacing between antennas. Thereafter, all transmit antennas are activated to transmit the generated OFDM signals following the conventional MIMO-OFDM process. The performance of SM-OFDM has been theoretically studied and some positive results have been found <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In the second category, the principle of SM is extended to subcarrier activation in OFDM. The first scheme that exploited this idea was called subcarrier index modulation OFDM (SIM-OFDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In SIM-OFDM, half of the subcarriers are activated according to the incoming information bits and some other subcarriers are dedicated to signaling. However, SIM-OFDM assumes perfect detection of the signaling at the receivers and suffers from bit error propagation. To solve this problem, an enhanced SIM-OFDM (ESIM-OFDM) scheme was later proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Unlike SIM-OFDM, ESIM-OFDM uses one bit to control two adjacent subcarriers such that only one subcarrier is activated at a time. At the receiver, the detection of the state of any subcarrier can be easily accomplished by comparing the power with that of its adjacent subcarrier. However, the spectral efficiency of ESIM-OFDM tends to be much smaller than that of classical OFDM when a high-order modulation is assumed for the symbols carried on the active subcarriers since the number of active subcarriers is fixed. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> raised the idea of relaxing this limitation by allowing more subcarriers to be active.</p><p>Unfortunately, no further attempt at practical implementation has been found.</p><p>The aforementioned incomplete work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> was carried out independently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where the new scheme is named OFDM with index modulation (OFDM-IM). Specifically, to reduce the complexity lying in the selection of active subcarriers, the authors proposed an efficient one-to-one mapping that relates the incoming information bits with the active subcarrier indices based on combinatorial number theory. Moreover, a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) detector was also proposed to determine the active subcarriers and the modulated symbols, achieving not only near maximum likelihood (ML) performance but also identical computational complexity to that of the classical OFDM detector. More recently, further efforts on the theoretical analysis of the uncoded bit error rates (BERs) under perfect and imperfect channel estimation as well as the implementation of OFDM-IM with terminal mobility were made by the same authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> that since the transmit power of each active subcarrier is enhanced and the information bits conveyed by subcarrier activation can be used to compensate for the size of the signal constellation, OFDM-IM can achieve significantly better uncoded BER performance than classical OFDM.</p><p>The superior performance of OFDM-IM in terms of BER motivated our work. In this paper, we investigate the (ergodic) achievable rate of OFDM-IM assuming slowly varying Rayleigh fading channels and channel state information at the receiver (CSIR). We mainly focus on the analysis under an M -ary constellation constraint considering that a finite-alphabet input makes more practical sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and briefly study the asymptotic case in which the constellation size tends to infinity. A closed-form lower bound on the constellation-constrained achievable rate is derived, which tracks very well the trend of the exact values as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases and can be used to estimate many important parameters, such as the optimal number of (in)active subcarriers in maximizing the achievable rate.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TSP.2015.2500880, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing summarized as follows.</p><p>• We propose a new subcarrier grouping method for OFDM-IM, which applies interleaved mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The idea is motivated by the fact that interleaved grouping can better benefit from frequency-selective fading, which brings frequency diversity gain to OFDM-IM.</p><p>An analytical proof and numerical results are presented to validate the superiority of the interleaved grouping over the existing localized grouping. We find that OFDM-IM with interleaved grouping can achieve SNR gain over classical OFDM under a low-order alphabet input. This improvement, however, becomes smaller as the alphabet size gets larger and is even lost when it increases further.</p><p>• We investigate the achievable rate of OFDM-IM with subcarrier activation only, which is a special case of OFDM-IM. We show that since the coding gain from subcarrier activation cannot compensate for the loss of spectral efficiency, OFDM-IM with subcarrier activation only exhibits poor performance. We also discuss the effects of modulation types on the achievable rate of OFDM-IM. It is found that the superiority of OFDM-IM over classical OFDM is greater under phase-shift keying (PSK) input than under quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) input.</p><p>The rest of this paper is outlined as follows. Section II describes the system model for OFDM-IM. In Section III, the achievable rates of OFDM-IM under constellation constraint and Gaussian inputs are derived, followed by the discussion of OFDM-IM with subcarrier activation only.</p><p>Section IV proposes the interleaved grouping approach for OFDM-IM. Numerical results are presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.</p><p>Notation: Upper and lower case boldface letters denote matrices and column vectors, respectively.

SYSTEM MODEL Suppose that the system bandwidth is B T , which is occupied by a total of N OFDM subcarriers, i.e., the subcarrier spacing is B S = B T /N . In OFDM-IM, the N subcarriers are split into G = N/L groups, each of which consists of L subcarriers. For group g, the subcarrier indices are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ψ g = {β g 1 , . . . , β g L } (1)</formula><p>where β g l ∈ {1, . . . , N } with g = 1, . . . , G and l = 1, . . . , L. Note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Ψ g 1 ∩ Ψ g 2 = ∅ and Ψ 1 ∪ • • • ∪ Ψ G = {1, . . . , N }, where g 1 , g 2 ∈ {1, . . . , G} and g 1 ̸ = g 2 .</formula><p>It is assumed that both the transmitter and the receiver have agreed on the subcarrier grouping in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The reason why subcarrier grouping is employed in OFDM-IM will be clarified in the sequel. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> depicts the OFDM-IM baseband transmitter structure. The source bits are equally split into G blocks, each of which consists of two parts. The bits associated with bit block g determine the states of all subcarriers and modulate the symbols carried on the active subcarriers within subcarrier group g. Specifically, m out of L subcarriers within the subcarrier group are set to be inactive according to the bits of the first part and the remaining (L -m) subcarriers are activated to transmit (L -m) M -ary PSK/QAM modulated symbols according to the bits of the second part. Note that given L and m, there are in total C (L, m) combinations of active/inactive subcarrier indices. Take L = 4 and m = 2 for example. All C (4, 2) = 6 combinations for subcarrier group g are listed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ω g 1 = {β g 1 , β g 2 } ( Ω g 1 = {β g 3 , β g 4 } ) , Ω g 2 = {β g 1 , β g 3 } ( Ω g 2 = {β g 2 , β g 4 }</formula><p>) ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ω g 3 = {β g 1 , β g 4 } ( Ω g 3 = {β g 2 , β g 3 } ) , Ω g 4 = {β g 2 , β g 3 } ( Ω g 4 = {β g 1 , β g 4 }</formula><p>) ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ω g 5 = {β g 2 , β g 4 } ( Ω g 5 = {β g 1 , β g 3 } ) , Ω g 6 = {β g 3 , β g 4 } ( Ω g 6 = {β g 1 , β g 2 }</formula><p>)</p><p>where Ω g j represents the j-th combination of the active subcarrier indices for subcarrier group g and Ω g j is the complement of Ω g j with respect to the set Ψ g , which therefore denotes the j-th </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E 1 L E 2 1 E 2 L E 1 G E G L E Group G Group 2 Group 1</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Baseband transmitter structure of OFDM-IM with arbitrary grouping.</p><p>combination of the inactive subcarrier indices for subcarrier group g. The way to select one out of C (L, m) combinations of active/insubcarrier indices according to random bits has been provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which is omitted here for brevity. Assume that the output of the index selector for active subcarriers is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x g c ∈ { Ω g 1 , . . . , Ω g C(L,m) } . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>Now, it is clear that subcarrier grouping is necessary for OFDM-IM since without it we have L = N and C (N, m) can take very large values, which makes the implementation complexity of OFDM-IM high. On the other hand, assume that the vector of the modulated symbols at the output of the M -ary modulator is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x g s ∈ S L-m . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>Denote the total transmit power of the system as P T . By taking into account x g c and x g s for all g and concatenating G subcarrier groups, the frequency-domain OFDM symbol is created as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">x = [x 1 , . . . , x N ] T (4)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">x i ∈ {0, √ P G / (L -m)x 1 s , . . . , √ P G / (L -m)</formula><p>x G s } with P G = P T /G representing the total transmit power within each subcarrier group and i = 1, . . . , N . Note that as the transmitter has no knowledge of the channel state information (CSI), it is wise to allocate active subcarriers with equal power. Also note that the power allocated to each active subcarrier is P G / (L -m) for OFDM-IM rather than P G /L for classical OFDM in order to balance the total transmit power. This policy is the so-called power reallocation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Before transmission, the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is applied to (4), yielding </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">xk = 1 √ N N ∑ i=1 x i e 2 √ -1π(i-1)(k-1) N , k = 1, . . . , N<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where D is the number of channel taps, and hd</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(d = 1, . . . , D) is circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distributed with E hd [| hd | 2 ] = δ 2 d and E h[ hH h] = ∑ D d=1 δ 2 d = 1.</formula><p>Suppose that the CP length Q is no smaller than D -1. After the removal of the CP and the application of the FFT, the frequency-domain received signal on the i-th subcarrier is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">y i = x i h i + w i , i = 1, . . . , N<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">h i = ∑ D d=1 hd e -2</formula><p>√ -1π(i-1)(d-1)/N is the channel coefficient and w i is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of power σ 2 at the i-th subcarrier, whose vector representations are given by h and w, respectively. Note that as the power delay profile is normalized, it follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">that E h [ h H h ] = N . Also note that σ 2 = N 0 B S ,</formula><p>where N 0 is the power spectral density of the AWGN. Finally, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the active/inactive subcarrier indices and the modulated symbols for each subcarrier group can be jointly detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>From the principle of OFDM-IM described above, one can discover that the index modulation always works efficiently even if all subcarriers are faded completely correlatively, i.e., h 1 = • • • = h N , thanks to the IFFT at the transmitter and the FFT at the receiver. This is quite different from the SM technique, which fails when the channels between different transmit antennas are highly correlated. Note that though we did not specify in (1) how to choose the subcarrier indices, a manner has been suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which is</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Ψ g = {β g 1 , . . . , β g L } = {L(g -1) + 1, . . . , Lg}<label>(8)</label></formula><p>with β g l = L(g -1) + l, where g = 1, . . . , G and l = 1, . . . , L. This means each set of L adjacent subcarriers forms a subcarrier group, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. As this manner is similar to the localized mapping in LTE systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, it is termed localized grouping in this paper.</p><p>Since OFDM-IM is in essence a kind of OFDM transmission technique, we are interested in its performance behavior and the comparison with classical OFDM. Specifically, we aim at answering the following questions from an information-theoretic perspective in this paper:</p><p>• Q1: Is there a better subcarrier grouping method than localized grouping for OFDM-IM?</p><p>• Q2: Can OFDM-IM outperform classical OFDM in the case of L = M ?</p><p>• Q3: How does the special case of OFDM-IM, i.e., OFDM-IM with subcarrier activation only, perform?</p><p>• Q4: What is the optimal subcarrier activation strategy for OFDM-IM in the case of L = M ?</p><p>• Q5: How does the performance superiority of OFDM-IM over classical OFDM behave for different modulation types? Note that the condition in Q2 and Q4 is of particular interest since given M -ary constellation input OFDM-IM shares the same entropy at the channel input with classical OFDM by inactivating one out of L subcarriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ANALYSIS OF ACHIEVABLE RATE</head><p>In this section, we investigate the (ergodic) achievable rate of OFDM-IM assuming CSIR. For fair comparison between OFDM-IM and classical OFDM, we resort to a unified definition of</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">SNR as γ = P T /N 0 B T = P G /Lσ 2 . The achievable rate of OFDM-IM is defined as [29] R OFDM-IM (γ) = 1 B T (B S E h [I (x; y|h)]) = 1 N E h [I (x; y|h)].<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Note that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">9</ref>) is exactly the spectral efficiency of OFDM-IM, measured in bits per second per Hertz (bps/Hz) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. For simplicity, we restrict our analysis to the OFDM-IM system with regular subcarrier grouping, which implies that the frequency correlation is the same for all subcarrier groups, though it can be easily extended to arbitrary subcarrier grouping. An example for regular subcarrier grouping is the existing localized grouping, since under this method the (a, b)-th entry of the covariance matrix of h g , defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Σ = E h g [h g (h g ) H ], equals [Σ LG ] a,b = ∑ D d=1 δ 2 d e -2 √ -1π(a-b)(d-1)</formula><p>/N with a, b = 1, . . . , L, which does not depend on g. Now, under the assumption of regular subcarrier grouping and based on the fact that the encoding and decoding processes associated with each subcarrier group are identical and statistically independent, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> can be simplified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">R OFDM-IM (γ) = 1 N G ∑ g ′ =1 E h g ′ [ I ( x g ′ ; y g ′ |h g ′ )] = 1 L E h g [I (x g s , x g c ; y g |h g )] , ∀g ∈ {1, . . . , G}. (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, in the sequel we will only focus on one subcarrier group for achievable rate analysis. For brevity, we omit the superscript g for all variables defined above. In addition, we let β l = l for notational simplicity such that all subcarriers within the subcarrier group will be indexed from {1, . . . , L}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. INTERLEAVED GROUPING</head><p>In this section, we answer Q1 raised in Section II.</p><p>Motivated by the derived lower bound on the achievable rate of OFDM-IM in Section III, which reveals that the correlation among channel coefficients on the subcarriers within a subcarrier improve the performance of OFDM-IM. Unlike the previous OFDM-IM scheme, in which the subcarrier grouping is performed in a localized manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we suggest grouping the subcarriers in an interleaved manner, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. After interleaved grouping, the set of subcarrier indices for subcarrier group g will be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_84">Ψ g = {β g 1 , . . . , β g L } = {g, . . . , g + (L -1) G} (49)</formula><p>with β g l = g + (l -1) G, where g = 1, . . . , G and l = 1, . . . , L. Note that when interleaved grouping is employed at the transmitter, it should be followed at the receiver. It is evident that applying either subcarrier grouping rule, i.e., localized grouping or interleaved grouping, leads to the same overall system complexity. Also note that from (49), it is clear that interleaved grouping is a kind of regular subcarrier grouping approaches since the (a, b)-th entry of the covariance matrix of</p><formula xml:id="formula_85">h g is [Σ IG ] a,b = ∑ D d=1 δ 2 d e -2 √ -1π(a-b)(d-1)/L with a, b = 1, . . . , L, which</formula><p>does not depend on g. Therefore, the analysis conducted in Section III also applies to interleaved grouping. The reason for adopting interleaved grouping is clarified in the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 4: OFDM-IM with interleaved grouping achieves the highest information rate in both low and high SNR regions when the spacing of any two subcarriers within a subcarrier group is no smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the channel.</p><p>Proof: When SNR is either low or high, it follows from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> that</p><formula xml:id="formula_86">R OFDM-IM (γ) ≈ L -m L log 2 (M ) + log 2 (C (L, m)) L - 1 LC (L, m) × 1 M L-m C(L,m) ∑ j=1 ∑ p (L-m) log 2   C(L,m) ∑ j ′ =1 ∑ p ′(L-m) 1 det (I L + ΣΛ j,j ′ )  <label>(50)</label></formula><p>where Λ j,j ′ is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Note that it is straightforward to have (50) according to Corollary 1 and Corollary 3. From (50), the optimal Σ * , which maximizes the achievable rate of OFDM-IM, lies in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_87">* = arg min ∀Σ C(L,m) ∑ j=1 ∑ p (L-m) log 2   C(L,m) ∑ j ′ =1 ∑ p ′(L-m) 1 det (I L + ΣΛ j,j ′ )   . (<label>51</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_88">)</formula><p>To solve (51), let us assume that the diagonal elements of Λ j,j ′ are all positive. In this case, </p><formula xml:id="formula_89">1 det (I L + ΣΛ j,j ′ ) = 1 det ( Λ -1 j,j ′ + Σ ) det (Λ j,j ′ ) ≥ L ∏ i=1 1 1 + j,j ′ ] i,i<label>(52)</label></formula><p>with equality iff Σ = I L , which represents the case in which h g is a fully independent random Since the logarithmic function is monotonically increasing, we obtain * = I L .</p><p>However, the above assumption does not hold since, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, there is at least one zero among the diagonal elements of Λ j,j ′ . Despite this, we will see that the solution, i.e., Σ * = I L , is still valid. To show this, first assume that only one diagonal element of Λ j,j ′ , e.g., [Λ j,j ′ ] k,k , equals zero. In this case, we can eliminate the k-th row as well as the k-th column of Σ and Λ j,j ′ , yielding updated Σ and Λ j,j ′ . Consequently, it follows from [31, Theorem 16.8.2] that</p><formula xml:id="formula_90">1 det (I L + ΣΛ j,j ′ ) = 1 det ( Λ -1 j,j ′ + Σ ) det ( Λ j,j ′ ) ≥ L ∏ i=1,i̸ =k 1 1 + [Λ j,j ′ ] i,i = L ∏ i=1 1 1 + [Λ j,j ′ ] i,i<label>(53)</label></formula><p>with equality iff Σ = I L-1 . Since for different j, j ′ ∈ {1, . . . , C (L, m)}, the location of the zero in the diagonal elements of Λ j,j ′ spans from 1 to L, we achieve that Σ * = I L . In analogy with the above analysis, the same conclusion can be drawn when more diagonal elements of Λ j,j ′ equal zero.</p><p>In order to achieve the maximum rate of OFDM-IM, the subcarriers within a subcarrier group should be spaced apart in frequency as far as possible to benefit from the independent fading. It is easy to see that interleaved grouping meets this requirement most perfectly, thus completing the proof.</p><p>Remark 5: For double check, let us consider the special case in which the elements of h g are highly correlated, which usually happens to the localized grouping method when the bandwidth spanned by the L continuous subcarriers is smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the channel.</p><p>From Corollary 2 and the identity</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">(1 + Tr {Λ j,j ′ }) -1 &gt; ∏ L i=1 (1 + [Λ j,j ′ ] i,i ) -1</formula><p>, it is easy to verify that the resulting achievable rate is smaller than that of the independent case. Remark 6: In practical systems, the condition in Proposition 4 can be satisfied. Take LTE systems for example. In a macrocell, the coherence bandwidth is on the order of 1 MHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, for a system bandwidth of 20 MHz, the subcarriers within each subcarrier group after interleaved grouping will experience independent fading provided that L &lt; 20. Since as will be disclosed in Section V, the superiority of OFDM-IM over classical OFDM narrows as the alphabet size of the signal input grows, L &lt; 20 is advantageous for OFDM-IM.</p><p>Remark 7: Since C OFDM-IM (γ) is dominated by the expectation of I (x s ; y|x c , h) over h with x s being a Gaussian signal set (especially as SNR gets higher), which is independent of the channel correlation as (39) implies, the gap between the resulting ergodic capacity of localized grouping and interleaved grouping will be very small. Furthermore, considering that Gaussian input is unfavorable to OFDM-IM with respect to classical OFDM as analyzed earlier, we do not evaluate the aforementioned gap in this paper.</p><p>Remark 8: From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_50">26</ref>) and the proof for Proposition 4, we see that the lower bound on the achievable rate of OFDM-IM achieves its maximum when Σ = I L , i.e., subcarriers within a subcarrier group are faded independently. Therefore, we expect that the interleaved grouping will also perform better than the localized grouping in the moderate SNR region for PSK/QAMconstrained input. This will be validated in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>In this section, numerical results are presented to validate the analysis and make comparisons between classical OFDM and OFDM-IM. The achievable rate is chosen as the performance metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Localized grouping vs. interleaved grouping</head><p>In this subsection, we answer Q1 and Q2 raised in Section II.</p><p>In the numerical calculations, the total number of subcarriers is chosen as N = 64 and the channel is assumed to have an exponentially decaying power delay profile with δ and 4 share the same entropy at the channel input. As seen from the figures, unlike classical OFDM for which the grouping type is irrelevant to performance, OFDM-IM with interleaved grouping can achieve up to 3 dB, 2 dB, 0.5 dB, and 0.2 dB SNR gains over OFDM-IM with localized grouping at achievable rates equal to 0.95 bps/Hz in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3(a),</ref><ref type="figure">1</ref>.85 bps/Hz in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>(b), 2.6 bps/Hz in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(a), and 2.8 bps/Hz in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4(b)</ref>, respectively. This is expected because the independence of channel fading makes the different subcarrier activation types easier to differentiate, which in turn improves the coding gain from index modulation. On the other hand, at those achievable rates, OFDM-IM with interleaved grouping outperforms classical OFDM with an SNR gain of up to 3 dB. From the figures, we also see that the resulting achievable rates by interleaved grouping from the practical channel model match the ultimate ones derived  by assuming fully independent fading, perfectly. This is in consistent with Proposition 3 as in those cases the interleaved grouping ensures the channel coefficients on subcarriers within a subcarrier group are approximately statistically independent.</p><p>Since as validated above the ultimate performance of OFDM-IM is available by adopting interleaved grouping in practice, in the following subsections we will simply let the subcarriers within each subcarrier group experience independent fading in order to examine the ultimate performance of OFDM-IM and avoid channel particularity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Performance of OFDM-IM with subcarrier activation only</head><p>In this subsection, we answer Q3 raised in Section II.</p><p>-12 -9 -6 -3 0 3  With the aid of ( <ref type="formula">35</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_67">36</ref> with BPSK can be accounted for its 3 dB larger minimum Euclidean distance than OOK-OFDM and its double entropy at the channel input over OFDM-IM with subcarrier activation only.</p><p>The behavior of OFDM-IM with subcarrier activation only in the very low SNR region can be to the coding gain from index modulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance of different subcarrier activation strategies</head><p>In this subsection, we answer raised in Section II.</p><p>In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>, we observe interestingly that OFDM-IM with m = 1 surpasses classical OFDM significantly under the finite constellation constraints. However, since the decoding reliability of the modulated symbol varies with the constellation order under a power constraint and that of different subcarrier activation types varies with the parameters L and m, different  phenomena will be observed for different system parameters.</p><p>To show this, we present an example with L = 8 and 8-PSK in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, where m varies from 1 to 5. As can be seen, besides m = 1, in which case OFDM-IM and classical OFDM have the same entropy at the channel input, OFDM-IM with m = 2 and m = 3 also have the potential to outperform classical OFDM despite smaller input entropy. For m = 4 and 5, the input entropies are too small to exploit the channel, thus leading to a smaller achievable rate than classical OFDM. Therefore, an intriguing question may arise: what is the optimal m in maximizing the achievable rate for a given SNR. For the above example, answers are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, where SNRs equal to 0 dB, 6 dB, and 12 dB are considered, and the corresponding lower bounds are also plotted. It is shown that there exists an optimal non-zero m (marked with a circle) which may vary for different SNR values. However, we expect in general that when SNR becomes  very high the optimal m is more likely to be 1 since the entropy at the channel input is the largest. On the other hand, it is clear from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> that the proposed lower bound can also point out the same solutions for its potential to trace the exact values as the increase of SNR well (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> for more evidences). Therefore, for computational tractability, the use of the proposed lower bound is more advisable in the determination of the optimal m. It is worth noting that under a finite-alphabet input, the achievable rates of all schemes will always saturate at their corresponding uncoded transmitted information rates at very high SNR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. PSK vs. QAM</head><p>In this subsection, we answer Q5 raised in Section II.</p><p>An example for the comparison between 16-PSK and 16-QAM inputs is shown in Fig.   power while that with 16-QAM will be determined by the origin point and its nearest 16-QAM constellation point of enhanced power. It should be noted that since in OFDM-IM the origin point appears with probability m/L while each 16-PSK/QAM constellation point appears with probability (L -m) /M L, the comparison through measuring the Euclidean distance directly need not guarantee absolute accuracy. However, this can be adopted as a general principle to foresee the comparison result when a larger alphabet, such as 64-PSK/QAM is considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Effects of Gaussian input</head><p>In this subsection, we compare the performance of OFDM-IM with classical OFDM under Gaussian input.</p><p>With L = 8 and m spanning from 1 to 7, the comparison in terms of ergodic capacity is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>. The expectation of (39) over channels, which accounts for the portion of ergodic capacity contributed by symbol modulation, is also depicted. As seen from the figure, the contribution of subcarrier activation to the ergodic capacity, which equals the gap between the black and blue dashed curves, cannot be neglected. Take m = 4 for example. At SNR equal to 27 dB, the ergodic capacity of OFDM-IM is about 5.3 bps/Hz and the portion contributed by symbol modulation is about 4.6 bps/Hz. Therefore, the other portion contributed by subcarrier activation is about 5.3-4.6 = 0.7 bps/Hz, resulting in the ratio between the portions of the ergodic capacity contributed by subcarrier activation and symbol modulation as high as 0.7/4.6 = 15.2%. On the other hand, it is clear that the figure substantiates our conclusion presented in Section III.B that OFDM-IM performs worse than classical OFDM under Gaussian input.</p></div>
