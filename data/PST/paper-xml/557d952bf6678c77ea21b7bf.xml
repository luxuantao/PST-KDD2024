<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A~sfruct-Classification and estimation of non-Gaussian signals observed in additive Gaussian noise of unknown covariance is addressed using cumulants or polyspectra. By integrating ideas from pattern recognition and model identification, asymptotically optimum maximum-likelihood classifiers and ARMA parameter estimators are derived without knowledge of the data distribution. Identifiability of noncausal and nonminimum phase ARMA models is established using a finite number of cumulant or polyspectral lags of any order greater than two. A unifying view of cumulant and polyspectral discriminant measures utilizes these lags and provides a common framework for development and performance analysis of novel and existing estimation and classification algorithms. Tentative order determination and model validation tests for non-Gaussian ARMA processes are described briefly. Illustrative simulations are also presented.

In these applications, vector 8, includes signal parameters such as Doppler-shift and two-way travel time, and/or parameters of the medium through which the information signal is transmitted. The former are used for range, angle of arrival and velocity estimation, and the latter are employed for system identification and channel equalization. In a pattern recognition context, 0,'s correspond to feature vectors which may contain ARMA parameters of models fitted to characterize Existing classification and parametric modeling approaches employ the autocorrelation sequence, and usually assume causal and minimum-phase models. Because the autocorrelation provides a complete statistical description of Gaussian signals only, to classify or estimate non-Gaussian signals we employ higher-than second-order statistics called cumulants.</p><p>Cumulants and their Fourier transforms called polyspectra generalize the notion of the autocorrelation sequence, and were introduced in statistics to characterize non-Gaussian The paper is structured as follows. Section I1 reviews cumulants and polyspectra. The asymptotic properties of sample cumulant estimators are studied in the first part of Section 111. In the second part, the minimal set of higher order statistics (HOS) that guarantees uniqueness in classification and strong consistency in parameter estimation of general noncausal and nonminimum phase ARMA models is obtained for both frequency-and time-domain approaches. The time-domain parameter identifiability results generalize earlier works reported in <ref type="bibr">[ l l ]</ref> , <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Using large sample theory, asymptotically optimum, maximum likelihood (ML) classifiers are developed in Section IV using cumulant (time-domain) or polyspectral (frequency-domain), statistics. The computationally attractive algorithms proposed in <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> for performing matched filtering (MF) in cumulant-domains are generalized. Methods for asymptotic performance evaluation are also described.</p><p>By integrating ideas from pattern recognition, detection theory, and system identification, novel parameter estimation algorithms are proposed in Section V. The asymptotic ML viewpoint provides an optimal basis for existing and novel HOS-based approaches and is motivated by the bispectral fitting ideas put forward by <ref type="bibr">Brillinger [3]</ref>. Related ML approaches for estimating causal and minimum phase models using 2nd-order statistics were originally proposed by <ref type="bibr">Whittle [48]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Walker [47]</ref>. For parameter estimation the results of Section V unify and extend the time-domain results of <ref type="bibr">[26], [43], and [lo]</ref>.</p><p>Within the novel unifying framework, tentative model validation and order selection schemes for non-Gaussian ARMA processes are discussed briefly in Section VI. Cumulant-based order determination of causal ARMA processes was reported in <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. The model validation ideas expand upon the frequency-domain tests of <ref type="bibr">[21] and [37]</ref>. Representative simulations are shown in Section VII, and conclusions are drawn in Section VIII.</p></div>

Similar to (5d) symmetries also exist in the frequency-domain. The nonredundant regions of bispectra ( k = 3) and trispectra ( k = 4), which are commonly used in practice, are as follows.

For precise statements of the asymptotic normality theorems involving polyspectra we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr">[27] and [46]</ref>.</p><p>Although (6) holds true when g T = [C2,(0) * * Czx(Ngl)]', autocorrelation statistics are not appropriate for unique characterization of a non-Gaussian process, unless the latter is linear, causal and minimum phase. On the contrary, higher order cumulants and polyspectra specify uniquely linear non-Gaussian processes within time-shift and scale ambiguities 1261. This fundamental result has initiated research in ARMA parameter estimation and signal detection using cumulant matching (see <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[17], [26], and [43]</ref>). Combination of this result and (6) forms the basis of the unified ML viewpoint suggested in this paper for classification and estimation of non-Gaussian signals. Notice though that our unifying approach includes the second-order autocorrelation and spectral matching ideas of <ref type="bibr">[47], [48]</ref> as special cases.</p></div>

NON-GAUSSIAN SIGNAL ESTIMATION/MODEL IDENTIFICATION</head><p>In signal estimation problems the unknown vector 0, of (1) can assume any value 0 in the parameter set 0 , which suggests that nonlinear optimization is necessary for estimating 8, through the cumulant and polyspectral objectives J,(O,, e) and d,(8,, 0 ) of Section IV. Candidate optimization schemes include the Gauss-Newton, the Marquardt-Levenberg or the Nelder-Mead algorithms. Although the focus of this section will be on ARMA processes, the same ideas are applicable to various parametric set-ups such as direction of arrival estimation problems met in array processing applications <ref type="bibr">[ 191, [36]</ref>. Parameter estimation algorithms using cumulant matching have been reported in the context of system identification, especially when s ( i 10) is the output of a causal ARMA model <ref type="bibr">[ 101, [26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. Driven by the classification and MF ideas of the previous section a unified ML viewpoint is offered here and consistent estimation algorithms are proposed for (non-)causal ARMA models, using both time-and frequency-domain criteria. Using Theorem 5 , it follows immediately that the estimator of (29a) will be strongly consistent so long as g, contains the Ng lags described by Proposition 1. In this case, we obtain The numerical minimization of J,(O,, 0) involves an iterative update of the form where p, &gt; 0, is the stepsize, and f g ) is a search direction which depending on the mhimization algorithm may involve the gradient V,J,[O,, e t ) ] , and perhaps the Hessian V;J,[Oo, @] of the objective function.

CONCLUSION-FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>The asymptotic normality of sample cumulant and polyspectral statistics allows a unifying maximum-likelihood viewpoint for classification and parameter estimation of non-Gaussian signals observed in Gaussian noise of unknown covariance. Asymptotically perfect classification and consistent estimation of noncausal and nonminimum phase ARMA models is guaranteed using a finite set of fixed cumulant or polyspectral lags. Trading off computational with statistical efficiency, a variety of methods becomes available using time-and frequency-domain matching criteria. Asymptotic evaluation of parameter estimation methods is performed through C-R bounds based on higher order statistics and derivation of confidence intervals. Consistent order determi- nation and validation tests are possible using both time-and frequency-domain statistics.</p><p>Currently under investigation are extensions to closed-loop systems and multivariate processes with exogeneous inputs, along the lines of [5, ch. 71. Additional topics worth further investigation include nonstationary and non-Gaussian processes, input-output identification, and parametric models excited by non-i.i.d. inputs. The non-i.i.d. input case calls for extending Theorem 2 to martingale differences.
