<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents innovative algorithms combining Jaya optimizer, salp swarm algorithms and (least-squares) support vector machines for simulating the temperature effect accurately in dam health monitoring modeling. The temperature effect is simulated by different variable sets of air temperature to get a reasonable choice. The proposed long-term air temperature based support vector machines algorithms are verified on monitoring data of a concrete gravity dam. Results confirm the ability of the proposed hybrid strategies to efficiently mine the effect of air temperature on dam behavior. The proposed approach based on direct air temperature observation can result in significant reduction in prediction errors of the dam displacements. The proposed method is tested on a concrete gravity dam and it is expected to be further tested on concrete arch dams in the future.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Dams are important structures in a reservoir project for water control, navigation and hydroelectric power generation, etc. Failure of dams can cause disastrous consequences to the personal properties and ecological environment in the downstream. Dam health monitoring systems provide an effective way for dam safety evaluation in real time. The observed structural responses, like displacements, are compared with predicted values obtained by mathematical models to identify whether the behavior of the structure is still reasonable. If the divergence between the measured value and the model prediction is larger than an early warning threshold, the reason for the change should be identified to prevent disaster occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>Statistical models based on multiple linear regression and their advanced forms have been shown to be more or less successful in dam health monitoring modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The adopted regression models include the multiple linear regression (MLR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the stepwise regression (SR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, the principal component analysis based regression model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, the partial least-squares regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> etc. Recently, some machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, neurofuzzy systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, support vector machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, boosted regression trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, extreme learning machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, etc. are also introduced to solve dam health monitoring problems. More extensive review of the topic is given in the work of Bukenya et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Salazar <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. The limitations of these models are hard for model structures and parameters selection. Meanwhile, previous dam health monitoring models are mostly developed from the HST (hydrostatic, season, time) model, which simulates the temperature effect by harmonic sinusoidal functions. The model is convenient, but it cannot reflect the effect of temperature variations in different years to the studied dam responses.</p><p>It is an intuition to simulate the thermal effect using measured air and/or dam body temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and HTT (hydrostatic, temperature, time) models are proposed. Leger and Leclerc <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> presented frequency domain solution procedures for developing the HTT statistical model to interpret recorded pendulum displacements of concrete dams. Mata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed a HT PCA T model using temperatures of the dam body directly and principal component analysis (PCA) is adopted to find statistically significant temperature observations for the proposed functional model. Numerical results show that the proposed HT PCA T model performs better than HST models. Except to use dam temperature, several scholars have tried to consider the thermal effect using air temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, since the structure temperature is strongly correlated to the air temperature. Mata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed frequency domain techniques for analyzing the effect of the daily variation of the air temperature on the structural response of a concrete dam. Tatin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> developed a hybrid physico-statistical HSTT (Thermal HST) model by introducing the air temperature and water temperature to improve the assessment of displacements due to the temperature field in a dam. Data-driven models using measured segmented air temperature data are also developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> considering the lag effect between the internal temperature and the external temperature changes. This type of model has achieved several successful applications, but the suitable length of air temperature data needs further discussion. The time period of air temperature is extended to several years and long-term air temperature based HT A T (hydrostatic, air temperature, time) model is proposed to obtain more accurate dam behavior prediction.</p><p>To mine the thermal effect from long-term measured air temperature, the traditional linear regression models are not qualified considering they are not well-suited to model nonlinear interactions between input variables. More flexible methods have to be introduced for establishing the prediction model. In this study, intelligent machine learning approaches based on support vector machines (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> are proposed to solve the problem. Support vector machines developed by Vapnik <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> are powerful and robust methodology firmly grounded in the framework of statistical learning theory. Originally, SVM was developed to solve classification problems. Then it was extended to solve nonlinear regression problems, and this technique is known as support vector regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The SVM model showed excellent performance in various prediction fields, such as flood forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, electric load forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, geotechnical reliability analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> etc. LSSVM is introduced by Suykens et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> as a variation of the conventional support vector machines. LSSVM not only has the same advantages of SVM, such as retaining the principle of SVM and having good generalization capability, but also has additional advantages over the SVM method like fast training. The LSSVM model also showed excellent performance in various prediction fields, and gained more and more popularity for engineering forecasting problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Meanwhile, estimation accuracy of SVM and LSSVM depends on a proper setting of hyper-parameters, and there is no general consensus on the appropriate setting of these parameters.</p><p>Nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are widely adopted for various science and engineering problems. The population based heuristic algorithms have two dominant groups: evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence based algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by the laws of natural evolution. The well-known evolutionary algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> are genetic algorithms, genetic programming, differential evolution, etc. Swarm intelligence algorithms imitate the intelligence of swarms, herds, schools, or flocks of creatures in nature. The most popular swarm-based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> are ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony algorithm, etc. Other swarm intelligence algorithms include grey wolf optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, ant lion optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, whale optimization algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, grasshopper optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, etc. Besides the evolutionary and swarm intelligence based algorithms, there are also some other algorithms which work on the principles of different natural phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. These techniques are generally probabilistic algorithms and require common controlling parameters like population size, number of generations, etc. Besides the common control parameters, most of these algorithms require their own algorithm-specific control parameters. The proper tuning of the algorithm-specific parameters is a very crucial factor which affects the algorithm performance. The improper tuning of algorithm-specific parameters either increases the computational effort or yields the local optimal solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Jaya algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> is a novel global optimization technique that was proposed without any algorithm specific parameter to be turned. Meanwhile, Jaya has only one update equation. These characteristics make the algorithm to be simple and easy to implement. It has been shown that Jaya algorithm is efficient in solving the benchmark optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> and some real world problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> is another recently proposed meta-heuristic algorithm for global optimization. SSA also does not contain any algorithm-specific parameter to be tuned, which makes the algorithm convenient to implement. Meanwhile, SSA has many unique characteristics that make it favorable to be utilized as the search engine in global optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Therefore, an attempt is made in this work to apply Jaya and SSA algorithms to select the parameters of SVM and LSSVM, and hybrid models are proposed for the behavior prediction of concrete dams.</p><p>The paper discusses an up-to-date question in dam structural safety procedures: to incorporate measured (air) temperatures directly into the model instead of using a model with indirect modeling of the temperature influence by harmonic sinusoidal functions. The performance of the proposed HT A T model using long-term air temperature and (least-squares) support vector machines is tested on a concrete gravity dam. Promising results are obtained for the studied example and similar results are expected for concrete arch dams.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, dam health monitoring modeling problem is stated. In Section 3, long-term air temperature based SVM and LSSVM model are presented. Simulation results are presented in Section 4, and in Section 5, conclusions are provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Dam health monitoring modeling</head><p>Data obtained from static health monitoring system are generally analyzed by using statistical models based on correlations between environmental factors and dam responses. Environmental factors include reservoir water levels, temperatures consist of the dam internal temperature and external temperatures of air and reservoir, earthquakes, etc., and the responses refer to displacements, uplift pressures, seepage, crack, stress and strain etc. The actual response of the dam is compared with the predictions of the mathematical model, with the aim of detecting anomalies and preventing failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The dam displacement is an overall index of the dam integrity. Therefore, the model for displacement monitoring is discussed in the following study.</p><p>Various statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of monitoring data <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The response of the dam is separated by two parts, (a) reversible effects due to hydrostatic load and temperature, and (b) irreversible effects induced by creep, alkali aggregation reaction and other damages. The HST model is the most common statistical model for safety control of concrete dams. A general statistical model is adopted to analyze the response of an instrument and can be formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= + + + y y y y i h T t (1)</formula><p>where y i is the measured horizontal displacements of the ith dam section, y h is the response due to the hydrostatic load, y T is the response due to temperature changes, y t is the irreversible time effects, and ε is the residual/difference between modeled/predicted and measured values of displacement.</p><p>According to theoretical analysis, the three components of the displacement can be expressed as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= + + + y a a h a h a h h 0 1 1 2 2<label>3 3</label></formula><p>(2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= + + + + y b b s b s b s b s s sin( ) cos( ) sin ( ) sin( )cos( ) T 0 1 2 3 2<label>4</label></formula><p>(3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= + + y c c c e or t 0<label>1 2</label></formula><p>(4)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= + + + y c c c ln( 1) t 0 1 2<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where h is the upstream water level or water depth; s = 2πj/365.25, j is the number of days from the beginning of the year (January 1) to the data of observation; sin(s), cos(s), sin 2 (s) and sin(s)cos(s) are combinations of harmonic sinusoidal functions use to simulate periodic evolution of the dam response to seasonal phenomena of temperature; θ = t/100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, t is number of days since the beginning of the analysis; and a j (j = 0,1,…,3), b j (j = 0,1,…,4) and c j (j = 0,1,2) are unknown coefficients.</p><p>Although exponential functions and logarithmic functions can be used to represent the evolution of time effect at the early age, a linear function of time is preferred for a dam running many years <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The time effects can be expressed as y t = c 0 + c 1 θ. For concrete dams that have been in operation for many years, the internal temperature can be regarded as quasi-steady state, and the temperature of the dam is generally not recorded enough. The dam response to seasonal phenomena of temperature is assumed to follow periodic evolution. The temperature effect can be calculated as a combination of harmonic sinusoidal functions as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3</ref>).</p><p>Except to consider the temperature effect in a seasonal form, it can also be evaluated by real measured air/dam temperature data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. For example, the relationship between temperature effect y T and segmented air temperature T p-q can be presented as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>   </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= + + + + + y b b T b T b T b T b T T 0 1</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">= + + + + + y b b T b T b T b T b T T 0 1<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where T 0 represents the mean daily air temperature of the measured day, T p-q represents the average air temperatures in the p to q days before the observation date of the dam response.</p></div>

Let f(u) be the objective function to be optimized. At the initial stage, some solutions {u 1 , u 2 ,…, u m } are randomly generated in the search domain, where m is the population size. These initial solutions are evaluated by the objective function, and the best solution u best and the worst solution u worst is founded. Then, these solutions perform cycle by cycle search, until the maximum generation or the optimization goal is achieved. At any iteration i, a solution of the population is modified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">= + v u r u u r u u ( ) ( ) j k j k j j best j k j j worst j k , ,<label>1, , , 2, , ,</label></formula><p>where u j,best is the value of the variable j for the best candidate and u j,worst is the value of the variable j for the worst candidate. v j,k is the updated value of u j,k , and r 1,j and r 2,j are two random numbers for the jth variable during the ith iteration in the range [0, 1]. The term r 1,j ((u j,best -|u j,k |) indicates the tendency of the solution to move closer to the best solution, and the term -r 2,j (u j,worst -|u j,k |) indicates the tendency of the solution to avoid the worst solution. The random numbers r 1 and r 2 ensure good exploration of the search space. The absolute value of the candidate solution (|u j,k |) considered in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">24</ref>) further enhances the exploration ability of the algorithm. The generated new solution will be evaluated by the objective function. If the new solution is better than the original solution, replace the old solution with the new one. Else, keep the original solution as it is. That means v j,k is accepted if it gives a better function value. All the accepted solutions at the end of the iteration are maintained and further searches are performed based on these solutions in the next iteration. In the proposed algorithm, the solution obtained for a given problem is moving towards the best solution and avoiding the worst solution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Salp swarm algorithm</head><p>Salp swarm algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> is a swarm intelligence based global optimization algorithm inspired by the navigation and foraging behaviors of salp swarms. The salps are barrel-shaped, free floating tunicates from the family of Salpidae <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. In oceans, salps often float together as a salp chain as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Some researchers believe that this manner can achieve better locomotion and foraging.</p><p>The salp chain behavior has been modeled mathematically by dividing the population into two groups: leaders and followers. The leaders guide the swarm, and the followers follow each other. The target of the swarm is a food source called F in the search space. Similar to other swarm intelligence algorithms, an initial population is generated by initializing a predefined number of individuals with random positions in the search domain. The solutions can represented as {u 1 , u 2 ,…, u m }, where m is the population size. Afterward, these salps update their positions in two phases. The leader position is updated as follows:   where u j 1 is the position of the leader in the jth dimension, F j is the position of the food source in the jth dimension, ub j and lb j are the are the upper and lower bounds of jth dimension, c 2 and c 3 are random numbers uniformly generated in the interval</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">= + + + &lt; u F c</formula><formula xml:id="formula_31">[0 1]. c 1 is a coefficient calculated as = ( ) c e 2 l L 1 4 2 (26)</formula><p>where l is the current iteration and L is the maximum number of iterations. Variable c 1 is gradually decreased over the iteration process, which makes the algorithm first explores the search space and then exploits it. Actually, c 1 is the most important parameter in SSA since it balances exploration and exploitation.</p><p>For each follower salp, the position is updated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">= + u u u 1 2 ( ) j i j i j i 1<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where i ≥ 2 and u j i is the position of the ith follower salp in the jth dimension.</p><p>The pseudocode of SSA is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. SSA algorithm assigns the best solution obtained so far to the food source F, so the algorithm never gets lost. The positions of the leading salps are updated respect to the food source only, so the leaders always explore and exploit the space around the best solution. The positions of follower salps are updated with respect to each other, so they move gradually towards the leading salp. The gradual movements of follower salps prevent the algorithm from easily being trapped at a local optimum. SSA also does not contain any algorithm-specific parameters to be tuned to get optimal solution. So the algorithm is simple and easy to implement.</p><p>The computational complexity of the SSA algorithm is of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, where l is the number of iterations, d is the number of variables (dimension), m is the number of solutions, and Cof represents the cost of objective function.</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">O (l × (d × m + Cof × m))</formula></div>

For SVM optimization, a solution can be represented as u = {u 1 , u 2 , u 3 }, where u 1 , u 2 , u 3 denote the parameters log 10 C, log 10 γ, log 10 ε, respectively. For LSSVM optimization, a solution can be represented as u = {u 1 , u 2 }, where u 1 , u 2 denote the parameters log 10 C and log 10 σ 2 , respectively. The method of encoding gives a more stable optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. A popular way to estimate the generalization performance of a model is cross-validation described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The procedure of cross-validation divides given data randomly into S distinct subsets {G s , s = 1, ⋅⋅⋅, S} of (approximately) equal size, and uses S-1 subsets for training, and uses the remaining one subset for validation. The process is repeated S times by changing the remaining subset.</p><p>The objective function value of solution u is calculated based on the mean squared error (MSE) of cross-validation as</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">= = = u x u f MSE N y f ( ) 1 ( ( )| ) , u s S i G i i 1 1 2 s (<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_35">)</formula><p>where N is the number of samples for training, S is the number of subsets for cross validation, G s denote the sth subset for validation, y i is the target value, and f(x i )|u is the value predicted by LSSVM when the hyper-parameters are set as u.

In order to avoid over-fitting, it is often necessary to observe both training and test errors. In this way, the fitting performance of the model can be guaranteed, and the generalization ability of the model is also considered.

Although the training error of the S 4 model is smaller than that of S 3 model, the test error of S 3 is the smallest. Therefore, S 3 is adopted as the representative variable set of long-term air temperature variables in the following studies. Through numerical experiments, 2-year air temperature data before the dam response measurement can obtain ideal results and adding more air temperature has no significant accuracy improvement. The suitable time period (one year, two years, three or more years) is related to the massiveness of the dam and the dam types. For other dams, suitable time periods of air temperature data need further experiments on actual monitoring data of the specific dam.</p><p>Performance comparison among mathematical models using two years air temperature is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">16</ref>. The machine learning techniques RBFN, LSSVM and SVM obtained much smaller errors than the MLR model. The optimized SVM model performs the best compared with the other mathematical models. The prediction results and residuals of the LSSVM-S 3 and SVM-S 3 models are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">17</ref>. The LSSVM-S 3 and SVM-S 3 models can fit the measured displacement better than MLR-HST model, and the residuals are also much reduced.</p></div>

Both of them are convenient to implement, and SSA shows slightly accurate in SVM parameter optimization problem. A real concrete dam is taken as an example to verify the proposed approach. Compared with harmonic sinusoidal functions based models, the long-term air temperature based SVM and LSSVM models using two years data can obtain the best performance. Forecasting accuracy is much improved considering several errors are much reduced. Therefore, the proposed SVM (LSSVM) based HT A T model can reflect the effect of real temperature variations on the structural response.</p><p>Mata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed a successful HTT model with better performance than HST models. The measured temperatures of the dam body were involved in the modeling directly and PCA is adopted to find statistically significant temperature observations for the proposed functional model. For the PCA, a subjective step should be employed to define a number of principal components. Numerical results confirm the statement that the proposed HT A T model can perform better than HST models. Comparison between HST and HTT was presented, so this study is surely a step forward from the HST-model.</p><p>Although there are a high number of variables in the proposed    model, there is no computational burden or special requirement considering the number of training samples is not very large. The simulation was programmed using MATLAB and performed on a computer equipped with an Intel Xeon E5, 2.40 GHz processor and 16GB RAM.</p><p>The proposed approach is tested on a concrete gravity dam and it is strongly recommended to test this method on concrete arch dams in the future. We expect similar results since the displacements are within a similar range as for concrete dams <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and expose similar correlation to the (air) temperature.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
