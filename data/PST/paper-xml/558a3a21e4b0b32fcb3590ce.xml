<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microwave Permittivity of Dry Snow Christian Matzler</head><p>Abstract-The relative dielectric constant, or relative permittivity, E of dry snow, is independent of frequency from about 1 MHz up to the microwave range of at least 10 GHz. New measurements of E with improved accuracy were made with a specially designed resonator operating near 1 GHz. The coaxial sensor accurately defines the sample volume whose actual mass can be determined to give the density of the snow sample. A special electronic instrument, called resometer, enabled accurate and rapid measurements under field conditions. Some 90 measurements of different kinds of dry snow (fresh, old, wind-pressed snow, depth hoar, and refrozen crusts) were made at test sites in the Swiss and Austrian Alps. The data indicate that E is a function of snow density only, given that the standard deviation of 0.006 from the fitted curve is just due to the expected measurement errors. The interpretation of these data in terms of physical mixing theory favors the effective medium formula of Polder and van Santen. The data allow to relate the average axial ratio X as a function of ice volume fraction. Both prolate and oblate spheroids can explain the data. Independent reasoning gives preference to oblate particles. In both cases, the axial ratio increases with increasing fraction up to a critical value of 0.33, followed by a decrease at still higher fractions. The destructive metamorphism of slowly compacting snow explains the increase of X, while the following decrease might be due to sintering. So far, no effect on E by a liquid-like surface layer on the ice grains at temperatures between -10" C and 0" C has been observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>NTEREST in the microwave dielectric properties of snow I arises for several reasons. Firstly, dry snow is a highly transparent medium for electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies up to about 10 GHz. There is an interest from the application's point of view to use this radiation for probing snow-covered terrain, glaciers, and ice sheets. For this purpose, the effective refractive index, n, or the relative dielectric constant, E, has to be known to compute depth from the measured phase delay. Motivated by this need [4] made one of the first accurate studies at a frequency of 9.4 GHz.</p><p>Secondly, snow itself is a medium of high interest to hydrology, climatology, avalanche research, etc., having lead to active and passive remote sensing research of snowpack properties at frequencies reaching to about 100 GHz (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). Here too, E plays the role of a key parameter. In the determination of snow wetness by dielectric measurements, it is necessary to accurately account for the contribution of dry snow. Whereas wet snow shows a distinct relaxation spectrum in the microwave range dry snow has a permittivity which is independent of frequency (if the very small imaginary part is neglected). <ref type="bibr">February 14, 1995</ref> Thirdly, dry snow is one of the simplest heterogeneous media that nature produces abundantly. There exists a strong theoretical interest in granular media. One of the objectives has been to develop effective medium theories to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in such media in a similar way as for homogeneous media (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>). A special result of the effective medium theories is that, for wavelengths large in comparison to the typical particle size, the dielectric constant of dry snow only depends on the volume fraction and on the shape of the ice grains. By applying the dielectric mixing formula of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> noted that the density dependence could be explained by spherical ice particles. His measurements were done very carefully in a laboratory experiment. The snow was poured into a waveguide to meet a certain density, and the wavelength was then measured. Although the procedure of handling the snow may have changed its natural property Cumming's data were regarded as the standard for many years. <ref type="bibr">Colbeck [3]</ref> was one of the first to point out to the shape dependence of the microwave permittivity; he reinterpreted Cumming' s data by spheroidal ice particles with an axial ratio of 1:1.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manuscript received</head><p>Other measurements of E versus density, usually made under field conditions, showed more scatter, see e.g., the review of <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. In this paper it will be shown that the scatter can be reduced to the expected uncertainty by a proper measurement of both permittivity and density in the same, well-defined volume of the given natural snow sample.</p><p>The ice-volume fraction, 'u, is clearly the dominant parameter for the determination of E . In contrast, the sensitivity of E to grain shape is small at high and microwave frequencies.' As an example at the fixed value, 'u = 0.3, the effective permittivity ranges from a minimum of E = 1.472 (spherical particles) to a maximum of E = 1.543 (thin plates). These values are based on the mixing formula of Polder and van Santen by choosing the permittivity of ice, E, = 3.185 (7' E -4°C). Therefore, the experimental accuracy has to be high if one wishes to distinguish different grain shapes.</p><p>During the 1980's, several efforts were made to improve the knowledge on microwave dielectric properties of snow. On the one hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and [8] emphasized multifrequency measurements covering a spectrum from less than 1 up to 37 GHz for both dry and wet snow. Their results have been important for the understanding of microwave signatures of snow to be used in remote sensing. The gain was mainly the new spectral information without putting too much emphasis on absolute accuracy. On the other hand, several groups were involved in the development of accurate, dielectric sensors mainly for measuring the snow wetness, Le., the volumetric liquid-water content (e.g., [l], [5], <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). The sensors were designed to optimize both the accuracy and the handling under field conditions. It turned out that frequencies in the 0.1 to 1 GHz range were optimum. An intercomparison of such sensors was done in the Austrian Alps in 1982 <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. A problem turned out to be the inhomogeneity of the natural snowcover inhibiting the accurate reproduction of any destructive measurements. It was not possible to measure the density and the dielectric constant, or the wetness and another parameter of the same sample. Reference samples had to be taken from nearby places which seemed to be homogeneous. The fact that the snowcover is heterogeneous in the vertical direction is evident by the apparent stratification. However, it was rather a surprise when it was observed that there is an unpredictable heterogeneity also in the horizontal direction.</p><p>Based on this experience, a new dielectric sensor was developed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>); it should allow the measurement of the permittivity of an exactly defined snow volume, and subsequently enable the density of the sample to be determined. First measurements with such a sensor were made by [ 16, figs. 2.12 and 2.131. In the meantime, new results were obtained in the Swiss and Austrian Alps. The dataset is now large enough, and the accuracy appears to be good enough to allow a discussion in the light of the existing mixing formulas. The formula of Polder and van Santen, indeed, turns out to be the most appropriate one. The grain shape appears to be a systematic function of density. The scatter of the data points from a fitted dielectric mixing formula has got a standard deviation as small as 0.006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IT. THE INSTRUMENTS A. The Resonator</head><p>The relative effective permittivity E can only be determined for a volume that contains many snow grains. The mean electric field has to be homogeneous in such a volume. From this requirement it follows that the radius of curvature of any electrode touching the snow should have sufficiently large radii of curvature, much larger than the snow grain diameter. In contrast to the majority of previous sensors, the new one fulfills this requirement. It is an open, coaxial resonator, an enlarged version of the coaxial surface sensor developed by 111, and modified so that it can be completely inserted into the snowcover (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The front edges are sharpened in such a way that the density and the structure of the snow to be measured are not changed by the sensor. The back end of the resonator is short-circuited. The end plate contains two coaxial connectors with inductive coupling loops for feeding and detecting the microwave power. Both the inner and outer conductors are hollow cylinders made from stainless-steel with outer(inner) diameters of 70(66) and 28( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) mm, respectively. The outer conductor has a length of 200 mm. In order to avoid radiative losses, the inner conductor is shorter by 25 mm. The resonator is operated at the 3X/4 resonance (at 1255 MHz in air) or, occasionally, at the X/4 resonance. In both cases the quality factor of the empty resonator is about 400. The real part of the effective refractive index, n, is determined from the ratio of the resonant frequency f o ~ in air to the resonant frequency flo when the resonator is completely inserted into the snow, and E is the square of n. From the measurement of the quality factor the imaginary part E / / of E can be determined as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This determination is useful for wet snow. For dry snow, however, E" is too small to be measurable with the given resonator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The LLResometer''</head><p>In order to enable an accurate and rapid measurement of the resonance properties of the resonator under field conditions, we developed a so-called resometer, a compact, battery-powered sweeper and electronic detecting system to automatically tune the resonator through the resonance, to measure and display the peak frequency fo and the frequencies fi. and fi, respectively, at the half-power points of the resonance curve [l5]. A switchable set of Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCO), covering the frequency range from 200 MHz to 1.4 GHz, are used. High accuracy in the frequency measurement is achieved by a quzrtz-stabilized frequency counter. Attention was paid also to allow an accurate measurement of the rf power coupled through the resonator. Interference due to standing waves on the feeding cable are minimized by good impedance match at the resometer I -€ output connector; standing waves are avoided at the resonator output by mounting the detector directly on the output connector. The detector voltage level is kept below 10 mV to guarantee linearity between rf power and detector signal.</p><p>The resometer, including the liquid-crystal display, operates over the temperature range from -25°C to at least +35"C.</p><p>Best accuracy is achieved if the resonant frequency is determined from the average of f 1 and f 2 . Under laboratory conditions, an absolute accuracy of 10 KHz can be achieved whereas under field conditions 100 KHz is typical. Assuming a resonant frequency of 1 GHz, the latter accuracy translates to an error of 0.1% in n, and 0.2% in E, provided that foo is E = 1.5 turns out to be 0.003.</p><p>C. The Scale media. His result for homogeneous, isotropically oriented ellipsoids of permittivity E , and volume fraction w in vacuum (or air) can be written in the following form, suitable for iterative solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>:</p><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">' u ( E s -1) EL €*+L&amp;-l) 3 -' u ( E , -1) EL Ea+'4&amp;-l) A E = l +</formula><p>exactly known. Thus the expected error for a typical value of where A, is the depolarization factor of the ellipsoids for the ith principal axis, and E, is the so-called apparent permittivity. The depolarization factors are positive numbers obeying</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A1 + A2 + A3 = 1. (2)</formula><p>For the determination of the snow density, the snow contained in the resonator is removed by a tamping tool and put on a commercial electronic scale. Effects due to wind were avoided by a simple shelter. Two different scales have been used in the field, with resolutions of 1 and 2 g, respectively. The absolute error was checked for both scales; it was found to be smaller than 2 g in almost all tests. Since the resonator volume is 684 cm3, the expected absolute error of a density measurement is at most 0.0029 g/cm3, or 0.0032 if expressed by the fractional ice volume 'u (the density of ice is 0.917 g/cm3). This maximum error can be translated to an error of E if the derivative, de/dv is known. Taking the average value da/dw = 1.8, the maximum contribution to the error in E becomes 0.0057. This value is larger than the expected error arising from the resonator measurement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">MEASUREMENTS</head><p>The described sensor has been used on different occasions as a complement to microwave signature studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>). Here we present the data of some 90 measurements made on dry snow at the two test sites, Weissfluhjoch-Davos, Switzerland and Getschalp-Kaunertal, Austria. Both sites are situated at altitudes above 2000 m. Samples of all depths within the snowcover, ranging from fresh snow at the surface to powder, felt and wind-pressed snow and further to depth hoar near the bottom, and even refrozen crusts in spring condition are included in the dataset. Difficulty to properly execute the measurements only arose for refrozen crusts; sometimes (for w &gt; 0.45) they were extremely hard. A spatial limitation was given by the size of the sensor; if it is inserted horizontally into the snow, it requires a minimum layer thickness of 7 cm, its outer diameter. The data of the snow to be reported here was always dry, the majority of the measurements were made at temperatures between -8°C and -1"C, and in some cases approaching OOC. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the data versus ice-volume fraction. It appears that all points closely follow the solid line representing a fit to the mixing formula of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to be discussed in the following. The standard deviation from the fitted line is 0.0064. This value is in agreement with the expected variability due to the statistical measurement errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sihvola's Generalized Mixing Formula</head><p>Different mixing models are represented by different choices of E, varying in the range 1 5 E, 5 E. With the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E, = 1 + a(&amp; -1) (3)</formula><p>the parameter a is defined which is found to range between 0 to 1, the Maxwell-Gamett formula resulting from a = 0, and the coherent potential formula from a = 1. The effective medium equation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is recovered by the choice a = l -A , .</p><p>(4)</p><p>Note that this value is different for each term i of the sum in (1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Is Dry Snow a Two-Component Granular Medium?</head><p>Snow is a heterogeneous medium consisting of irregular ice grains whose permittivity E, is quite well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. An uncertainty about the required homogeneity of E, arises from the potential influence of a quasi-liquid layer occurring at the ice-particle surface at temperatures above -1OOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The thickness of this layer is very sensitive to temperature; it increases toward 0°C. The liquid layer would imply a dielectric heterogeneity. Due to the large permittivity of liquid water a layer of varying thickness would lead to a temperature dependence of E. This variation should appear as scattered data in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Since the standard deviation of these data can be explained by statistical errors alone it must be concluded that the influence of a liquid layer is not detectable here. Therefore, the ice particles can be regarded as homogeneous. However, their irregular shape does not allow a direct description by ellipsoids; the parameterization of (l), using the depolarization factors as free fitting parameters, opens a range of permittivity values that allows to fit the snow data. The ellipsoids, corresponding to the best fit, can then be compared with the snow-particle shape or with other structural parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Which Formula is Best?</head><p>Before the fitting procedure was done a selection of the most suitable mixing formula had to be made. For this purpose a subset consisting of the 40 data points with v 1 0.25 of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> was selected with the assumption that E, = ~i = 3.185. This higher density snow is relatively old; it can be approximated by rounded particles not far different from spheres. Therefore A;</p><p>In his dissertation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> generalized the existing physical mixing formulas for the effective permittivity of granular must be close to 1/3. We started by assuming A; = 1/3. With this selection a first value of a was estimated by minimizing of Polder and van Santen for oblate spheroids with a variable depolanzation factor as given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Measured permittivity of dry snow versus measured density, expressed by the ice volume fraction. The solid line is the fit by the mixing formula the standard deviation of the 40 data points from (1). The minimum value of 0.0079 found this way was for a = 0.8.</p><p>For a = 0.7 and for a = 0.9 the standard deviation increased to 0.01. These best-fit a values lie somewhere between 2/3 of the Polder and van Santen formula and 1 of the Coherent Potential formula. For the following arguments it must be noted that for given values of u and E , (where E , &gt; 1) E depends on a and on A, in the following manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>: 0 for any given set of A, values, E increases with increasing * for any given a value, E has a minimum for A, = 1/3. In the next step, the more realistic assumtion is made that A, slightly deviates from 1/3. The resulting increase of E must be compensated by a decrease of the a value. This means that a;</p><p>Polder and van Santen then turns out to be best, in accordance with earlier experimental evidence [6] and with the Strong Fluctuation Theory ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, ch. 5.4). The following analysis will be based on this formula, as expressed by (1) to (4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Interpreting the Snow Datu in Terms of the Formula of Polder and van Santen</head><p>A further simplification of the mixing formula is given by assuming spheroidal particles where two of the three depolarization factors are equal. This assumption reduces the number of free parameters to a minimum without seriously limiting the potential of interpretation. By choosing the equal parameters to be A = AI = Az, A3 is found from (2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A3 = 1 -2A.</formula><p>(5) a = 1 is inhibited. Also a = 0 can be excluded, because this value is too far from the first estimate. The formula of Small values, A &lt; 1/3, represent oblate spheroids while higher values, A &gt; 1/3, the maximum being 0.5, represent prolate spheroids. With this simplification the mixing formula reduces to a function of E,, v and A. Furthermore, it is possible to express A by the axial ratio X of the spheroids, defined by X = (minor axis)/(major axis). ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)</p><p>For oblate and prolate spheroids A can be computed from the upper and lower (7), respectively, as ([9], app.)</p><p>The curves of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> display these two functions. Note that (7) represents both A I and A2, and A3 is determined by (5). Since A may be different at different snow densities, bestfit A values should be computed from data within narrow density intervals. They were chosen by grouping each set of 6 monotonously increasing E values. In this way a running mean of A values was obtained. Usually two different solutions were found, one for oblate spheroids within 0 &lt; A &lt; 0.3, the other one for prolate spheroids within 0.4 &lt; A &lt; 0.5. The result of this fitting procedure is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. For both solutions, the axial ratios versus w are shown. The standard deviations of the individual fits are shown for the case of prolate spheroids. The values are around 0.005, and mostly below 0.008 for volume fractions up to about 0.4. The snow data at the highest density show larger scatter, thus increasing the standard deviation to values slightly above 0.01. The fit by oblate spheroids turns out to have almost the same standard deviation, including its functional dependence on v. Therefore, the selection of a "correct" particle type cannot be made on the basis of this fitting procedure. Nevertheless the resulting axial ratios show a similar behavior: there is a clear increase with increasing v up to v = 0.33 followed by a slight decrease for still higher v. The minimum axial ratio is found for the snow at the lowest density. This is freshly fallen snow, mainly consisting of the original snow flakes, such as needles, plates, stars and their fragments. Although both prolate and oblate grains exist, the oblate ones are usually more abundant.</p><p>With increasing age, the dry snow is compacted by gravity and by other forces, undergoing a destructive metamorphism, and changing to more and more rounded ice grains; therefore, the axial ratio increases toward one. The present snow samples were only checked visually for their grain shape. Nevertheless the increase of the axial ratio with increasing density and age can be regared as general behavior. It was also described in the dielectric study of <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. It has to be added that some data points in the range 0.25 &lt; w &lt; 0.3 resulted from samples of depth hoar, i.e., a snow type which passed through a temperaturegradient metamorphism. It is interesting to see that their E data fit well within the general behavior of the more regular snow. The abrupt reversal of X from an increase to a decrease at a volume fraction v, 2 0.33 is hard to understand, especially, because refrozen crusts, occurring at v S 0.4, consist of well rounded ice grains. One might expect X to increase up to 1 at this highest density. This is not observed here. According to a first idea, the reversal to smaller axial ratios could be understood by the formation of depth hoar. Indeed, under this situation the axial ratio should be slightly reduced; however, the associated change of density is no longer an increase. The density rather decreases when depth hoar is formed, so this process cannot explain the reversal either. As noted above depth-hoar data fit within the general behavior.</p><p>Two possible explanations for the observed reversal remain: first, the reversal could be an instrumental artifact. With increasing density the standard deviation of the fits increases, indicating a certain increase of nonsystematic errors, probably due to the hardness of the refrozen crusts, and also due to the large size of some grains and grain clusters. It is possible that this increase is also accompanied by an increase of systematic errors. An argument against this hypothesis is given by the different volume fractions v, at which the reversal occurs and where the increase of the standard deviation starts. The second explanation just derives from the coincidence of v, with v,, the critical volume fraction for the onset of the so-called "percolation" effect. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, TI, is given by (8) 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">21, = ___ 1 + 3a</formula><p>where a is given by (4). At v = v,, the grains are not far from spherical, thus allowing to replace A, in (4) by its mean value of 1/3. Inserting the resulting parameter a in (8) leads to v, = 113 which is identical to v,. Percolation can be understood as the transition from a loose kind of snow to one </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>0.</head><p>Ice Volume Fraction Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Depolarization factors of dry snow versus ice volume fraction derived from fitting a running mean over 6 data points of the dielectric data (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) to the mixing formula of Polder and van Santen. The solid line is the result for oblate spheroids, and the dotted line represents a simple fit as expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. with solid connections throughout the entire volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The shape factor would then no longer be determined by the shape of individual grains, but rather by the larger-scale structure, such as the clusters, or the network of sintered ice particles. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> would describe the onset of clustering at v = v, and how strong its influence is on the effective permittivity at v &gt; v, as expressed by the mixing formula of Polder and van Santen. Sintering of contacting snow grains would then be the explanation for the observed behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The Fitted Permittivity of Dry Snow</head><p>In order to fit the permittivity data of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> by a smooth function of v , either X or A has to be fitted by a function of v. If the grains are chosen to be oblate, then the following function can be used to represent A over the range of v from 0 to 0.33:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A = 0.1 + 0 . 5 ~; 0 &lt; v &lt; 0.33.</formula><p>For v &gt; 0.33, a fitted linear decrease could certainly be used for the present dielectric data. However, it has to be remembered that the air will be trapped above a certain value of v. Indeed, by exchanging ice and air we can use the same arguments as before, starting at low air-volume fractions, 1 -v &lt;&lt; 1. There A = 1/3, because the trapped air bubbles have spherical shape in natuial ice. With decreasing v , the value of A does not change until the air-percolation point, 1 -v Z 1/3, is reached. What has to be obtained is a steady function with a minimum near v = 0.5. The following function approximates the required behavior 0.1 + 0 . 5 ~; 0 &lt; w &lt; 0.33 v 2 0.71 A = 0.18 + 3.24(v -0.49)'; 0.33 5 v &lt; 0.71 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> i 1/3; This function is shown as the dotted line in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Equations (1) to (5) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) now define the functional form of E(.). The solid line in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> displays this function for E, = 3.185. The standard deviation of the data points from this fit is 0.0064. This value agrees with the expected uncertainty due to measurement errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Comparison with Other Mixing Formulas</head><p>A number of additional mixing formulas have been proposed, several of them being empirical. The purpose of this section is to qualify the most often used mixing formulas by testing them with the available dataset of dry snow. One important class of formulas can be described by the linear mixing rules in powers b of the permittivities involved:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(10) Eb = (1 -.)EL +</formula><p>where &amp;h is the permittivity of the host medium. For b = 1 we get the linear, for b = 1/2 the refractive formula, and for   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>.</p><p>The standard deviation systematically decreases from top to bottom of the table, indicating better and better fits, the best one being the discussed form of the mixing formula of Polder and van Santen. Empirical formulas tend to give incorrect values for E ( W = 1) which should be equal to E~ = 3.185. This is especially evident in the fit to (11) with M = 3.</p><p>Nevertheless, the fit is excellent over the range of existing data points. Surprisingly good values of &amp;h close to 1.0, of E, = E ( W = 1) close to E % , and of the standard deviation are found for Looyenga's formula. On the other hand the refractive formula is clearly inferior in all three parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The dielectric permittivity E of snow is a key parameter for electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering. Both theoretical and application-oriented interests exist for improving the knowledge on dielectric properties. The topic of this contribution was a presentation and discussion of new results on the real part of E with high accuracy in both density and permittivity of dry snow. It was shown that the scatter of the data can be reduced to the expected uncertainty by a proper measurement of both permittivity and density in the same, well-defined volume of the given, natural snow sample. A specially designed, coaxial resonator at frequencies around 1 GHz was built, and operated with a so-called resometer to produce accurate and rapid measurements under field conditions. The results, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> as a function of ice volume fraction, show surprisingly low scatter, indicating that the measurable variation is only due to this parameter. This result is quite surprising, because all different kinds of dry snow are included in these data. The analysis in terms of physical mixing theories showed that the mixing formula of Polder and van Santen is consistent with the data while other mixing formulas are not. The intkrpretation of the data in terms of grain shape lead to two possible solutions, one for oblate, and the other one for prolate spheroids. Since oblate spheroids are more common in fresh snow the first solution is given preference at least for this snow type. In both cases the axial ratio X increases similarly with increasing density up to a critical volume fraction of 1/3, followed by a decrease. The increase of X can be explained by the destructive metamorphism of compacting snow; the following decrease, however, is more difficult to understand. A possible explanation is the occurrence of percolation due to the sintering of snow grains. More studies should be devoted to this subject.</p><p>In the last part, a discussion of several fits to the dielectric data was held, and a comparison with the solution based on the physical formula of Polder and van Santen was made. None of the empirical fits reached the quality of the physically based formula. Looyenga's semiempirical formula turned out to be a reasonable alternative. In the reduced interval 0 &lt; %I &lt; 0.5 a simple third-order equation (without a second-order term) almost reaches the accuracy of the physical mixing formula.</p><p>For practical purposes this approximation may be used in the given v range.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
