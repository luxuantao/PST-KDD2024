<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present a novel control strategy to perform the exact finite-time restoration among voltages and frequencies of an islanded inverter-based microgrid. The problem is attacked from a cooperative-based control perspective inspired to the tracking consensus paradigm. Ad-hoc chattering-free sliding-mode based distributed algorithms are designed to enhance the underlying robustness and convergence properties of the system with respect to the existing solutions. Particularly, the restoration is achieved while dispensing with the knowledge of the distributed generators' models and parameters. Performance of the control system is analyzed by Lyapunov tools, and a simple set of tuning rules are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulations on a realistic inverter-based microgrid modelization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>M ICROGRIDs (MGs) constitute the bridge between the traditional electrical distribution system and the distributed renewable generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. While often connected to larger grids, MGs can autonomously "insland" themselves in response to pre-planned or unplanned events and then operate independently. During grid-tied operation the MG control is simple, since the larger primary grid dominates the MG dynamics. On the contrary, in islanded operation the MG control is crucial for a reliable power delivery and to preserve synchronization, voltage stability and load sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>To simplify the system's integration, the MG control infrastructure is recently standardized into a three-layer hierarchical architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The Primary Control (PC), depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, consists of local controllers acting on each Distributed Generator (DG) to preserve the MG stability while guaranteeing the load sharing facilities. The Secondary Control (SC) designed to compensate the unavoidable deviations of the DG's output voltages and frequencies from the expected setpoints. The Tertiary Control (TC), with the aim to guarantee a correct and economical power dispatching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Literature review</head><p>This research is focused on designing a novel SC layer. Centralized approaches to SC design have been firstly proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, the current trend is to discourage centralized strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> whose disadvantages are, e.g.: 1) latency and delays due to all-to-one communication; 2) the need of costly central computing and communication units; 3) poor global reliability of the power system due to critical sensitivity to single-point failures. Additionally, they are hardly scalable, not flexible, and do not possess plug-and-play functionalities.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, multi-agent based consensus controllers have been proposed to take advantage of their inherent scalability and flexibility features <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to address power dispatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and secondary voltage and frequency restoration problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in the distributed control setting. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> the secondary distributed voltage and frequency restoration task is addressed. However, due to the requirement of all-to-all communication among DGs, its communication overhead was significantly greater than that of the centralized strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Furthermore, no formal stability analysis was made. Among the existing investigations, references <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> appear to be the more closely related to the present research.</p><p>An overview of the main features of these proposals as well as the main improvements provided by the present paper are explained hereinafter.</p><p>Frequency restoration: Based on Distributed Averaging Proportional Integral (DA-PI) scheme, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposes for the first time the use of the consensus paradigm to restore the frequencies in an islanded MG. The results are derived on the basis of a simplified MG model consisting of coupled Kuramoto oscillators. A different strategy, namely a consensusbased Distributed Tracking (DT) approach, is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Both papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> implement active power sharing functionalities, but the corresponding approaches only possess local exponential stability properties. Additionally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> the restoration frequency ω re f must be constant and globally known to all DGs. On the contrary, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> allows to arbitrarily modify the steady frequency of the MG by simply acting, at the local level, on a particular DG referred as "leader".</p><p>Note that, although the leader information is available only to a small portion of DGs, the whole MG will cooperatively converge towards the expected synchronization value in spite of limited communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This feature is particularly useful during islanded operation when more active power is required, or to seamlessly transfer the MG from islanded to grid-connected mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Voltage restoration: Similarly, DA-PI and DT solutions have also been employed for voltage restoration purposes. The DA-PI approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is only capable of providing a tuneable compromise between the adverse tasks of voltage restoration and reactive power sharing accuracy. Furthermore, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, such an approach doesn't allow to arbitrarily affect the restoration voltages. Other solutions can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, none of them provide guidance in characterizing the power sharing properties with respect to the voltage restoration accuracy. On the contrary, since national agencies penalize customers with low load power factors, DT schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> focus on the exact voltage restoration problem only, disregarding the reactive power sharing issue.</p><p>Common approach is to convert the voltage restoration problem into a linear DT consensus problem by using feedback linearization techniques. Then, after linearization, the exact voltage restoration can be achieved by using different DT consensus strategies, such as, for instance, power fractional finite-time control <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, linear proportional-derivative <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, ARE-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and sliding-mode (SM) based adaptive neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Among them, it is worth to mention that only <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> considers the presence of uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics in its treatment.</p><p>Clearly, the underlying requirement of feedback linearization techniques to have an exact MG mathematical model is rather unrealistic in practical scenarios, and furthermore feedback linearization may also yield numerical problems (e.g. due to the online computation of nonlinear coordinate transformations or high-order Lie Derivatives) that can compromise the effectiveness of the whole control system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Statement of contributions</head><p>Inspired by the most recent results in the area of SMbased DT consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we propose a novel SC layer capable of providing the finite-time voltage and frequency restoration in an islanded inverter-based MG. In contrast with the existing DT solutions, our implementation does not rely on the knowledge of the DGs' mathematical models (i.e., the present proposal is inherently robust against model/parameter uncertainties) and it dispenses with the need to measure several grid variables and parameters, cfr. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Particularly, the proposed DT frequency restoration SC improves the performances of the DA-PI controller in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> since it allows to arbitrarily modify in a distributed way the MG frequency by acting on the leader DG only. Furthermore, the scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is also overperformed in terms of convergence rate (that was exponential in the quoted references <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> whereas the present work provides finite-time convergence properties). A dedicated Lyapunov analysis based on a faithful nonlinear modelization of MG corroborates the finite-time stability "in-the-large" of the proposed scheme without relying on local linearization arguments. The analysis confirms that the active power sharing constraints are restored in finite-time even in spite of abrupt modifications of the power demand.</p><p>The present investigation additionally proposes a novel SM based DT scheme for the voltage restoration. In contrast with the existing solutions the present proposal dispenses with the use of feedback linearization techniques, that were employed, respectively, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In both the proposed frequency and voltage SM-based SCs, chattering is alleviated by relying on ad-hoc input dynamic extension technique where the discontinuous sign functions only appear in the time derivatives of the actual control input, thus yielding continuous control actions. The proposed SCs thus inherit all the main desirable properties of SM control, such as finite-time convergence, high accuracy, and robustness to uncertainties, disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, without being affected by the chattering phenomenon.</p><p>Particularly, to figure out what can be expected when the proposed methods will be applied to an actual MG, we notice that robustness to realistic measurement noise and parameter uncertainty/variations has been verified by simulations. Unmodeled dynamics of the grid components will be the main issue arising at the practical implementation stage, causing an increase in the input-output relative degrees. It is well known, however, that sliding-mode controllers possess significant robustness properties against the presence of sufficiently fast unmodeled dynamics, that should be the case in the applicative scenario of MG control under investigation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Distributed Secondary Controller Design</head><p>Strategies ranging from centralized to completely decentralized have been suggested to achieve the aforementioned SC purpose.

On the other hand, decentralized strategies appear to be unfeasible by using only local information <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. As such, the communication between DGs has been identified as the key ingredient in achieving these goals while avoiding a centralized architecture.

Concerning Ṗ∞ , relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> gives a conservative upper bound.

Clearly, these strategies would be built on the same communication infrastructure of the SC layer.</p><p>2) Voltage Restoration Control: With the aim of enhancing robustness to model uncertainties and convergence properties of the voltage restoration control loop, as compared to the previously quoted existing schemes, we propose a novel chattering-free SM distributed control protocol that guarantees the finite-time attainment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Readers can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for a comprehensive description of the Singular-Perturbation method, which is involved in the convergence proof.</p><p>As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the cascaded voltage and current PCs in, resp., ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">11</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">14</ref>), are theoretically justified based on time-scale separation techniques. With this in mind, following the Singular Perturbation paradigm, let us make the realistic assumption that the inductance L f i in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, and the inverse of the integral gain of the current control 1/k ici in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> are small enough. Thus, we define ε = max{L f i , 1/k ici } as perturbation parameter. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">11</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, it yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">ε d dt i ldi φ di - (ω i -ω)i lqi 0 = -R f i -k pci 1 -1 0 i ldi φ di + 1 1 i * ldi</formula><p>Setting ε = 0, as prescribed by the Singular Perturbation method, the quasi steady-state behavior of the fast dynamics are the solution of the resulting algebraic system, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">i ldi φ di = 1 -k pci -R f i -1 • i * ldi (<label>36</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_46">)</formula><p>It follows that in the quasi-steady regime the current control forces the inverter to dispatch almost instantaneously its setpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, in spite of the inherent coupling between the d-q components. Analogously, one also has that i lqi = i * lqi . Let us now consider the dynamics of the voltage variables to be restored. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> the reduced-order relation between υ odi and the control input υ ni is given by dυ odi dt = w i (ω i , ψ di , υ odi , υ oqi , i odi ) + wi • υ ni <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> where w i = (ω i -ω)υ oqi + ψ di -k pvi υ odi + (k f vi -1)i odi /C f i and wi = k pvi /C f i . For later use, Lemma 2 is presented.</p><p>Lemma 2. Consider a MG of "n" DGs, subject to the PC (1)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Let (37) be the dynamic equation of υ odi in the quasi- steady regime of the current control. It follows that there exists</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">Ωi ∈ R + such that | ẇi | Ωi , ∀ i = 1, 2, ..., n.</formula><p>Proof of Lemma 2. Differentiating the expression of w i (•) in (37), along the system dynamics ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">14</ref>) yields ẇi = ωi υ oqi + (ω i -ω) υoqi -k pvi υodi + (k f vi -1) iodi (38)   From <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> follows that, thanks to the PC (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">14</ref>), the MG stability is guaranteed. Furthermore, the frequency synchronization on the value (25) is achieved. It follows that ωi is not only bounded but it decays to zero as well. That remains true a fortiori, also when the frequency SC ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_36">31</ref>) is active. Let us now consider the other terms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. With a similar line of reasoning as that of Ass. 1, due to the inherent boundedness of the MG variables in terms of generated and demanded power, and thanks to the stability established by the PC, υ odi , υ oqi and i odi will also be bounded with bounded derivatives. Thus, we conclude that there exist a sufficiently large constant Ωi , such that | ẇi | Ωi , ∀ i = 1, . . . , n.</p><p>We are now in a position to present the proposed novel sliding-mode based control for voltage restoration purposes υni = -</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">C f i k pvi ς 1 • sign ∑ j∈N i υ odi -υ od j + g i υ odi -υ re f +ς 2 • sign ∑ j∈N i υodi -υod j + g i υodi -υre f (<label>39</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_49">)</formula><p>where ς 1 , ς 2 ∈ R + are the control gains, and g i ∈ {0, 1} is the pinning gain, assumed to be equal to "1" if the i-th DG has a direct access to the reference voltage, "0" otherwise.

Consider a MG of "n" DGs, subject to the PC (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">14</ref>), and communicating over a connected network G.

Some comments on the tuning rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> are given.</p><p>Let us first note that υ re f is a signal generated ad-hoc for SC purposes by higher level logics. Thus, its rate of variation can safely be assumed to be bounded and a-priori known by a constant Ω, as stated in Ass. 2. As for the estimation of ΩM = max i Ωi , first note that from Lemma 2 the local bounds Ωi exist. Furthermore, thanks to the PC stability properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and to the current and voltage operating limits, one can derive conservative estimations of ΩM . However, better estimations of these quantities based on more sophisticated strategies can be devised. As an example, since <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> depends on measurable variables then the exact estimation of Ωi could be computed in a decentralized way by using, e.g., finitetime unknown input observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> or disturbance observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Alternatively, similarly to Remark 3, distributed estimation strategies based on max-consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, could be used to cooperatively obtain less conservative estimations of this bound. Clearly these strategies would be built on the same communication infrastructure of the SC layer.</p><p>Remark 5. The chattering problem is a critical aspect in sliding mode control implementation. Several strategies have been proposed to counteract it, e.g., the introduction of observerbased auxiliary loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the averaging of the discontinuities by low-pass filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, the use of higher order sliding mode algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, to cite a few. Here, an ad-hoc input dynamic extensions conceptually similar to that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> is proposed. Thus, the secondary controllers (30)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, and (39) result in continuous control actions, thereby alleviating the chattering. However, due to unmodeled dynamics or to the finite sampling rate of digital controllers, small residual chattering may still appear <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Thus, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, a useful additional countermeasure is to smooth out the discontinuities by using smooth approximations of the sign functions such as,   </p><formula xml:id="formula_52">m p 10 × 10 -5 6 × 10 -5 4 × 10 -5 3 × 10 -5 n Q 1 × 10 -2 1 × 10 -2 1 × 10 -2 1 × 10 -2</formula><formula xml:id="formula_53">2 P L4 3 Q L1 1.5 Q L2 1.5 Q L3 1.3 Q L4 1.5</formula><p>e.g., the sigmoidal approximation sign(S) ≈ S/(S + ε) with small parameter ε → 0.</p></div>

PWM Generators with 2kHz carrier are used to control the switching devices. According to (2)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">14</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, and (39), the PC and the SC are formulated in the local ref. frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. On the contrary, the coupling filter ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">18</ref>), the output connector ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">19</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and the power lines are modeled in the abc frame by using 3-ph Series RLC Branches and the loads as 3-ph Parallel RLC Loads. The current and voltage outputs of the PI controllers, as well as the PWM modules, are saturated in accordance with the DGs' rated powers, resp., 380V ph-ph , 32A. All the MG's specifications are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>.</p><p>Simulations were performed by using the Runge-Kutta fixed-step solver with sampling time T s = 2µs, whereas the PC and SC algorithms have been discretized by using the larger sampling step of Ts = 0.5ms. Finally, the secondary control gains are chosen as follows α = 200, ς 1 = 240, and ς 2 = 250. Note that, in accordance with Remark 5, the sign function <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> is approximated by a sigmoidal function with ε = 0.01.</p><p>At the startup, the SC communication network G has the same topology of the power network, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. DG 1 is the only DG that knows the reference voltage υ re f and frequency ω re f , i.e., g 1 = 1 and g 2 = g 3 = g 4 = 0 [12], [16].</p><p>To test the robustness of the algorithm, uncertainties in the range of ±(10 ÷ 15)% of the corresponding nominal values are introduced for all the DG's parameters involved for control purposes, namely parameters C f i and L f i in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Realistic noisy measurements are also taken into account. Particularly, all measurements are converted into the 4 ÷ 20mA range with power transmission equal to 0.2W, and then corrupted by an Additive White Gaussian Noise with a realistic Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 90dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, in order to investigate the robustness of the proposed SC algorithms against sudden planned or unplanned events, the presence of load changes, 3-ph faults, and the consequent reconfiguration of both the physical and the SC communication topologies are also scheduled throughout the simulation.</p><p>In particular, a 3-ph to ground fault <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> will be introduced on Line 3, i.e. R l3 , L l3 , see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Then, due to the surge transient current and according to the delays of protection devices, 10msec later, two circuit breakers located at the branch buses "b3" and "b4" will isolate DG 4 from the MG. Finally, two seconds later, the SC is also reconfigured by letting a 34 = a 43 = 0. Meanwhile, DG 4 continues to fed Load 4 with only its local PC active.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Case Study</head><p>The use-case under test schedules the next list of events: I1 At the startup (t = 0s), only the PC is active with PC setpoints ω ni = 2π • 50Hz and υ ni = 220V RMS ≈ 380V ph-ph ; I2 At t = 5s the frequency restoration SC (30)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_36">31</ref>  from the corresponding PC setpoints. The voltages also deviate each other. As expected, and in accordance with Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the synchronization among frequencies to the common value <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, as well as the power sharing constraints ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">28</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">29</ref>) are achieved, as confirmed also by Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. At t = 5s the frequency SC ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_36">31</ref>) is activated. Fig.  shows that almost instantaneously the frequencies are restored in finite-time to the desired 50Hz value. From Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> it is also of interest to note that the agreement on the frequency SC actions, i.e. condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, is in force. It follows that the desired active power ratios are preserved, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. At t = 10s, the voltage restoration control (39) is activated.

Due to this fault, a surge current, depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> is generated. Then, 10ms later, protection devices isolate that portion of the MG. Although DG 4 and Load 4 have been electrically isolated from the rest of the MG, the SCs are intentionally reconfigured only two seconds later at t = 42s. From Figures <ref type="figure">3,</ref><ref type="figure">4,</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref>, and 8, it can be noted that, even in spite of changes on the MG electrical topology (DG 4 has been isolated), the restoration control aims for all the DGs is still guaranteed, whereas, limited to those DGs that can share their loads, i.e. DG 1, DG 2 and DG 3, also the power sharing constraints are still in force.</p><p>At t = 42s the secondary communication layer is updated, i.e. a 34 = a 43 = 0, and DG 4 starts to operate with only the PC active, with ω n4 = 2π • 50Hz and υ n4 = 220V RMS , see Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>. Finally, to show the tracking performances of the proposed SCs during the novel SC configuration, at t = 43s and t = 44s, the secondary setpoints are updated, resp., to ω re f = 2π • 50.2Hz and υ re f = 220V RMS . Finally, the time profiles of the SC actions ω ni (t) and υ ni (t), in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> confirm that the chattering is successfully removed.</p><p>These simulation results confirm that the proposed SC schemes effectively accomplish all their goals by using local information from the neighboring DGs only. Simulations have further shown good voltage and frequency tracking performances in spite of parameter uncertainties, noisy measurements, and the occurrence of abrupt structural modification in both the electrical and the secondary communication layers.</p></div>

Furthermore, from (44) σ ω goes to zero in finite-time, while preserving ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 2. Let us define the error variables σ υ1 = y 1 -1 ⊗ υ re f , σ υ2 = y 2 -1 ⊗ υre f where y 1 = [υ odi ] ∈ R n and y 2 = [ υodi ] ∈ R n . By differentiating σ υ1 and σ υ2 along the trajectories of ( <ref type="formula">37</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, and due to the zero row sum property L 1 = 0 of the Laplacian matrix, the collective error output voltage dynamic is</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">συ1 = σ υ2 συ2 = ẇ -1 ⊗ ϋre f -ς 1 • Sign((L +G)σ υ1 ) -ς 2 • Sign((L +G)σ υ2 )<label>(45)</label></formula><p>where w = [w i ] ∈ R n . By invoking Ass. 2 and Lemma 2, it follows that ẇ -1 ⊗ ϋre f ∞ Ω+ max i∈V Ωi ≡ Ω. Let M = G + L ∈ R n×n and because by assumption at least one DG has a direct access to the reference voltage, from Lemma 1, M ≻ 0. Thus, let us consider as candidate Lyapunov function V υ (t) = ς 1 • M σ υ1 1 + 1 2 • σ ′ υ2 M σ υ2 ≻ 0. By performing computations similar to those made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> for a leaderless network of double integrators, i.e. such that G = 0, it results</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">Vυ (t) -(ς υ2 -Ω) • Mσ υ2 1 0 if ς υ2 &gt; Ω. (46)</formula><p>By virtue of (46), the equi-uniform stability of the error dynamic (45) is thus established. Let R &gt; V υ (0), by (46), it further follows that, whenever system (45) will be initialized in an arbitrary vicinity of the origin, the corresponding solution is confined within the invariant set D R = {(σ υ1 , σ υ2 ) ∈ R 2n : V υ (σ υ1 , σ υ2 ) R}. Let µ m be the smallest eigen- value of M, and κ R &gt; 0 be sufficiently small such that κ R &lt; min{2ς 2  1 /R, µ m , µ m /2R • (ς 2 -Π)}. By invoking the Extended Invariance Principle, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, the augmented Lyapunov function W υ (t) = V υ (t) + κ R • σ ′ υ1 M σ υ2 satisfies W υ (t) c R • ( M σ υ1 1 + Mσ υ2 1 ) ≻ 0 (47) with c R = min{ς 1 -κ R R/(2ς 1 ), (µ m -κ R )/2}. Lengthy but straightforward computations yield that W υ (t) c R • ( M σ υ1 1 + M σ υ2 1 ) with cR = max{ς 1 + κ R 2R/µ m , R/(2µ m )}. Finally, after differentiation of (47) along the system trajectories described by (45), the following estimation is shown to be in force</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">d dt W υ (t) - c R cR •W υ (t)<label>(48)</label></formula><p>with c R = min{κ R (ς 1 -ς 2 -Ω), ς 2 -Ω -κ R 2R/µ m } &gt; 0. From (48), the augmented Lyapunopv function W υ exponentially decays to zero. Due to the exponential stability of (45), and thanks to the uniform boundedness of the term ẇ -1 ⊗ ϋ0 ∞ Ω in (45), by invoking the Quasi-Homogeneity Principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 2]</ref>, it follows that W υ (t) decays to zero in finite-time. Thus the errors variables σ υ1 and σ υ2 go to zero as well, while guaranteeing the voltage restoration <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. This conclude the proof.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
