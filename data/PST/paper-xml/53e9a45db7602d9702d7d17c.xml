<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>fewer requirements on the design and engineering efforts, is more popular in many industry sectors, while the model-based methods are mainly applied to automatic control systems with well-established process models.</p><p>In a complex industrial system, the technical production process often consists of numerous control loops with a huge number of sensors and actuators embedded in the loops. Since production and product quality are in general not online measurable or the measurement is only realizable after the production process is completed, efficient quality prediction and diagnosis play an important role in complex industrial systems. For this purpose, the concept of key performance indicator (KPI) has been introduced and the KPI-based quality prediction and diagnosis cover a wide range of requirements from industrial applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. For instance, for a hot strip mill process in the steel manufacturing industry, engineers are highly interested in the relationship between operating conditions and those KPIs of the final product like thickness or flatness. Although much effort has been devoted to developing the analytical model of the hot strip mill process, performing a reliable KPI prediction is still a challenging issue in practice due to the process complexity. Generally speaking, it is the state of the art that the product quality prediction is performed by skilled operators based on their experiences, which, however, also causes potential threats to reliability and safety of the considered plants. Therefore, the KPI prediction based on the available measurements of process variables is highly necessary in practice and becomes a critical factor for the quality control. Moreover, in order to ensure the successful operation of such complex process, it is necessary to detect those process faults as early as possible, which will otherwise significantly affect the product quality.</p><p>It is the objective of this work to study KPI prediction and diagnosis and their application to a hot strip mill process in the steel manufacturing industry. To this end, we have decided, based on our experiences in monitoring and control of hot strip mill processes, to apply data-driven techniques.</p><p>The most popular data-driven methods to achieve fault-diagnosis tasks are principle component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and partial least squares (PLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which are proposed in the multivariate statistical framework and become dominant datadriven tools for complex industrial processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In particular, PLS is widely accepted in industry as a KPI prediction method with superior ability in processing a huge amount of highly correlated process data. The original idea behind the PLS is to identify the correlation model between the measured process variables and KPI and, based on it, to predict KPI using online observations of process variables. For diagnosis purposes, a PLS-related approach aims to detect the faults in process variables that are mostly related to the KPI. Although the PLS-based KPI prediction and diagnosis have been utilized in many applications, some deficits have been reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Moreover, the performance of PLS relevant methods is limited in coping with the KPI prediction and diagnosis in (highly) dynamic industrial processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and sophisticated extensions are needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by these observations, we will address two topics in this paper: 1) developing an efficient data-driven KPI prediction and diagnosis scheme for static processes, which will offer an alternative solution to the PLS method, and 2) proposing a data-driven KPI prediction and diagnosis scheme for dynamic processes. Our major goal is to solve KPI prediction and diagnosis problems met in the hot strip mill process.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, an alternative solution to the PLS method is first introduced. It is followed by the study on the data-driven design of dynamic KPI prediction and diagnosis. Section III is dedicated to the application to an industrial hot strip mill process. The process description, industry requirements, as well as process abnormalities will be presented in detail. The proposed data-driven approaches are implemented on the hot strip mill process, and the achieved results are discussed in Section IV.</p><p>Notation: The notation adopted throughout this paper is fairly standard.</p><p>denotes the -dimensional Euclidean space, is the set of all real matrices, and is a square diagonal matrix.</p><p>represents mean value. means that is normal distributed with zero mean and covariance (matrix) .</p><p>stands for -distribution with degrees of freedom and, associated with it, and for the probability of equal to (significance level).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. KPI PREDICTION AND DIAGNOSIS</head><p>This section is devoted to the development of a KPI computation and prediction scheme, which includes two algorithms, respectively, for static and dynamic processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. KPI Prediction and Diagnosis Approach for Static Processes</head><p>PLS is a standard technique widely used in practice for the KPI computation and prediction. Let and be process measurement (observation) vector and the KPI vector, respectively. Assume that and denote the normalized process observations and KPI vectors, respectively, by and satisfying</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where and represent the standard deviations of the th process observation and the th KPI. The core of the standard PLS method is to identify the correlation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> using the process observation and KPI data, where is the coefficient matrix, and is residual vector in the KPI subspace. Let , , , be samples of the recorded process observations and KPIs and build the data sets where , and , , are the normalized process observation and KPI vectors as defined by ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>) with the estimates Based on and , will be identified and, moreover, the process observation subspace is, according to their correlation with KPIs, decomposed into two subspaces: the prediction subspace and the residual subspace, which should be as less correlated with KPIs as possible.</p><p>In their recent work, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> have demonstrated that by means of the standard PLS algorithm the residual subspace may be strongly correlated with which leads to poor prediction performance due to the loss of useful information <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. On the other hand, they have also shown that the prediction subspace may contain the component which is uncorrelated with . This means, in turn, that unnecessary computation is included in the prediction and, more critical for the real application, the key variables used for the KPI prediction are redundant.</p><p>Here, we propose an alternative KPI prediction approach to improve the prediction performance on the one hand and simplify the needed computation procedure on the other hand. To this end, we decompose the KPI subspace orthogonally into two parts: , which is correlated with , and uncorrelated with . This decomposition can be modelled by ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) with (4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> It follows from ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) that <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> Now, multiplying to both sides of ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) yields which can be, considering <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, further written into <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> since, for large , . Let</p><p>(9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> be an SVD (singular value decomposition) of , where represent those (very) small singular values caused by the possible linear dependence among the measurement variables. Thus, the projection removes those redundant measurements, and an estimate for is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> It is worth noting that represents a normalized projection that delivers a redundancy-free measurement vector. For our purpose of KPI prediction, we further decompose by an SVD as follows:</p><p>where , , , . Let be a projection of onto , which satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and can be viewed as a key variable vector for the detection. The prediction of based on is given by ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> We now address the issue of detecting those process faults which cause changes in the KPIs. For this purpose, consider the distribution of satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> It is thus reasonable to apply the following statistic for the detection purpose: Note that ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) As a result, we propose to use as the test statistic, which saves the online computation and avoids possible numerical problems caused by the (very) small singular values in . Considering the possible limited number of available data, the threshold is set to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where is -distribution with and degrees of freedom and is the user-specified significance level. Finally, the detection logic is faults in process variables that will affect KPIs, otherwise fault-free To complete our study, we give the projection of the process measurement onto the so-called residual subspace of the process variables It is clear that any fault in this subspace will not cause any change in the KPIs. can be used to build the test statistic for detecting the faults in the residual subspace.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, the complete algorithm is summarized. Notice that the computational complexity of the standard PLS and the proposed approach mainly comes from performing SVD on covariance matrices with different dimensions. The standard PLS needs times SVD on an matrix, where is the number of latent variables. The computation cost of the proposed approach mainly comes from two SVDs on an and an matrix, which shows relatively lower computation cost compared with PLS in the case of . Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the number of latent variables is an important design parameter in standard PLS to achieve successful fault diagnosis. The leave-N-out cross validation is mostly referred in the literature for selecting the number of latent variables. Although it is a widely used criterion in practice, different results can be obtained with different sample size , which may influence the performance of the complete process monitoring system. Based on this observation, the modified approach without such a design parameter will show more advantages from the application point of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. KPI Prediction and Diagnosis Approach for Dynamic Processes</head><p>Although rarely emphasized in publications, data normalization described in (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>), both in the training and online monitoring phases, plays an important role in the PLS, dynamic PLS (DPLS) methods, and in the approach proposed above. It is evident that such a normalization can only be successfully realized under the stationary operating condition. The key step of all approaches is the normalization procedure, in which the process variables are mean centered and often variance-scaled to further construct the residual signals and test statistics. In real applications, we often meet situations that the process under consideration is in dynamic operations. In this case, the performance of those normalization procedure of PLS-related methods is limited. On the other hand, it is known that the main advantage of the model-based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> lies in their ability to deal with dynamic process monitoring and diagnosis. It is similar to normalization procedure in PLS-related approaches but the residual signal is constructed by utilizing analytical process model to remove deterministic influence in the considered process variable. A successful application of the model-based techniques requires a sophisticated modeling procedure, which is often not realizable and a handicap especially for applications in complex industrial processes. Motivated by these observations, we propose next a data-driven method for the KPI prediction and fault detection.</p><p>Our study is inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, where a subspace technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> aided approach is proposed for a data-driven design of observer-based fault diagnosis system without identification of the complete process model. Suppose that the (dynamic) relationship between the process variables and KPIs under consideration are modeled as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by (18) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where represents a state vector describing the dynamic process between the process variables (observations) (input vector without normalization) and the KPIs (output vector without normalization). , represent zero-mean, Gaussian distributed white noises which are statistically independent of the process variables. The system matrices , , , and and the system order are unknown a priori. Similar to the static case given in (3), model ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) can be understood as a decomposition of the KPI vector into two parts:</p><p>, where represents the part correlated with process variables and represents the uncorrelated part, i.e.,</p><p>In the model-based fault diagnosis framework, residual generation is a key step. In our application, it deals with the design of a dynamic system satisfying (</p><p>It is demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> where is an estimate of and delivered, e.g., by an identity observer. The basic idea of our approach is to identify , which is also called left coprime factorization (LCF) of system ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>), based on property <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and then to estimate the KPIs using relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> </p><p>Now, do the following QR decomposition:</p><p>(24) Since for , there exists so that <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and can be determined by the following SVD: <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> Note that, for , , and any <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> Thus, analogous to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, is called the data-driven realization of the LCF of ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>).</p><p>Although can be used for the purpose of KPI computation and prediction, the needed online computation is involved. Moreover, the prediction can only be achieved in a (large) time interval. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, a method to construct an observer or observer-based residual generator based on is proposed, which is applied for our purpose. For the sake of simplicity, we only introduce the realization for the single KPI case, i.e., , which is also the case addressed in our study on the real process in Section III.</p><p>Let be a row of . Write it into with</p><p>It has been proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> that is the so-called parity vector of the th-order and . Using the relation between a parity vector and the solution of the so-called Luenberger equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, two types of KPI predictors can be constructed as follows.</p><p>• In case that KPI is on-line measurable:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(27)<label>(28)</label></formula><p>• In case that KPI is not online measurable:  It is worth to mention that an order-reduction algorithm has been provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> so that KPI predictor ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) or ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">29</ref>) of the th-order can be designed. Moreover, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, two algorithms are given for the construction of predictors for multiple KPIs.</p><p>For detecting faults in the KPI subspace, we address two cases. If the KPI is online measurable, then delivers a residual signal with (31) It is well-known <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> that Thus, can be determined by , based on which test statistic and the detection logic are defined as follows:</p><p>(32) fault free, otherwise faulty.</p><p>(33)</p><p>In the case that no online KPI measurement is available, we use the KPI prediction delivered by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">29</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>) and build, on the assumption that the process is in the steady state and the (constant) mean value of , , is known and identified in terms of the recorded process data, the residual As a result, the test statistic and the detection logic (32) and (33) can be adopted.</p><p>The algorithm given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref> is a summary of the major results here. It is worth to mentioning the following.</p><p>• In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a data-driven design of Kalman-filter-based residual generation is proposed, which can also be adopted for the KPI prediction. • Different from the standard subspace technique, in the approach proposed above the residual generator is directly identified by means of the process data. Moreover, it is  achieved based on the data-driven realization of the LCF by using <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, which is computationally less consuming and more reliable. This is also the major different to the approaches proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The proposed KPI related prediction and diagnosis approaches have been applied on an industrial hot strip mill process, which will be introduced in Section III.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. APPLICATION IN INDUSTRIAL HOT STRIP MILL</head><p>Here, the above proposed KPI prediction and diagnosis scheme for static as well as dynamic processes are applied to a key process in the steel manufacturing industry: the hot strip mill.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Industrial Hot Strip Mill Description</head><p>As schematically described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the industrial hot strip mill basically consists of six subprocesses in turn. The furnaces heat the steel slab up to approximately 1200 C, where the thickness is about 200 mm. Then the slab is rolled back and forth in the roughing mill to about 28-45 mm thick with output temperature around 1050 C. After transported through transfer table, the head and tail of the strip are sheared to prevent damaging the work rolls. The finishing mill has the most significant influence on the final thickness of steel strip, in which the controlled variables include average gap and total force of the 7 finishing mill stands and work roll bending (WRB) force of the last six stands (WRB force of the first stand is not measured). The thickness and temperature of the strip after finishing rolling are around 850 C-950 C and 1.5-12.7 mm, respectively. As is well known from materials science, the kinetics of metallurgical transformations and the flow stress of the rolled steel strip are dominantly controlled by the temperature, which is mainly determined by the coiling temperature control (CTC). Thus, the following subprocess, i.e., laminar cooling, plays a quite important role in steel production industry. At the end, the strips are coiled as intermediate or final products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Implementation of KPI Prediction and Diagnosis Scheme</head><p>A four-step implementation procedure for KPI prediction and diagnosis scheme is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. At first, KPIs should be defined according to specific process characteristics, economical benefits, and quality requirements. In the case of hot strip  mill, strip thickness, temperature, and flatness can be defined as KPIs for instance. The next step is to select process variables which are responsible for the given KPIs. The realization of this step is mainly based on the process knowledge, but some data based methods also exist, e.g., causality analysis and transfer entropy. As an example for demonstrating the effectiveness of our novel methods, we define the finishing mill exit strip thickness as a KPI. According to our knowledge about the case process, 20 process variables are selected. Together with the KPI, the process variables are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>. The offline training as well as the online prediction and diagnosis procedures have been realized as described in Section II for static and dynamic processes, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>As discussed so far, the first objective of our study is to predict KPI, i.e., thickness of the strip, only based on the process variables. The process variables listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref> are utilized to predict KPI in case of normal operation. The prediction performance of the static approach can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, in  which the predicted thickness shows relatively smooth variations around 3.95 mm, since dynamic property of the underlying process has not been taken into account.</p><p>On the other hand, the data-driven LCF-based dynamic approach is able to deal with dynamic processes, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. It is obvious from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> that the dynamic prediction approach with unmeasurable KPI shows better performance than the static one. Since KPI measurements are used for Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, the predicted strip thickness are almost equal to the measurement, which is similar to the case with the application of a filter-or observer-based scheme.</p><p>The result of KPI based plant abnormality/performance degradation diagnosis for static processes is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, the first (around) 100 samples belong to the transition phase, where the static model trained with normal precess data in steady state is not yet valid. This is why the overshoot of threshold does not indicate any fault scenario. As given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, from the 1001st sample, an additive fault happens in , i.e., the third stand's total force. Because of the complexity and closed-loop nature of real-life plants, the fault has propagated to other process    are given in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref>. We can see that all three methods have delivered successful fault-detection results. Nevertheless, the approaches for dynamic processes give more useful information for fault diagnosis in the sense of early detection. We can also see that both dynamic approaches have detected the fault with less time delay than the static one. Since KPI measurements are utilized for Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, the diagnosis performance in sense of detection time and fault sensitivity is better than the dynamic approach without KPI measurements. (Remark: the overshoots during the starting phase in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref> are mainly caused by initial state uncertainty of the LCF-based algorithm).</p><p>We would like to remark that, regarding industrial implementation, it is generally not wise to claim that the dynamic approach is superior to the static one or with the order reversed. Selection of prediction and diagnosis method should be dependent of the underlying process nature (e.g., how significant/fast is the dynamic), computation limitation, memory cost, economic benefits, robustness requirements, and design complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a data-driven scheme for KPI prediction and diagnosis for complex industrial processes. Compared with standard static approaches, e.g., PLS, the proposed approach can improve the prediction performance and significantly simplify the needed computation steps involved in diagnosis, as discussed in Section II. For dynamic processes, the well-known LCF technique has been realized in a data-driven fashion, based on which efficient KPI prediction and diagnosis algorithms have been developed with measurable and unmeasurable KPIs, respectively. The industrial implementation issues of the proposed KPI prediction and diagnosis scheme have been discussed in Section III. With a successful application to an industrial hot strip mill process, the effectiveness and issues have been discussed in Section IV.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
