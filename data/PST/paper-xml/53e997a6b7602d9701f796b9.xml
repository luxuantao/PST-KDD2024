<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Human creativity represents an enigma to the research community: It is all but impossible to describe the process in unequivocal terms, yet there is a strong desire to promote and encourage this uniquely human activity. Within the realm of human-computer interaction, the challenge is to understand in what ways technology can enhance the creative process. In the past, research on creativity focused on the individual and the individual's internal cognitive processes. As a result, there exists a legacy of guidelines and frameworks for building computer-based tools that encourage and promote individual creativity. However, recent research has begun to paint a more complicated picture of creativity that highlights the importance of social interactions, mentoring, and collaboration in creative work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8]</ref>. The importance of analyzing creativity in this more holistic sense is readily apparent when one considers that most creative pursuits in industry involve interdisciplinary teams working together to develop a product that cannot be created by a single individual alone. The question for HCI research becomes then: What tools, methodologies, and practices can support creativity of individuals in interdisciplinary teams?</p><p>There are a number of important differences in driving forces behind individual and collaborative creativity. By understanding factors that influence collaborative creativity we can devise ways to promote and enhance it and build a foundation for develop-ment of computer-based tools that augment the creative process. This article presents a view on interdisciplinary creative collaboration inspired by two separate sources. One is a practitioner's experience of creative collaboration in a music and sound design company. Another is based on a long-standing research program observing the collaboration of artists and technologists during the COSTART artist-in-residency studies at Loughborough University, U.K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The two creative environments discussed here serve as catalysts for bringing together collaborators with various backgrounds, skill sets, and experience levels. Despite the differences in goals between the two environments, both seek to develop teams that can uniquely solve a problem through their collective efforts, and both environments have done so with relative success. It is therefore instructive to analyze the commonalities between these two environments-one a commercial enterprise, the other a research institution-to better understand how to encourage collaborative creativity in other situations.</p><p>In both environments, we have observed collaborators engage in a process consisting roughly of three main activities: creative conceptualization, realization (or implementation), and evaluation. Within these three activities, partners in collaboration tend to adopt certain roles, which are especially noticeable and pronounced between artists and technologists (rather than within groups of artists or technologists). We describe these roles as models of collaboration, which we sum-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collaborative Creativity</head><p>marize as an assistant model, a full partnership model, and a partnership model, depicted in the figures appearing here. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> provides an overview of the three main activities compared to the participants (artists and technologists), while Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> depicts the assistant, full partnership, and partnership models respectively. Strong involvement, influence, and leadership by a collaborator are indicated by shaded areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>. The assistant model is the one most commonly observed in a commercial creative team setting, where collaborators assume the responsibility for different phases of the project, and often even join the project for a brief time and leave after fulfilling their parts. This model is sometimes referred to as a conveyer model. We argue that the second model, which we define as partnership, presents significant benefits for creative collaboration and discuss ways to achieve these benefits here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creative Collaboration through Partnership</head><p>In a full partnership situation, complementary interests exist even where the outcomes by each individual party may differ. Indeed, one of the most successful ongoing partnerships observed in the artist-in-residence studies operated in such a way as to serve convergent interests though it produced quite distinct artistic outcomes. The partners are able to achieve mutual benefit but at the same time, retain ownership of their individual achievements. Such mutual benefit requires the relin-quishing of individual control of the creative process and different, but complementary, roles appear to be best suited to achieving that end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supporting Interdisciplinary Collaboration</head><p>Computing technology has a vast potential to support interdisciplinary creative collaboration. Here, we discuss the requirements for a successful partnership based upon the experience of the COSTART project, and suggest some opportunities for the development of computer-based tools.</p><p>Devising a Shared Language. An ability to communicate and exchange creative ideas is an essential part of the creative process. For an interdisciplinary group, this ability can be impaired by the differences in the group members' professional vocabulary and the concepts they use. Participants' success in reaching a common creative vision, brainstorming, exchanging creative ideas and evaluating them depends on the ability of the group to devise a shared language. One of the successful practices for reaching a shared understanding in an audio design world is the use of metaphors that relate specific terms and concepts to real-world scenarios and situations familiar to everyone. In this way, an interaction designer might describe a desired sound as a "church bell" or a "gentle whisper," and a composer can extract the necessary musical components from such metaphors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>By Lena Mamykina, Linda Candy, and Ernest Edmonds</head><p>There are a number of potent directions for providing support in devising a shared language. One way is to help team members understand and learn each other's professional jargon with automated interpretation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. Frequently, however, the vocabulary needs to be task-dependent, custom or unique to the team and the environment, and developed by the team over an extended period of time and during multiple projects. In cases like this, teams need tools that allow them to capture, annotate, and reuse custom vocabulary. In our earlier example of successful metaphor use, the collaborators would benefit from the ability to reuse successful metaphors or to learn from unsuccessful ones. In their work discussing communities of practice, Brown and Duguid [2] note the natural tendency for people to develop and communicate stories as a way of informally disseminating important onthe-job information. Another approach developed by Thomas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> and discussed in this issue is the development of a pattern language that captures solutions to a recurring problem in patterns and is meant to stimulate thought without providing an inflexible, possibly inappropriate structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing a Common Understanding of the Artistic Intentions and Vision.</head><p>A shared language is a great asset in developing a common understanding of the artistic intentions and vision. However, the language of creative exchange does not have to be verbal. People often use design artifacts to express their creative vision. For example, during a brainstorming session, an interaction designer might start drawing flow charts, whereas a composer would create musical sketches using a keyboard. These demonstrations of creative ideas and visions, when the right tools are available, greatly reduce the risk of misunderstanding and fruitless arguments.</p><p>Fluid and open communication is a necessary con-dition for reaching a shared vision. One way to encourage communication in an interdisciplinary team is to provide lightweight ways to support articulation of thought. For example, there are multiple commercially available tools supporting the development of low-fidelity design artifacts, such as sketches and prototypes. There are also multiple practices developed in the HCI community, such as paper prototyping, Wizard of Oz prototyping, storytelling, and role-playing. What is lacking in some of these tools is the ability to easily develop, store, annotate, and share multimedia and multiformat prototypes and sketches.</p><p>Engaging in Extensive Discussions and What-if Sessions. Development of a common understanding of the artistic intentions and vision requires that collaborators engage in extensive discussions and what-if sessions. Within this phase of collaboration the interdisciplinary nature of the group confers multiple benefits to the participants. They can present different, often complementary views on the problem and help each other break away from obvious solutions. During such discussions, the ability to capture ideas, annotate them and store them for future reference allows the group to build a shared knowledge resource that has innumerable benefits.</p><p>In creative work it is also important to be able to track the progress of an idea or revisit design decisions. To this end, there are encouraging developments emerging in lightweight capture and annotation of design histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. Interdisciplinary collaboration presents a new context and new benefits of design histories. Participants can refer to captured design progress to learn each other's approaches, or to track the development of a creative idea without having to explicitly discuss it. However, it is important to remember the need for multiformat sketching and allow information designers, visual designers, composers, and other creative professionals to explore creative ideas within the same environment.</p><p>Developers of tools for creativity support should be mindful of differences in cognitive styles, which are typical for different disciplines or even for individuals with the same professional backgrounds. For example, when working on an audio interface, an interaction designer might start with building a conceptual framework concentrating on logical flow and relationships between elements, using tools that support and encourage it, such as flowchart applications. A composer, on the other hand, is more likely to engage in a free-form exploration, creating and discarding many musical ideas simultaneously, possibly without capturing them. Development of tools that support creative exploration should reflect these different approaches, allowing for structured and linear explorations, as well Tools that support articulation of creative ideas and allow for better exchange between different disciplines can eliminate some of the barriers in interdisciplinary collaboration.</p><p>as free form and parallel discovery.</p><p>Sharing Knowledge Resources. An effective working relationship exists where both parties exchange knowledge resources in order to make progress and resolve difficulties of both a technical and artistic nature. The sharing of knowledge is an important facilitator of creative collaboration. It also depends upon the parties having complementary rather than identical skills. A partnership that aims to be self-sufficient must also know its limits and be willing to carry out the necessary research when the knowledge is insufficient. Indeed, self-sufficiency in technical knowhow, or at least the quest for it through research, can be in itself a stimulus to creative thought. Being able to learn through knowledge sharing is beneficial and it particularly applies where having a direct contact with a new way of thinking stimulates the generation of options.</p><p>Tools like CoWeb, mailing lists, and newsgroups are commonly used by commercial enterprises to enhance communication and share knowledge resources. Capturing and distributing successful practices in case studies can foster this sharing. Computer-based methods that enable users to broadcast Web site information to one another combined with shared drawing and knowledge-based support to decision making have been developed in prototype form but are not yet commercially available <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Observations and analysis of the creative work of an interdisciplinary team, whether in industry or in academic settings, can greatly increase our understanding of factors that influence it and the driving forces behind it. Carefully developed tools that provide lightweight support for articulation of creative ideas and allow for better exchange between different disciplines can eliminate some of the barriers in interdisciplinary collaboration. However, the questions of interdisciplinary collaboration are more complex and are a subject for studies in organizational behavior, leadership and management, social sciences, and even architecture and space design. The importance of creating an emotional as well as physical environment that encourages creativity should not be underestimated. The atmosphere of trust, encouragement, and risk-free exploration as well as incentives for creative investigation is a necessary part of any creative culture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
