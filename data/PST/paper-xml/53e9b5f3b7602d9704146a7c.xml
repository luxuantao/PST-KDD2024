<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A. Introduction to the KAIST OLEV W ITH INCREASING concern over global warming and energy issues, electric vehicles are being considered as an alternative to vehicles with an internal combustion engine. Over the last couple of years, automotive makers and researchers have introduced numerous ideas for new electric transportation systems to meet the new market demand and social and economic requirements. Although some automotive makers have already introduced commercial versions of electric Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. System configuration of the OLEV System (above) and a prototype of the OLEV system operating at the KAIST campus (below).</p><p>vehicles, there are still technical and economic limitations, mainly caused by the weight and size of the battery, the cost of the battery, the long battery charging time, and the limited availability of charging stations. The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV) has been developed to overcome the limitations of the current generation of battery-powered electric vehicles. The OLEV shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is a battery-powered transportation system that remotely picks up electricity from power transmitters buried underground. The system utilizes the innovative wireless charging technology developed by Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in South Korea <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The OLEV mainly consists of vehicles and power transmitters. Note that, although the name OLEV literally refers to the vehicle, it actually includes the integrated system that consists of a vehicle or a fleet of vehicles together with the charging units, which are the power transmitters installed on the road. The vehicle is similar to the conventional electric vehicle, i.e., an electric motor is used as a main engine and a battery pack is installed to supply the energy to the motor. However, unlike conventional electric vehicles that require a cable connection between the car and the charger or power outlet when the battery needs to be recharged, the battery in the OLEV can be wirelessly charged from the transmitters using the noncontact charging mechanism. The power transmitter  generates a magnetic field to provide the vehicle with the required energy. Each power transmitter consists of an inverter and inductive cables buried under the roadway, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. An inductive cable installed for the prototype system developed at the KAIST campus is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. The length of the inductive cable varies depending on the road condition and power requirements. Multiple transmitters are installed on the route to supply enough power to the OLEV. One of the main benefits of wireless charging systems is that no cable connection is required for charging. Moreover, the wireless technology developed at KAIST enables vehicles to be charged while they are in motion, thus significantly reducing the charging downtime.</p><p>Recognized as one of the 50 Best Innovations of 2010 by TIME Magazine <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the OLEV is now considered a potential solution for the next-generation electric public bus system in Seoul, Korea <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A commercialization process is in progress at the time of writing of this paper. One of the main tasks for achieving successful commercialization of the system is to determine how to allocate economically the power transmitters on the road and how to determine the right battery capacity. With given routes and bus operation policies, transmitting enough energy through the power transmitters to the bus is the critical design variable. The allocation of the power transmitters and size of the battery capacity also directly affect the initial infrastructure cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Background Research and Applications of the Wireless Power Transfer Technology</head><p>The history of wireless power transfer technology started when Maxwell's equation was first introduced in 1862. The equation is essentially the first theoretical foundation of wireless power transfer technology. The technological develop-ments and research progress since Maxwell's equation are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The recent advancements in wireless power transfer technologies have enabled various commercial applications, particularly in small electronic devices such as mobile phones and small personal devices. Wireless power transfer technology can be applied to charge the batteries in such equipment without the need for a wire connection. For example, Qualcomm introduced a wireless charging solution for mobile phones with resonant coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Researchers at Kyoto University, Japan, have recently demonstrated a mobile phone that transmits both power and information via microwave connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. For systems that use only very low power, the concept of "energy harvesting" has been proposed, which utilizes wireless power transmission technology. Energy harvesting is the process by which energy is directed, captured, and stored from external sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is one of the well-known applications that uses the concept of energy harvesting. A review of the recent progress in wireless power transfer technology for RFID can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The commercial application of wireless power transfer technology is not limited to small electronic devices. One emerging application that utilizes such wireless charging technology is electric vehicles. In 2006, the team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, introduced a resonant coupler that transmits a large amount of power (from watts to kilowatts) over midlength distances at low frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. WiTricity, which is a company developing commercial applications with MIT's solution, is already introducing products such as wireless charging stations for car parks, garages, and beyond <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Daimler (which owns Mercedes-Benz and Smart) is teaming up with Conductix-Wampfler and Röchling Automotive KG to develop wireless charging solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Hino Motors and Showa Aircraft in Japan applied inductive coupling in wireless power transfer to an electric bus called the inductive power transfer electric vehicle. The bus operated in an experimental environment from April 13, 2009 to April 27, 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>There have been some research studies on the application of wireless power transfer technologies for electric vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The KAIST OLEV utilizes a resonant coupling technique for wireless power supply. Power from the 60-Hz supply is converted to a frequency of 20 kHz by the inverter, and a current of 200 A flows through the power transmitter; 60 kW of power may be wirelessly transferred from the power transmitters with 80% efficiency. Huh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> introduced the technological development of the inductive power supply system adopted in the OLEV. The power supply, power transmitter, and wireless transfer mechanisms in the OLEV were discussed in the paper. Suh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> presented the design concept of the OLEV with axiomatic design theory. They also briefly discussed the economic benefit of the OLEV compared with conventional electric vehicles. The wireless charging mechanism in the OLEV was introduced in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. These studies specifically considered the process of efficiency improvement for the wireless charging mechanism used in the OLEV. The history of the OLEV development process at KAIST was described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. More detailed information about the mechanical and electrical design issues and the wireless power transfer technology used in the OLEV can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The papers aforementioned explained the wireless power transmission issues and hardware design issues of the OLEV, focusing on the hardware mechanism of the wireless power transmission in the OLEV. However, there has been little research on the OLEV from the perspective of a road-vehicle integrated transportation system. The mathematical model and formulation presented in this paper are based on the ideas proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Goal and Organization of the Paper</head><p>In this paper, we consider an OLEV-based mass transportation system in which multiple identical buses service a fixed route. The OLEV is an integrated road-vehicle system, and the size of the battery in the vehicles and the number of transmitters installed on the road directly affect the overall performance and cost of the transportation system. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the system issues of the OLEV-based transportation system, which we illustrate with a mathematical model. Another goal of this paper is to describe the method for determining the key design variables of the transportation system-the battery size and allocation of the power transmitters-which are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. Section II describes the system modeling issues of the OLEV. The detailed mathematical model describing the dynamic behavior of the OLEV system is presented in Section III. The optimization problem and the solution algorithm using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) are explained in Section IV. A case with numerical solutions and system sensitivity issues are discussed in Section V. The summary and further research directions are described in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. ONLINE ELECTRIC VEHICLE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Wireless Charging System</head><p>The wireless power transfer system for the OLEV is composed of an inverter, an inductive cable, a pickup device, a capacitor, a battery, and a motor, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Power from the 60-Hz supply is converted to a frequency of 20 kHz by the inverter, and a current of 200 A flows through the inductive cable. The magnetic flux generated from the cable is collected by the pickup device to generate dc power for the vehicle motor. A more detailed description of the system's power transfer mechanism and hardware configuration can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. When a vehicle is operating on a road with a power transmitter installed, as shown in the lower part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, the power pickup device installed underneath the vehicle remotely collects electricity from the transmitter and distributes the power either to the motor or to the battery or both, depending on the power requirement of the motor and the charging level of the battery. However, when the OLEV is running where no power transmitter unit is installed, the motor in the vehicle uses the power from the battery. This situation is shown in the upper part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>.</p><p>The wireless power transmission technology enables the motor to receive power remotely while the vehicle is operating on the road; hence, the vehicle does not need to be idle  while recharging the battery. As a result, the OLEV does not need to carry a heavy and bulky battery. The disadvantage of the OLEV is the initial investment cost. Compared with the existing plug-in electric vehicle system, the OLEV requires a significant initial investment to build the power transmitters. However, this initial cost can be offset by the reduced battery size and increased operating time by eliminating the recharging downtime of the vehicles. Investigating this tradeoff is critical in the commercialization of the OLEV system. More specifically, there is a tradeoff between the capacity of the battery and allocation of the power transmitters. If the vehicle has a battery with a large capacity, fewer transmitters are needed. However, a vehicle with a small battery may require more frequent recharges; thus, more transmitters should be installed. As the costs of the battery and power transmitters account for a significant portion of the total investment cost of the OLEV, the tradeoff should be carefully analyzed. To position optimally the transmitters and determine the battery capacity, the energy consumption rate of the vehicle and the charging rate of the power transmitters should be quantitatively modeled. Furthermore, the model should consider the physical constraints in installing the power transmitters. For example, a road on a bridge or on an overpass may not have enough space for power transmitters. The quantitative model evaluating the optimal battery size and the placement of the power transmitters should consider these physical constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Practical Motivation of the Optimization Model</head><p>This paper is motivated by the first commercial OLEV system operating in Seoul Grand Park, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. The city government of Seoul has recently adopted the OLEV technology for the shuttle buses circulating in the amusement park as a test case before applying the technology to an actual mass transportation system in the city <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The OLEV-based shuttle buses are running at a speed between 20-40 km/h on the circular route, with a total length of 2.85 km. The authors found two major issues in the current deployment of the OLEV-based shuttle buses. First, the capacity of the battery in the shuttle bus was determined without considering the allocation of the power transmitters. We found that when the shuttle system was developed, the vehicle design and the route design were considered in separate design processes. In the vehicle design process, the vehicle hardware specifications were determined, including the capacity of the battery. Once the vehicle design process was complete, the route was designed, including the allocation of the power transmitters. There is a close performance correlation between the capacity of the battery and the allocation of the power transmitters. In addition, the costs of the battery and the power transmitters account for a significant portion of the total cost of the system. Therefore, we believe that a more cost-efficient solution can be provided by analyzing together the battery capacity and the allocation of the power transmitter. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model of the OLEV-based transportation system circulating on a single fixed route. There are multiple vehicles in the system, and they are traveling in one direction. The loading/unloading stations are also predetermined in the route. We also assume that the vehicle operates with a predefined velocity profile; thus, the speed of the vehicle at a specific location on the route is deterministically defined. We also consider the attitude on the route. With this information, the required energy for the vehicle at a specific point can be evaluated. The mathematical modeling constructed in this paper is based on the actual OLEV model deployed in Seoul Grand Park. Although the modeling approach and optimization are particularly designed for the OLEV in Seoul Grand Park, they could be utilized as a fundamental building block for more complicated models to be developed in the future. Another motivation of this paper is to provide an analytical foundation for emerging intelligent transportation systems that integrate the vehicle, the driver, and the road (the general environment). The advancement of in-vehicle information systems and accurate GPS technology opens the door for the efficient operation of transportation systems, such as better fleet management and real-time scheduling of public transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Note that the OLEV is an existing vehicle-driver-road integrated system. There is strong potential for further development of the OLEV system if the system can effectively utilize advanced in-vehicle information and realtime traffic data. For example, traffic and location information may enable efficient real-time energy control of the OLEV, i.e., optimal charging decisions could be made in real time based on the energy requirement to the destination, traffic conditions, and other real-time data. The analytical model proposed in this paper could be extended to create an analytical building block for the OLEV system utilizing the advanced in-vehicle information system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. OPTIMIZATION MODEL DEVELOPMENT</head><p>The purpose of developing a mathematical model of the OLEV system is to construct an optimization problem to min-imize the total cost of the system. Here, we first define the notations with the model descriptions, and then, we explain the modeling assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Model Descriptions and Notations</head><p>The proposed model is based on the actual OLEV system operating in Seoul Grand Parks, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>.</p><p>1) The vehicle is operating on a fixed route, where there are multiple stopping points to load and unload passengers. The total length of the route is denoted by L.</p><p>2) The route information, such as the location of the stations, stopping points, and the degree of slope (hill profile) are given.</p><p>3) The k numbers of identical OLEVs are operated separately. The number of vehicles k is given. The power transmitter can provide enough power even when there are multiple vehicles operating on the same inductive cable. 4) Each vehicle is equipped with one battery unit, and the battery capacity is identical for all the vehicles. The cost of the battery is proportional to the capacity. The battery cost per unit capacity (in kilowatthours) is denoted by c bat . 5) The N numbers of power transmitters are installed separately. 6) Let x o i and x f i indicate the starting point and end point of the power cable of the ith power transmitter unit, respectively. The cable length of the ith transmitter y i is simply x f ix o i . These values should satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x o i &lt; x f i , for i = 1, . . . , N x f i &lt; x o i+1 , for i = 1, . . . , N -1 N i y i ≤ L.</formula><p>With these notations, allocating a power transmitter in this paper refers to determining the starting x o i and end x f i points of the power cable of the ith transmitter. The total number of transmitters N is also a decision variable. 7) There is a limit on the length of the transmitter cable due to the power supply limit of the inverter. The limit is denoted by L max c , and the constraint is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y i ≤ L max c for i = 1, . . . , N.</formula><p>8) The installation cost of one transmitter consists of the cost of the inverter c inv [unit cost per inverter] and the cost of the transmitter cable c cable [unit cost per cable length], which is proportional to the length of the cable (this cost includes the construction and equipment costs). Then, the installation cost of the power transmitter i is described by the function denoted by c i , such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">c(i) = c inv + c cable • y i .</formula><p>9) The maximum battery capacity of the OLEV is I max . This value is determined by the optimization problem. 10) The state of the charge level of the OLEV at time t is presented by I(t). 11) Let I high and I low be the maximum and minimum chargeable battery capacities, respectively, of the OLEV during its operation. They satisfy the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I high = α • I max I low = β • I max</formula><p>where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ β ≤ α. These α and β are constants and given. 12) The state-of-charge (SOC) level at the initial starting point is I high , and the remaining battery capacity of the OLEV during operation should always be greater than I low . Therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I low ≤ I(t) ≤ I high .</formula><p>13) The charge/supply rate of electricity per unit time is always greater than the electricity consumption rate per unit time of the OLEV in operation, and our model reflects this fact. 14) There is one base station on the route, which is used as a parking area when the OLEVs are idle. We assume that there is a power transmitter installed in the base station, and it is the starting point of the route. Therefore, once a vehicle completes a round trip, it moves to the base station, and the battery is fully charged before it begins the next trip.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Modeling Assumptions</head><p>The following assumptions are considered in the model:</p><p>1) The battery cost is proportional to the maximum capacity of the battery I max , hence c bat • I max . This is a reasonable assumption because the battery pack used in the electric vehicle consists of multiple battery cells. The capacity of the battery is normally determined by the number of cells in the battery pack; thus, the cost of the battery is linearly proportional to the number of cells.</p><p>2) The SOC level is linearly proportional to the charging time, as long as the level of the charge is between I high and I low , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. This assumption is based on the mechanism of the charging controller in the OLEV. The charging limits are set to maximize the battery life. Therefore, if the vehicle is traveling on a route with a power transmitter installed, the level of charge in the battery will increase. Note that, although the entire spectrum of the charging state is nonlinear, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, the charging state within I high and I low , which is the actual state range in the OLEV, is almost a straight line. Therefore, the charging rate, denoted by P cs , is assumed to be constant. The linear energy charging and discharging assumption is widely used in electric vehicle modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. 3) Regenerative braking-an energy recovery mechanism that slows a vehicle down by converting its kinetic energy into electric energy and charges the battery simultaneously-is neglected in the model. This is a reasonable assumption because the OLEV operates at a relatively low speed, and the energy generated by the regenerative braking is negligible. 4) The OLEVs are driven following a fixed and predefined speed profile for the route, expressed by the function V (x). That is, at a point x, we can predict that the vehicle is running at a speed V (x). In an actual operational condition, drivers may not follow the predefined profile exactly, and there is some variability in the vehicle speed. However, our recent investigation of the actual driving data from the OLEV in Seoul Grand Park has indicated that the drivers followed the velocity instructions fairly well <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Therefore, when operating in a special environment such as the Seoul Grand Park, a fixed velocity profile is a reasonable assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Power Requirement</head><p>In this paper, we consider k vehicles operating on a fixed route. The required power for the vehicles at a specific point x on the route, denoted by P te (x), is approximated with F te (x) and V (x), which are the required force and velocity for point x. Again, V (x) is the velocity profile, where a vehicle is expected to run at V (x) at point x on the route. The required force at each point is decomposed into the five applied forces: rolling resistance force F rr , air resistance force F ad , hill climbing force F hc , linear acceleration force F la , and wheel acceleration force F wa . In general, the magnitude values of both air resistance and wheel acceleration are relatively small; thus, we assume that these two forces can be neglected. As a consequence, the driving force can be described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F te = F rr + F hc + F la . (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>Note that the acceleration force can be calculated from the velocity profile, and the hill climbing force can be calculated from the route information (hill profile). The power and force requirements, i.e., P te (x) and F te (x), respectively, are functions of the placement x. For convenience, we convert these variables into functions of time t, i.e., P te (t) and F te (t). Our primary focus in this modeling is to understand the battery charging behavior on the route. The charging rate is a function of time; hence, it is more convenient to describe the variables as a function of time rather than a function of displacement. This conversion can be achieved using the velocity profile equation V (x) and the definition of the velocity v(t) = dx/dt; thus, dx/dt = V (x). Required power at time t is then expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P te (t) = F te (t) • V (t).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We introduce the required battery power at time t denoted by P bat (t). In general, electricity from the battery is served to the electric motor through several separate processes, such as gears and controllers, and there are further energy dissipation in the form of sound, light, or heat. As a result, some degree of efficiency loss is inevitable. We define the efficiency loss η and assume that it is a constant. Then, the battery power requirement is then described as P bat (t) = P te (t)/η.</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">)<label>3</label></formula><p>This approximation is widely used in industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and the numerical value of the efficiency can be evaluated from the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Battery Power Behavior</head><p>Our primary decision variables are the battery size I max and the allocation of the power transmitters on the route denoted by x o i and x f i , where i = 1, 2, . . . , N. As explained earlier, it is more convenient to describe the battery power dynamics as a function of time rather than as a function of displacement. If the vehicle is traveling at a predefined speed, following the specified speed profile V (x), we can calculate the location of the vehicle at a specific time t. At this point, we introduce the following variables: the arrival time at the starting point of the ith power transmitter t o i , and the arrival time at the ending point of ith power transmitter, t f i . Once we know these two arrival time variables, we can evaluate the decision variables, x o i and x f i from the following relationship:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x j i = t j i 0 V (t)dt for j ∈ {o, f } and i = 1 . . . N. (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>Let us express the dynamic behavior of the battery.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimization Model Development</head><p>Our goal is to allocate the power transmitters and to determine the battery size so that the vehicles operate at a minimum cost while maintaining the energy level of the batteries I min ≤ I(t) ≤ I max . To allocate optimally the power transmitters for the OLEV operating on fixed routes, we develop a mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the total cost. The objective function is presented such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">min k • F p (I max ) + N • c inv + N i=1 c cable • x f i -x o i . (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>The first term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> indicates the cost of the batteries for a k number of vehicles operating on the route. There are k vehicles, and each vehicle is equipped with one identical battery. The cost of the battery is a function of the maximum capacity I max , which is described by the function F p . The cost monotonically increases with the maximum capacity of the battery. The second and third terms represent the cost of the transmitters. Each transmitter unit consists of an inverter and a power cable; therefore, if we install one transmitter unit, there is also a cost for the inverter and the cable. There are N transmitter units, and each transmitter needs to have one inverter. Therefore, the terms for the inverter cost are multiplied by N . Note that the cost of the cable linearly increases with the length of the cable. As a result, the cost of each cable unit is described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">c cable (x f i -x o i ).</formula><p>The third term sums up the cost of the cables. Before we construct the constraint equations for the optimization model, consider the case in which a vehicle is about to leave an area where a power transmitter i is installed. From our notion, we can say that, at this particular moment, the vehicle is located at x f i , and the time at which the vehicle is at this point is denoted by t f i . The level of charge in the battery at this moment is expressed as I(t f i ). Once the vehicle starts traveling on the route where no transmitter is installed, the energy in the battery will be consumed at the rate of P bat (t), which is the power consumption rate of the vehicle at time t. When the vehicle arrives at the starting point of the next transmitter at time t o i+1 , the total energy consumption from point x f i to point x o i+1 , which can also be described by the time stamps between t f i and t o i+1 , is evaluated by integrating P bat (t) over t f i and t o i+1 . This quantity should be larger than the minimum charge level I low ; hence, we can state the following constraint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">I t f i - t o i+1 t f i P bat (t)dt ≥ I low . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>If the vehicle keeps traveling from point x o i+1 , the level of charge will increase as it is now moving on the path with a transmitter installed, and the battery receives the energy wirelessly from the transmitter, i.e., i + 1. The rate of energy increase is P cs , and the amount of charge added to the battery is proportional to the time that the vehicle spends traveling above the transmitter. As a result, the motor will consume the charge at the rate of P bat (t), whereas at the same time, the charge will be added at the rate of P cs as the vehicle travels above the transmitter. However, when the battery charge level reaches its maximum, i.e., I high , the current from the pickup device will be cut off to prevent the battery from overcharging. Therefore, when the vehicle arrives at the end of the transmitter i + 1, the level of charge I(t f i+1 ) is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">I t f i+1 = min ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ I high , I t f i - t f i+1 t f i P bat (t)dt + P cs t f i+1 -t o i+1 i = 1, . . . , N -1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Solution Procedures</head><p>The optimization problem consists of the objective function described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and the constraints expressed from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">10</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. To solve the optimization problem, we selected PSO as the solution algorithm because it is very robust for solving complex nonlinear optimization problems. Moreover, PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable. Therefore, it is the best candidate for our problem, which contains nondifferentiable equations. PSO is a metaheuristic algorithm introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The PSO algorithm was motivated by the social behavior of flocks of birds or schools of fish. Compared with other metaheuristic optimization methods, the main advantage of the PSO algorithm is its simplicity; it requires fewer initial parameters, and its searching mechanism is more intuitive. Other applications of PSO can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In PSO, the particle refers to a certain candidate solution. Each particle has its own position (solution), velocity, and best position (solution). To find the best solution to a given problem, the particles move around in the search space according to the given mathematical formula for their current positions and velocities. Each particle's velocity is calculated and updated at each step. All particles share their information about their current positions, best positions, and velocities, so that they eventually find the best global solution. More detailed descriptions of PSO can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>The solution procedure for the optimization problem with PSO is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> and is described as follows:</p><p>1) Multiple particles, which are candidate solutions, are randomly generated in the feasible solution space. As we do not know the optimal solution at this point, the particles are randomly distributed. The position of a particle s at the iteration step n is denoted by λ s (n). 2) Evaluate the current fitness value with the objective function in the optimization problem. 3) Compare the fitness value at the current iteration with the previous best and update the individual (pbest) and group best (gbest). Note that pbest is the best value achieved by the individual particle so far, and gbest is the best value of the group. 4) Evaluate the velocity, i.e., direction and magnitude, denoted by v s (n) for each particle, and update the position of the particles with the velocities from the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">λ s (n + 1) = λ s (n) + v s (n + 1)<label>(19)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_35">v s (n + 1) = ω • v s (n) + α 1 • rand 1 • (pbest s -λ s (n)) + α 2 • rand 2 • (gbest -λ s (n)) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Computational Results</head><p>The proposed solution procedure was programmed in C++ language and was run on a PC with an AMD Athlon II X3 450 microprocessor under Windows Vista. For the road condition, battery size, and distance values, we utilized the information from the existing route in the Seoul Grand Park shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. The total distance is 2.85 km, and the maximum allowable battery capacity of the OLEV is 20 kW. We limited the battery size to 20 kW due to the space constraint of the vehicle. The input parameters for the case are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. The planned velocity, which is the target velocity for the vehicles, and the uphill/downhill profiles are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, respectively. Due to the data ownership issue, we modified the actual data used in the OLEV at the Seoul Grand Park. However, the input values used to present the results in this paper are not very different from the actual system. The algorithm reliably generated the results within a few seconds. The solution is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>. The expected SOC over the course of the route is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>. Note that the SOC is evaluated using the linear model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and the state of health of the battery is not considered in the SOC evaluation, as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The optimal solution indicates that four transmitters should be allocated. The first transmitter is located between 425 and 660.6 m from the starting point of the vehicles on   the route. The second, third, and fourth transmitters are located at 1140.3-1194, 1782.8-1831, and 2153 m-2182.7 m, respectively. The optimal battery capacity is 11 kW, and the total cost is 64025.4, which is the minimum figure possible while satisfying the constraints. There are four stopping points (stations), excluding the base station, on the route. We discovered that the optimal solution allocated all four transmitters near the stop points (station). For instance, the first station is located at 647.0 m, and the first transmitter is installed between 425 and 660.6 m. This result intuitively makes sense for the following reasons. The vehicles slow down as they approach the stations and then eventually stop. Note that the amount of charging is proportional to the charging time. That is, given the same length of a transmitter cable, more charging is possible when the vehicles are moving slowly along the transmitter cable because they spend more time on the transmitters. Therefore, it is cost effective to allocate the transmitters to the areas where the vehicles are moving slowly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Sensitivity Analysis</head><p>To understand the system behavior of the OLEV system, a sensitivity analysis was performed.</p><p>We first investigated the system behavior of the OLEV system with a varying battery cost. In this analysis, the number of vehicles in the OLEV system is five (k = 5), and this number is fixed. We assume that the largest battery that the OLEV system can equip in each vehicle is 20 kWh. An upper limit on the battery size is needed in the analysis to reflect reality; without this upper bound, the optimization problem would give an infinite capacity of the battery as an optimal solution if the battery cost was 0. Typically, the capacity of the battery is proportional to the volume of the battery. Due to the vehicle's space limitation, the size of the battery is also limited. We varied the battery cost from 0 to 800 in increments of 80. That is, 11 different cases were evaluated. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. The red line (dotted line) and the blue line (solid line) represent the optimal values for the total cable length and battery capacity, respectively, for each battery cost. The total cable length in the figure is the sum of all of the cable lengths installed on the route. The values shown on the left y-axis are for the battery capacity, and those on the right y-axis are for the total cable length. The numerical values shown above the red line indicate the number of transmitters N . In general, as the cost of the battery increases, the optimal battery size decreases and the total cable length increases, i.e., more transmitters are installed, and longer cables are installed in response to the increasing battery cost. Note that, when the cost of the battery is zero, the optimization recommends the largest battery available, which is 20 kW. Note that the optimal solution still recommends the installation of transmitters, although the battery cost is 0. This is because a 20-kW battery, which is the largest allowable size for the vehicle, is not big enough to hold the required energy to complete the circuit with- out any additional charge. An interesting behavior is captured when the battery cost increases from 640 to 720. In this case, the total cable length decreases, although the battery size decreases. This case can be explained by the number of transmitters and their allocation. Note that the number of transmitters increases from four to five when the cost increases from 640 to 720. The optimization problem calculates that it would be cost effective to add one more transmitters to five instead of increasing the length of the cables with the four existing transmitters. With five transmitters, the optimization model can allocate them to better locations and eventually reduce the total length of the cable. This case clearly shows the nonlinear behavior of the system and the reason why the lines do not monotonically increase or decrease as the input parameters change.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> shows the results of the sensitivity analysis when the cable cost per unit length is varied from 0 to 120 in increments of 12. In general, the battery size increases as the cable cost increases. As the cable cost increases, the cable cost becomes the dominant factor in the total cost. Therefore, the optimization model tries to seek the solution that minimizes the total length of the cable either by installing more transmitters with a short cable or by increasing the battery capacity. The figure also shows that the rate of decrease in the total length of the cable diminishes. We conjecture that there is an absolute minimum length of cable required for the route, and this is around 250 m. In other words, even if a battery with the largest capacity is installed, the vehicle needs to have at least 250 m of cable to make one round trip.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">12</ref> shows the optimal cable length and battery size when the inverter cost is varied. Remember that each transmitter consists of an inverter and a cable; thus, the number of inverters in the OLEV system is identical to the number of transmitter units. The numerical values shown along the cable length in the figure indicate the optimal number of inverters for each case. As the inverter cost increases, the optimal number of inverters decreases. As shown in the figure, the total length of the cable either increases or decreases, and there is a particularly sharp increase when the cost of the inverter increases from 3000 to 4000. This is because, as the cost of the transmitter increases, the number of transmitters is reduced, and the effect of this reduced number of transmitters is offset by assigning longer cables for the remaining transmitters. That is, the optimization model responds to the increased cost of the inverter by allocating fewer transmitters with longer cables. Conversely, the cable length is reduced when the inverter cost reduces from 5000 to 6000. In this case, as the number of transmitters is reduced from four to three, the size of the battery increases from 11 to 14 kW. As the battery capacity is increased, the vehicle is able to travel with less charging time, and the cable is reduced. There is another interesting case shown in the figure. Note that both the cable length and the battery size increase as the cost of the inverter increases from 8000 to 9000. In this case, the number of transmitters is reduced to two. We conjecture that this transmitter count is too small to satisfy the constraints, and both the cable length and the battery size increase dramatically with only two transmitters.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13</ref> shows the system behavior in response to the number of vehicles. As more vehicles are required, the cost of the battery becomes the dominant factor in the total cost of the OLEV system. Therefore, as the number of vehicles increases, the optimization seeks optimal solutions with less battery capacity. As the battery capacity gets smaller, either longer cables or more transmitters are needed. Hence, the red line representing the total length of the cable and the numerical values indicating the number of transmitters show trends. However, this upward trend is not always true. When the number of vehicles changes from eight to nine, the cable length reduces because, in this par- ticular case, the optimization model managed to find an optimal solution by adding one more transmitter instead of increasing the cable length with the existing number of transmitters. Transmitters are then rearranged so that the system requires less cable than the case in which there are eight vehicles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>In this paper, we have introduced the electric vehicle system called OLEV with the wireless power transfer technology developed by KAIST. The OLEV is an innovative electric transportation system that remotely picks up electricity from power transmitters buried underground. The OLEV mainly consists of vehicles and power transmitters installed under the road. As the battery in the vehicle can be remotely charged while in motion, the vehicle does not need to stop at the charging station, and recharging downtime is significantly reduced. We logically analyzed the tradeoff between the battery size and the positions of the power transmitters on the route. In particular, we considered the OLEV system with multiple vehicles circulating on a single route, such as the OLEV currently operating in Seoul Grand Park. We constructed an analytical model to imitate the battery charging and discharging behavior of the OLEV with reasonable assumptions and then presented the optimization problem to find the minimum total investment cost while satisfying the operational requirements. We considered the battery size and the total number of power transmitters and their allocation as decision variables. We presented the solution algorithm with the PSO technique to solve the optimization problem. We validated our model and algorithm with a numerical solution for a case with numerical parameters similar to the actual values of the OLEV in Seoul Grand Park. It was proven that the algorithm reliably generated solutions. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to show the model with our intuition. In this paper, we have assumed that the vehicles follow a regulated vehicle profile. This assumption may work for the vehicles operating in a controlled environment, such as the OLEV in Seoul Grand Park. However, if the method is applied to a system operating in a normal traffic environment, velocity variability should be considered. We suggest that future research will incorporate the velocity variation issue.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
