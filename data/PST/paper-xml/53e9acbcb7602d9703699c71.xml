<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The active contour/snake model is one of the most successful variational models in image segmentation. It consists of evolving a contour in images toward the boundaries of objects. Its success is based on strong mathematical properties and efficient numerical schemes based on the level set method. The only drawback of this model is the existence of local minima in the active contour energy, which makes the initial guess critical to get satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem by determining a global minimum of the active contour model. Our approach is based on the unification of image segmentation and image denoising tasks into a global minimization framework. More precisely, we propose to unify three well-known image variational models, namely the snake model, the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi denoising model and the Mumford-Shah segmentation model. We will establish theorems with proofs to determine the existence of a global minimum of the active contour model. From a numerical point of view, we propose a new practical way to solve the active contour propagation problem toward object boundaries through a dual formulation of the minimization problem.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and Motivations</head><p>The image segmentation problem is fundamental in the field of computer vision. It is a core component toward e.g. automated vision systems and medical applications. Its aim is to find a partition of an image into a finite number of semantically important regions. Various variational and partial differential equations (PDEs)-based methods have been proposed to extract objects of interest in images such as the well-known and successful active contour/snake model, initially proposed by Kass, Witkin and Terzopoulos in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The number of applications of this method is numerous in various image processing applications such as in medical imaging to extract anatomical structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Following the first model of active contours, Caselles, Kimmel and Sapiro in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Kichenassamy, Kumar, Olver, Tannenbaum and Yezzi in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed a new enhanced version of the snake model called the geodesic/geometric active contour (GAC) model. This new formulation is said geometrically intrinsic because the proposed snake energy is invariant with respect to (w.r.t.) the curve parametrization. The model is defined by the following minimization problem: ds. Hence, the energy functional (1) is actually a new length obtained by weighting the Euclidean element of length ds by the function g which contains information concerning the boundaries of objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The function g is an edge indicator function that vanishes at object boundaries such as <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> where I 0 is the original image and β is an arbitrary positive constant. The calculus of variations provides us the Euler-Lagrange equation of the functional E GAC and the gradient descent method gives us the flow that minimizes as fast as possible E GAC (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">g(|∇I 0 |) = 1 1+β|∇I 0 | 2 ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">∂ t C = (κg -∇g, N )N , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where ∂ t C := ∂C/∂t, t being an artificial time parameter, and κ, N are respectively the curvature and the normal to the curve C. The evolution equation of active contours, defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, is well-defined because a unique viscosity solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> associated to the PDE (2) exists. Osher and Sethian introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> the level set method to efficiently solve the contour propagation problem and to deal with topological changes. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) can be written in the level set form as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∂ t φ = κg + ∇g, ∇φ |∇φ| |∇φ|,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where φ is the level set function embedding the evolving active contour C such that C(t) = {x ∈ R N |φ(x, t) = 0}. The PDE (3) is implemented with numerical schemes based on hyperbolic conservation laws, see Osher-Sethian <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which can be highly accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> to give very fine/subpixel segmentations. Despite the many good numerical results obtained with this segmentation model and strong theoretical properties, the snake/GAC model is highly sensitive to the initial condition. Actually, the quality of the segmentation result depends a lot on the choice of the initial contour, which means that a bad initial contour can give an unsatisfactory result. The problem of a good initial condition is related to the non-convexity of the energy functional, E GAC , to be minimized and then the existence of local minima. This drawback is not specific to this variational model because it is a Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> The standard snake model, defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, fails to segment the two objects widespread issue when dealing with variational models in image processing which also suffer from local minima. In the case of the GAC model, the existence of local minima in E GAC can prevent the segmentation of meaningful objects lying in images. A simple example is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The initial GAC (embedded in a level set function in order to allow natural topology changes) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(a) can not fully segment the two objects, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(b)</ref>, because it gets stuck in a bad local minimum. The best segmentation result should provide the two objects, which corresponds to another local minimum of E GAC obtained with a different initial condition. Hence we wish to define an image segmentation model providing the correct result independently of the initial condition, which means that we look for a global minimum of a convex functional. We notice that the global minimum for the GAC/snake model corresponds to a point, which has no practical sense for the image segmentation task. We thus propose in this paper to define new active contour energies based on the GAC model and whose global minimum corresponds to the expected segmentation result. Hence, throughout the paper, "global minimum of the active contour model" will refer to the global minimization of new active contour models based partially on the GAC model but not to the global minimization of the GAC model, which has no sense as we previously said.</p><p>In a recent work, Chan, Esedoḡlu and Nikolova <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a new approach to deal with global minimum and overcome the limitation of local minima. In their paper, they related image segmentation to image denoising in order to find global minimizers of two denoising and segmentation models. The first model is a binary image denoising model which removes the geometric noise in a given shape and the second model is the active contours without edges (ACWE) model of Chan and Vese <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we develop three theoretical global minimization models for the active contour model inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The first model is based on the standard snake/GAC segmentation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> and the well-known image denoising model of Rudin, Osher and Fatemi (ROF) defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We remind that image denoising aims at removing noise in images while keeping main features such as edges and textures. It is interesting to notice that a unified approach of image segmentation and image denoising provides us with a global minimization solution for the active contour model subject to an intensity homogeneity constraint. Then the second model is based on the standard active contour model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> and the piecewise-constant Mumford and Shah's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which is related to the ACWE model of Chan and Vese <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Our model will "reconcile" the classical GAC model, based on the detection of edges, and the ACWE model, based on the detection of homogeneous regions, in a single framework to globally minimize the active contour model subject to intensity homogeneity constraints. Finally, the third model uses the piecewise-smooth approximation of the Mumford-Shah model to find a global active contour subject to smooth intensity constraints.</p><p>This paper, besides developing new theoretical models to carry out the global minimization of the active contour model, also proposes new numerical schemes to perform the contour evolution in an efficient and fast way. Thus, the traditional contour propagation problem is solved with a dual formulation of the total variation (TV) norm introduced and developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. These original implementation schemes are easy to implement and very fast compared with usual schemes, based on the level set approach such as (3). Indeed, standard contour tracking algorithms use a distance function (DF), as a level set function, to implicitly and intrinsically represent the active contour. The main problem is that the DF is not a solution of (3), which means that the level set function does not remain a DF during the contour evolution process. This requires the user to periodically re-initialize the level set function as a DF, which is timeconsuming, to ensure correct numerical computations of the curvature and the normal to the contour. Finally, the initial active contour has also to be embedded in a DF in the standard approach, which also requires special techniques. Thus the main contributions of this paper are as follows: The next section defines the global minimization model based on the snake method and the ROF model, which pro-vides a unified way to perform image segmentation and image denoising. Then Sect. 3 introduces the second global minimization model based on the piecewise-constant approximation of the Mumford-Shah model, which is known as the ACWE model of Chan-Vese. We show that our model improves the performances of the ACWE. Section 4 presents the global minimization model based on the piecewisesmooth approximation of the Mumford-Shah model. We compare the proposed model in this paper to other works in Sect. 5. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 6 and give in Appendix the proofs of the introduced theorems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Theoretical Model</head><p>In this section, we unify the snake segmentation model with the denoising Rudin, Osher and Fatemi model defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The ROF model is one of the most famous and influential variational and PDE-based image denoising models in image processing. This denoising technique removes the noise while preserving the edges in images. The minimization problem associated with the ROF model is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min u E ROF (u, λ) = |∇u|dx =:T V (u) +λ (u -f ) 2 dx ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where ⊂ R N is an open set representing the image domain, f is a given (possibly noisy) image, TV(u) is the total variation norm of the function u, and λ &gt; 0 is an arbitrary parameter related to the scale of observation of the solution. Based on the approach of Chan, Esedoḡlu and Nikolova in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we propose the following (non-strictly) convex energy defined for any given observed image f ∈ L 1 ( ), any function g : → R + independent of u and any positive parameter λ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E 1 (u, λ) := g(x)|∇u|dx =:T V g (u) +λ |u -f |dx.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The differences between Energy (5) and the ROF model (4) are the introduction of the weighted TV-norm, T V g (u) with a weight function g(x) and the replacement of the L 2 -norm by the L 1 -norm as a fidelity measure w.r.t. the given image f . These modifications have two important consequences. First, the L 1 -norm, which has been introduced and well studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, outperforms the standard ROF regularization model with the L 2 -norm for some applications and presents important geometric properties concerning global minimizers of functionals, which will be used for the active contour global minimization problem. Second, the introduction of a weight function, g, in the TVnorm gives us the link between the snake/GAC model and the proposed functional, E 1 , because the snake energy, defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, is equal to the weighted TV-norm when g is an edge indicator function and the function u is a characteristic function, 1 C , of a closed set C ⊂ which C denotes the (non-connected) boundaries of C :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T V g (u = 1 C ) = g(x)|∇1 C |dx = C g(s)ds = E GAC (C).</formula><p>Before establishing the global minimization theorem for the active contour model, let us develop here the comparison between the standard ROF model, the ROF model with the L 1 -norm and the proposed model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Chan and Esedoḡlu studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> the differences between the ROF model and the ROF model that uses the L 1 -norm as a fidelity measure. They showed that the L 1 -norm better preserves the contrast than the L 2 -norm and the order in which the features disappear, in the regularization process, is completely determined in terms of the geometry (such as area and length) of the features and not in terms of the contrast such as in the standard model. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents the difference between the ROF model using the L 1 -norm and our model using the L 1 -norm and the weight function g. The parameter λ for both models in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a</ref>) is chosen such that the four small circles are removed while keeping the larger one. We can see that our model, using an edge indicator function, gives us a better quality result because the edge function better preserves the geometry of the original features such as the corners and the largest disk.</p><p>Besides improving the regularization process of the ROF model, Energy (5) provides a global minimization of the active contour model. The global minimization result is based on the following theorem: Theorem 1 Suppose that g(x) ∈ [0, 1] and f (x), the given image, is the characteristic function of a bounded domain f ⊂ , for any given λ &gt; 0, if u(x) is any minimizer of E 1 (., λ), then for almost every μ ∈ [0, 1] we have that the characteristic function</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 C (μ)={x:u(x)&gt;μ} (x),</formula><p>where C is the boundary of the set C , is a global minimizer of E 1 (., λ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof See Appendix.</head><p>Theorem 1 states the relation between the global minimization of Energy E 1 and the snake/GAC model. Indeed, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Comparison between the ROF model using L 1 -norm as a fidelity measure, (c-d), and our model using the weighted TV-norm and the L 1 -norm, (e-f). The difference between both models is clear. The result generated by our model better preserves the geometry of the original features such as the corners and the largest circle when function u is a characteristic function of a set C , whose boundary is denoted C, the expression of Energy E 1 is thus equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">E 1 (u = 1 C , λ) = g|∇1 C |dx + λ |1 C -f |dx = C gds + λ |1 C -f |dx.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Hence, minimizing Energy ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) is equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">minimize C gds = E GAC (C) (the snake/GAC energy (1)),</formula><p>while approximating the given image f (in the L 1 sense) by a binary function of a set/region C .</p><p>Hence minimizing Energy E 1 corresponds to find an active contour which minimizes the GAC energy while recover-ing the boundary of a binary image. We underline that globally minimizing E 1 is obviously not equivalent to globally minimizing the GAC energy defined in (1). As we said in Sect. 1, it has no sense to globally minimize the GAC model because its global minimum corresponds to a point. Here, we globally minimize a new active contour energy, namely E 1 , partially based on the GAC and whose global minimum corresponds to the expected segmentation result. Finally, since Energy E 1 is convex but not strictly convex, it does not possess local minima that are not global minima. Hence any minimizer of Energy E 1 is a global minimizer. Thus, according to Theorem 1, for any minimizer u of E 1 , the contour C of the set {x : u(x) &gt; μ} for any μ ∈ [0, 1] is a global minimizer of the active contour energy for (possibly noisy) binary images such as the image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>The next two sections define two numerical schemes to compute the global minimum of the active contour model. Section 2.2 gives a PDE to find a global minimum and Sect. 2.3 introduces a new algorithm, based on a dual formulation of the TV-norm, to quickly compute a global minimizer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Standard Minimization Based on a PDE</head><p>As we previously said, any minimizer u of E 1 provides a global minimum to the active contour model. Hence, the standard calculus of variation model can be used to determine a PDE which is guaranteed to find a global minimizer of the segmentation model. The minimization flow of Functional E 1 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∂ t u = div g ∇u |∇u| + λ u -f |u -f | = g div ∇u |∇u| + ∇g, ∇u |∇u| + λ u -f |u -f | , (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where the first term of the right-hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">7</ref>) is the curvature of the level sets of u, div( ∇u |∇u| ), multiplies by the edge indicator function g, the second term is a shock term which enhances the detection of edges and the third term of the right-hand side is a data fidelity term w.r.t. the observed image f . The evolution equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">7</ref>) can be discretized with the following explicit numerical scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">u n+1 -u n δt = g (D 0 x f ) 2 + (D 0 y f ) 2 × {D - x N +,n x,ε 1 + D - y N +,n y,ε 1 } + (D 0 x g) ∧ • N -,n x,ε 1 + (D 0 x g) ∨ • N +,n x,ε 1 + (D 0 y g) ∧ • N -,n y,ε 1 + (D 0 y g) ∨ • N +,n y,ε 1 + λ u n -f (u n -f ) 2 + ε 2 , (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">D 0 x f = (f i x +1,i y -f i x -1,i y )/2, D + x u = u i x +1,i y - u i x ,i y and D -</formula><p>x u = u i x ,i yu i x -1,i y are respectively the central, forward and backward approximations of the spatial derivatives in the x-direction, N ±,n</p><p>x,ε =</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">D ± x u n (D ± x u n ) 2 +(D ± y u n ) 2 +ε</formula><p>is the approximation of the normal to the level sets of u in the x-direction, the same approximations being held in the y-direction, (•) ∧ := max(•, 0), (•) ∨ := min(•, 0), δt being the temporal step, and ε 1 , ε 2 small positive constants. In all our experiments, we choose δt = 5 × 10 -5 , ε 1 = 10 -12 and ε 2 = 10 -4 . The numerical scheme defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, determined from the classical Euler-Lagrange equations method, is actually a very slow segmentation method because of the regularization process of the TV-norm. Indeed, Energy E 1 is not directly minimized but the regularized version g(x)</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">|∇u| 2 + ε 1 + λ (u -f ) 2 + ε 2</formula><p>where ε 1 , ε 2 are very small parameters to be faithful to the original energy and useful to avoid numerical instabilities. The direct consequence of this regularization parameter is the obligation to use a small temporal step to ensure a correct minimization process. Thus a large number of iterations to reach the steady state minimization solution is necessary. In other words, although it is correct, the segmentation process remains slow. For instance, let us come back to the first image, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. This time, we consider a more challenging initial active contour because we choose a characteristic function of a small disk outside the two objects, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>. The two objects are now successfully segmented as we can see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> thanks to the global minimization property of our model but the segmentation process takes 5 minutes. In the next section, we introduce a new numerical model based on a dual formulation of the TV-norm which gives a fast segmentation algorithm.</p></div>

The parameter μ is arbitrary chosen to 0.5, although any value between 0 and 1 can be used without changing the segmentation result because the final function u is very close to a binary function.

This improves the standard active contour result obtained in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> where a good initial guess is necessary to get the same result and the parameter θ &gt; 0 is small so that we almost have f = u + v where the function u represents the geometric information, i.e. the piecewise-smooth regions, and the function v captures the texture information lying in the given image.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">min u E 1 (u, λ) = g(x)|∇u|dx + λ |u -f |dx , as follows: min u,v E r 1 (u, v, λ, θ) = g(x)|∇u|dx =T V g (u) + 1 2θ (u + v -f ) 2 dx u+v-f 2 L 2 +λ |v|dx v L 1<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Since the functional E r 1 is convex, its minimizer can be computed by minimizing E r 1 w.r.t. u and v separately, and iterating until convergence as in the references mentioned above.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Results</head><p>The new active contour model, given by the global minimization of Energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, is applied to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The numerical energy minimization based on the dual formulation of the TV energy, and not on the classical technique of Euler-Lagrange equations such as in Sect. 2.2, gives us the same result, see Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, in less than 5 seconds! We remind the reader that 5 minutes was necessary in the case of the Euler-Lagrange equations method. Furthermore, the implementation of the minimization is straightforward. Hence, our new Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Global minimization of the active contour/snake model with a dual formulation of the TV-norm proposed in Propositions 1 and 2. Our segmentation successfully extracts the two meaningful objects, a, in less than 5 seconds! b, c present the final functions u and v which minimize the regularized energy E r 1 defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The minimization of Functional E r 1 carries out the image decomposition task because u represents the geometric information, i.e., the piecewise-smooth regions, and v captures the texture information lying in the given image. Of course, this model also improves the standard active contour result obtained in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> where a good initial guess is needed to get the same result. Here the initial condition is u 0 = v 0 = p 1 0 = p 2 0 = 0. We also have λ = 0.1, θ = 1 snake model provides not only a global minimum independent of the initial contour position but also an easy and fast algorithm to carry out the segmentation process. This new way to solve the active contour problem is also numerically much faster than classical methods used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> that consists of embedding the snake in a distance function and reinitializing it periodically to insure correct numerical computations of the curvature and the normal to the level sets.</p><p>It is interesting to note that our segmentation framework unifies image segmentation (snake model), image denoising (ROF model) and now image decomposition using the energy functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Indeed, the introduction of the function v in the minimization problem, naturally captures the textural part lying in images. Image decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> consists of separating an image into its structural parts, representing by the geometric/piecewisesmooth regions, and textural parts, containing textures and noise. Thus the minimization of Energy (9), leading to the global minimum of the segmentation model, simultaneously performs an image decomposition which improves the segmentation task. Indeed, consider Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The standard GAC fails to segment the rectangle, Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>, because it gets stuck in textures whereas our model, thanks to the separation between geometric regions and textures, is able to capture the black rectangle, Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>. Finally, performing image segmentation and image decomposition at the same time can be useful for other image processing tasks such as pattern recognition.</p><p>We also apply our model on a real-world image, Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a), corrupted with a salt-and-pepper noise unlike Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> which is distorted by a Gaussian additive noise. Our model successfully extracts the meaningful part of the given image corresponding to the original text. The previous section defined a new image segmentation method based on the ROF model to determine a global minimum of the standard geodesic/geometric active contour model. This new model is thus independent of the initial contour position. However, it is designed for (noised) binary images such as Figs. 1, 5 and 6. In this section, we propose to extend the previous technique to grey-scale images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Theoretical Model</head><p>We consider the global minimization problem of the active contour/snake model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> using the well-known Mumford and Shah's (MS) functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the Chan and Vese's model of active contours without edges (ACWE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The MS model is one of the most influential variational model to solve the image segmentation problem. This model determines the optimal piecewise smooth approximation of a given image, which is equivalent to partition an image into distinct homogeneous regions which boundaries are sharp and piecewise regular. The ACWE model is also an important segmentation model based on curve evolution techniques, the level set approach and the MS model. This model detects boundaries of objects based on the detection of homogeneous regions, like in the MS model, and not on the detection of large image gradients such as in the classical snake model. The efficiency of the ACWE model is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> on various experimental results for which the classical snake model, based on the image gradient, is not applicable. Chan and Vese also noticed on experimental results that their model has the tendency to compute a global minimizer. Finally, Chan, Esedoḡlu and Nikolova proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> that a global minimum to the ACWE model exists.</p><p>In our approach, we propose to determine a global minimum of the snake model by enhancing the standard ACWE method. The enhancement is realized by unifying the classical GAC model with the ACWE model in a global minimization framework to detect at the same time object edges, based on the detection of large image gradients and homogeneous intensities regions. Hence, we unify the complementary approaches of the geodesic/geometric active contours model and the active contours without edges model to create an improved segmentation model. We will show that our model, besides being independent of the initial condition, improves the model of Chan and Vese when the contrast between meaningful objects and the background is low. Then, we will propose a fast numerical model, easy to implement, to carry out the image segmentation.</p><p>The variational model of ACWE, which corresponds to the two-phase piecewise constant approximation of the Mumford and Shah's model, is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">min C ,c 1 ,c 2 E ACWE ( C , c 1 , c 2 , λ) = Per( C ) + λ C (c 1 -f (x)) 2 dx + λ \ C (c 2 -f (x)) 2 dx , (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_31">)</formula><p>where f is the given image, C is a closed subset of the image domain , Per( C ) is the perimeter of the set C , λ is an arbitrary positive parameter which controls the tradeoff between the regularization process and the fidelity of the solution w.r.

Hence, the optimization problem can have local minima, which implies solutions with wrong scales of details. Despite the nonconvex nature of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">13</ref>), a natural way to determine a solution ( C , c 1 , c 2 ) is a two-step algorithm where c 1 and c 2 are first computed, then the region C is updated to decrease the energy E ACWE . Chan and Vese proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> a solution to determine an evolution equation for the region C based on a level set based approach. They represent the regions C and \ C with the Heaviside function of a level set function (which models a characteristic function).

The numerical minimization based on the dual formulation of the TV-norm, and not on the classical technique of the Euler-Lagrange equations, gives us the same result, Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>, in less than 10 seconds! Furthermore, as we noticed in Sect. 2.4, the implementation of the minimization is straightforward, fast Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> Global minimization of the active contour/snake model using the Mumford-Shah's model and the Chan-Vese's model. Our segmentation model "reconciles" in a consistent framework the standard GAC model, based on the detection of edge points defined by large image gradients, and the ACWE model, based on the detection of homogeneous regions defined from the Mumford-Shah energy. A minimization of E 2 realized with the Euler-Lagrange equations technique takes about 10 minutes. Here, the numerical minimization of E 2 , given in b, is carried out with a dual formulation of the TV-norm in less than 10 seconds! As in Sect. 2, the active contour in a is given by the boundary of the set C (μ = 0.5) = {x : u(x) &gt; 0.5}. The parameter μ is arbitrary chosen to 0.5, even if any value between 0 and 1 can be used without changing the segmentation result because the final function u is very close to a binary function. We choose λ = 0.1, θ = 1 and independent of the initial condition (we simply chose u 0 = v 0 = p 1 0 = p 2 0 = 0 in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). Hence, this new way to solve the active contour propagation problem is numerically more efficient than classical methods, which consists of embedding the snake in a distance function and re-initializing it periodically to insure correct computations of the curvature and the normal to the level sets.</p><p>Our segmentation model improves not only the GAC model but also the ACWE model when the contrast between meaningful objects and the background is low. Indeed, let us consider the synthetic image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8a</ref>. At the right edge of the rectangular foreground object, the contrast changes are very low even though there is still a clear discontinuity delineating the edge. The result obtained using the standard ACWE model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8b</ref>. No matter how large the fidelity constant λ is chosen, the model will always prefer to cut through the low contrast region of the foreground object (does so exactly where the contrast is 0.5). There is no way to avoid this by varying the parameters in the model, the active contour always misses the correct boundary at the right edge of the rectangle by at least the amount shown. However, the solution obtained using our segmentation algorithm, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8c</ref>, provides enough of edge sensitivity, given by the edge indicator function g, for the active contour to stay faithful to the actual boundary of the foreground object. We show the advantage of our model over the standard ACWE model on a real-world image, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9a</ref>. Our model is able to segment an important part of the liver, Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9b</ref> and<ref type="figure">d</ref>, despite of very low contrast changes, whereas the standard ACWE model can not segment accurately the liver as we can see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref> where different values of λ was tested.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Comparison with Related Works</head><p>In this section, we consider three works related with our approach.</p><p>The first related approach is naturally the work of Chan, Esedoḡlu and Nikolova <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> because the global minimization of the snake/GAC model proposed in this paper is inspired by their work. However, our approach is more general because we propose a unified framework to use the GAC model and the ACWE model. Experimental results in Sect. 3.3 demonstrate the advantage of using the GAC model with the ACWE model when the contrast changes between meaningful objects and the background are very low. Finally, we propose a fast numerical scheme to perform the global minimization of our variational model, which is not the case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The second related work is the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> of Cohen and Kimmel which also addresses the problem of determining Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> Segmentation using the GAC model and the two-phase piecewise smooth approximation of the MS model defined by Vese-Chan in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Our segmentation model also performs at the same time the image denoising because d presents the regularized version of a a global minimum for the GAC energy. Their approach is different from ours since it is focused on finding a minimal path between two given end points of an open curve. As noticed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, object segmentation is not easy to carry out in their approach because the method needs a number of points on the boundary of the object to be extracted. Furthermore the model is naturally designed to capture open curves, such as minimal paths on road images, but not directly closed curves because it requires a complementary method based on a topology-based saddle search routine.</p><p>Finally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, Appleton and Talbot propose to determine a global minimum for the GAC model for closed curves under the restriction that the curve contains a specified internal point. Authors present very good object segmentation results in various medical images. However, the need of a specified internal point can limit the segmentation process because it means that object with multiple closed curves can not be extracted without a set of seed points. For example, the two objects presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> can not be directly segmented with only one internal point. Their model needs to detect two internal points, which is not our case. Finally, the extension of their model to higher-dimensional images is not straightforward whereas the extension is natural in our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>As we said at the beginning, the active contour/snake model is a well-known image segmentation model which is more and more used in various image processing applications such as in automated surveillance, graphics animation, robotics or medical imaging. Its success is based on strong theoretical properties and efficient numerical schemes. The only drawback of this segmentation model is the existence of local minima in its functional energy, which makes critical the initial contour to extract meaningful objects lying in images. Hence we proposed in this paper a new approach to determine a global minimum of the snake energy in order to become independent of the initial position of the contour. We think that this new approach can have numerous applications in the image processing tasks previously mentioned.</p><p>The core of our models was to express the energy functionals in terms of level sets as observed by Strang in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> and solve geometric problems as proposed by Chan-Esedoḡlu-Nikolova <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Thus we defined three new variational models based on the unification of the classical snake/GAC model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, the denoising Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the segmentation Mumford-Shah model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the active contours without edges model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In the case of the ROF model, we obtained a global minimization theorem for binary images. It was interesting to notice that the computation of the global minimum was done by decomposing an image into a geometric part, i.e., smooth part, and a texture part as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Experimental results showed that the image decomposition improves the segmentation task. In the case of the ACWE model of Chan-Vese for grey-scale images, we showed that our model improves classical segmentation results at the location of smooth transitions between objects and the background thanks to the edge indicator function.</p><p>We established theorems to prove the existence of global minimizers to our segmentation variational models. We determined not one but several global minima of the active contour model, which looks to be a drawback. However, all global solutions are close to each other because the minimizers u are very close to binary functions.</p><p>We also proposed efficient and fast numerical schemes to globally minimize the variational segmentation models. The proposed algorithms, based on a dual formulation of the TVnorm proposed and developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, are easy to implement. This new way to solve the standard contour propagation problem allows us to avoid the usual drawback in the level set approach that consists of initializing the active contour in a distance function and re-initializing it periodically during the evolution to ensure a correct computation of the curvature and the normal to the level sets, which is timeconsuming. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> for more details and another approach to solve the re-distancing problem.</p><p>Future works will investigate the extension of this global minimization approach to other image processing variational models, which most of them suffers from the existence of local minima. One application of our work has been done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> to unify image segmentation, image denoising and image inpainting. since all the equations are independent, and the computation is straightforward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Theorem 2</head><p>The proof is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, by replacing the TV-norm by the weighted TV-norm introduced in Definition 1.

The parameter μ is arbitrary chosen to 0.5, although any value between 0 and 1 can be used without changing the segmentation result because the final function u is very close to a binary function.
