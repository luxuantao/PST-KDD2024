<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we investigate an optimal power loading algorithm for an OFDM-based cognitive radio (CR) system. The downlink transmission capacity of the CR user is thereby maximized, while the interference introduced to the primary user (PU) remains within a tolerable range. We also propose two suboptimal loading algorithms that are less complex. We also study the effect of a subcarrier nulling mechanism on the performance of the different algorithms under consideration. The performance of the optimal and suboptimal schemes is compared with the performance of the classical power loading algorithms, e.g., water-filling and uniform power but variable rate loading schemes that are used for conventional OFDMbased systems. Presented numerical results show that for a given interference threshold, the proposed optimal scheme allows CR base station (BS) to transmit more power in order to achieve a higher transmission rate than the classical loading algorithms. These results also show that although the proposed suboptimal schemes have certain degradation in performance compared to the optimal scheme, they outperform the classical loading algorithms. We also present numerical results for nulling mechanism. Finally, we investigate the effect of imperfect channel gain information at the transmitter.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ADIO spectrum is one of the most scarce and valuable resources for wireless communications. Given this fact, new insights into the use of spectrum have challenged the traditional approaches to spectrum management. Actual measurements have shown that most of the allocated spectrum is largely underutilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The Spectrum-Policy Task Force appointed by the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) has also reported similar views about under utilization of the allocated spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Cognitive radio (CR) has been proposed as a way to improve spectral efficiency by exploiting unused spectrum in dynamically changing environments. The CR design is an innovative radio design philosophy that involves smartly sensing the swaths of spectrum and then determining the transmission characteristics (e.g., symbol rate, power, bandwidth, latency) of a group of secondary users(SU) 1 based on the behavior of the users to whom the spectrum has been licensed (referred to as primary users (PUs)). Although opportunistic spectrum access would allow CR users to identify and access available spectrum resources, one of the main concerns is to utilize these available spectrum resources in an efficient manner.</p><p>Due to its great flexibility in dynamically allocating unused spectrum among CR users, and the ease of analysis of the PU's spectral activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has already been recognized in the literature as a potential transmission technology for CR systems. Since both CR user and PU may exist in side-by-side bands yet have different access technologies, mutual interference is the limiting factor for performance of both networks. Specifically, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> the authors have shown that using OFDM modulation causes mutual interference between the PU and CR users due to the non-orthogonality of the transmitted signals. The amount of interference introduced to the PU's band by a CR user's subcarrier depends on the power allocated in that subcarrier as well as the spectral distance between that particular subcarrier and the PU's band.</p><p>In order to exploit the time-varying nature of fading gains across the OFDM subcarriers, power loading algorithms have been proposed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These algorithms maximize the transmission capacity of an OFDM-based conventional wireless network where there is only one group of users, i.e., PUs. Since there is mutual interference between CR user and PU when they co-exist in side-by-side bands, use of the classical loading algorithms e.g., uniform power but variable rate and water-filling algorithms, for CR system may result in higher mutual interference in the PUs' band. We consider a CR downlink transmission scenario where a CR transmitter/base station (BS) transmits information to a CR user using the radio spectrum that is unoccupied by the PU. For such downlink scenario interference introduced to the PUs is the limiting factor, rather than the transmit power of the CR user. In fact, such an interference-limited scenario limits the transmit power as well as the achievable transmission rate of CR user. Hence, the design problem is as follows. Given an interference threshold prescribed by PUs, how much power should be transmitted into each OFDM subcarrier for a given channel fading gain such that the total transmission rate of the CR user is maximized?</p><p>According to the classical power loading schemes, e.g., water-filling, more power should be loaded into the subcarrier with the higher channel gain. However, the amount of interference introduced by allowing transmission in a CR user's subcarrier depends on the location of the subcarrier with respect to the PU's spectrum. From the interference point of view, more power should be loaded into a subcarrier that 1536-1276/08$25.00 c 2008 IEEE is far away from PU's band. Therefore, a judicious loading policy is required that not only considers the fading gain of the subcarrier but also the spectral distance of the subcarrier from the PU's band.</p><p>Motivated by the aforementioned challenging task and the interference model studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, in this paper we propose an optimal power loading scheme using the Lagrange formulation. This loading scheme maximizes the downlink transmission capacity of the CR user while keeping the interference induced to the PUs below a specified threshold. As the complexity of the optimal scheme can be high for some applications, we also propose two suboptimal schemes. Our presented simulation results demonstrate the strength of our proposed schemes compared to the classical schemes for the CR scenario. Specifically, we show that our proposed schemes can load more power into CR user band in order to achieve higher transmission capacity for a given interference threshold as specified by the PUs' network. In a related work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Wyglinski has proposed an unequal bit loading algorithm for a non-contiguous (NC)-OFDM-based CR system. In NC-OFDM-based transmission systems, subcarriers, which could potentially interfere with the transmission of other users have been proposed to deactivate. A combined spectrum pooling and adaptive bit loading for CR OFDM based system has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in order to improve the bit error rate (BER) of CR system. In order to minimize adjacent channel interference, a sidelobe suppression mechanism has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. An efficient multiuser water filling algorithm under interference temperature constraints in the OFDMA-based CR networks has been proposed for an uplink scenario in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have studied the effect of the subcarrier's nulling mechanism, which reduces the interference in the PU's band. By nulling the subcarriers that are adjacent to the PU band, more power can be loaded into far apart subcarriers for a given interference threshold. However, after nulling we cannot load any bits into the nearby subcarriers even when they have very good channel gain. Hence, nulling presents a trade-off, which we also study in this paper. Specifically, we present the power profile of different schemes under various nulling scenarios. Numerical results show that for a given interference threshold, nulling of one adjacent subcarrier improves the achievable transmission rate of suboptimal and classical schemes, while nulling of two or more adjacent subcarriers may degrade their performance. Finally, we study the effect of imperfect channel gain information at the CR transmitter.</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows. While Section II describes the system model, Section III presents the problem formulation and the optimization solution for power adaptation. In Section IV, we propose two low-complexity suboptimal schemes. We compare performance of our proposed schemes with that of the classical schemes and nulling mechanism in Section V. Selected numerical results are presented in Section VI. The effect of imperfect channel gain information at the transmitter is studied in Section VII. Finally, Section VIII concludes the paper. II. SYSTEM MODEL For an example, a possible co-existence scenario of PUs' radio and a CR user's radio in geographical location is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In fact, there may be a number of co-existence scenarios. For example, one scenario can be co-located scenario where both primary receivers and CR receiver co-exist in same user's device. For example, in future generation laptops, multiple radios will exist in a given laptop and a medium access control (MAC) coordinator will co-ordinate their MAC functionalities. One of these radios can be based on CR technology. The other co-existence scenario can be closelylocated scenario. In such scenario, different radio receivers may exist in different users' devices but these users can be closely located.</p><p>In spectral domain, we consider the same side-by-side CR radio access model as is assumed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Basically, it is assumed that the frequency bands of bandwidth B 1 , B 2 , ..., B L , in Hz which have been occupied by the PU(s) 1, 2, ...L, are sensed by the CR system and known (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) to it. The unoccupied band sensed by the CR system for possible transmission is located on each side of the PU bands 1, 2, ...L, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.The available bandwidth for CR transmission is divided into N subcarrier based OFDM system. It is assumed that the bandwidth for each CR subcarrier is Δf Hz. It is assumed that the access mechanism/modulation format in PUs' band is not known to the CR system.</p><p>In downlink transmission scenario shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, in general, there are three instantaneous fading gains: (1) between the CR user's transmitter and CR user's receiver for the i th subcarrier denoted as h ss i ; (2) between the CR user's transmitter and l th PU receiver, denoted as h sp l ; and (3) between the l th PU's transmitter and the CR user's receiver, denoted as h ps l . We assume these instantaneous fading gains are perfectly known at the CR user's transmitter. Specifically, we assume that the CR user's receiver can estimate channel gains h ss i and h ps l and report to the CR transmitter. With co-located scenario discussed earlier i.e., both primary and CR receivers are located in same device and primary receiver can estimate the channel h sp l which is reported to the CR transmitter. On the other hand, if PU and CR receivers are located in different devices, we assume that the CR transmitter can estimate the channel gain h sp l from the emitted signal from the PU 's receiver. In Section VIII, we will study the case where the instantaneous fading gains are not perfectly known at the CR transmitter rather the average fading gains of PUs are known at the CR transmitter.</p><p>The transmit power is adjusted in each CR user's subcarrier. With an ideal coding scheme, the transmission rate at the i th carrier, R i , for the transmit power, P i and channel fading gain, h ss i , is connected via the Shannon capacity formula, and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R i (P i , h ss i ) = Δf log 2 1 + |h ss i | 2 P i σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i , (1)</formula><p>where σ 2 denotes the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) variance, and J (l) i denotes the interference introduced by the lth PU's band into the i th OFDM subcarrier. It is assumed that the interference introduced by PUs into the SUs can be modeled as AWGN which may not be valid for low number of SUs. However, for larger number of SUs, AWGN assumption is a good approximation.</p><p>As it is mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that due to the coexistence of PU and CR users in side by side bands, there are two types of interference in the system. One is introduced by the PUs into the CR user's band, and the other is introduced by the CR user into the PUs' band. In what follows, we provide brief description and mathematical models for interference between CR user and PUs.</p></div>

(12)</formula><p>Hence,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">P * i = 0 if λ ≥ 1/ σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 L l=1 K (l) i .</formula><p>Therefore, we can write the optimal power profile as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">P * i = 1 λ L l=1 K (l) i - σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 if λ &lt; 1 σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 L l=1 K (l) i = 0 if λ ≥ 1 σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 L l=1 K (l) i (13)</formula><p>or, more simply, can be written as following,</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">P * i = max 0, 1 λ L l=1 K (l) i - σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 . (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>Substituting Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">14</ref>) into Eq.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">15</ref>) are positive values, the maximum of left-hand side would be achieved when the right-hand side is maximum. Hence, to maximize the capacity, i.e. to maximize the power, we solve Eq. (15) at the boundary and it is written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">L l=1 N i=1 K (l) i × max 0, 1 λ L l=1 K (l) i - σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 = I th .

Hence Proved.</p><p>It is important to mention that the power allocation policy in Eq. 9 is indeed an waterfilling policy. However, the cutoff value for the channel gain or the threshold for this waterfilling policy is weighted by the inverse of the interference term</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">L l=1 K (l)</formula><p>i . Specifically, the policy suggests that more power should be allocated to the subcarrier which has relatively better channel quality and is relatively far away from the PU's band.</p><p>IV. SUBOPTIMAL SCHEMES By using the above scheme, we can calculate the optimal power allocation policy that maximizes the transmission capacity of the CR user while keeping the interference introduced to the PUs below the specified threshold. However, several iterations may be required in finding the value of λ from Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">16</ref>) and the complexity of the optimal scheme is O(N log N ). It should be noted that the complexity of the optimal scheme is not very high, but however there might be some systems which have strict requirements on the complexity and hence, in the following section, we propose suboptimal schemes based on heuristics that have a complexity of O <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>Heuristic schemes proposed in this section are based on the fact that the interference introduced to a PU band by the CR user subcarrier increases as the spectral distance between them decreases. If we ignore the second term (</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 )</formula><p>from the power profile of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), the power is inversely proportional to the parameter</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">L l=1 K (l)</formula><p>i , which depends on the spectral distance of the i th subcarrier from the PU band. As such, in order to reduce the interference to a particular PU band, less power should be assigned to the subcarriers that are near to that PU band, and more power should be assigned to the subcarriers that are far from the PU band.</p><p>There are two types of CR user bands as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. One is adjacent only to one PU band (CR user band 1) and the other is surrounded by PU bands on both sides (CR user band 2, 3, ..., L). The allocation of less power to the nearby subcarriers suggests that the power can be distributed like a single ladder profile in CR user band 1 and like a step ladder profile in other CR user subcarriers (2, 3, ..., L), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The total transmit power is determined such that the total interference introduced by all the subcarriers is equal to the interference threshold. Based on the step size of the power profile, we propose two suboptimal schemes as follows.</p><p>A. Scheme A While allocating power using Scheme A for a particular CR user subcarrier, we consider the effect only on the PU band where it causes the most amount of interference, i.e., the PU band to which it is closest. Power is distributed such that the subcarriers that are adjacent to the PU bands are given power P . Then we increase the power by P as we move away from the PU bands. Hence, to subcarriers that are adjacent to the PU bands we allocate power P , to those that are right next to them we allocate 2P , and so on. For proposing this scheme, without loss of generality we assume that each CR user band occupies N L ≥ 1 subcarriers. Hence, we can write the power profile as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">P A i = N L + 1 -i P ∀i ∈ 1, 2, ...

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. COMPARISON WITH CLASSICAL SCHEMES AND NULLING MECHANISM</head><p>The classical OFDM loading algorithms, the uniform power loading and waterfilling schemes, are suboptimal for such an interference limited scenario, as they do not have constraints on interference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Uniform Power Loading Scheme</head><p>In the uniform power loading scheme, uniform power P is loaded into each subcarrier. In fact, the uniform power loading scheme is a special case of sub-optimal scheme A, where P A i is assumed as P . Therefore, using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">18</ref>) for a given interference threshold I th , the power allocated to the i th subcarrier with uniform power loading P U i can be easily expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">P U i = I th N i=1 L l=1 K (l) i . (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_46">)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Waterfilling Scheme</head><p>For distributing power according to the waterfilling scheme, we first determine the total power used by the uniform scheme (P U T otal ) in transmitting at the given interference threshold. Using this total power as the power constraint, the power profile for the waterfilling scheme can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_47">P WF i = 1 λ - σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 if λ &lt; 1 σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 = 0 if λ ≥ 1 σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 (24)</formula><p>or, more simply, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">P WF i = max 0, 1 λ - σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2</formula><p>. Now, the constant λ can be calculated from the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">N i=1 max 0, 1 λ - σ 2 + L l=1 J (l) i |h ss i | 2 = P U T otal (25)</formula><p>It should be noted that the interference introduced by the water-filling scheme will not be equal to I th and can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">I WF = L l=1 N i=1 K (l) i P WF i .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Nulling Mechanism</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the authors studied the effect of nulling the subcarriers and showed that the interference introduced to the PU band can be reduced by nulling those subcarriers (i.e., allocating zero power) that are adjacent to the PU band, since the adjacent subcarriers produce the maximum amount of interference. This procedure implies that for a given interference threshold, more power can be allocated to the far apart subcarriers than to the neighboring subcarriers. Thus, one would expect that a higher transmission rate can be achieved using more power. However, nulling the adjacent subcarriers loses frequency diversity, as the adjacent subcarrier is assigned with zero power even when it has a very good channel gain. Therefore, nulling creates a trade-off. Hence, here we study our proposed suboptimal schemes namely Scheme A, and Scheme B, and classical uniform-loading and water-filling scheme with the effect of nulling. It should be noted that we do not study effect of nulling on the optimal scheme, as it is already optimal, and automatically nulls the subcarriers that need to be nulled.</p><p>Here, we restrict ourselves to two cases of nulling, namely, the one-nulling and two-nulling cases. By a "one-nulling" we mean that for each side of the PU band, we null one subcarrier that is adjacent to it. Without loss of generality, we assume that each CR user band occupies N L subcarriers. Hence, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> we null 2L -1 subcarriers, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">O ∈ N L , N L + 1 , 2N L , 2N L + 1 , ...., (N ) .</formula><p>(27) Similarly, in two-nulling, for each side of the PU band we null the two subcarriers adjacent to it. Hence, for two-nulling in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> we null 2(2L -1) subcarriers, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">T ∈ N L -1 , N L , N L + 1 , N L + 2 , 2N L -1 , 2N L , 2N L + 1 , ...., (N ) . (<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_54">)</formula><p>Now for studying the nulling mechanism, we load zero power in the sub-carriers in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) or Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_53">28</ref>) for one and two nulling respectively. For the remaining sub-carriers, we load powers according to the scheme under study, such that the total interference introduced to the primary user band is equal to I th , and the power profile for the schemes can be derived accordingly. In the following section, we present simulation results that compare the performances of the various proposed schemes with the classical schemes and nulling mechanism for the CR scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In the numerical results presented in this section, we assume the values of L and N to be 4 and 20, respectively. We assume the value of T s to be 4μ seconds and Δf , B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , and B 4 have been assigned the value of 0.3125 MHz, 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 5 MHz, and 10 MHz respectively. The value of σ 2 is assumed to be 10 -3 . The value of amplitude P P U is assumed to be 10mW. The channel gains h ss i , h sp l , and h ps l is assumed to be Rayleigh fading with an average channel power gain of 10dB.

From this figure, we observe that for a given interference threshold, the optimal scheme achieves the highest transmission rate for CR users. We can also see that the transmission rate that can be achieved using the sub-optimal schemes is higher than that achieved by the classical uniform-power loading and water-filling algorithms. It can also be observed that scheme B performs better than scheme A.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, we present the transmit power of the CR user versus the interference introduced to the PU band for various schemes under consideration. We can observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> that the optimal scheme allows transmission of higher power than the other schemes for a given interference threshold.

For the sake of comparison, we have also plotted the transmission capacity of the optimal scheme in Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9. It can be observed from the figures that after nulling, the performance of the suboptimal and classical schemes improves compared with the no-nulling case. However, the optimal scheme still achieves the highest capacity for a given interference threshold. Interestingly, it can be observed from Figs. 6, 7, 8, and Interference introduced to the primary user band (in Watts) Maximum transmitted data rate of CR users (in Mbps) Optimal Scheme Classical Uniform-loading -Zero Nulling Classical Uniform-loading -One Nulling Classical Uniform-loading -Two Nulling Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.</p><p>Maximum transmitted data rate of CR user versus interference introduced to the PU band by the uniform-loading scheme for various nulling scenarios.

This result is because of the tradeoff between the interface that can be reduced by nulling additional subcarriers and the capacity that can be achieved by keeping them active. From these selected numerical results, it can be concluded that nulling additional subcarriers does not always help to improve overall system performance. We did not consider further nulling, as the associated performance degradation was checked via simulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. IMPERFECT CHANNEL-GAIN INFORMATION AT THE TRANSMITTER</head><p>In the numerical results presented in this section, we use the values of L, N , T s , Δf , B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , B 4 , σ 2 and P P U supplied Maximum transmitted data rate of CR user versus average interference introduced to the PU band when the channel gain is not perfectly known at the CR transmitter.</p><p>in Section VI. Further, the channel gains h ss i , h sp l , and h ps l are assumed to be Rayleigh fading with an average channel power gain of 10dB. Now, we assume that the CR transmitter can know the h ss i exactly as it can receive the feedback from CR receiver. But for some scenarios, e.g., closely-located scenario, it may not be possible for the CR transmitter to know the instantaneous values of h sp l and h ps l . However, the average channel gains of h sp l and h ps l can be predicted as they are closely located. Therefore, in this section, we study the performance of various algorithms assuming that only average channel gains of h sp l and h ps l are known at the CR user's BS. It is important to mention that in such case, interference constraint imposed to PUs is met in an average sense. We run our simulations for the scenario when CR transmitter only knows the average channel power gain of h sp l and h ps l . In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, we have plotted the transmission capacity of the CR user versus interference introduced to the PU band for various schemes for the the scenarios of perfect and imperfect channel information at the transmitter. Again, we have presented the curve of average transmission capacity for 100,000 simulation iterations. It can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, that performance degrades for the imperfect scenario. However, it should be noted that even with the imperfect channel gain information at the CR transmitter, proposed optimal and suboptimal schemes perform better than the classical schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we have developed an optimal power loading algorithm that maximizes the downlink transmission data rate of the CR user while the interference introduced to the PU remains within a given limit. We have also proposed two suboptimal power loading algorithms that have less complexity but can achieve a performance close to the optimal one. Presented numerical results show that the classical loading algorithms used for conventional wireless networks perform the worst for the CR scenario among the schemes considered. We have also studied the effect of nulling mechanisms on the performances of various schemes. Selected numerical results have demonstrated that the optimal scheme performs the best, and that the one-nulling case achieves better data rate performance than cases with a greater number of nullings, as well as zero-nulling cases. Finally, we have studied the case where the channel gain information is not perfectly known at the CR transmitter and found that even in this case proposed schemes perform better than the classical schemes.</p><p>For optimal power loading problem, we have assume that three values of channel gains i) between PUs receiver and CR transmitter ii) between CR receiver and CR transmitter and iii) CR receiver and PUs transmitters are known. We have mentioned some scenarios where these channel gains can be estimated and reported to the CR transmitter. However, there are some scenario's CR transmitter may not have knowledge of instantaneous channel gain between the CR transmitter and PUs receiver. We are currently working towards development of optimal power loading scheme where this instantaneous channel gain is not known to the CR transmitter.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
