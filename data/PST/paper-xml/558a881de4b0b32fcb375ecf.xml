<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Future wireless systems will need to accommodate information sources with different data rates. Direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) is a multiple access technique that is well suited to provide multirate access. Thus, in this paper, multirate communication systems are considered for the transmission of DS/CDMA wireless signals. Performance for maximum-likelihood-based detection is studied in the context of two multirate access methodologies: multicode access, where high data rate users multiplex their information streams onto multiple codes; and variable spreading length access where signature sequences of different lengths are assigned to users with different data rates. Various maximum-likelihood-based detection schemes for the variable spreading length system are considered as they can achieve near-optimal performance and thus provide reference points for comparison with suboptimal schemes. In addition, asymptotic multiuser performance measures are calculated and bounded to compare performance of the two systems.</p></div>

Receivers recently proposed for multirate CDMA systems include the conventional receiver (e.g,. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) which is a filter matched to the spreading code of the desired user. This conventional receiver is well-known to be suboptimal and suffers severe performance degradation in the absence of perfect power control. Successive interference cancellation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and the use of decorrelators <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> have also been studied. We emphasize that except for the decorrelating detector works, the prior papers do not explicitly take advantage of the multirate nature of the CDMA signals. It is noted that multirate communications was considered from a transmit pulse optimization perspective in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A qualitative discussion of multirate access methodologies is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</p><p>It is patent that the choice of multirate access method will necessarily bias the choice of receiver. Thus, in this paper, we present results comparing maximum-likelihood-based joint detection for two of the more viable multirate access schemes. The objective is to determine if one multirate access scheme is inherently better than the other. Our consideration of maximum-likelihood-based detection schemes is motivated by the need to determine benchmarks for performance of other detection methods. As the methods under study are near-optimal, they can fulfill this benchmarking role. The two access schemes to be examined are multicode access and variable spreading length access. As the probability of error is intractable, the comparison will be based on the determination of asymptotic multiuser performance measures. To this end, bounds on the asymptotic multiuser efficiency are determined for variable spreading length systems with feedback. The bounds are straightforward to derive and evaluate. In addition, the bounds can be further massaged to facilitate direct comparison of the two multirate systems under consideration. While there has been effort directed toward evaluating asymptotic multiuser performance measures for single-rate systems with decision feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, these results are either unwieldy or provide bounds that are excessively loose for the purposes of this paper. Thus, there is a need to develop suitable bounds. It is noted that the bounds developed herein are applicable to both single-rate and multirate CDMA systems.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: in Section II, the two multirate access methods are described and the relevant features of maximum-likelihood detection for CDMA systems are reviewed. New observations on detection in the variable spreading length system are presented in Section III. A com- parison of the performance achievable for the two access methods, with a focus on dual-rate systems, is provided in Section IV. In that section, a detection scheme based on feedback and maximum likelihood is presented for variable-length sequence systems. In Section V, some numerical examples are considered. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI. The Appendix provides a methodology for detection in a truly multirate system and generalizes the dual-rate bounds on performance for this scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES</head><p>We shall first present results for a dual-rate system where a user can transmit information at one of two data rates. In the Appendix, the results will be generalized for a system offering more than two data rates. Multirate access will be achieved via multicode access or variable sequence length access.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Multirate Access Methods</head><p>Multicode (MC) access can be implemented in single-rate systems and thus, offers the system construction advantage of being able to use a single-rate receiver. High rate users are accommodated by multiplexing their data onto several signature sequences. As a result, high rate data from a user is sent in parallel. MC schemes have been examined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) shows an example of how two users, one with a bit rate that is twice as fast as the other, would be supported via multicode access. Essentially, the high rate user is converted into two virtual low rate users.</p><p>is the number of chips in the signature sequence.</p><p>For variable spreading length (VSL) access, the chip rate is constant, and different data rates are accommodated with the assignment of signature sequences of different lengths. It should be noted that signature sequence design (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) in the past has relied on codes in a set having the same length. The development of more versatile signature sequence sets is necessary for this proposed scheme. We note that decorrelation-based detectors have been studied for VSL access in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. An example of this multirate access scheme is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>). Due to the assumption of a constant chipping rate for both multirate access methods, these two access schemes can be constructed to have similar bandwidth requirements.</p><p>We next review the salient features of jointly optimal detection for a single-rate system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Review of Single-Rate Maximum-Likelihood Joint Detection</head><p>In this study, we shall focus on pseudo-synchronous communication as is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We view the treatment of the pseudo-synchronous problem as a necessary precursor to considering a more general and more realistic communication channel. We begin with a single-rate synchronous system. Under the assumption that communication is synchronous, coherent, and of a constant bit-rate, the received waveform in a given symbol interval can be described as follows:</p><p>(1)</p><p>where is the received amplitude for user , is the transmitted bit for user at time , and denotes the normalized signature waveform for user .</p><p>is the number of active users. It is assumed that the channel also contains additive noise that is characterized as a white Gaussian process with variance . In the context of analyzing the minimum probability of error receiver for multiuser detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Verdú also investigated the performance of the maximum-likelihood joint detector. Note that the minimum probability of error receiver provides optimal performance for a single active user, while the maximumlikelihood joint detector optimizes performance for all active users simultaneously. The vector of data bits that maximizes the likelihood is found to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> where The matrix is a diagonal matrix such that . The are termed the matched filter outputs. A multiuser performance measure of interest in this study is the asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. The AME describes the performance degradation of a receiver due to the multipleaccess interference as the additive channel noise diminishes for a fixed set of received powers for all users. The worstcase AME over all possible received powers for the interfering users is the near-far resistance (NFR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The AME for user detected in additive white Gaussian noise with variance by a receiver with resultant probability of error is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(2)</formula><p>where is the probability of error of the optimal single-user receiver operating in a single-user environment where the signal-to-noise ratio is . This receiver is simply a filter matched to the spreading waveform of the single user.</p><p>is the complementary cumulative distribution function 1 of a zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian random variable. Thus, the near-far resistance for this user is <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> For multiuser systems employing maximum-likelihood joint detection, the multiuser performance measures defined above are found to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> (4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Having reviewed ML detection for a single-rate system, we can now consider ML detection for dual-rate systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. OBSERVATIONS ON VSL ML DETECTION</head><p>Due to the nature of VSL-received waveforms, this type of multirate access merits the investigation of detection schemes that take advantage of the waveform structure. We begin by making some observations about maximum-likelihood detection for VSL. For variable sequence length detection in a dual-rate system, we shall denote the bit interval of the lowrate users as . The high-rate users will transmit data with bit intervals of duration , where is an integer. We assume a pseudo-synchronous system where the signals of each user are as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>, and thus, the received signal is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(6) 1 Q(x) = 1 x (1= p</formula><p>2) exp f0v 2 =2g dv:</p><p>where the superscript indicates whether the parameter is for a high-rate ( ) or low-rate ( ) user. It is assumed that each user's signature sequence is normalized over the bit interval of interest, that is, for</p><p>To reiterate, it is assumed that the chipping rates for both the VSL system and the MC system are the same. Furthermore, the chipping rates for both high-and low-rate users in the VSL system are identical. It is noted that the received signal for an MC system can be described by modifying the notation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. We can make the following observations for VSL systems: Observation 1: Jointly optimal detection over the low-rate bit interval is equivalent to jointly optimal synchronous detection where each high-rate user is treated as virtual users. The signature sequence corresponding to the th virtual user ( th bit) for high-rate user is thus for else.</p><p>Observation 2: If detection of a low-rate user is performed using the observations from a high-rate bit interval , then the AME of this low-rate user is upperbounded as follows:</p><p>This result is shown via the use of a genie-aided lower bound (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) on the probability of detection error.</p><p>Observation 3: The AME of the optimal joint detector on a high-rate bit interval for those users with nonzero support on that interval is always worse than or equal to the performance of the optimal joint detector on the low-rate bit interval. This is despite the fact that there are more virtual users with nonzero support on than on . This is shown below.</p><p>We shall consider the discrete time equivalent of the received signal. We can form a matrix whose columns correspond to the chip-matched filtered and chip-rate sampled signature sequences of the transmitting users. We denote this matrix as . If we partition the users in two sets such that , then we can rewrite the signature crosscorrelation matrix as follows:</p><p>where If we consider the detection of the users with nonzero support over , then there will be a subset of users whose signals will be truncated or not present for detection over this interval. Let be the matrix whose columns are the spreading vectors for the users with nonzero support on . The signals actually employed to perform detection on this interval will be the result of projecting the codes in onto the interval of interest. Thus, the signature cross-correlation matrix of the active users with nonzero support on can be written as follows, where is the appropriate projection:</p><p>. As is a projection, this implies that .</p><p>Similarly, let denote the total number of bits (virtual users) transmitted over the low-rate bit interval . Let denote the total number of bits (virtual users) transmitted over the high-rate bit interval . We define to be the AME of user over the low-rate interval and to be the AME of user over the high-rate interval. Let where The conclusion we can draw from the previous observations is that for a multirate system utilizing VSL access, detection is preferably performed over the low-rate interval. Thus, we have proven that the low-rate decorrelation scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> will outperform the high-rate decorrelation scheme for the high-rate users proposed in the same work. This is due to the fact that the decorrelator achieves optimal near-far resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. An alternative proof for the decorrelator, which manipulates appropriate partitions of the signature cross-correlation matrix directly, is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We shall observe that the performance degradation for high-rate users detected over the high-rate interval is not as severe as that for low-rate users. This is evident from Observation 1.</p><p>The sequel defines notation, presents bounds on the performance of the VSL system with feedback, and compares the near-far resistances achievable by the two access methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. COMPARISON OF ACCESS METHODS</head><p>Comparison of the performance of optimal detection with these two access methods requires imposing assumptions on the signaling sets and the received amplitudes of the two access schemes in an attempt to equalize the communication environments.</p><p>A1: Assuming a one-to-one mapping between virtual users in each access scheme, the cross-correlation for users and will be the same in both systems unless and correspond to two users that are orthogonal in the VSL system. This quantity is determined by where is the spreading signal for virtual user over the low-rate bit interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A2:</head><p>The received amplitudes for analogous virtual users in the two access schemes are the same.</p><p>Assumption [A2] implies that the energy per bit, for each user, for each system, is the same.</p><p>An unfortunate facet of MC multirate access is that nonzero cross-correlations will exist between pairs of virtual users whose analogs in the VSL system will be orthogonal. Consider the scenario depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> with a single low-rate and highrate user. The signature cross-correlation matrices for optimal detection over for each access method are given below. We denote the low-rate user as user 1 and the two virtual users associated with the high-rate user as users 2 and 3 Calculation of the near-far resistances for the users reveals conditions under which the VSL access scheme provides improved performance over the MC scheme if and if It is clear that under certain circumstances, employing VSL multirate access would ensure improved performance over the commensurate MC system. It is arguable that the second condition above will almost always be met in systems with reasonable cross-correlations (i.e.,</p><p>). However, the first condition will not be met in such cases if and . Thus, negative cross-correlations could improve the performance of the MC system for this scenario. It is, of course, possible for the MC virtual users corresponding to a single high-rate user to have reduced or zero cross-correlations. However, there will be still be correlation induced between pairs of virtual users corresponding to distinct high-rate users in the MC scenario. The reduction in correlation between virtual users of the same high-rate user set will be considered in Section V.</p><p>We make the following remark: VSL access naturally invites the use of multistage detection algorithms for the detection of high data rate users prior to that of low data rate users. This is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, where two high-rate and two low-rate users are depicted. The dotted box shows the users that are detected in the high-rate interval (detect first) and those to be detected in the second stage (detect second). This notion will be the basis of our study.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, a multicode access scheme is suggested. A key characteristic of the system described is that the spreading codes of virtual users corresponding to a single high-rate user will be orthogonal. In practice, due to the electromagnetic effects of the radio channel, this orthogonality will be impossible to maintain. In looking toward future work, we present the following justification of this claim. Consider small delay spreads and a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel. For a fixed set of channel coefficients, we can consider the effects of channel on the transmitted spreading code as a convolution of the code with the channel. That is, . The discrete time, chip-sampled version of the spreading waveform is denoted by the vector , while is the Sylvester matrix corresponding to the channel convolution operation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). The effective received spreading vector is denoted by . We shall consider two MC spreading codes that were originally orthogonal and determine whether their effective received codes retain that orthogonality. Let but Thus, unless (the identity matrix), orthogonality cannot possibly be maintained even in this simple example. On the other hand, if the delay spread is short, orthogonality in time can be maintained for the VSL system. It is observed that should it be possible to obtain perfect channel estimates, equalization can reduce the correlation.</p><p>We shall investigate this characteristic by considering systems with a highly structured correlation matrix. We will reduce the correlation between MC virtual users and observe the effects on performance. We note that even if the scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is adopted, there will still be virtual users in the MC system that have correlated spreading codes while their VSL analogs will be orthogonal.</p><p>We shall consider ML detection where the active users can be partitioned into three sets: denotes the set of users currently being detected, denotes the set of users whose data bits are being fed back, and denotes the rest of the users. The signature cross-correlation matrix (over the low-rate interval) of the spreading codes of these users can be partitioned as seen below</p><p>In the sequel, the will denote restriction (of codes and/or correlation matrices) to the high-rate interval. In regards to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b</ref>), a possible partition is , , and . We note that this signature cross-correlation matrix could describe either or , the difference between the two schemes is that if and are two sets of distinct highrate users, zero matrix. This reiterates the observation above that a characteristic of MC multirate access is that nonzero cross-correlations will exist between pairs of virtual users whose analogs in the VSL system will be orthogonal.</p><p>Prior to comparing performance of these two multirate access schemes numerically, we will present bounds on the AME for jointly optimal detection with feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Bounds on ML AME with Feedback</head><p>We next develop bounds on the asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> for optimal multiuser detection with decision feedback of optimally detected prior decisions. It is noted that the motivation behind seeking these bounds is to find an expression for detection in the VSL system with feedback that admits a straightforward comparison to the MC system. Thus, our objective is not to determine the exact AME for detection with feedback. Research directed to this end can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. However, the resulting expressions are difficult to manipulate for our comparison. The approach taken here is to apply the techniques employed in <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. We shall denote the AME achieved via ML detection for user after feedback as . It should be noted that the bounds to be developed are general and can be applied to single-rate CDMA systems as well.</p><p>We shall consider bounds on in a multistep process. Proposition 1 will provide a lower bound on where one will consider the detection of even partial low-rate bits. As this scenario will incur additional complexity, this bound is loosened to consider the more practical scenario of ignoring partial low-rate bits to provide the group detection bound [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(21)</ref>]. However, the form of this bound does not facilitate direct comparison to the MC system. Thus, by straightforward manipulation, we will then consider a second lower bound (Proposition 2). The form of this second lower bound will enable us to directly compare performance as it will have the same form as that of the AME of a single-rate system.</p><p>We provide the following. Proposition 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">For (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where and is the set of indecomposable error sequences as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for the active user set . is the set of all possible vector values for and thus, , where is the cardinality of union of the sets and . The restriction of to the estimated bits that are fed back is denoted as .</p><p>, , and are the appropriately restricted diagonal amplitude matrices.</p><p>Proof: Let denote the probability of detection error for user for the optimal receiver with feedback of optimally derived prior decisions. It can be shown that the effects of feedback are captured exclusively by the difference between the actual data bits and their estimated values, for . Let be the vector of data bits that will be estimated first; the corresponding vector estimate is given by . We shall denote the difference between the actual and estimated vectors as . For the moment, it is proposed that optimal detection be performed for all users over the high-rate bit interval; that is, users 1, 2, 5, and 6 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The decisions for users 5 and 6 will not be fed back, as the fidelity of these decisions will be low from Observation 2. Hence, the definition of ; which notes that the low-rate users are observed on the restriction to the high-rate interval. We observe that it is possible to perform optimal group detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for users 1 and 2 and not estimate the bits for users 5 and 6. The lower bound currently under development will be modified in the sequel for such a scenario.</p><p>As noted earlier, the bounding methods employed will rely on techniques developed in <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Let be the function maximized for maximum-likelihood detection of the first set of data bits <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> The vector is the set of matched filter outputs over the high-rate detection interval. We now proceed to bound Equation ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) follows from ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) by appropriate conditioning.</p><p>is the set of admissible error-vectors and is defined as . The following can be shown [16]: the event is independent of , it is also independent of the event ; and where is the number of nonzero elements in . A bound for the first probability above is developed similarly <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where analogously, is the function maximized for the maximum-likelihood detection of user .</p><p>is the set of indecomposable error sequences as defined in <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. We shall next observe that despite a contribution in the signal from misfed bits, is independent of , as in the case of optimal detection without feedback. However, this event is a function of . The vector of matched filter outputs employed for the detection of user conditioned on is then <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> The columns of the matrix are the spreading codes of the users in . Note that is the contribution due to possible errors in the detection of .</p><p>is the restriction of to the difference vector that is actually fed back. Recall the earlier discussion which noted that although the low-rate user bits may be detected over the high-rate data interval, they will not be fed back.</p><p>From ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), we see that conditioned on , is a Gaussian random variable. The probability in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) can be evaluated explicitly <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> If we combine the bounds on and (15) above, we have (16)</p><p>We next use a bound (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>) for the bounding of the product of functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(17)</ref> This results in the following bound:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(18)<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Thus, it is straightforward to use this expression to realize a lower bound on the asymptotic multiuser efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> (20)</p><p>And the proposition is proven. Each term in the bound above has an intuitive description: is a measurement of the fidelity of the estimates of the bits that are fed back, while quantifies the impact of prior decisions. It is straightforward to show that the bound described above is tighter than the lower bound offered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>; however, this tightness is at the expense of a significant increase in computational complexity.</p><p>We next revisit the issue of optimal group detection. For complexity reasons, it would be prudent to not explicitly optimally detect the data bits which will not be used for feedback purposes. In such a case, optimal group detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> would be employed. The reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for explicit details. The lower bound developed above can be easily modified to accommodate optimal group detection on the data bits to be fed back. This type of a feedback scenario is referred to as sequential group detection in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The lower bound on the asymptotic efficiency when group detection is used in the first stage is <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(21)</ref> where is the Schur complement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> of the signature crosscorrelation matrix partitioned according to users that are fed back and those that are not. That is, . is the appropriately restricted amplitude matrix and is defined much as . It is noted that . In order to facilitate comparison of the MC and VSL systems we will further lower bound the AME.</p><p>Proposition 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">For (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where where is the set of indecomposable error sequences for the communications scenario described by and . Proof: For ease of manipulation we replace the functions above in ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) by their vector/matrix forms.

This is a modified perfect interference cancellation bound which we will observe to be fairly tight for the scenarios considered. This bound is simply the AME under the assumption that the first-stage estimates are perfect. This bound is given as (24) where and are the appropriate function and set, respectively, defined for optimal detection of all active users simultaneously without feedback.

This activity is motivated by the fact that closed-form expressions can be derived for the near-far resistances and appropriate bounds of all active users using the results of Propositions 3 and 4. In addition, we wish to consider the effects of cross correlation between the virtual users in the MC system corresponding to the same high-rate user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we consider numerical examples for comparing performance of the VSL and MC multirate access schemes with jointly optimal detection. We examine the scenario portrayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>: two high-rate and two low-rate users with . This dual-rate system will be studied in the context of three types of spreading code sets: general, equicorrelated, and pseudo equicorrelated. A general code set is generated from -sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> with no other optimization for cross correlation between codes. Although results are shown for a particular  realization of the code assignments, several numerical studies indicate that performance is commensurate for other randomly chosen code sets. In an equicorrelated code set, each pair of distinct codes has the same cross correlation. Finally, we shall investigate the performance of a pseudo equicorrelated system. In this case, the cross correlation between distinct MC users' codes will have one value, while the cross correlation between two virtual users' codes corresponding to the same high-rate user will be a fraction of that value. As stated earlier, the motivation for investigation of this scenario is to study whether the minimization of the cross correlation between the codes assigned to a single high user in the MC system will have a significant effect on the performance.</p><p>The curves exhibited will be denoted as follows: MC describes the AME of the MC system as calculated using (3); the upper bound (VSL UB) for ML detection in a VSL system with feedback is derived from (24); a lower bound (VSL LB) for ML detection in a VSL system with feedback is derived Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Performance comparison of MC and VSL systems for equicorrelated code set ( = 0:1). from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>; while the second lower bound found in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">22</ref>) is labeled as VSL SLB. The performance for estimating the VSL data bits which will be fed back is denoted by L-VSL to indicate detection over the low-rate bit interval and H-VSL to indicate detection over the high-rate interval. Note that these curves (L-VSL and H-VSL) are for detection without feedback. The AME will be plotted as a function of varying amplitude ratio , where is the amplitude of the desired user and denotes the amplitude of the interferers. All interferers will have equal amplitude.</p><p>1) General Code Set Case: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> considers detection of low-rate users with a general code set. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(a) shows performance for detecting a low-rate user without feedback, while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b</ref>) exhibits performance for detecting a low-rate user with feedback. It is clear that the VSL access system offers a distinct advantage over the MC system. It is also patent that detection of low-rate users should not be done over the highrate interval. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b)</ref>, we note that the lower and upper bounds for detection with interference cancellation are quite tight. From Observation 3, it is clear that . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> provides the performance curves for the detection of a high-rate user. Once again the VSL system exhibits superior performance. We shall see that the advantages of the VSL system are uniformly realized in the detection of the high-rate users over their bit interval of duration.</p><p>2) Equicorrelated Code Set Case: We next provide results from the consideration of an equicorrelated system. Sample cross-correlation matrices ( and ) are provided below for a system where there are two low-rate users (virtual users 1-2) and two high-rate users (virtual users 3-6) and</p><p>We shall see that the value for the common cross-correlation value significantly affects the results. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows the AME for the two systems when ; for this scenario it is preferable to employ the VSL system. However, if the cross correlation is positive as in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> , there is minimal gain to using the VSL system. We note that for the detection of low-rate users with feedback that the first lower bound (VSL LB) is essentially coincident with the upper bound while the second lower bound (VSL SLB) is quite loose. For both scenarios, we observe that the effects of feedback for the detection of low-rate users is not as significant as is seen for high-rate users. However, these results are not surprising. In such a scenario, the relative interference between the low-rate user and the remaining users is the same for both multirate access systems. It should be underscored, however, that for general code sets, it has been observed that the VSL system offers superior performance. We next consider the near-far resistance of these systems. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> exhibits the regions (shaded) where . For all plots, the region above the dotted line depicts valid cross-correlation values for an equicorrelated system. These values ensure a positive definite cross-correlation matrix. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>(a) and (b) considers the detection of high-rate users without feedback, and the boundaries were determined using <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> with appropriate cross-correlation matrices. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7(a)</ref> there are two high-rate users and the number of low-rate users is varied, while in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>(b) there are two low-rate users and the number of high-rate users is varied. It is clear that for most valid values of , the VSL system offers superior performance. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7(c</ref>) and (d) exhibits the relevant regions for the detection of high-rate users with feedback. The boundaries were determined using (25) and (26). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7(c</ref>) there are two high-rate users and the number of low-rate users is varied, while in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7(d</ref>) there are two low-rate users and the number of high-rate users is varied. The regions of for which with feedback are more circumspect, but this could be attributed to the fact that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">22</ref>) is potentially a loose bound. In fact, due to the looseness of this bound for low-rate users with feedback [Figs. 5(b) and 6(b)], regions for such users are omitted.</p><p>3) Pseudo Equicorrelated Code Case: We next turn our attention to a pseudo equicorrelated system, where the correlation structure for the MC system is varied in a controlled manner. We consider an MC system where the cross correlation between distinct users is [e.g., users 1, 3 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>] and the cross correlation between bits (virtual users) of a particular high-rate user is where [e.g., in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>]. is a positive factor which represents the reduction in cross correlation between the codes of MC virtual users corresponding to the same high-rate user. To crystallize this notion, we provide example cross-correlation matrices. We describe a system where there are two low-rate users (virtual users 1-2) and two high-rate users (virtual users 3-5) and</p><p>The consideration of this scenario is propelled by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>For the VSL system, the cross correlation between distinct users is , and the signals due to distinct data bits for high rates are orthogonal. Detection of high-rate users after feedback is studied. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, we get a sense of how increasing affects the AME for the MC system. We see that while the AME for the high-rate users increases slightly, it is still less than the lower bound for the VSL system. In fact, as is evidenced by the curves, the VSL lower bound is still better than the AME achievable by the MC system even when the high-rate code sets are mutually orthogonal.  it was observed that the corresponding low-rate performances decrease as increases for the MC system.</p><p>We next consider the effect of varying on the near-far resistances for the two systems under investigation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> exhibits the regions (shaded) where for the pseudo equicorrelated case. Again, the regions above the dotted lines depict valid values of . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>(a) and (c) considers a communication scenario with two high-rate users and six low-rate users. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>(b) and (d) portrays the dual scenario: two low-rate users and six high-rate users.</p><p>These figures show that if the cross correlation between virtual users can be minimized, there is improvement in the performance of the MC system; however, this improvement is not significant. This is due to the fact that there are virtual users Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. Performance comparison of MC and VSL systems for a three-rate system: P 1 = 1, P 2 = 2, P 3 = 4; there are two users of each rate.</p><p>due to distinct high-rate users which still have nonzero cross correlation in the MC system. It is in the scenario where all of the MC users are mutually orthogonal that the MC system can outperform a VSL system. However, this would require coordination between distinct users which is not practically possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we provided observations and results comparing jointly optimal detection for two multirate CDMA systems. It is clear that the VSL methodology can offer improved performance in the detection of high data rate users for realistic cross-correlation values, although performance for low data rate users is comparable in the two systems. We have assumed that each user employs the same chipping rate. Thus, this improvement in performance is achieved by VSL despite the fact that it is assumed that all users occupy the same bandwidth. There are other considerations to weigh when determining which system to use. The VSL multistaged approach has lower complexity than the MC system. The complexity of the MC system is of order , while the VSL multistaged system (employing group detection) has complexity . If is large, the difference in complexity for performing detection will be considerable. In addition, there is an inherent delay present in the MC system due to the fact that high-rate data is multiplexed and transmitted in parallel. We note that, in general, for both systems, each virtual user corresponding to a particular highrate user, and thus the corresponding bits can potentially have a different probability of error.</p><p>Future work will focus on communication in more realistic communication channels, i.e., channels with asynchronous communication and multipath. set of users with data rates such that ; set of users which are fed back, which by definition must have rates . This invites the following detection strategy:</p><p>For detection on we employ group detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> with regards to users present in set , thus, an equivalent system can be derived by appropriate projection of spreading codes onto the null-space of the space spanned by the users in . The reader is directed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for further details. The system now reduces, in a sense, to the dual-rate system: a set of users is currently detected and a set of users is fed back . We can thus modify Proposition 1 as follows. The sets for describe the subsets of users that are detected with feedback, thus . Similarly, the sets for describe the subsets of users that are detected without feedback, and as such . The set (without subscript) refers to the appropriate partition of that is in fact fed back. Correspondingly, and are the appropriate partitions of the total error vector . The functions and are defined as in (8) for the appropriate user sets. Finally, is the appropriate complete set of error sequences. We note that most other variables are defined similarly to the variables in Proposition 1 with one distinct caveat: each spreading code for detection over a particular interval is the restriction of the code to the null-space of those users whose data rates are less than the interval under consideration. It is clear that there is a corresponding Proposition A.2 that generalizes Proposition 2 for the multirate case.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, we show the AME's for a three-rate system. It is intriguing that for the users of the higher rate, the VSL system offers a definitive advantage, while for the low-rate user, there is a loss in performance versus the MC system. In addition, one can observe that the second lower bound is not as tight for the low-rate user as for other users. This is to be expected given the information that is neglected in the computation of the second lower bound.</p><p>Urbashi Mitra (S'90-M'94) received the B.S. degree with high honors and the M.S. degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1987 and 1989, respectively, both in electrical engineering and computer science.
