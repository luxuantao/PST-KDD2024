<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nature-inspired algorithms are becoming popular among researchers due to their simplicity and flexibility. The nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms are analysed in terms of their key features like their diversity and adaptation, exploration and exploitation, and attractions and diffusion mechanisms. The success and challenges concerning these algorithms are based on their parameter tuning and parameter control. A comparatively new algorithm motivated by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves is Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), which is a very successful algorithm for solving real mechanical and optical engineering problems. In the original GWO, half of the iterations are devoted to exploration and the other half are dedicated to exploitation, overlooking the impact of right balance between these two to guarantee an accurate approximation of global optimum. To overcome this shortcoming, a modified GWO (mGWO) is proposed, which focuses on proper balance between exploration and exploitation that leads to an optimal performance of the algorithm. Simulations based on benchmark problems and WSN clustering problem demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and stability of mGWO compared with the basic GWO and some well-known algorithms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Overview of Grey Wolf Optimizer Algorithm</head><p>Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a typical swarm-intelligence algorithm which is inspired from the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. Grey wolves are considered as apex predators; they have average group size of 5-12. In the hierarchy of GWO, alpha (𝛼) is considered the most dominating member among the group. The rest of the subordinates to 𝛼 are beta (𝛽) and delta (𝛿) which help to control the majority of wolves in the hierarchy that are considered as omega (𝜔). The 𝜔 wolves are of lowest ranking in the hierarchy.</p><p>The mathematical model of hunting mechanism of grey wolves consists of the following:</p><p>(i) Tracking, chasing, and approaching the prey.</p><p>(ii) Pursuing, encircling, and harassing the prey until it stops moving.</p><p>(iii) Attacking the prey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Encircling Prey.</head><p>Grey wolves encircle the prey during the hunt which can be mathematically written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27</ref>]</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">⃗ 𝐷 = 󵄨 󵄨 󵄨 󵄨 󵄨 󵄨 ⃗ 𝐶 ⋅ 󳨀 󳨀 → 𝑋 𝑝 (𝑡) -⃗ 𝑋 (𝑡) 󵄨 󵄨 󵄨 󵄨 󵄨 󵄨 , ⃗ 𝑋 (𝑡 + 1) = 󳨀 󳨀 → 𝑋 𝑝 (𝑡) -⃗ 𝐴 ⋅ ⃗ 𝐷,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝑡 indicates the current iteration, ⃗ 𝐴 and ⃗ 𝐶 are coefficient vectors, 󳨀 󳨀 → 𝑋 𝑝 is the position vector of the prey, and ⃗ 𝑋 indicates the position vector of a grey wolf.</p><p>The vectors ⃗ 𝐴 and ⃗ 𝐶 are calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">⃗ 𝐴 = 2 ⃗ 𝑎 ⋅ 󳨀 → 𝑟 1 -⃗ 𝑎, ⃗ 𝐶 = 2 ⋅ 󳨀 → 𝑟 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where components of 𝑎 are linearly decreased from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations and 𝑟 </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">󳨀 → 𝑋 1 = 󳨀 → 𝑋 𝛼 - 󳨀 → 𝐴 1 ⋅ ( 󳨀 → 𝐷 𝛼 ) , 󳨀 → 𝑋 2 = 󳨀 → 𝑋 𝛽 - 󳨀 → 𝐴 2 ⋅ ( 󳨀 → 𝐷 𝛽 ) , 󳨀 → 𝑋 3 = 󳨀 → 𝑋 𝛿 - 󳨀 → 𝐴 3 ⋅ ( 󳨀 → 𝐷 𝛿 ) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">⃗ 𝑋 (𝑡 + 1) = 󳨀 → 𝑋 1 (𝑡) + 󳨀 → 𝑋 2 (𝑡) + 󳨀 → 𝑋 3 (𝑡) 3 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>(5)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Attacking Prey.</head><p>In order to mathematically model for approaching the prey, we decrease the value of ⃗ 𝑎. The fluctuation range of ⃗ 𝐴 is also decreased by ⃗ 𝑎. ⃗ 𝐴 is a random value in the interval [-𝑎, 𝑎] where 𝑎 is decreased linearly from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations. When random values of ⃗ 𝐴 are in [-1, 1], the next position of a search agent can be in any position between its current position and the position of the prey. The value |𝐴| &lt; 1 forces the wolves to attack the prey.</p><p>After the attack again they search for the prey in the next iteration, wherein they again find the next best solution 𝛼 among all wolves. This process repeats till the termination criterion is fulfilled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Modified GWO Algorithm</head><p>Finding the global minimum is a common, challenging task among all minimization methods. In population-based optimization methods, generally, the desirable way to converge towards the global minimum can be divided into two basic phases. In the early stages of the optimization, the individuals should be encouraged to scatter throughout the entire search space. In other words, they should try to explore the whole search space instead of clustering around local minima. In the latter stages, the individuals have to exploit information gathered to converge on the global minimum. In GWO, with fine-adjusting of the parameters 𝑎 and 𝐴, we can balance these two phases in order to find global minimum with fast convergence speed.</p><p>Although different improvements of individual-based algorithms promote local optima avoidance, the literature shows that population-based algorithms are better in handling this issue. Regardless of the differences between population-based algorithms, the common approach is the division of optimization process to two conflicting milestones: exploration versus exploitation. The exploration encourages candidate solutions to change abruptly and stochastically. This mechanism improves the diversity of the solutions and causes high exploration of the search space. In contrast, the exploitation aims for improving the quality of solutions by searching locally around the obtained promising solutions in the exploration. In this milestone, candidate solutions are obliged to change less suddenly and search locally.</p><p>Exploration and exploitation are two conflicting milestones where promoting one results in degrading the other. A right balance between these two milestones can guarantee a very accurate approximation of the global optimum using population-based algorithms. On the one hand, mere exploration of the search space prevents an algorithm from finding an accurate approximation of the global optimum. On the other hand, mere exploitation results in local optima stagnation and again low quality of the approximated optimum.</p><p>In GWO, the transition between exploration and exploitation is generated by the adaptive values of 𝑎 and 𝐴. In this, half of the iterations are devoted to exploration (|𝐴| ≥ 1) and the other half are used for exploitation (|𝐴| &lt; 1), as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a). Generally, higher exploration of search space results in lower probability of local optima stagnation. There are various possibilities to enhance the exploration rate as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b), in which exponential functions are used instead of linear function to decrease the value of 𝑎 over the course of iterations. Too much exploration is similar to too much randomness and will probably not give good optimization results. But too much exploitation is related to too little randomness. Therefore, there must be a balance between exploration and exploitation.</p><p>In GWO, the value of 𝑎 decreases linearly from 2 to 0 using the update equation as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑎 = 2 (1 - 𝑡 𝑇 ) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where 𝑇 indicates the maximum number of iterations and 𝑡 is the current iteration. Our mGWO employs exponential function for the decay of 𝑎 over the course of iterations. Consider</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝑎 = 2 (1 - 𝑡 2 𝑇 2 )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(c). Using this exponential decay function, the numbers of iterations used for exploration and exploitation are 70% and 30%, respectively. The pseudocode of mGWO is given in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and Discussion</head><p>This section investigates the effectiveness of mGWO in practice. It is common in this field to benchmark the performance of algorithms on a set of mathematical functions with known global optima. We also follow the same process and employ 27 benchmark functions for comparison. The test functions are divided to four groups: unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite benchmark functions. The unimodal functions (𝐹 1 -𝐹 7 ) are suitable for benchmarking the exploitation of algorithms since they have one global optimum and no local optima. On the contrary, multimodal functions (𝐹 8 -𝐹 13 ) have a large number of local optima and are helpful to examine exploration and local optima avoidance of algorithms. The mathematical formulation of the employed test functions is presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. We consider 30 variables for unimodal and multimodal test function for further improving their difficulties.</p><p>Since heuristic algorithms are stochastic optimization techniques, they have to be run at least more than 10 times to generate meaningful statistical results. It is again a common strategy that an algorithm is run on a problem 𝑚 times and average/standard deviation/median of the best obtained solution in the last iteration are calculated as the metrics of performance. We follow the same method to generate and report the results over 30 independent runs. In order to verify the performance of mGWO algorithm, PSO, BA, CS, and GWO algorithms are chosen. Note that we utilized 30 search agents and 3000 iterations for each of the algorithms.</p><p>The convergence curves of unimodal, multimodal, fixeddimension multimodal, and composite benchmark functions for the competitive optimization algorithms are given in Figures <ref type="figure">2, 3, 4,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, respectively. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>   mGWO algorithm provides the best results in 5 out of 7 unimodal benchmark test functions. The mGWO algorithm also provides very competitive results compared to CS on 𝐹 5 and 𝐹 6 . As discussed above, unimodal functions are suitable for benchmarking exploitation of the algorithms. Therefore, these results evidence high exploitation capability of the mGWO algorithm.</p><p>The statistical results of the algorithms on multimodal test function are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. It may be seen that mGWO algorithm highly outperforms other algorithms on 𝐹 9 , 𝐹 10 , 𝐹 11 , and 𝐹 12 . It should be noted that mGWO algorithm outperforms other algorithms on these multimodal test functions except PSO for 𝐹 13 . The results of multimodal test function strongly prove that high exploration of mGWO algorithm is a suitable mechanism for avoiding local solutions. Since the multimodal functions have an exponential number of local solutions, the results show that mGWO algorithm is able to explore the search space extensively and find promising regions of the search space. In addition, high local optima avoidance of this algorithm is another finding that can be inferred from these results.</p><p>The rest of the results, which belong to 𝐹 14 -𝐹 23 and 𝐹 24 -𝐹 27 , are provided in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>, respectively. The results are consistent with those of other test functions, in which mGWO shows very competitive results compared to other algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Cluster Head Selection in WSN Using mGWO</head><p>Cluster head (CH) selection problem is a well-known problem in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in which the energy consumption cost of the network should be minimized <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. In this paper, this problem is solved using mGWO algorithm and compared with GA, PSO, BA, CS, and GWO. The main challenges in designing and planning the operations of WSNs are to optimize energy consumption and prolong network lifetime. Cluster-based routing techniques, such as the well-known low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, are used to achieve scalable solutions and extend the network lifetime until the last node dies (LND). In order to achieve prolonged network lifetime in cluster-based routing techniques, the lifetime of the CHs plays an important role. Improper cluster formation may cause some CHs to be overloaded. Such overload may cause high energy consumption of the CH and degrade the overall performance of the WSN. Therefore, proper CH selection is the most important issue for clustering sensor nodes. Designing an energy efficient clustering algorithm is not an easy task. Therefore, nature-inspired optimization algorithms may be applied to tackle cluster-based routing problem in WSN.

The results show that the proposed method is found to be very effective for real-world applications due to fast convergence and fewer chances to get stuck at local minima. It can be concluded that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform the current well-known and powerful algorithms in the literature. The results prove the competence and superiority of mGWO to existing metaheuristic algorithms and it has an ability to become an effective tool for solving real word optimization problems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Updating the value of 𝑎 for GWO, (b) some samples of possible functions for updating 𝑎 over the course of iterations, and (c) updating the value of 𝑎 over the course of iterations for mGWO.</figDesc></figure>
