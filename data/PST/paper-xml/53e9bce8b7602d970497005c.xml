<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>all computational cost depends on the number of iterations used.</p><p>Our experience has been that the algorithm attains steady state around 25 iterations; hence, its complexity per pixel is still a constant. For large images ( N ? 256), the proposed iterative algorithm is found to be much more computationally efficient than the Wiener filtering/FFT procedure, and in terms of storage requirement, the former needs only three ( N x N ) arrays compared to four for the latter. In addition, the iterative nature of the new image restoration algorithm readily facilitates man-machine interaction.</p><p>2) Recursive Noise Smoothing Algorithm: In the recursive noise smoothing algorithm, Kalman filtering is used to smooth out observation noise in image data <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. Direct computation of the recursive equations of the Kalman filter for an image of size N = 256 is extremely involved as it requires multiplication and inversion of size (256 X 256) matrices in the computation of the gain matrix H ( i ). To circumvent this problem, the image is segmented into several strips of size ( N X n ) , such that the gain matrix H,( i ) of the segmented image is now ( n x n). The steady-state value of H, ( i ) is used to construct the ( N X N ) gain matrix H ( i ), which results in a matrix H that is sparse and has quasi-Toeplitz form with a small number of distinct elements. This matrix H is then taken as the gain matrix for all i , i = 1 , 2, . . . , <ref type="bibr">256 (refer to [lo]</ref>).</p><p>The complexity of this algorithm can be seen to be of the order of nN2 for the computation of the restored image and n3 for the computation of the segmented gain matrix H, ( i ). For small values of n (i.e., n = 16), the order of complexity is similar to that of the proposed iterative algorithm, but as n is increased (this happens when a better improvement in the restored image is required), the computational cost for the gain matrix is increased to the third power. However, the memory requirement for the computation of this recursive algorithm is small, requiring only one ( N x N ) array and one ( N X 1 ) array. Comparing the rate of convergence of the proposed new algorithm to that of the gain matrix H , ( i ) of the recursive noise smoothing algorithm, it is seen that the former is three times faster than the latter. In addition, one has control over the rate of convergence of the new iterative algorithm by choosing the values of the parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>The feasibility of the iterative algorithm was established by simulation with real images for different input SNR's. The results obtained experimentally are seen to agree with the theoretical derivations. The dependency of the rate of convergence of the algorithm on the input SNR and on the correlation parameters is shown graphically, as was the improvement in SNR ( A S N R ) achieved for various values of 1. The advantages that this iterative restoration method is seen to have are that it does not exhibit any high noise sensitivity, restores images without significant loss of resolution, and is also able to restore images having low values of 1.</p><p>Due to its low computational complexity and low storage memory requirement, the iterative algorithm can be easily implemented in digital hardware that operates on a column-by-column and rowby-row basis. It is also possible to extend the proposed iterative algorithm to include the restoration of color imagery by representing each pixel of the image as a vector instead of as a scalar.</p><p>ing a single sinusoid corrupted with noise are proposed. In our approach, the IIR filter is a cascade of second-order all-pole and all-zero filters and the coefficients of FIR section are adapted. The proposed algorithms keep the poles of the filter inside the unit circle. The computer simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have considerable potential in adaptive notch filter applications, especially when the input signal-to-noise ratio is low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The ALE (adaptive line enhancer) was first proposed by Widrow <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref>, and studied in depth by other authors, e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[3], and [4]</ref>. The FIR (finite impulse response) filter was used at first. However, recently, Rao and Kung proposed an ALE using an adaptive IIR notch filter <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. This ALE adapts 2 p coefficients for p sinusoids. Nehorai <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref> also proposed a notch-type ALE which adapts only p coefficients for p sinusoids by restricting the zeros of the notch filter to the unit circle. The idea of using an IIR notch filter is attractive since it can reject the interference signals. Also, it requires much smaller filter length than the ALE with an FIR filter. However, the Gauss-Newton algorithm, which is used in <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref>, is computationally complicated and quite sensitive to some of the initial conditions.</p><p>In this correspondence, we propose a new ALE by employing a lattice-type IIR notch filter, which is adapted using adaptive algorithms related to the lattice FIR filters. Our study is motivated by various attractive properties of lattice adaptive filters [7]. Two algorithms are proposed for adaptation purposes, during which the algorithms keep the poles of the filter inside the unit circle. Thus, the system is stable after the coefficients have converged. The first algorithm adapts two coefficients for a sinusoid. The second adapts only one coefficient by restricting the zeros of the filter to the unit circle as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref> and [8]. To compare the convergence characteristics of lattice ALE to direct form realizations, simulations were performed under several different conditions for the proposed algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">ALE WITH AN IIR NOTCH FILTER OF LATTICE TYPE</head><p>Rao and Kung [5] constructed an ALE as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. In this ALE, H ( z ) is a transfer function of notch filter. For enhancing a sine wave, the transfer function H ( z ) is given by ( l ) , which can be rewritten as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(2)</ref>, where a is the parameter that determines the bandwidth of the notch filter.</p><p>-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 + W I Z -, + w2z-? 1 + a w , z -I + cY2w2z-2 - (wI = -2r cos 8, w 2 = r 2 ) . ( 2 )</formula><p>The value of a closer to I implies a narrower notch. That is, if a is closer to I , H ( z ) becomes a more ideal notch filter.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. s ( k ) and 17 ( k ) arc the sine wave signal and broadband noise, respectively, and " * " represents the estimates of each signal. In [SI, the coefficients of H ( z ) are adapted so as to minimize the mean-square value of the output A ( k ) of the notch filter by means of the Gauss-Newton algorithm.</p><p>The ALE proposed in this correspondence has the same structure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. However, a lattice filter is used instead of the direct form filter. If a notch filter of lattice type is constructed in standard form as can be seen in [ l ] or <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[7]</ref>, the relationships of the coefficients in the numerator and denominator of the transfer function would be very complicated. Thus, we employ a lattice IIR filter which can be viewed as a cascade of all-pole and all-zero lattice filters as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[9]</ref>. The structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. By this realization, many adaptation algorithms used for the FIR filters of the lattice type can be directly used. The transfer function of the filter is   <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is to be a transfer function of a notch filter, the following equations must be satisfied, as can be seen from ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ao(l + a , ) = ako(l + k , ) ( 4 ) a , = a2kl. (5a)</formula><p>Also, ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and (5a) yield Thus, a, and a. are expressed in terms of ko and k , by (5). In our approach, ko and k , can be adapted by employing the adaptive algorithms for lattice FIR filters. Then the coefficients of the all-pole filter a , and a. are computed using (5). But, if a is close to 1, we can see that the following approximations hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">a , = a 2 k , = a k , (<label>6a</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">) uO( 1 + U , ) = aka( 1 + k1) = ko( 1 + a k l ) . (<label>6 b )</label></formula><p>Thus, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">6</ref>) yields a , = a k , (7a)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a. = ko. (7b)</formula><p>Hence, it is noted that (3) can still be considered as a notch filter even if <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(7)</ref> is used instead of (5). Since ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is simpler in computation than ( 5 ) , we shall use <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(7)</ref> for the development of the adaptation algorithm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the frequency response of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(3)</ref> where cr = 0.95, k , = 1, and ko = -c o s ( T / ~) . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(a) corresponds to the case when the coefficients are related by ( 5 ) , and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(b) is the case of employing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(7)</ref>. Comparison of the figures shows that (b) is nearly the same as (a) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>Based on the filter of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> whose coefficients are related by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(7)</ref>, we derive two adaptation algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Method I</head><p>Stability conditions of the filter shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> are that ( a o / and 1 a , I must be less than 1. Thus, if I ko I and 1 k , 1 were less than 1, then the filter is stable from the relationships of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(7)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Method 11</head><p>In Method I and <ref type="bibr">[ 5 ]</ref> , the zeros will eventually converge to the unit circle. Thus, if the magnitudes of the zeros are fixed to 1 and only the phases of them are adapted, then the number of adaptive coefficients needed for p sinusoids is only p . Hence, the adaptive algorithm would be simpler and the convergence speed would increase in this case. Based on these notions, Nehorai <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ng [8]</ref> independently proposed an ALE with the notch filter of direct form.</p><p>Siniilarly, by restricting the zeros of the lattice filter of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> to the unit circle and adapting only the phases of them, we can derive a simpler method than Method I. Restricting the zeros of the lattice filter in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> to the unit circle implies fixing k , to 1.</p><p>In this approach, since the adaptive parameter is only ko, it can be adapted to minimize the time averages of s : ( n ) and r ; ( n ) . When k , is fixed to I , it is easy to show that the following equations hold from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2:</ref> It can be shown that the I k, 1's are always less than</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 [ 1 I]. Thus, s2(n) = r l ( n -I ) + s , ( n ) r 2 ( n ) = s , ( n ) + r l ( n -1 ) . (9a) (9b)</formula><p>In this case, r 2 ( n ) is always equal to s z ( n ) . Hence, k o ( n ) is to be adapted to minimize the time average of s:(n) only. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, s l ( n ) and r , ( n ) can be expressed in terms of k o ( n ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">s , ( n ) = so(n) + ko(n)ro(n -1) r , ( n ) = ko(n)so(n) + ro(n -1 ) . ( l o a ) ( lob)</formula><p>By substituting these equations in (9a), we can obtain s 2 ( n ) in terms of k o ( n ) and k,(n -1 ) as s 2 ( n ) = ko(n -I)s0(fi -1) + ko(n)ro(n -1 )</p><p>+ ro(n -2 ) + so(n).</p><p>(11) If we assume that the adaptive estimate ko( n -1 ) is approximately equal to k o ( n ) , then we can represent them as ko. Then the cost function can be represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">n n ~( n ) = c h"-hs:(k) = c ~-k ( ~( k ) k ~ + ~( k ) ) ' A ( n ) = so(n -1) + ro(n -1) B ( n ) = ro(n -2 ) + s o ( n ) . (12a) (12b) (12c) k = O h = O</formula><p>The value of ko which minimizes (12a) is used as ko(n + 1 ) in our approach. This term can be expressed as (13a), which can also be computed recursively by ( <ref type="formula">13b</ref>) and (13c):</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C ( n ) = XC(n -1) + A ( n ) B ( n ) (13b) D ( n ) = h D ( n -1) + A 2 ( n ) (0 &lt; h &lt; I ) . ( 1 3 ~)</formula><p>In the Burg algorithm, 1 D,,, ( n ) 1 is always greater than 1 C,, ( n ) 1,</p><p>as can be seen from (8); thus, the k,'s are always less than 1. But in this case, it is not guaranteed that I D ( n ) 1 will always be greater than ( C ( n ) J in (13). Thus, it is possible that I k o ( n ) l becomes greater than 1, and the poles of the filter may not be inside the unit circle in the process of adaptation. In fact, during the simulation, it was observed that 1 ko( n ) I sometimes exceeded 1 or fluctuated severely at the beginning when the input noise power was large. Hence, the filter might become unstable and diverge. To keep 1 ko( n ) 1 less than 1 and to make the variation smaller, it is necessary to limit k o ( n ) in the range of [ -I , I ] by clipping. Also, in order to reduce the effect of clipping further, we use kh( n), which is obtained by ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), instead of k o ( n ) . In fact, the smoothing process of ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) is equivalent to the low-pass filtering: kh(n) = ( 1 -y)kh(n -1 ) + yk"(n) (7 = 0.5). ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>111.</head><p>SlMULATlON RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS To compare the performance of proposed algorithms (method I and method 11) to the performance of the notch filters of direct form 151, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref>. computer simulation was performed under several different conditions. For convenience, Rao and Kung's algorithm [SI and Nehorai's <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref> will be referred to as DFALEI (direct from ALE) and DFALE2, respectively. The normalized input frequency is varied from 0.0 to 0.4 Hz with the interval of 0.1, and three different cases of SNR for -6, -3, and 0 dB are tested. Simulation was performed 30 times for each case by changing the seed numbers of the pseudorandom number generating program. In order to test the algorithms in the same environment, we have set the value of CY equal to 0.95 for DFALEI and 0.9025 for method I and method I1 since the value of CY in our approach corresponds to that of CY' in DFALEl . This ensures that the poles of all these methods are on the circle of the same radius when the magnitudes of the zeros are of the same value. Because method I1 and DFALE2 adapt only the phases, we decide that the filter has converged if the difference between the true phases and the average phases of zeros in the recent ten steps are less than 0.5". In method I and DFALEl, since the zeros are not constrained on the unit circle, the convergence criterion for the magnitude of the zeros should also be considered. The convergence criterion for the magnitude in the simulation is that the distance of the zeros from the origin is in the range of [0.8, I]. The value of h used for the proposed algorithms is the best possible value obtained by trial and error.</p><p>In method I and method 11, all the initial conditions are set to 0. In DFALEI, the initial value of Po [5] affects convergence prop-erties considerably as the input frequencies vary. However, it was found from the simulation that Po = 1 yielded relatively good performance. Tables <ref type="table">I</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I1</ref> summarize the results of 30 trials using method I and DFALEI, respectively. But the results for SNR = -6 dB for DFALEl are omitted from the table because it diverged for most of the time. Instead, the result for SNR = 3 dB is shown. In the tables, "C.AVE" denotes the sample mean of the convergence times where the "C.STD" denotes the sample standard deviation. "DIVRG" is the number of occurrences where the filter parameters failed to converge within 1000 steps. Comparison of method I and DFALEl shows that DFALEl experiences more of a divergence problem than method I. This result clearly demonstrates the advantage of employing lattice filters in the implementation of the notch filter. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">111</ref> presents the results for method 11. As expected, method I1 performs better. This consequence is expected since the zeros are restricted to lie on the unit circle in method 11. For fairness of the comparison, attempts have also been made to compare method I1 to DFALE2. The results of DFALE2 are presented in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>. From Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I11</ref> and<ref type="table">IV</ref>, it is shown that, when the filter parameter converges, DFALE2 gives slightly faster convergence results than method 11. However, DFALE2 shows a tendancy of converging less frequently than method 11. For example, when the SNR = 0 dB, DFALE2 does not converge in many cases, but method I1 converges in all trials performed. This observation is essentially the same as that made in method I and DFALEl. It seems that the notch filter with a lattice implementation converges more consistently than the notch filter of direct form [SI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref>. In addition, computational requirements for method I and method I1 are smaller than those of DFALEl and DFALE2 because the Burg algorithm (method I) and its variation (method 11) are used in our approach. If the structure is extended to the multiple sinusoid case, the lattice ALE will require still less computational complexity than the DFALE's. The reason for this is that the Burg algorithm, as well as many other lattice FIR algorithms, has order N computational complexity, while the Gauss-Newton algorithm has order N 2 complexity.</p><p>To compare the convergence behavior in another way, learning curves for method I1 and DFALE2 are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Each of these learning curves is obtained by averaging the behavior of 30 trials. It is seen that two algorithms show almost the same convergence behavior. Finally, we repeated the simulation with the colored noise, which is generated by passing a white noise sequence through a bandpass filter. Since all results for the colored noise cases are similar to the results of the white noise cases, the simulation results of the colored noise cases are omitted. The results show that the algorithms proposed in this correspondence have considerable potential in adaptive notch filter applications, especially when the input signal-to-noise ratio is low.</p></div>

CONCLUSION</head><p>Based on a lattice form realization of an adaptive IIR notch filter, two simple methods for retrieving a single sinusoid corrupted with noise are proposed. In our approach, we considered the IIR filter as a cascade of second-order sections, and the coefficients of the FIR section are adapted using the Burg algorithm or its variation.</p><p>The methods proposed here keep the poles of the IIR filter inside the unit circle; thus, it satisfies the stability condition after the filter parameters have converged.

WARD Abstmct-The restoration of images distorted by systems with noisy point spread functions and additive detection noise is considered. The criterion considered for the restoration is based on the Wiener technique. The proposed Wiener-based filter is iterative in nature. The overall computation of this modified Wiener filter can be carried out in the frequency domain using the FFT and circulant matrix approximation. Experimental results show that the modified Wiener filter outperforms its linear counterpart (based on neglecting the impulse-response noise). The modified Wiener filter also gives better restoration results than a recently proposed Backus-Gilbert technique. The Wiener-based filter is found to be computationally robust and inexpensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Restoration of images distorted by a system with a random blur function has been studied in recent years. The phenomenon of random blur describes an important class of imaging systems-those in which the impulse response function (or the transfer function) is random. The uncertainty of random blur may result from random amplitude and phase fluctuations of the pupil function of the optical system, due to such effects as optical propagation through turbulence or dust particles on the lens. Another class exhibiting the phenomenon of random blur is that of a scanning image-formation system (scanning microscope, microdensitometer. or laser printer) where the width of the beam has random noisy fluctuations. Random blur may also result from random vibrations of the imaging system relative to the object.</p><p>Previous work in this area has been limited. In 1967, Slepian <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[3]</ref> addressed this problem using the Wiener filter. Franks [4] used the same approach for random dispersive channels in communications. Heide [ 5 ] investigated this problem using several restoration schemes based on the assumption of Gaussian statistics for the random parameters in the blur function. Other methods applied to such restoration problems where the impulse response is unknown include the so-called blind deconvolution method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref>. Ward and Saleh [8] discussed the same problem via the Backus-Gilbert technique. But there, the randomness in the point spread function was confined in its width to that of the impulse response. In this work, the noise in the point spread function does not have to be confined to the width of the impulse response.</p><p>Manuscript received April I , 1987; revised July 15. 1988 </p></div>			</div>
