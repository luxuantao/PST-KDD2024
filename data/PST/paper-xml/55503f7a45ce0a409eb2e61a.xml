<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A time series is a sequence of data points, measured typically at successive points in time and spaced at uniform time intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Examples of time series are the daily closing value of the Mexican Stock Exchange. Time series are very frequently plotted via line charts. Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy and communications engineering.</p><p>Stock fund managers and financial analysts attempt to predict price activity in the stock market on the basis of either their professional knowledge or stock analyzing tools, in order to obtain gains in prices in the stock market.</p><p>For more than one decade, time series models have also been applied to solve various domain problems, such as financial forecasting.</p><p>In this paper the design of a neural network ensemble with the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) and its integration with type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems, along with simulation results for the prediction of the Mexican Stock Exchange are presented. In the literature there has been a lot of recent work in time series prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, which indicate the recent importance of the topic. Time series prediction with hybrid models has also been a hot topic in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. This paper shows the results of an optimized ensemble neural network and its fuzzy response aggregation for predicting the time series of the Mexican Stock Exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The PSO technique is used to optimize the neural network ensemble, as this can help in finding a good solution to a complex problem, which in this case is to find the best ensemble neural network architecture to obtain the minimum forecast error for the time series mentioned above and to integrate the results with type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems.</p><p>The main contribution of the paper is the proposed model of a neural network ensemble with type-2 fuzzy logic for response integration. In addition the particle swarm optimization method determines the number of modules of the neural network ensemble, number of layers and number of neurons per layer, and thus obtains the best architecture of the ensemble neural network. After obtaining this architecture the results from the modules are aggregated with type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems, the inputs to the fuzzy system are the responses according to the number of network modules and this are the number of inputs of the fuzzy system. In this case, the maximum number of inputs is of 5 inputs and one output with two Gaussian membership functions and these are be granulated in two linguistic variables that are low and high forecast, and the forecast output will also be low or high and thereby obtain the forecast error for this series of the Mexican Stock Exchange. The proposed hybrid ensemble of neural networks with fuzzy response aggregation and its optimization with PSO is main contribution of the paper, as this hybrid approach has not been proposed previously in the literature for this kind of time series prediction problems. This paper considers the times series of the Mexican Stock Exchange because the problem is quite complex and the time series is chaotic in some periods of time and for this reason an ensemble model is justified. To consider different possible behaviors we have also previously worked with other time series, such as the Mackey-Glass s ¼ 17; 34 and 68 and this series has chaotic behavior and as the value of s increases it will be more chaotic. Also the US/Dollar/MX Peso and the Dow Jones time series, which are quite complex, have been considered with ensembles and have produced good results in these cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>We can find that there are similar ensemble approaches in the literature, but the main difference is that in the proposed approach in this paper we use type-2 fuzzy aggregation of responses in the ensemble, which is not found into other similar works. The idea of using type-2 fuzzy logic is the better manage the uncertainty in prediction. In addition, we also use PSO to optimize ensemble neural network, which is not so commonly used in ensembles.</p><p>We consider this as the new contribution, since the results obtained are better than other methods proposed in the literature.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the architecture of the ensemble neural network, basic concepts of the proposed method, Section 3 describes the concepts particle swarm optimization, In Section 4 Optimization Ensemble Neural Network with Particle Swarm Optimization. Section 5 describes the concepts of fuzzy systems as methods of integration. In Section 6 the methodology for solving it are represented, Section 7 describes the simulation results of the proposed method, in Section 8 the comparison and the t student test are presented, and Section 9 shows the conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Time series and prediction</head><p>Time series are analyzed to understand the past and to predict the future, enabling managers or policy makers to make properly informed decisions. A time series analysis quantifies the main features in data and the random variation. These facts, combined with improved computing power, have made time series methods widely applicable in government, industry, and commerce. Time series models often form the basis of computer simulations. Some examples are assessing different strategies for control of inventory using a simulated time series of demand; comparing designs of wave power devices using a simulated series of sea states; and simulating daily rainfall to investigate the long-term environmental effects of proposed water management policies A time-series is defined as a sequence of observations on a set of values that takes a variable (quantitative) at different points in time. Time series are widely used today because organizations need to know the future behavior of certain relevant phenomena in order to plan, prevent, and so on, their actions. That is, to predict what will happen with a variable in the future from the behavior of that variable in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The data can behave in different ways over time, this may be a trend, which is the component that represents a long-term growth or decline over a period of time. A cycle is also possible, which refers to the wave motion that occurs around the trend, or may not have a defined or random manner; there are seasonal variations (annual, biannual, etc.), which are a behavior patterns that are repeated year after year at a particular time <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The word ''prediction'' comes from the Latin prognosticum, which means I know in advance. Prediction is to issue a statement about what is likely to happen in the future, based on analysis and considerations of experiments. Making a forecast is to obtain knowledge about uncertain events that are important in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Time series prediction tries to predict the future based on past data, it take a series of real data x t À n, . . . x t À 2.0 x t À 1, x t and then obtains the prediction of the data x t + 1, x t + 2 . . . x n + n. The goal of time series prediction or its model is to observe the series of real data, so that future data may be accurately predicted <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Ensemble neural network</head><p>Artificial neural networks are inspired by the biological nervous system architecture, which consists of a large number of relatively simple neurons that work in parallel to facilitate rapid decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</p><p>A neural network is a system of parallel processors interconnected as a directed graph. Schematically each processing element (neurons) in the network is represented as a node. Its most important advantage is to solve problems that are too complex for conventional technologies, problems that have no solution algorithm and its solution algorithm is very difficult finding. Artificial neural networks are formed by a large number of neurons; these are not called artificial neurons but output nodes or units. Ensemble models are formed by a collection of neural networks with the idea of combining multiple decisions and achieving a better result. These ensemble models behave remarkably well, recently it has become a very hot topic in both the neural networks and machine learning communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and has already been successfully applied to diverse areas such as face recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, optical character recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, scientific image analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, medical diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, seismic signals classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, etc.</p></div>

PSO is a search algorithm based on the behavior of biological communities that exhibits individual and social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, and examples of these communities are groups of birds, schools of fish and swarms of bees <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</p><p>A PSO algorithm maintains a swarm of particles, where each particle represents a potential solution. In analogy with the paradigms of evolutionary computation, a swarm is similar to a population, while a particle is similar to an individual. In simple terms, the particles are ''flown'' through a multidimensional search space, where the position of each particle is adjusted according to its own experience and that of its neighbors. Let x i denote the position i in the search space at time step t; unless otherwise stated, t denotes discrete time steps. The position of the particle is changed by adding a velocity, m t (t), to the current position, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x i ðt þ 1Þ ¼ x i ðtÞ þ v i ðt þ 1Þ<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">with x i (0) $ U(X min , X max ).</formula><p>It is the velocity vector the one that drives the optimization process, and reflects both the experimental knowledge of the particles and the information exchanged in the vicinity of particles.</p><p>For gbest PSO, the particle velocity is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v ij ðt þ 1Þ ¼ v ij ðtÞ þ c 1 r 1 ½y ij ðtÞ À x ij ðtÞ; þc 2 r 2 ðtÞ½ŷ j ðtÞ À x ij ðtÞ<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where v ij (t) is the velocity of the particle i in dimension j at time step t; c 1 and c 2 are the positive acceleration constants used to scale the contribution of cognitive and social skills, respectively, yr 1j (t), yr 2j (t) $ U(0, 1) are random values in the range</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[0, 1].</formula><p>The best personal position in the next time step t + 1 is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y i ðt þ 1Þ ¼ y i ðtÞ if f ðx i ðx i ðt þ 1ÞÞ P f y i<label>ðtÞÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">x i ðt þ 1Þ if f ðx i ðx i ðt þ 1ÞÞ &gt; f y i ðtÞÞ<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where f : R nx ! R is the fitness function, as with EAs, the goal is measuring the fitness function closely corresponding to the optimal solution, for example the objective function quantifies the performance, or the quality of a particle (or solution).</p><p>The overall best position, y_ (i) (t) at time step t, is defined as: ŷðtÞ y o ðtÞ; . . . ; y s ðtÞ f g f ðyðtÞÞ ¼ min f y o ðtÞ ð Þ; . . . f ðy s ðtÞÞ; f g ð6Þ</p><p>where n s is the total number of particles in the swarm, More importantly, the above equation defining and establishing ŷ the best position is uncovered by either of the particles so far as this is usually calculated as the best personal best position.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Fuzzy systems</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, fuzzy logic was conceived by Lotfi A. Zadeh in 1965, based on a fuzzy set that differs from the traditional sets considering now that the membership degree is define by a function that represents a membership, which evaluates the input, and according to some predefined rules, assigns the membership degree to a fuzzy set.</p><p>Fuzzy Set: Let X be a space of objects and x be a generic element of X. A classical set A, A # X, is defined as a collection of elements or objects x e X, such that each x can either belong or not belong to the set A. By defining a characteristic function for each element x in X, we can represent a classical set A by a set of ordered pairs (x, 0) or (x, 1) which indicates x R A or xA, respectively. Unlike the aforementioned conventional set, a fuzzy set expresses the degree to which an element belongs to a set. Hence the characteristic function of a fuzzy set is allowed to have values between 0 and 1, which denotes the degree of membership of an element in a given set. The basic structure of a fuzzy inference system consists of three conceptual components: a rule base, which contains a selection of fuzzy rules; a dictionary, which defines the membership functions used in the fuzzy rules; and a reasoning mechanism, which performs the inference produce (usually the fuzzy reasoning) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, there is another class of fuzzy systems called type-2 fuzzy systems, which were also proposed b Q3 y</p><p>Zadeh. The reason to augment the original fuzzy systems is to consider higher levels of uncertainty, broadening their scope.</p><p>In type-2 fuzzy systems the membership functions can now return a range of values that varies depending on the uncertainty involved, not only in the input but also on the same membership function.</p><p>The structure of the type-2 fuzzy rules is the same as for the type-1 case because the distinction between type-2 and type-1 is associated with the nature of the membership functions. Hence, the only difference is that now some or all the sets involved in the rules are of type-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>As an example: Consider the case of a fuzzy set characterized by a Gaussian membership function with mean m and a standard deviation that can take values in [1r 1 , r 2 ], i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">lðxÞ ¼ exp À1=2 x À m r h i 2 ; r½r 1 ; r 2<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>Corresponding to each value of r we will get a different membership curve (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). So, the membership grade of any particular x(except x = m) can take any of a number of possible values depending upon the value of r i.e., the membership grade is not a crisp number, it is a fuzzy set. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the domain of the fuzzy set associated with x = 0.7; however, the membership function associated with this fuzzy set is not shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>Gaussian type-2 fuzzy set. A Gaussian type-2 fuzzy set is one in which the membership degree of every domain point is a Gaussian type-1 set contained in [0, 1].</p><p>Interval type-2 fuzzy set. An interval type-2 fuzzy set is one in which the membership degree of every domain point is a crisp set whose domain is some interval contained in [0, 1].</p><p>Footprint of uncertainty: The uncertainty in the primary memberships of a type-2 fuzzy set, Ã, consists of a bounded region that we call the ''footprint of uncertainty'' (FOU). Mathematically, it is the union of all primary membership functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Upper and lower membership functions. An ''upper membership function'' and a ''lower membership functions'' are two type-1 membership functions that are the bounds for the FOU of a type-2 fuzzy set Ã. The upper membership function is associated with the upper bound of the FOU(Ã). The lower membership function is associated with the lower bound of the FOU(Ã). Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Type-1 membership functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operations of type-2 fuzzy sets</head><p>Union of type-2 fuzzy sets. The union of f A 1 and f A 2 is another type-2 fuzzy set, just as the union of type-1 fuzzy sets A 1 and A 2 is another type-1 fuzzy set. More formally, we have the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f A 1 [ f A 2 ¼ Z x2X l e A 1 [ e A 2 ðxÞ=x<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>Intersection of type-2 fuzzy sets. The intersection of f A 1 and f A 2 is another type-2 fuzzy set, just as the intersection of type-1 fuzzy sets A 1 and f A 2 is another type-1 fuzzy set. More formally, we have the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">f A 1 \ f A 2 ¼ Z x2X l e A 1 \ e A 2 ðxÞ=x<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>Complement of a type-2 fuzzy set. The complement of a set is another type-2 fuzzy set, just as the complement of type-1 fuzzy set A is another type-1 fuzzy set. More formally we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f A 1 ¼ Z x l e A 0 1 ðxÞ=x<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>where the prime denotes complement in the above equation. In this equation l e A 0 1 is the secondary membership function.</p><p>Type-2 fuzzy rules. Consider a type-2 FLS having r inputs x 1 2 X 1 ; . . . ; x r 2 X r and one output y e Y. As in the type-1 case, we can assume that there are M rules; but, in the type-2 case the 'th rule has the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R 1 : IF x 1 is Ã1 1 and . . . x p is e A 1 P ; THEN y is b Y 1 1 ¼ 1; . . . M:<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>6. Optimization of the ensemble neural network with particle swarm optimization</p><p>The operation of the optimization algorithm by the swarm of particles is given by a sequence of steps, which are:</p><p>1. Generate the initial swarm.</p><p>2. Evaluate the particles of the swarm.</p><p>3. Updating the particle velocity.</p><p>4. Calculating new positions of the particles.</p><p>From steps 2-4, begins an iterative process until a stopping criterion is satisfied. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we can see the outline of the algorithm of particle swarm optimization.</p><p>To optimize the Ensemble Neural Network following the outline of the algorithm of particle swarm optimization, the first step is to create a swarm of particles, and to create the swarm we have to choose the representation of candidate solutions (particles), for which we choose a real representation.</p><p>Once we have the representation of candidate solutions (particles), set the number of variables to indicate the position of the particle or possible solution to our problem, number of the particle. Set the number of variables that will form the particle, the initial population is generated randomly within a set range for each variable according to upper and lower limits of the search space for each variable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Model description</head><p>This section describes the proposed model for the neural network ensembles, the objective is to optimize the architecture of a neural network with the particle swarm optimization method.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> represents the Ensemble Neural Network Model, where we have first the historical data, then the optimization algorithm based on swarms means of particles determines the number of modules of the ensemble neural network, which can be from 1 to 5 modules, as well as the number of layers that this module, that could of from 1 to 3 and the number of neurons by layer that could be of 1 to 3. Then after the responses of neural network ensemble are obtained the integration is performed with type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems. The input and output linguistic variables of the fuzzy system have Gaussian membership functions. The performance of the type-2 fuzzy integrators is analyzed under different levels of uncertainty to find out the best design of the membership functions for the rules of the fuzzy system. For the type-2 fuzzy integrator using 2 membership functions, which are called ''low prediction'' and ''high prediction'' for each of the inputs and the output of the fuzzy system. Membership functions are of Gaussian type and we deal with 3 footprint uncertainty sizes of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 to obtain a better prediction of the time series.</p><p>If we consider 5 modules in the ensemble then the fuzzy system will have 5 input linguistic variables and the rules used are determined according to the possible combinations according to the number of inputs and membership functions of the fuzzy system. Considering that have 5 inputs and two membership functions for each of the inputs then there are 32 possible combinations.</p><p>Each of the modules in the ensemble is a neural network and the calculations are performed as follows:</p><p>The net input x of a node is defined by the weighted sum of the incoming signals plus a bias term. For instance, the net input of the output of the node j is given as follows.</p><p>x j ¼ X</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">i x ij þ x j ; x ¼ f ð x j Þ ¼ 1 1 þ expðÀ x j Þ ;<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>where x i is the output of node i located in any of the previous layers, x ij is the weight associated with the link connecting nodes i and j, and x j is the bias of node j. Since the weights x ij are actually internal parameters associated with each node j changing the weights of the node will alter behavior of the node and in turn alter behavior of the whole backpropagation MLP.</p><p>A squared error measure for the pth input-output pair is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">E P ¼ X ðd k À x k Þ 2<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Methodology</head><p>This section describes the general architecture of the proposed ensemble neural network model. The aim of this work was to implement a PSO algorithm to optimize the neural network architectures, for each of the modules, number of neurons and number of layers and thus find an architecture for the neural network that produces the best results in each particular time series that is considered. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref> shows the overall architecture, where historical data for each time series prediction, in this case the Mexican Stock Exchange is used as input, and then the time series analyzed and in the next step the data provided to the modules, which are optimized with PSO in which the particle contains information of the ensemble neural network for the optimization. The particle gives us the number of modules, number of layers and number of neurons are then applied to the neural network ensemble and then these results of these modules are integrated with an integration method based on type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic and finally obtain the prediction error. Derived from the monitoring of global trends and changes that have occurred in legislation, the MSE concluded with the conversion process, becoming a company whose shares are likely to be traded on the market stock exchange, with the initial public offering taking place on June 13 of 2008 with its shares representing its capital <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Data of the Mexican Stock Exchange time series: In this case 800 points are used, that correspond to a period from 11/09/ 05 to 01/15/09 where we plot in the x axis the historical data in this case the day and in the y axis the closing of the Mexican Stock Exchange (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). In the experiment 70% of the data were used for the ensemble neural network training and 30% to test the network <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>.</p><p>After some tests were performed, another period of data from 04/08/08 to 05/09/11 for this series was also selected, where we plot in the x axis the historical data in this case day, and the y axis is the closing of the Mexican Stock Exchange (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p><p>For the optimization of the structure of the ensemble neural network a particle swarm optimization algorithm was used.</p><p>The structure of the swarm particle represents the structure of the ensemble.</p><p>The objective function is defined to minimize the prediction error as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">EM ¼ X D i¼1 ja i À x i j !, D<label>ð16Þ</label></formula><p>where a, corresponds to the predicted data depending on the output of the network modules, X represents real data, D the Number of Data points and EM is the total average prediction error.  The corresponding particle structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> represents the particle structure to optimize the ensemble neural network, where the parameters that are optimized are the number of modules, number of layers, and number of neurons of the ensemble neural network. PSO determines the number of modules, number of layers and number of neurons per layer, that the neural network ensemble should have and that meets the objective to achieve a better Prediction error.</p><p>The parameters for the particle swarm optimization algorithm are: 100 Particles, 100 iterations, Cognitive Component (C1) = 2, Social Component (C2) = 2, Constriction coefficient of linear increase (C) = (0-0.9) and Inertia weight with linear decrease (W) = (0.9-0). We consider a number of 1-5 modules, number of layers of 1-3, number neurons of 1-30.</p><p>The network parameters used to train the neural network ensemble for each of the ensembles are 100 epochs, learning rate of = 0.01, the error goal 0.01, training method of Levenberg-Marquardt (trainlm), these parameters were used in this work because previous tests were performed and we managed to obtain a good prediction error with these parameters.</p><p>The parameters for the particle swarm optimization algorithm are: 100 particles, 100 iterations and these parameters were used because previously an optimization with a genetic algorithm was considered and to compare it with this method we used similar parameters, Cognitive Component (C1) = 2, Social Component (C2) = 2, Constriction coefficient of linear increase (C) = (0-0.9) and Inertia weight with linear decrease (W) = (0.9-0), these parameters were used since we did perform a manual testing and by changing the values and with these parameters we obtain a better prediction error also. We consider a number of 1-5 modules, number of layers of 1-3, neurons number of 1-30, as maximum number of modules, layers and neurons that had already previously been tested with 3 modules and increasing error gives us better prediction.</p><p>The aggregation of the responses of the optimized ensemble neural network is performed with type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems. In this work a fuzzy system consisting of 5 inputs depending on the number of modules of the neural network ensemble and one output are used. Each input and output linguistic variable of the fuzzy system uses 2 Gaussian membership functions because the performance of the type-2 fuzzy aggregators is analyzed under different levels of uncertainty to find out the best design of the membership functions for the 32 rules of the fuzzy system with good results. Previous tests have been performed only with a three input fuzzy system, however the fuzzy system changes according to the responses of the neural network to the fuzzy system to give us better prediction error. In the type-2 fuzzy system we also change the levels of uncertainty to obtain the best prediction error.   Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">9</ref> represents the possible 32 rules of the fuzzy system; we have 5 inputs in the fuzzy system with 2 membership functions, and outputs with 2 membership functions. These fuzzy rules are used for the type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Comparison of results</head><p>A comparison of results for this time series of the Mexican Stock Exchange for the period of 11/09/05 to 01/15/09 with the paper entitled: ''An Ensemble Neural Network Architecture with Fuzzy Response Integration for Complex Time Series Prediction'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>, shows that the best result was using an ensemble neural network architecture with 1 layer using 3 delays.</p><p>The error obtained by the average integration was 0.0479, by the average weighted integration was 0.0519 and by fuzzy integration was 0.1094, respectively. In the same work the authors decided to implement an evolutionary approach to optimize the membership functions and rules of this system and the obtained error was of 0.045848. The genetic algorithm was applied to optimize the monolithic neural network for the Mexican Stock Exchange time series: 0.1092, (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">9</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In this paper the best result when applying the genetic algorithm to optimize the ensemble neural network was: 0.00112, (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1.">Statistical t students test</head><p>In statistics, the stu Q5 dent t-test or t-test is a test that uses the statistical Student's t distribution to find out if a proposed null hypothesis is true. The test is applied when the population is normally distributed, but the sample size is too small for making the inference based on a normally distributed statistic, using an estimate of the standard deviation instead of the  actual value. In this section the results with the t student test are shown, and it can be noticed that there is statistical evidence of significant difference in the results between the type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems. In other words, it can be said that for this time series prediction results are better with type-2 fuzzy aggregation than with type-1 fuzzy integration. The number of samples used for the type-1 were 10 and 30 samples for type-2, the t value obtained for type-1 in series number 1 is:</p><p>À5.96 and À4.56 for series number 2, so that the results show that in our tests more than 99% confidence was obtained of significant improvement with type-2 fuzzy logic according to the achieved value of P, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> shows results of the prediction error for the Ensemble Neural Network (without fuzzy aggregation), the prediction error with type-1 fuzzy aggregation and the prediction error with type-2 fuzzy and a 0.3 level of uncertainty for the time series 1.</p></div>

In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> it is clearly noted that using the response aggregation (type-1 or type-2) produces results that are significantly improved with respect to only using the results of the modules in the ensemble (first column of results). Both type-2 and type-1 fuzzy aggregation in the ensemble clearly help outperform the ensemble without fuzzy logic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we considered the PSO algorithm to optimize the architecture of the ensemble neural network to predict the time series of the Mexican Stock Exchange, where good results were obtained, and we can say that this algorithm is good in speed when compared with other optimization techniques. PSO is an effective and efficient meta-heuristic to find the solution of this kind of problems. In conclusion the use of ensemble neural networks with type-2 fuzzy integration could be a good choice in predicting complex time series. Future works would be to optimize with the particle swarm algorithm the type-1 and type-2 fuzzy system aggregators to obtain an even better prediction error. type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems could be optimized in terms of the parameters of the membership functions, membership type and number of rules.</p><p>12.
