Some examples include social networks in computational social sciences, sensor networks in communications, functional networks in brain imaging, regulatory networks in genetics, and meshed surfaces in computer graphics. In many applications, such geometric data are large and complex (in the case of social networks, on the scale of billions) and are natural targets for machine-learning techniques. In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural-language processing, and audio analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of deep learning</head><p>Deep learning refers to learning complicated concepts by building them from simpler ones in a hierarchical or multilayer manner. Artificial neural networks are popular realizations of such deep multilayer hierarchies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> for many additional examples of successful applications of deep learning). Today, deep learning has matured into a technology that is widely used in commercial applications, including Siri speech recognition in Apple iPhone, Google text translation, and Mobileye vision-based technology for autonomously driving cars. One of the key reasons for the success of deep neural networks is their ability to leverage statistical properties of the data, such as stationarity and compositionality through local statistics, which are present in natural images, video, and speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. These statistical properties have been related to physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> and formalized in specific classes of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. In image analysis applications, one can consider images as functions on the Euclidean space (plane), sampled on a grid. In this setting, stationarity is owed to shift invariance, locality is due to the local connectivity, and compositionality stems from the multiresolution structure of the grid. These properties are exploited by convolutional architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, which are built of alternating convolutional and downsampling (pooling) layers. The use of convolutions has a twofold effect. First, it allows extracting local features that are shared across the image domain and greatly reduces the number of parameters in the network with respect to generic deep architectures (and thus also the risk of overfitting), without sacrificing the expressive capacity of the network. Second, the convolutional architecture itself imposes some priors about the data, which appear very suitable especially for natural images <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. While deep-learning models have been particularly successful when dealing with speech, image, and video signals, in which there are an underlying Euclidean structure, recently there has been a growing interest in trying to apply learning on non-Euclidean geometric data. Such kinds of data arise in numerous applications. For instance, in social networks, the characteristics of users can be modeled as signals on the vertices of the social graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>. Sensor networks are graph models of distributed interconnected sensors, whose readings are modeled as time-dependent signals on the vertices. In genetics, gene expression data are modeled as signals defined on the regulatory network <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>. In neuroscience, graph models are used to represent anatomical and functional structures of the brain. In computer graphics and vision, three-dimensional (3-D) objects are modeled as Riemannian manifolds (surfaces) endowed with properties such as color texture.</p><p>The non-Euclidean nature of such data implies that there are no such familiar properties as global parameterization, common system of coordinates, vector space structure, or shift invariance. Consequently, basic operations like convolution that are taken for granted in the Euclidean case are even not well defined on non-Euclidean domains. The purpose of this article is to show different methods of translating the key ingredients of successful deep-learning methods, such as CNNs, to non-Euclidean data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geometric learning problems</head><p>Broadly speaking, we can distinguish between two classes of geometric learning problems. In the first class of problems, the goal is to characterize the structure of the data. The second class of problems deals with analyzing functions defined on a given non-Euclidean domain. These two classes are related, because understanding the properties of functions defined on a domain conveys certain information about the domain, and vice versa, the structure of the domain imposes certain properties on the functions on it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of the domain</head><p>As an example of the first class of problems, assume to be given a set of data points with some underlying low-dimensional structure embedded into a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Recovering that low-dimensional structure is often referred to as manifold learning or nonlinear dimensionality reduction and is an instance of unsupervised learning (note that the notion of manifold in this setting can be considerably more general than a classical smooth manifold; see, e.g., this example a little general social network 基因 参考⽂献？ <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>). Many methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction consist of two steps: first, they start with constructing a representation of local affinity of the data points (typically, a sparsely connected graph). Second, the data points are embedded into a low-dimensional space, trying to preserve some criterion of the original affinity. For example, spectral embeddings tend to map points with many connections between them to nearby locations, and multidimensional scaling (MDS)-type methods try to preserve global information, such as graph geodesic distances. Examples of manifold learning include different flavors of MDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref>, locally linear embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref>, stochastic neighbor embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref>, spectral embeddings, such as Laplacian eigenmaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref> and diffusion maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>, and deep models <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>. Instead of embedding the vertices, the graph structure can be processed by decomposing it into small subgraphs called motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref> or graphlets <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>. Finally, most recent approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref> tried to apply the successful word-embedding model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref> to graphs.</p><p>In some cases, the data are presented as a manifold or graph at the outset, and the first step of constructing the affinity structure described previously is unnecessary. For instance, in computer graphics and vision applications, one can analyze 3-D shapes represented as meshes by constructing local geometric descriptors capturing, e.g., curvature-like properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref>. In social network analysis applications the topological structure of the social graph representing the social relations between people carries important insights allowing, e.g., to classify the vertices and detect communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[40]</ref>. In naturallanguage processing, words in a corpus can be represented by the co-occurrence graph, where two words are connected if they often appear near each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data on a domain</head><p>Our second class of problems deals with analyzing functions defined on a given non-Euclidean domain. We can further break down such problems into two subclasses: problems where the domain is fixed and those where multiple domains are given. For example, assume that we are given the geographic coordinates of the users of a social network, represented as a time-dependent signal on the vertices of the social graph. An important application in location-based social networks is to predict the position of the user given his or her past behavior as well as that of his or her friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref>. In this problem, the domain (social graph) is assumed to be fixed; methods of signal processing on graphs, which have previously been reviewed in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref>, can be applied to this setting, in particular, to define an operation similar to convolution in the spectral domain. This, in turn, allows generalizing CNN models to graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45]</ref>. In computer graphics and vision applications, finding similarity and correspondence between shapes are examples of the second subclass of problems: each shape is modeled as a manifold, and one has to work with multiple such domains. In this setting, a generalization of convolution in the spatial domain using local charting <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref> appears to be more appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brief history</head><p>The main focus of this review is on this second class of problems, namely, learning functions on non-Euclidean structured domains, and, in particular, attempts to generalize the popular CNNs to such settings. The first attempts to generalize neural networks to graphs we are aware of are due to Gori et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[49]</ref>, who proposed a scheme combining recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and random walk models. This approach went almost unnoticed, reemerging in a modern form in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[50]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref> due to the renewed recent interest in deep learning. The first formulation of CNNs on graphs is due to Bruna et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref>, who used the definition of convolutions in the spectral domain. Their article, while being of conceptual importance, came with significant computational drawbacks that fell short of a truly useful method. These drawbacks were subsequently addressed in the follow-up works of Henaff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref> and Defferrard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45]</ref>. In the latter article, graph CNNs (GCNNs) allowed achieving some state-of-the-art results.</p><p>In a parallel effort in the computer vision and graphics community, Masci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref> showed the first CNN model on meshed surfaces, resorting to a spatial definition of the convolution operation based on local intrinsic patches. Among other applications, such models were shown to achieve state-of-theart performance in finding correspondence between deformable 3-D shapes. Follow-up works proposed different construction of intrinsic patches on point clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53]</ref> and general graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref>.</p><p>The interest in deep learning on graphs or manifolds has exploded in the past year, resulting in numerous attempts to apply these methods to a broad spectrum of problems ranging from biochemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref> to recommender systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref>. Because such applications originate in different fields that usually do not cross-fertilize, publications in this domain tend to use different terminology and notation, making it difficult for a newcomer to grasp the foundations and current state-of-the-art methods. We believe that our article comes at the right time, attempting to systemize and bring some order into the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Signal processing, differential geometry, and graph theory</head><p>Geometric deep-learning frameworks dealt with in this paper are based on notions in differential geometry and graph theory. Unfortunately, these topics are insufficiently known in the signal processing community, and to our knowledge, there is no introductory-level reference treating these so different structures in a common way.

One way is to resort to the analogy of the convolution theorem, defining the convolution in the spectral domain. An alternative is to think of the convolution as a template matching in the spatial domain. Such a distinction is, however, far from being clear-cut: as we will see, some approaches draw their formulation from the spectral domain, essentially boiling down to applying filters in the spatial domain. It is also possible to combine these two approaches, resorting to spatio-frequency analysis techniques, such as wavelets or the windowed Fourier transform. We have provided sidebars to illustrate important concepts, and  </p></div>

Alternatively, one can integrate the convolution and downsampling in a single linear operator (convolution with stride).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The geometry of manifolds and graphs</head><p>Our main goal is to generalize CNN-type constructions to non-Euclidean domains. In this article, by non-Euclidean domains, we refer to two prototypical structures: manifolds and graphs. While arising in very different fields of mathematics (differential geometry and graph theory, respectively), in our context, these structures share several common characteristics that we will try to emphasize throughout our review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manifolds</head><p>Roughly, a manifold is a space that is locally Euclidean. One of the simplest examples is a spherical surface modeling our planet: around a point, it seems to be planar, which has led generations of people to believe in the flatness of the Earth. Formally speaking, a (differentiable) d-dimensional manifold X is a topological space where each point x has a neighborhood that is topologically equivalent (homeomorphic) to a d-dimensional Euclidean space, called the tangent space and denoted by T X</p><p>x [see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(a)</ref>]. The collection of tangent spaces at all points (more formally, their disjoint union) is referred to as the tangent bundle and denoted by . TX On each tangent space, we define an inner product</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">,• : , T T • R X X T x x X x " # G H</formula><p>which is additionally assumed to depend smoothly on the position x. This inner product is It is important to note that the definition of a Riemannian manifold is completely abstract and does not require a geometric realization in any space. However, a Riemannian manifold can be realized as a subset of a Euclidean space (in which case it is said to be embedded in that space) by using the structure of the Euclidean space to induce a Riemannian metric. The celebrated Nash embedding theorem guarantees that any sufficiently smooth Riemannian manifold can be realized in a Euclidean space of sufficiently high dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[67]</ref>. An embedding is not necessarily unique; two different realizations of a Riemannian metric are called isometries.</p><p>Two-dimensional (2-D) manifolds (surfaces) embedded into R 3 are used in computer graphics and vision to describe boundary surfaces of 3-D objects, colloquially referred to as 3-D shapes. This term is somewhat misleading because 3-D here refers to the dimensionality of the embedding space rather than that of the manifold. Thinking of such a shape as made of infinitely thin material, inelastic deformations that do not stretch or tear it are isometric. Isometries do not affect the metric structure of the manifold, and consequently, they preserve any quantities that can be expressed in terms of the Riemannian metric (called intrinsic). Conversely, properties pertaining to the specific realization of the manifold in the Euclidean space are called extrinsic. As an intuitive illustration of this difference, imagine an insect that lives on a 2-D surface [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(b)</ref>]. The surface can be placed in the Euclidean space in any way, but as long as it is transformed isometrically, the insect would not notice any difference. The insect in fact does not even know of the existence of the embedding space, as its only world is 2-D. This is an intrinsic viewpoint. A human observer, on the other hand, sees a surface in 3-D space-this is an extrinsic point of view.</p></div>

In computer graphics applications, reconstructing a correct discretization of a manifold from a point cloud is a difficult problem of its own, referred to as meshing (see "Laplacian on Discrete Manifolds"). In manifold-learning problems, the manifold is typically approximated as a graph capturing the local affinity structure. We stress that the term manifold as used in the context of generic data science is not geometrically rigorous and can have less structure than a classical smooth manifold we have defined beforehand. For example, a set of points that looks locally Euclidean in practice may have self-intersections, infinite curvature, different dimensions depending on the scale and location at which one looks, extreme variations in density, and noise with confounding structure.</p></div>

It follows that strided convolutions can be generalized using the spectral construction by keeping only the low-frequency components of the spectrum. This property also allows us to interpret (via interpolation) the local filters at deeper layers in the spatial construction to be low frequency. However, because in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(27)</ref> the nonlinearity is applied in the spatial domain, in practice one has to recompute the graph Laplacian eigenvectors at each resolution and apply them directly after each pooling step.</p><p>The spectral construction (27) assigns a DoF for each eigenvector of the graph Laplacian. In most graphs, individual high-frequency eigenvectors become highly unstable. However, similarly as the wavelet construction in Euclidean domains, by appropriately grouping high-frequency eigenvectors in each octave, one can recover meaningful and stable information. As shown next, this principle also entails better learning complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spectral CNN with smooth spectral multipliers</head><p>To reduce the risk of overfitting, it is important to adapt the learning complexity to reduce the number of free parameters of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref>. On Euclidean domains, this is achieved by learning convolutional kernels with small spatial support, which enables the model to learn a number of parameters independent of the input size. To achieve a similar learning complexity in the spectral domain, it is thus necessary to restrict the class of spectral multipliers to those corresponding to localized filters.</p><p>For that purpose, we have to express spatial localization of filters in the frequency domain. In the Euclidean case, smoothness in the frequency domain corresponds to spatial decay, because</p><formula xml:id="formula_86">| | | ( ) | ( ) , x f x dx f d k k k 2 2 2 2 2 ~~= 3 3 3 3 - + - + t # #<label>(29)</label></formula><p>by virtue of the Parseval identity. This suggests that, to learn a layer in which features will be not only shared across locations but also well localized in the spatial domain, one can learn spectral multipliers that are smooth. Smoothness can be prescribed by learning only a subsampled set of spectral multipliers and using an interpolation kernel to obtain the rest, such as cubic splines. However, the notion of smoothness also requires some geometry in the spectral domain. In the Euclidean setting, such a geometry naturally arises from the notion of frequency, e.g., in the plane, the similarity between two Fourier atoms e x i~&lt; and e x i~&lt; l can be quantified by the distance ~-l , where x denotes the 2-D planar coordinates, and ~ is the 2-D frequency vector. On graphs, such a relation can be defined by means of a dual graph with weights wij u encoding the similarity between two eigenvectors i z and j z . A particularly simple choice consists in choosing a 1-D arrangement, obtained by ordering the eigenvectors according to their eigenvalues. [In the mentioned 2-D example, this would correspond to ordering the Fourier basis function according to the sum of the corresponding frequencies . </p></div>

However, for many applications, it is not necessary for information to completely traverse the graph. Furthermore, note that the graphs at each layer of the network need not be the same. Thus, we can replace the original neighborhood structure with one's favorite multiscale coarsening of the input graph and operate on that to obtain the same flow of information as with the convolutional nets above (or rather more like a locally connected network <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[81]</ref>). This also allows producing a single output for the whole graph (for translation-invariant tasks), rather than a per-vertex output, by connecting each vertex to a special output node. Alternatively, one can allow h to use not only Wf and f D at each node but also W f s for several diffusion scales s 1 &gt; (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45]</ref>), giving the GNN the ability to learn algorithms like the power method and more directly accessing spectral properties of the graph.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Charting-based methods</head><p>We now consider the second subclass of non-Euclidean learning problems, where we are given multiple domains. A prototypical application the reader should have in mind throughout this section is the problem of finding correspondence between shapes, modeled as manifolds (see "Three-Dimensional Shape Correspondence Application"). As we have seen, defining convolution in the spectral domain has an inherent drawback of the inability to adapt the model across different domains. We will therefore need to resort to an generalization of the convolution in the spatial domain that does not suffer from this drawback.</p><p>Finding intrinsic correspondence between deformable shapes is a classical tough problem that underlies a broad range of vision and graphics applications, including texture mapping, animation, editing, and scene understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[107]</ref>.

Correspondence is an example of structured output, where the output of the network at one point depends on the output in other points (in the simplest setting, correspondence should be smooth, i.e., the output at nearby points should be similar) Litany et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[109]</ref> proposed intrinsic structured prediction of shape correspondence by integrating a layer computing functional correspondence <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[106]</ref> into the deep neural network.</p><p>Three-Dimensional Shape Correspondence Application</p><formula xml:id="formula_104">x i U Θ y i X Y (a) (b)</formula><p>S7.

It is, however, possible to pool pointwise features produced by a network by aggregating all the local information into a single vector. One possibility for such a pooling is computing the statistics of the pointwise features, e.g., the mean or covariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref>. Note that after such a pooling, all of the spatial information is lost.</p><p>On a Euclidean domain, due to shift invariance the convolution can be thought of as passing a template at each point of the domain and recording the correlation of the template with the function at that point. Thinking of image filtering, this amounts to extracting a (typically square) patch of pixels, multiplying it elementwise with a template and summing up the results, then moving to the next position in a sliding window manner. Shift invariance implies that the very operation of extracting the patch at each position is always the same.</p><p>One of the major problems in applying the same paradigm to non-Euclidean domains is the lack of shift invariance, implying that the patch operator extracting a local patch would be position dependent. Furthermore, the typical lack of meaningful global parameterization for a graph or manifold forces to represent the patch in some local intrinsic system of coordinates. Such a mapping can be obtained by defining a set of weighting functions ( , ), , ( , )</p><formula xml:id="formula_105">x x v v J 1 $ $ f</formula><p>localized to positions near x (see examples in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">3</ref>).

For instance, the Fiedler vector (the eigenvector associated with the smallest nontrivial eigenvalue of the Laplacian) carries information on the graph partition with minimal cut <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[73]</ref>, and the popular PageRank algorithm approximates page ranks with the principal eigenvector of a modified Laplacian operator. In some contexts, one may want develop data-driven versions of such algorithms that can adapt to model mismatch and perhaps provide a faster alternative to diagonalization methods. By unrolling power iterations, one obtains a GNN architecture whose parameters can be learned with backpropagation from labeled examples, similarly to the learned sparse coding paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[91]</ref>. We are currently exploring this connection by constructing multiscale versions of GNNs.</p></div>

Mathematically, a recommendation method can be posed as a matrix completion problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[92]</ref>, where columns and rows represent users and items, respectively, and matrix values represent a score determining whether a user would like an item or not. Given a small subset of known elements of the matrix, the goal is to fill in the rest. A famous example is the Netflix challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[93]</ref> offered in 2009 and carrying a US$1 million prize for the algorithm that can best predict user ratings for movies based on previous ratings. The size of the Netflix matrix is 480,000 movies × 18,000 users (8.5 billion elements), with only 0.011% known entries. Several recent works proposed to incorporate geometric structure into matrix completion problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[94]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[97]</ref> in the form of column and row graphs representing similarity of users and items, respectively (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4</ref>). Such a geometric matrix completion setting makes meaningful, e.g., the notion of smoothness of the matrix values and was shown beneficial for the performance of recommender systems.</p><p>In a recent work, Monti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref> proposed addressing the geometric matrix completion problem by means of a learnable model combining a multigraph CNN (MGCNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). Multigraph convolution can be thought of as a generalization of the standard bidimensional image convolution, where the domains of the rows and the columns are now different (in our case, user and item graphs). The features extracted from the score matrix by means of the MGCNN are then passed to an RNN, which produces a sequence of incremental updates of the score values. Overall, the model can be considered as a learnable diffusion of the scores, with the main advantage compared to traditional approach being a fixed number of variables independent of the matrix size. The MGCNN achieved Recommending movies on Netflix, friends on Facebook, or products on Amazon are a few examples of recommender systems that have recently become ubiquitous in a broad range of applications. Such applications may benefit from geometric deep learning methods.</p><p>state-of-the-art results on several classical matrix completion challenges and, on a more conceptual level, could be a very interesting practical application of geometric deep learning to a classical signal processing problem of matrix completion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer vision and graphics</head><p>The computer-vision community has recently shown an increasing interest in working with 3-D geometric data, mainly due to the emergence of affordable range-sensing technology, such as Microsoft Kinect or Intel RealSense. Many machine-learning techniques successfully working on images were tried as is on 3-D geometric data, represented for this purpose in some way digestible by standard frameworks, e.g., as range images <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[98]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[99]</ref> or rasterized volumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[100]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[101]</ref>. The main drawback of such approaches is their treatment of geometric data as Euclidean structures. First, for complex 3-D objects, Euclidean representations, such as depth images or voxels, may lose significant parts of the object or its fine details or even break its topological structure. Second, Euclidean representations are not intrinsic and vary when changing pose or deforming the object. Achieving invariance to shape deformations, a common requirement in many vision applications, demands very complex models and huge training sets due to the large number of DoF involved in describing nonrigid deformations [see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">5(a)</ref>].</p><p>In the domain of computer graphics, on the other hand, working intrinsically with geometric shapes is a standard practice. In this field, 3-D shapes are typically modeled as Riemannian manifolds and are discretized as meshes. Numerous studies (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[102]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[106]</ref>) have been devoted to designing local and global features, e.g., for establishing similarity or correspondence between deformable shapes with guaranteed invariance to isometries.</p><p>However, different applications in computer vision and graphics may require completely different features. For instance, to establish feature-based correspondence between a collection of human shapes, one would desire the descriptors of corresponding anatomical parts (e.g., noses, mouths) to be as similar as possible across the collection (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">6(a)</ref>). In other words, such descriptors should be invariant to the collection variability. Conversely, for shape classification, one would like descriptors that emphasize the subject-specific characteristics and, e.g., distinguish between two different nose shapes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">6b</ref>). Deciding a priori which structures should be used and which should be ignored is often hard or sometimes even impossible. Moreover, axiomatic modeling of geometric noise, such as 3-D scanning artifacts, turns out to be extremely hard.</p><p>By resorting to intrinsic deep neural networks on manifolds, the invariance to isometric deformations is automatically built into the model, thus vastly reducing the number of DoF required to describe the invariance class. Roughly speaking, the intrinsic deep model will try to learn residual deformations that deviate from the isometric model. Geometric deep learning can be applied to several problems in 3-D shape analysis, which can be divided into two classes. First are problems like local descriptor learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53]</ref> or correspondence learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref> (see the example in "Three-Dimensional   The computer-vision community has recently shown an increasing interest in working with 3-D geometric data.</p><p>Shape Correspondence Application"), in which the output of the network is pointwise. The inputs to the network are some pointwise features, e.g., color texture or simple geometric features, such as normals. Using a CNN architecture with multiple intrinsic con volutional layers, it is possible to produce nonlocal features that capture the context around each point. The second type of problems, such as shape recognition, require the network to produce a global shape descriptor, aggregating all the local information into a single vector using, e.g., the covariance pooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Particle physics and chemistry</head><p>Many areas of experimental science are interested in studying systems of discrete particles defined over a low-dimensional phase space. For instance, the chemical properties of a molecule are determined by the relative positions of its atoms, and the classification of events in particle accelerators depends upon position, momentum, and spin of all the particles involved in the collision. The behavior of an N-particle system is ultimately derived from solutions of the Schrödinger equation, but its exact solution involves diagonalizing a linear system of exponential size. In this context, an important question is whether one can approximate the dynamics with a tractable model that incorporates by construction the geometric stability postulated by the Schrödinger equation and at the same time has enough flexibility to adapt to data-driven scenarios and capture complex interactions.</p><p>An instance l of an N l -particle system can be expressed as z a a = expressed through a similarity kernel capturing the appropriate priors. GNNs are currently being applied to perform event classification, energy regression, and anomaly detection in high-energy physics experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider, and neutrino detection in the IceCube Observatory. Recently, models based on GNNs have been applied to predict the dynamics of N-body systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[111]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[112]</ref>, showing excellent prediction performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecule design</head><p>A key problem in material and drug design is predicting the physical, chemical, or biological properties (such as solubility of toxicity) of a novel molecule from its structure. State-ofthe-art methods rely on hand-crafted molecule descriptors, such as circular fingerprints <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[113]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[115]</ref>. A recent work from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref> proposed modeling molecules as graphs (where vertices represent atoms and edges represent chemical bonds) and employing GCNNs to learn the desired molecule properties. The authors' approach has significantly outperformed handcrafted features. This work opens a new avenue in molecule design that might revolutionize the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical imaging</head><p>An application area where signals are naturally collected on non-Euclidean domains and where the methodologies we reviewed could be very useful is brain imaging. A recent trend in neuroscience is to associate functional magnetic resonance imaging traces with a precomputed connectivity rather than inferring it from the traces themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[116]</ref>. In this case, the challenge consists in processing and analyzing an array of signals collected over a complex topology, which results in subtle dependencies. For example, in a recent work from Imperial College London <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[117]</ref>, GCNNs were used to detect disruptions of the brain functional networks associated with autism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open problems and future directions</head><p>The recent emergence of geometric deep-learning methods in various communities and application domains, which we tried to overview in this article, allows us to proclaim, perhaps with some caution, that we might be witnessing a new field being born.

Yet, such models assume some prior knowledge (e.g., isometric shape deformation model) and often fail to correctly capture the full complexity and richness of the data. In computer vision, departing from handcrafted features toward generic models learnable from the data in a taskspecific manner has brought a breakthrough in performance and led to an overwhelming trend in the community to favor deep-learning methods. Such a shift has not occurred yet in the fields dealing with geometric data due to the lack of adequate methods, but there are the first indications of a coming paradigm shift.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generalization</head><p>Generalizing deep-learning models to geometric data requires not only finding non-Euclidean counterparts of basic building blocks (such as convolutional and pooling layers) but also generalization across different domains. Generalization capability is a key requirement in many applications, including computer graphics, where a model is learned on a training set of non-Euclidean domains (3-D shapes) and then applied to previously unseen ones. Spectral formulation of convolution allows designing CNNs on a graph, but the model learned this way on one graph cannot be straightforwardly applied to another one, because the spectral representation of convolution is domain dependent. A possible remedy to the generalization problem of spectral methods is the recent architecture proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[118]</ref>, applying the idea of spatial transformer networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[119]</ref> in the spectral domain. This approach is reminiscent of the construction of compatible orthogonal bases by means of joint Laplacian diagonalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[75]</ref>, which can be interpreted as an alignment of two Laplacian eigenbases in a k-dimensional space.</p><p>The spatial methods, on the other hand, allow generalization across different domains, but the construction of lowdimensional local spatial coordinates on graphs turns out to be rather challenging. In particular, the construction of anisotropic diffusion on general graphs is an interesting research direction. The spectrum-free approaches also allow generalization across graphs, at least in terms of their functional form. However, if multiple layers of (38) are used with no nonlinearity or learned parameters i , simulating a high power of the diffusion, the model may behave differently on different kinds of graphs. Understanding under what circumstances and to what extent these methods generalize across graphs is currently being studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time-varying domains</head><p>An interesting extension of geometric deep-learning problems discussed in this review is coping with signals defined over a dynamically changing structure. In this case, we cannot assume a fixed domain and must track how these changes affect signals. This could prove useful to tackle applications like abnormal activity detection in social or financial networks. In the domain of computer graphics and vision, potential applications deal with dynamic shapes (e.g., 3-D video captured by a range sensor).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directed graphs</head><p>Dealing with directed graphs is also a challenging topic, as such graphs typically have nonsymmetric Laplacian matrices that do not have orthogonal eigendecomposition allowing easily interpretable spectral-domain constructions. Citation networks, which are directed graphs, are often treated as undirected graphs (including in our example in "Three-Dimensional Shape Correspondence Application") considering citations between two articles without distinguishing which article cites which. This obviously may lose important information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synthesis problems</head><p>Our main focus in this review was primarily on analysis problems on non-Euclidean domains. Not less important is the question of data synthesis. There have been several recent attempts to try to learn a generative model allowing to synthesize new images <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[120]</ref> and speech waveforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[121]</ref>. Extending such methods to the geometric setting seems a promising direction, though the key difficulty is the need to reconstruct the geometric structure (e.g., an embedding of a 2-D manifold in the 3-D Euclidean space modeling a deformable shape) from some intrinsic representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[122]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computation</head><p>The final consideration is a computational one. All existing deep-learning software frameworks are primarily optimized for Euclidean data. One of the main reasons for the computational efficiency of deep-learning architectures (and one of the factors that contributed to their renaissance) is the assumption of regularly structured data on a 1-D or 2-D grid, allowing to take advantage of modern GPU hardware. Geometric data, on the other hand, in most cases do not have a grid structure, requiring different ways to achieve efficient computations. It seems that computational paradigms developed for large-scale graph processing are more adequate frameworks for such applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Authorized licensed use limited to: Renmin University.
