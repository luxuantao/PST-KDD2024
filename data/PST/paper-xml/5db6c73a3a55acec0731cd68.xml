<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) refers to the task of detecting the span and the semantic category of entities from a chunk of text. The task can be further divided into two sub-categories, nested NER and flat NER, depending on whether entities are nested or not. Nested NER refers to a phenomenon that the spans of entities (mentions) are nested, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Entity overlapping is a fairly common phenomenon in natural languages.</p><p>The task of flat NER is commonly formalized as a sequence labeling task: a sequence labeling model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chiu and Nichols, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ma and Hovy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Devlin et al., 2018)</ref> is trained to assign a single tagging class to each unit within a sequence of tokens. This formulation is unfortunately incapable of handling overlapping entities in nested NER <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Huang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chiu and Nichols, 2015)</ref>, where multiple categories need to be assigned to a single token if the token participates in multiple entities. Many attempts have been made to reconcile sequence labeling models with nested NER <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alex et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Byrne, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Finkel and Manning, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lu and Roth, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Katiyar and Cardie, 2018)</ref>, mostly based on the pipelined systems. However, pipelined systems suffer from the disadvantages of error propagation, long running time and the intensiveness in developing hand-crafted features, etc.</p><p>Inspired by the current trend of formalizing NLP problems as question answering tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Levy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">McCann et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al., 2019)</ref>, we propose a new framework that is capable of handling both flat and nested NER. Instead of treating the task of NER as a sequence labeling problem, we propose to formulate it as a SQuADstyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rajpurkar et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rajpurkar et al., , 2018) )</ref> machine reading comprehension (MRC) task. Each entity type is characterized by a natural language query, and entities are extracted by answering these queries given the contexts. For example, the task of assigning the PER(PERSON) label to " <ref type="bibr">[Washington]</ref> was born into slavery on the farm of James Burroughs" is formalized as answering the question "which person is mentioned in the text?". This strategy naturally tackles the entity overlapping issue in nested NER: the extraction of two entities with different categories that overlap requires answering two independent questions.</p><p>The MRC formulation also comes with another key advantage over the sequence labeling formulation. For the latter, golden NER categories are merely class indexes and lack for semantic prior information for entity categories. For example, the ORG(ORGANIZATION) class is treated as a onehot vector in sequence labeling training. This lack of clarity on what to extract leads to inferior performances. On the contrary, for the MRC formulation, the query encodes significant prior information about the entity category to extract. For example, the query "find an organization such as company, agency and institution in the context" encourages the model to link the word "organization" in the query to location entities in the context. Additionally, by encoding comprehensive descriptions (e.g., "company, agency and institution") of tagging categories (e.g., ORG), the model has the potential to disambiguate similar tagging classes.</p><p>We conduct experiments on both nested and flat NER datasets to show the generality of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. We are able to achieve a vast amount of performance boost over current SOTA models on nested NER datasets, i.e., +1.28, +2.55, +5.44, +6.37, respectively on ACE04, ACE05, GENIA and KBP17, as well as flat NER datasets, i.e., +0.24, +1.95, +0.21, +1.49 respectively on English CoNLL 2003, English OntoNotes 5.0, Chinese MSRA, Chinese OntoNotes 4.0. We wish that our work would inspire the introduction of new paradigms for the entity recognition task.</p></div>

The task can be formalized as two multi-class classification tasks, i.e., predicting the starting and ending positions of the answer spans. Over the past one or two years, there has been a trend of transforming NLP tasks to MRC question answering. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Levy et al. (2017)</ref> transformed the task of relation extraction to a QA task: each relation type R(x, y) can be parameterized as a question q(x) whose answer is y. For example, the relation EDUCATED-AT can be mapped to "Where did x study?". Given a question q(x), if a non-null answer y can be extracted from a sentence, it means the relation label for the current sentence is R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">McCann et al.

For example, the task of summarization can be formalized as answering the question "What is the summary?". Our work is significantly inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al. (2019)</ref>, which formalized the task of entity-relation extraction as a multi-turn question answering task. Different from this work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al.

(2019)</ref> utilized a template-based procedure for constructing queries to extract semantic relations between entities and their queries lack diversity. In this paper, more factual knowledge such as synonyms and examples are incorporated into queries, and we present an in-depth analysis of the impact of strategies of building queries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Task Formalization</head><p>Given an input sequence X = {x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n }, where n denotes the length of the sequence, we need to find every entity in X, and then assign a label y ∈ Y to it, where Y is a predefined list of all possible tag types (e.g., PER, LOC, etc).</p><p>Dataset Construction Firstly we need to transform the tagging-style annotated NER dataset to a set of (QUESTION, ANSWER, CONTEXT) triples. For each tag type y ∈ Y , it is associated with a natural language question q y = {q 1 , q 2 , ..., q m }, where m denotes the length of the generated query. An annotated entity x start,end = {x start , x start+1 , • • • , x end-1 , x end } is a substring of X satisfying start ≤ end. Each entity is associated with a golden label y ∈ Y . By generating a natural language question q y based on the label y, we can obtain the triple (q y , x start,end , X), which is exactly the (QUESTION, ANSWER, CONTEXT) triple that we need. Note that we use the subscript " start,end " to denote the continuous tokens from index 'start' to 'end' in a sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Query Generation</head><p>The question generation procedure is important since queries encode prior knowledge about labels and have a significant influence on the final results. Different ways have been proposed for question generation, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al. (2019)</ref> utilized a template-based procedure for constructing queries to extract semantic relations between entities. In this paper, we take annotation guideline notes as references to construct queries. Annotation guideline notes are the guidelines provided to the annotators of the dataset by the dataset builder. They are descriptions of tag categories, which are described as generic and precise as possible so that  <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Model Backbone</head><p>Given the question q y , we need to extract the text span x start,end which is with type y from X under the MRC framework. We use BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Devlin et al., 2018)</ref> as the backbone. To be in line with BERT, the question q y and the passage X are concatenated, forming the combined string</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{[CLS], q 1 , q 2 , ..., q m , [SEP], x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n },</formula><p>where [CLS] and [SEP] are special tokens. Then BERT receives the combined string and outputs a context representation matrix E ∈ R n×d , where d is the vector dimension of the last layer of BERT and we simply drop the query representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Span Selection</head><p>There are two strategies for span selection in MRC: the first strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Seo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016)</ref> is to have two n-class classifiers separately predict the start index and the end index, where n denotes the length of the context. Since the softmax function is put over all tokens in the context, this strategy has the disadvantage of only being able to output a single span given a query; the other strategy is to have two binary classifiers, one to predict whether each token is the start index or not, the other to predict whether each token is the end index or not. This strategy allows for outputting multiple start indexes and multiple end indexes for a given context and a specific query, and thus has the potentials to extract all related entities according to q y . We adopt the second strategy and describe the details below.</p><p>Start Index Prediction Given the representation matrix E output from BERT, the model first predicts the probability of each token being a start index as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P start = softmax each row (E • T start ) ∈ R n×2 (1)</formula><p>T start ∈ R d×2 is the weights to learn. Each row of P start presents the probability distribution of each index being the start position of an entity given the query.</p><p>End Index Prediction The end index prediction procedure is exactly the same, except that we have another matrix T end to obtain probability matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P end ∈ R n×2 .</formula><p>Start-End Matching In the context X, there could be multiple entities of the same category. This means that multiple start indexes could be predicted from the start-index prediction model and multiple end indexes predicted from the endindex prediction model. The heuristic of matching the start index with its nearest end index does not work here since entities could overlap. We thus further need a method to match a predicted start index with its corresponding end index. Specifically, by applying argmax to each row of P start and P end , we will get the predicted indexes that might be the starting or ending positions, i.e., Îstart and Îend :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Îstart = {i | argmax(P (i) start ) = 1, i = 1, • • • , n} Îend = {j | argmax(P (j) end ) = 1, j = 1, • • • , n}</formula><p>(2) where the superscript (i) denotes the i-th row of a matrix. Given any start index i start ∈ Îstart and end index i end ∈ Îend , a binary classification model is trained to predict the probability that they should be matched, given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P istart,j end = sigmoid(m • concat(E istart , E j end )) (3)</formula><p>where m ∈ R 1×2d is the weights to learn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Train and Test</head><p>At training time, X is paired with two label sequences Y start and Y end of length n representing the ground-truth label of each token x i being the start index or end index of any entity. We therefore have the following two losses for start and end index predictions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L start = CE(P start , Y start ) L end = CE(P end , Y end )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Let Y start, end denote the golden labels for whether each start index should be matched with each end index.

The reason why greater performance boost is observed for OntoNotes is that OntoNotes contains more types of entities than CoNLL03 (18 vs 4), and some entity categories face the severe data sparsity problem. Since the query encodes significant prior knowledge for the entity type to extract, the MRC formulation is more immune to the tag sparsity issue, leading to more improvements on OntoNotes. The proposed method also achieves new state-of-the-art results on Chinese datasets. For Chinese MSRA, the proposed method outperforms the fine-tuned BERT tagging model by +0.95% in terms of F1. We also improve the F1 from 79.16% to 82.11% on Chinese OntoNotes4.0.</p><p>5 Ablation studies</p></div>

In this subsection, we explore different ways to construct queries and their influence, including:</p><p>• Position index of labels: a query is constructed using the index of a tag to , i.e., "one", "two", "three". • Keyword: a query is the keyword describing the tag, e.g., the question query for tag ORG is "organization". • Rule-based template filling: generates questions using templates. The query for tag ORG is "which organization is mentioned in the text". • Wikipedia: a query is constructed using its wikipedia definition. The query for tag ORG is "an organization is an entity comprising multiple people, such as an institution or an association." • Synonyms: are words or phrases that mean exactly or nearly the same as the original keyword extracted using the Oxford Dictionary. The query for tag ORG is "association". • Keyword+Synonyms: the concatenation of a keyword and its synonym. • Annotation guideline notes: is the method we use in this paper. The query for tag ORG is "find organizations including companies, agencies and institutions". Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">5</ref> shows the experimental results on En- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Zero-shot Evaluation on Unseen Labels</head><p>It would be interesting to test how well a model trained on one dataset is transferable to another, which is referred to as the zero-shot learning ability. We trained models on CoNLL 2003 and test them on OntoNotes5.0. OntoNotes5.0 contains 18 entity types, 3 shared with CoNLL03, and 15 unseen in CoNLL03. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> presents the results. As can been seen, BERT-tagger does not have zero-shot learning ability, only obtaining an accuracy of 31.87%. This is in line with our expectation since it cannot predict labels unseen from the training set. The question-answering formal- ization in MRC framework, which predicts the answer to the given query, comes with more generalization capability and achieves acceptable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Size of Training Data</head><p>Since the natural language query encodes significant prior knowledge, we expect that the proposed framework works better with less training data. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> verifies this point: on the Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 training set, the query-based BERT-MRC approach achieves comparable performance to BERT-tagger even with half amount of training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we reformalize the NER task as a MRC question answering task. This formalization comes with two key advantages: (1) being capa-ble of addressing overlapping or nested entities;</p><p>(2) the query encodes significant prior knowledge about the entity category to extract. The proposed method obtains SOTA results on both nested and flat NER datasets, which indicates its effectiveness. In the future, we would like to explore variants of the model architecture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: An example of attention matrices between the query and the input sentence.</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="8,118.77,62.81,360.00,196.46" type="bitmap" /></figure>
