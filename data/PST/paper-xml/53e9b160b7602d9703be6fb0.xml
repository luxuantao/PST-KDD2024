<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Flow variation over time is an important feature in network flow problems arising in various applications such as road or air traffic control, production systems, communication networks (e.g., the Internet), and financial flows. The common characteristic are 'dynamic' networks with capacities and transit times on the arcs. In contrast to static flow problems, flow values on arcs may change with time in these networks. Moreover, flow does not progress instantaneously but can only travel at a certain pace through the network which is determined by transit times of arcs.</p><p>Another crucial phenomenon in many of those applications is the variation of time taken to traverse an arc with the current (and maybe also past) flow situation on this arc. Since it is already a highly nontrivial problem to map these two aspects into an appropriate and tractable mathematical network flow model, there are hardly any algorithmic techniques known which are capable of providing reasonable solutions even for networks of rather modest size. The main aim of this paper is to make a first step in this direction by providing new insights and algorithmic results which will hopefully turn out to have the potential to contribute to practically efficient solution methods.</p><p>Problem definition and notation. We consider a directed network G = (V, E) with node set V and arc set E. There is a source node s ∈ V , a sink t ∈ V , and a positive demand value D. Our aim is to find a quickest flow over time which satisfies demand D within minimal time horizon (or makespan) T while respecting the following restrictions. Each arc e ∈ E has a positive capacity u e which is interpreted as an upper bound on the rate of flow entering e, i.e., a capacity per unit time. Moreover, arc e has an associated positive transit time τ e which determines the amount of time it takes for flow to travel from the tail to the head of that arc. In many real-world applications, a difficult but crucial aspect is that the amount of time needed to traverse an arc of the network increases as the arc becomes more congested. Thus, we consider the case where τ e is not necessarily fixed but may depend on the amount of flow currently sent through arc e.</p><p>In the setting of flows over time, flow conservation constraints require that, for any point θ in time and for any node v ∈ V \ {s}, the total inflow into node v until time θ is an upper bound on the total outflow out of node v until time θ. In particular, the fact that the inflow may exceed the outflow means that flow can be stored in nodes. However, for a flow over time with finite time horizon T we require that, for any node v ∈ V \ {s, t}, the total inflow into node v until time T is equal to the total outflow out of node v until time T . In other words, the network must be empty again at time T , as it was at time 0.</p><p>Modeling flow-dependent transit times. The crucial parameter for modeling temporal dynamics of flows is the presumed dependency of the actual transit time τ e on the current (and maybe also past) flow situation on arc e. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff between the need of modeling this usually highly complex correlation as realistically as possible and the requirement of retaining tractability of the resulting mathematical program.</p><p>Due to the latter condition, many models in the literature rely on relatively simple assumptions. For example, the transit time of an arc is often treated as a function of only the flow rate at time of entry to the arc; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, this assumption is in many cases unrealistic since it does, for example, not preserve the first-in-first-out property encountered in most applications.</p><p>In contrast, a fully realistic model of flow-dependent transit times on arcs must take density, speed, and flow rate evolving along the arc into consideration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Unfortunately, even the solution of mathematical models relying on simplifying assumptions is in general still impracticable, i.e., beyond the means of state-of-the-art computers, for problem instances of realistic size (as those occuring in real-world applications such as road traffic control).</p><p>Existing models and results. In the following we discuss some approaches which can be found in the literature. For a more detailed account and further references we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. The existing approaches can be assigned to four groups: Simulation-based approaches like, for example, traffic simulation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>); models based on fluid dynamics (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>) or variational inequalities (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>); and, finally, mathematical programming-based approaches, which we discuss in more detail below.</p><p>While simulation is a powerful tool to evaluate complex flow scenarios, it misses the optimization potential. On the other hand, fluid models and other models based on differential equations capture very well the dynamical behavior of flows, but currently can not handle large networks. Mathematical programming and, in particular, network flow theory have the potential to overcome this drawback at the cost of a less precise modelling of real flow behavior.</p><p>Merchant and Nemhauser <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> formulate a non-linear and non-convex program where time is being discretized. In their model, the outflow out of an arc in each time period solely depends on the amount of flow on that arc at the beginning of the time period. However, the non-convexity of their model causes analytical and computational problems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, special constraint qualifications are described which are necessary to guarantee optimality of a solution in this model. Carey <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> introduces a slight revision of the model of Merchant and Nemhauser which transforms the non-convex problem into a convex one.</p><p>Carey and Subrahmanian <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduce a time-expanded network<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> with fixed transit times on the arcs. However, for each time period, there are several copies of an arc of the underlying 'static' network corresponding to different transit times. In this setting, flow-dependent transit times can implicitly be modeled by introducing appropriate capacities on the copies of an arc corresponding to different transit times. More precisely, these arc-capacities approximately model inflow -dependent transit times, that is, the situation when the transit time on an arc only depends on the current rate of flow into the arc. As discussed above, this model provides only a rough description of flow-dependent transit times in typical real-world situations.</p><p>While the solution of the model of Carey and Subrahmanian requires general linear programming techniques, Köhler, Langkau, and Skutella <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> present a refined model that can be solved by standard network flow computations. While these algorithmic techniques are typically very efficient, the size of the time-expanded graph itself causes problems when the number of discrete time steps gets large.</p><p>Results for fixed transit times. The latter problem was already addressed by Ford and Fulkerson <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> when they studied the 'maximal dynamic flow problem': Given a directed network with capacities and fixed transit times on the arcs and a fixed time horizon T , send as much flow as possible from the source vertex s to the sink vertex t within time T . This problem can be solved by one max-flow computation on the corresponding time-expanded network. Notice, however, that the size of the time-expanded network is only pseudo-polynomial in the size of the input.</p><p>Nevertheless, Ford and Fulkerson were able to show that the problem can be solved by essentially one min-cost flow computation on the given 'static' network, where transit times of arcs are interpreted as cost coefficients. An optimal solution to this min-cost flow problem can be turned into a flow over time by decomposing it into flows on paths. The optimal flow over time starts to send flow on each path at time zero, and repeats each so long as there is enough time left in the T periods for the flow along the path to arrive at the sink. Such a flow over time is called temporally repeated.</p><p>In particular, this result of Ford and Fulkerson implies that the quickest s-t-flow problem with fixed transit times can be solved in polynomial time. Burkard, Dlaska, and Klinz <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> give a strongly polynomial algorithm for the quickest s-t-flow problem which is based on the parametric search method of Megiddo <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, if costs are added, the resulting minimum cost quickest flow problem is NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>; the same hardness result holds for the case of multiple commodities, even without costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. On the other hand, Hoppe and Tardos <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> show that there is a non-trivial generalization of the result of Ford and Fulkerson to the case of multiple sources and sinks.</p><p>Recently, and prior to this work, Fleischer and Skutella <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> showed that the technique of Ford and Fulkerson can be generalized to yield approximate solutions to the NP-hard quickest flow problem with costs and also to the more general quickest multicommodity flow problem with costs. Their approach is based on the computation of a static length-bounded flow<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> which is then turned into a flow over time, similarly as in Ford and Fulkerson's result. This leads to an approximation algorithm with performance guarantee 2 + ε for the quickest multicommodity flow problem with costs. Moreover, Fleischer and Skutella <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> introduce the concept of so-called condensed time-expanded networks. They are obtained by rounding transit times of arcs and scaling time such that the size of the resulting time-expanded network is polynomially bounded in the input size. As a consequence, one obtains fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for the quickest multicommodity flow problem with costs and for related problems.</p><p>New results and models. Our work is inspired by the results of Ford and Fulkerson <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and Fleischer and Skutella <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> on temporally repeated flows. Although their techniques cannot directly be translated to the more general setting of flow-dependent transit times, we can show that a similar approach yields provably good temporally repeated flows in this setting.</p><p>This result is based on the following fairly general model of flow-dependent transit times. We assume that, at each point in time, the uniform speed on an arc depends only on the amount of flow or load which is currently on that arc. This assumption captures for example the behavior of road traffic when an arc corresponds to a rather short street (notice that longer streets can be replaced by a series of short streets); similar transit time functions are used in standard traffic simulation systems.</p><p>In static, i.e., not time-varying flows, the load of an arc is uniquely determined by its flow rate which is the number of flow units traversing the arc per time unit. Therefore, the transit time of an arc is a function of its flow rate in this case. Throughout the paper we assume that this dependency is given by an increasing and convex function. This assumption is satisfied for many applications, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We propose an algorithm which is similar to the one of Ford and Fulkerson and thus also very efficient. However, since the transit times are no longer fixed, the linear min-cost flow problem considered by Ford and Fulkerson now turns into a convex cost flow problem. Under the assumptions on the transit time functions τ e stated above, the resulting optimal static flow can be turned into a temporally repeated flow which needs at most twice as long as a quickest flow over time.</p><p>Finally, we show that the quickest flow problem under consideration is strongly NP-hard and even cannot be approximated with arbitrary precision in polynomial time, unless P=NP. We give ), where τ 0 e is the free-flow transit time, x e is the flow rate, and u e is the 'practical capacity' of arc e. It follows from the given equation that the practical capacity of an arc is the flow rate at which the transit time is 15% higher than the free-flow transit time. b) Davidson proposed a function describing the transit time based on queuing theory considerations: τ e = τ 0 e (1 + Jx e /(u e -x e )). Again, τ 0 e is the free-flow transit time (i.e., the transit time at zero flow), x e is the flow rate, u e is the capacity of the arc, and J is a parameter of the model. We depict the function for various choices of J. In contrast to the function depicted in a), Davidson's function is obviously asymptotic to the capacity u e of the arc. More details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>reductions from the NP-hard problems Partition and Satisfiability. Notice that the flowover-time problem considered by Ford and Fulkerson is solvable in polynomial time and that the generalized problems considered by Fleischer and Skutella <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> possess fully polynomial-time approximation schemes and are therefore not strongly NP-hard, unless P=NP.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the load-dependent transit time model which our results are based on. Our main result on the existence and efficient computation of provably good temporally repeated flows is presented in Section 3. Section 4 contains results on the complexity of the quickest flow problem under consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">A model for load-dependent transit times</head><p>Our research is motivated by traffic routing problems. Here, the transit time τ e of an arc (street) e is typically given for the case of static flows, that is, flows which do not vary over time. We thus interpret τ e (x e ) as the transit time on arc e for the static flow rate x e , which is the number of flow units (cars etc.) traversing the arc per time unit; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for examples.</p><p>Unfortunately, for a flow varying over time, the latter model is only of limited use. First of all, it is not clear how to define the flow rate on an arc at a specific moment in time; there are several possibilities depending on where exactly it is measured. For example, the inflow rate is measured at the tail and the outflow rate is measured at the head of an arc; moreover, a flow rate can also be determined at any other position on an arc. Secondly, in real-world applications, it is not reasonable to assume that the transit time of an arc depends only on the current flow rate on this arc, no matter where it is measured. For example, even if the number of cars which currently enter a street is small compared to the capacity of the street, the transit time might nevertheless be huge due to traffic congestion caused by a large number of cars which have entered the street earlier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Description of the model</head><p>In the following we assume that we are given a network and for every arc of the network there is a function τ e which describes the dependency of the arc's transit time on the static flow rate. Since we are interested in the general setting where the flow on an arc may vary over time, we have to come up with a model which enables us to at least approximately determine transit times for flows over time. The small example of a congested street discussed above suggests that the transit time on an arc depends on its current load, which is the amount of flow (number of cars) currently on that arc. We thus assume in our model that (i) at each point in time, the entire flow on an arc travels with uniform speed;</p><p>(ii) this speed depends only on the current load of that arc.</p><p>Before we discuss the implications of these assumptions for flows varying over time, we first consider the simpler case of static flows. If we let y e denote the load of arc e and x e its flow rate, it is easy to see that, for a static flow, the following relation holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y e = x e τ e (x e ) .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Observation 2.1. If the function τ e is monotonically increasing and convex (as, e.g., in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), then, in a static flow, the flow rate x e is a strictly increasing and concave function of the load y e of arc e.</p><p>Proof. Since both τ e and the identity are non-negative, monotonically increasing, and convex, it follows from (1) that the load is also a non-negative, strictly increasing, and convex function of the flow rate x e . Thus, the inverse function exists and is strictly increasing and concave.</p><p>It follows from the proof that Observation 2.1 already holds under the weaker assumption that the function x e → x e τ e (x e ) is strictly increasing and convex. In the remainder of the paper we assume that this weaker assumption holds for all arcs e ∈ E.</p><p>Assumption. For all arcs e ∈ E, the function x e → x e τ e (x e ) is non-negative, strictly increasing, and convex.</p><p>Observation 2.1 yields that, for the case of static flows, the transit time τ e can also be interpreted as a function of the load y e ; to avoid ambiguity, it is then denoted by τe (y e ). Notice that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">τ e (x e ) = τe (y e )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>if the flow rate x e and the load y e satisfy equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The function τe can now be used in order to model the setting of flows over time with load-dependent transit times.</p><p>A flow over time on arc e with time horizon T can be described by its flow rate f e : (0, T ] → R + . The considerations and results in the remainder of this paper do not depend on the precise definition of f e but work for all possible types of flow rates (like, e.g., inflow or outflow rate etc.). In the flow model given by assumptions (i) and (ii), the mutual dependency of the flow rate f e : (0, T ] → R + and the load e : (0, T ] → R + is implicitly given as follows: At any point in time θ, the speed of the flow on arc e is proportional to the inverse of the 'current transit time' τe ( e (θ)). This concludes the precise description of our model of load-dependent transit times on one arc.</p><p>An s-t-flow over time with load-dependent transit times is given by flow rate functions (f e ) e∈E satisfying the following constraints: i) 0 f e (θ) u e for all e ∈ E and θ ∈ (0, T ] (capacity constraints);</p><p>ii) for every node v = s and every point in time θ ∈ (0, T ], the total amount of flow that has arrived in v until time θ is an upper bound on the total amount of flow that has left v until time θ (flow conservation constraints);</p><p>iii) equality holds in ii) for θ = T and all v ∈ V \ {s, t}; moreover, e (T ) = 0 for all e ∈ E (i.e., all flow must have arrived at the sink at time T ).</p><p>Notice that it is a non-trivial task to check whether flow conservation constraints ii) are fulfilled for given inflow rate functions (f e ) e∈E ; the outflow rate of an arc is not a simple function of its inflow rate. Flow entering arc e at time ν arrives at the head of e at time inf ξ</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ξ ν 1 τe ( e (θ)) dθ 1 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This follows since, by definition of our flow model, 1/τ e ( e (θ)) is proportional to the speed on arc e at time θ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Basic results and observations</head><p>We are interested in two basic characteristics of flows over time on an arc e. The total transit time is the total amount of time spent by all units of flow on that arc. If we think of cars driving along a street, it is the sum of the individual transit times of all cars. Formally, the total transit time is given by T 0 e (θ) dθ .</p><p>The total amount of flow shipped through arc e is the integral over the flow rate f e (θ), 0 &lt; θ T . This value can also be written in terms of the load e (θ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T 0 f e (θ) dθ = T 0 e (θ) τe ( e (θ)) dθ .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We give an intuitive interpretation of (4): If f e (θ) denotes the inflow rate into arc e at time θ, the left hand side simply counts the number of cars entering the street e over time. In contrast, the right hand side counts, at every point in time, the number of cars currently traveling on e weighted by the inverse of the 'current transit time' on e. In particular, the overall contribution of every car to the right hand side is 1 which yields the claimed equation. Notice, however, that Equation (4) does not hold pointwise (with the integrals removed) since the load e (θ 0 ) at some point in time θ 0 does not only depend on the current flow rate f e (θ 0 ) but also on the whole history f e (θ), 0 &lt; θ θ 0 .</p><p>For an arbitrary flow over time on arc e with time horizon T and flow rate f e (θ), for θ ∈ (0, T ], we define a corresponding static flow with flow rate</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x e := 1 T T 0 f e (θ) dθ<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and load y e := x e τ e (x e ) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. We refer to this static flow as the average rate flow corresponding to the flow over time given by f e (or e ).</p><p>Lemma 2.2. If the function τ e is monotonically increasing and convex, the total transit time of a flow over time with time horizon T , flow rate f e and load e is at least as big as the total transit time of the corresponding static average rate flow over T time units, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T 0 e (θ) dθ T y e .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Proof. The left hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref> .</p><p>We refer to this static flow as the average load flow corresponding to the flow over time given by f e (or e ). Thus, (6) can now be rewritten as ỹe y e . Since the load of a static flow is a monotonically increasing function of its flow rate, it suffices to show that xe x e . Using (4) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>), this inequality can be rewritten as ỹe τe (ỹ e ) 1 T T 0 e (θ) τe ( e (θ))</p><p>dθ .</p><p>It follows from Observation 2.1 that the function ξ → ξ/τ e (ξ) is concave. Thus, inequality ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>) is a result of Jensen's inequality. This concludes the proof.</p><p>In other words, Lemma 2.2 says that, for an arbitrary flow over time on arc e, the corresponding average load flow is stronger than the corresponding average rate flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">An approximation algorithm 3.1 A related static flow problem</head><p>In order to determine a flow over time which satisfies demand D in close to optimal time, we consider the following static maximum flow problem with bounded convex cost. In this problem, the cost of flow x e on arc e is x e τ e (x e ) and the total cost must not exceed D. More formally, the problem can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">max e∈δ -(t) x e - e∈δ + (t)</formula><p>x e s. t.

In this way, we can compute a static flow x of value at least (1 -ε) Opt and cost at most D in polynomial time, where Opt is the value of an optimal static flow. Lemma 3.2.

Moreover, it is well-known that the number of paths in P can be bounded by the number of arcs |E|.</p><p>For the case of fixed transit times, a temporally repeated flow over time with time horizon T can be generated from a path-decomposition of x by starting each path-flow at time zero, and repeatedly sending flow on each of them, as long as there is enough time left in the T periods for the flow along the path to arrive at the sink. In the following we argue that basically the same approach can be used in the setting of load-dependent transit times. Here, however, some care has to be taken in order to avoid undesirable congestion. If all transit times are fixed, it follows from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">8</ref>) that, at any point in time, the total flow rate on arc e in the temporally repeated flow over time is bounded by x e . This is no longer true if transit times on arcs may vary over time. We use the following trick to solve this problem.</p><p>As soon as we have computed the static flow x, we assume that the transit time of every arc e ∈ E in the network is fixed to τ e (x e ). This assumption is justified if we can assure that the rate of flow into arc e is always bounded by x e and thus its load never exceeds x e τ e (x e ). In this case, we can enforce the constant transit time τ e (x e ) by introducing waiting times at the head node v of arc e in order to compensate for a potentially smaller transit time on that arc. Thereby we emulate the fixed transit time τ e (x e ) and, at the same time, make sure that the rate of flow into every arc e ∈ δ + (v) also stays below x e . The same technique is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> in order to round up transit times of arcs.</p><p>Under these assumptions, the amount of flow that can be sent within time horizon T over path P ∈ P of length τ P := e∈P τ e (x e ) with τ P T is x P (T -τ P ). Therefore, the total amount of flow which we can send on paths P within time horizon T is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d(T ) := P ∈P : τ P T x P (T -τ P ) .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>From this expression one can easily determine the minimal T that is needed to satisfy demand D: Simply order the paths in the set P by non-decreasing lengths τ P 1 τ P 2 • • • τ P k and observe that the function d is affine linear and increasing within every interval [τ P i , τ P i+1 ], 1 i &lt; k. Theorem 3.3. If there is a flow over time with load-dependent transit times which sends D units of flow from s to t within time T , then there exists a temporally repeated flow satisfying demand D within time horizon at most 2T . Moreover, for every ε &gt; 0, one can compute a temporally repeated flow in polynomial time which satisfies demand D within time horizon at most (2 + ε)T . Proof. By Lemma 3.2, we can compute a static flow x of value at least (1 -ε/3)D/T and cost at most D in polynomial time, for any ε &gt; 0 (in the following we assume that ε 1). Moreover, by Lemma 3.1, there even exists such a flow for ε = 0. We decompose x into path-flows as discussed above and get</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">d (2 + ε) T (9) = P ∈P : τ P (2+ε) T x P (2 + ε) T -τ P P ∈P x P (2 + ε) T -τ P = (2 + ε) T P ∈P x P - e∈E x e τ e (x e ) (2 + ε) (1 -ε/3) D -D D .</formula><p>Since the function d is increasing, this concludes the proof.</p><p>The presented analysis of the algorithm is similar to the one of the (2 + ε)-approximation algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The common underlying idea is to prove that averaging a flow over time with time horizon T yields a feasible static flow which can then again be turned into a flow over time with time horizon 2T . However, while Fleischer and Skutella use the fact that the average static flow is length-bounded by T , it is easy to observe that this is no longer true if we allow flow-dependent transit times on the arcs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Lower bounds on the performance of the algorithm</head><p>It can be shown that our analysis is tight, even for the case of a network consisting of only one uncapacitated arc e from s to t. In this example, the transit time of arc e is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">τ e (x e ) := 2 if x e 1, ∞ if x e &gt; 1.</formula><p>From (2) one can determine the corresponding load-dependent function</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">τ (y e ) = 2 if y e 2, ∞ if y e &gt; 2.</formula><p>Thus, a quickest flow over time sending demand D := 2 from s to t needs exactly 2 time units since it can put the 2 units of flow onto arc e at time 0 such that they arrive at time 2. However, an optimal solution to the static maximum flow problem stated at the beginning of this section sets the flow rate x e to 1. Thus, in the resulting temporally repeated flow the last piece of flow leaves s only at time 2 and therefore does not arrive before time 4.</p><p>In this example, the gap of 2 between the optimal solution and the solution arising from the static maximum flow problem obviously originates from the incapability of the static flow problem to capture the possibility of sending flow at a very high flow rate for a very short period of time.</p><p>Although the optimal flow over time is temporally repeated here, a slight modification of the instance shows that every temporally repeated flow can be bad compared to an optimal flow over time. If we double the demand value to D := 4, an optimal flow over time needs 4 time units since it sends two packets of flow, each containing 2 units of flow, at time 0 and at time 2, respectively. However, in a temporally repeated flow, the flow rate cannot be chosen bigger than 1 since otherwise the arc would become completely congested as soon as there are more than 2 units of flow on it. Therefore, every temporally repeated flow needs at least 6 time units and is thus at least a factor of 3/2 away from the optimal value 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">A bicriteria generalization</head><p>The results in Theorem 3.3 can be generalized in the following direction. One can decrease the factor of 2 in time at the cost of a decrease of the amount of flow that can be delivered. This leads to the following bicriteria results.</p><p>Corollary 3.4. If there is a flow over time which sends D units of flow from s to t within time T , then, for every α 1, there exists a temporally repeated flow satisfying demand (α -1)D within time horizon at most αT . Moreover, for every ε &gt; 0, one can compute a temporally repeated flow in polynomial time which satisfies demand (α -1)D within time horizon at most (α + ε)T .</p><p>The proof of Corollary 3.4 is almost identical to the proof of Theorem 3.3 (replacing 2 by α).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">An alternative view on the 2-approximation</head><p>We close this section with the following alternative view of the presented approximation result which highlights its close relation to the algorithm of Ford and Fulkerson. A temporally repeated flow with load-dependent transit times and time horizon T can be obtained from a solution to the following static convex cost flow problem. For the special case of fixed transit times, this is exactly the static flow problem considered by Ford and Fulkerson. It is easy to observe that the value of the resulting temporally repeated flow is equal to the value of the objective function (compare ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">9</ref>)). For the special case of fixed transit times, Ford and Fulkerson showed that this temporally repeated flow over time is maximal. This is no longer true in the setting with load-dependent transit times. However, it follows from Lemma 3.1 that for T = 2T * (where T * denotes the makespan of a quickest flow) this value is at least D. Thus, we get an alternative (2 + ε)-approximation algorithm for the quickest flow problem by embedding this approach into a binary search framework for T . The main drawback of this alternative algorithm is that it requires more than one convex cost flow computation. Moreover, the simple example discussed above also shows that its performance guarantee is not better than 2. On the other hand, we have to show that the existence of a flow over time with makespan less than 4+ 1/9 yields a satisfying truth-assignment for the underlying instance of Satisfiability. We first claim that, in such a flow, exactly one unit of flow is sent to t across arc a i , for every i = 1, . . . , n, and exactly ε units of flow are sent over arc c j , for every j = 1, . . . , m.</p><p>Notice that every unit of flow which is sent across a i enters this arc between time 1 and 2 + 1/9. Since the transit time of a i is at least 2, these flow units can simultaneously be found on the arc at time 2 + 1/9. The construction of τa i yields that the total amount of flow which is sent across a i is bounded by 1. A similar argument shows that at most ε units of flow can be sent to t across arc c j , for every j = 1, . . . , m. Since exactly n + εm units of flow are sent from s to t, these bounds are tight which proves the claim.</p><p>In the following, we refer to the unit of flow sent across arc a i as commodity i. For every i = 1, . . . , n, if at most one half of commodity i is sent across e i , we set variable z i to true; otherwise, we set it to false<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . It remains to show that this is a satisfying truth-assignment.</p><p>Consider some clause C j and the flow which uses the corresponding arc c j ; we refer to this flow as commodity j. Moreover, consider an arc e leaving the source s which is used by commodity j. By construction of the network, e corresponds to a literal (z i or ¬z i ) of clause C j . It therefore suffices to show that the amount of flow of commodity i which is sent across arc e is less than 1/2. In this case, the corresponding literal in clause C j is set to true such that the clause is fulfilled.</p><p>Notice that, in order to arrive in time at the sink t, all flow of commodity j using arc e must arrive at the head of e before time 10/9. In particular, arc e must not be congested too much in the time interval [0, 10/9), that is, the 'speed' 1/τ e ( e (θ)) has to be large enough such that flow of commodity j can arrive at the head of e before time 10/9. More formally, this implies the following condition on the load e (θ) of arc e: </p><p>Notice that flow entering arc e at or after time 0 cannot arrive at the head of e before time inf{ξ | ξ 0 1/τ e ( e (θ)) dθ 1}, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. By contradiction, we assume that the amount d of flow of commodity i which is sent across arc e is at least 1/2. In order to arrive in time at the sink t, all flow of commodity i using arc e must arrive at the head of e before time 19/9. This yields </p><p>where e,i (θ) denotes the load of commodity i on arc e at time θ (also compare ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>)). Since e,i (θ) min{ e (θ), d}, for all θ, and d 1/2, we get .</p><p>The second inequality is based on the fact that the function ξ → ξ/(1+ξ) is monotonically increasing in the interval [0, ∞).</p><p>Together with <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, this yields </p><p>Putting together <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, we get the following contradiction: The first equality follows from the definition τe ( e (θ)) = 1 + e (θ). This concludes the proof.</p><p>As a consequence of Lemma 4.2 we get the following hardness result for the flow problem under consideration.</p><p>Theorem 4.3. The problem of finding a quickest flow over time with load-dependent transit times is strongly NP-hard and also APX-hard, i.e., there does not exist a polynomial-time approximation scheme, unless P=NP. Lemma 4.2 even yields a stronger non-approximability result.</p><p>Corollary 4.4. There does not exist an approximation algorithm with performance guarantee better than 37/36, unless P=NP.</p><p>Certainly, stronger bounds than the one stated in Corollary 4.4 can be obtained using the same reduction with a more careful choice of the crucial parameters. However, we did not pursue this idea further.</p><p>Notice that the load-dependent transit times used for the hardness results in this section and the negative results of the last section are artificial and probably not very realistic. However, similar results can be obtained for more natural transit time functions. Unfortunately, the analysis gets much more involved then.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Concluding remarks</head><p>The following interesting generalization of the quickest flow problem under consideration was pointed out by Lisa Fleischer (personal communication, January 2002). There are k commodities i = 1, . . . , k, each given by a source-sink pair (s i , t i ). The aim is to find a quickest multicommodity flow over time such that the sum of the flow values of all commodities is at least D. The approximation result described in Section 3 can directly be generalized to this setting; the static flow problem stated at the beginning of Section 3 is turned into a maximum multicommodity flow problem with cost bounded by D. The analysis remains essentially unchanged.</p><p>A problem closely related to the quickest flow problem is the maximum flow-over-time problem with fixed time horizon T . Unfortunately, Corollary 3.4 does not yield any useful result for this variant of the problem. On the other hand, the reduction from the problem Partition in Section 4 shows, that the problem cannot be approximated with performance guarantee strictly better than 1/2, unless P=NP.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: a) For the case of static road traffic, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads developed a simplified function describing the dependency of the transit time on the flow. This function is given by τ e = τ 0 e (1 + 0.15(x e /u e ) 4), where τ 0 e is the free-flow transit time, x e is the flow rate, and u e is the 'practical capacity' of arc e. It follows from the given equation that the practical capacity of an arc is the flow rate at which the transit time is 15% higher than the free-flow transit time. b) Davidson proposed a function describing the transit time based on queuing theory considerations: τ e = τ 0 e (1 + Jx e /(u e -x e )). Again, τ 0 e is the free-flow transit time (i.e., the transit time at zero flow), x e is the flow rate, u e is the capacity of the arc, and J is a parameter of the model. We depict the function for various choices of J. In contrast to the function depicted in a), Davidson's function is obviously asymptotic to the capacity u e of the arc.

Lemma 3.1. If there exists a flow over time f with load-dependent transit times which sends D units of flow from s to t within time T , then there exists a static flow x of value at least D/T for the static flow problem stated above. Proof. Consider the static average rate flow x = (x e ) e∈E as defined in (5) which corresponds to the given flow over time with flow rate (f e ) e∈E and load ( e ) e∈E . By the assumption on the amount of flow sent, the value of the static flow x is D/T . Moreover, since the given flow over time obeys capacity constraints, the same is true for the average rate flow x. It thus remains to show that the cost of x is bounded by D. Since in the flow over time f every unit of flow needs at most time T to travel through the network from s to t, the corresponding total transit time is bounded by D T , that is,</figDesc></figure>

If: Let I be a subset of {1, . . . , n} such that i∈I a i = L. The flow is sent in two packets, each containing one flow unit.

Therefore the construction of the network yields that no arc can be traversed by more than one flow unit unless the flow takes at least (2n + 2)L units of time. As a consequence, in a flow over time with makespan (2n + 1)L, every arc is traversed by exactly one flow unit and the total transit time is thus n i=1 (2L + 2L + a i ) = 2(2n + 1)L. In particular, an arbitrary piece of flow needs exactly (2n + 1)L units of time to travel from s to t and the corresponding path therefore induces a subset I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} with i∈I a i = L.</p><p>So far we have shown that the problem under consideration is NP-hard in the weak sense.

Given a satisfying truth-assignment for the underlying instance of Satisfiability, we construct a flow over time as follows. For every i = 1, . . . , n, if the variable z i is set to true (false), then we route one unit of flow from s over ēi (e i ) and a i to t.
