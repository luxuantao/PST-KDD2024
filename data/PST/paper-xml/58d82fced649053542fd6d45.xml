<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We consider the cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink, where a very large number of distributed multiple-antenna access points (APs) serve many single-antenna users in the same time-frequency resource. A simple (distributed) conjugate beamforming scheme is applied at each AP via the use of local channel state information (CSI). This CSI is acquired through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink training signals transmitted by the users. We derive a closed-form expression for the spectral efficiency taking into account the effects of channel estimation errors and power control. This closed-form result enables us to analyze the effects of backhaul power consumption, the number of APs, and the number of antennas per AP on the total energy efficiency, as well as, to design an optimal power allocation algorithm. The optimal power allocation algorithm aims at maximizing the total energy efficiency, subject to a per-user spectral efficiency constraint and a per-AP power constraint. Compared with the equal power control, our proposed power allocation scheme can double the total energy efficiency. Furthermore, we propose AP selections schemes, in which each user chooses a subset of APs, to reduce the power consumption caused by the backhaul links. With our proposed AP selection schemes, the total energy efficiency increases significantly, especially for large numbers of APs. Moreover, under a requirement of good quality-of-service for all users, cell-free massive MIMO outperforms the colocated counterpart in terms of energy efficiency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The performance of cellular networks is typically limited by inter-cell interference. In particular, users close to the cell boundaries suffer from strong interference (relative to their desired signal power). Network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) (also referred to as distributed MIMO, coordinated multi-point transmission, and distributed antenna systems) can reduce such inter-cell interference through coherent cooperation between base stations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In network MIMO, the base stations cooperate via advanced backhaul links to jointly transmit signals in the downlink and jointly detect signals in the uplink. However, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> that base station cooperation has fundamental limitations, i.e., even with full cooperation between the base stations, the spectral efficiency is upperbounded by a finite constant when the transmit power goes to infinity. However, this does not mean that cooperation has no benefits. Cooperation can still yield significant higher spectral efficiencies and coverage probabilities compared to the case where interference is ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest in network MIMO over the past decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The main challenges in the implementation of network MIMO are the need for a substantial backhaul overhead, high deployment costs, and a sufficiently capable central processing unit. In particular, precoded signals and channel state information (CSI) need to be shared among the base stations.</p><p>Recently, cell-free massive MIMO has been introduced as a practical and useful embodiment of the network MIMO concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In cell-free massive MIMO, a large number of access points (APs) equipped with single or multiple antennas, and distributed over a large area, coherently serving a large number of users in the same time-frequency resource. As in (cellular) colocated massive MIMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, cell-free massive MIMO exploits the favorable propagation and channel hardening properties when the number of APs is large to multiplex many users in the same time-frequency resource with small inter-user interference. Thus, it can offer a huge spectral efficiency with simple signal processing. More importantly, in a cell-free massive MIMO configuration, the service antennas are brought close to the users, which yields a high degree of macro-diversity and low path losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; hence, many users can be served simultaneously with uniformly good quality-ofservice. Furthermore, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> that cell-free massive MIMO has significantly better performance than conventional small-cell systems, where each user is served by a single AP. For these reasons, cell-free massive MIMO is as a promising technology for next generation wireless systems.</p><p>Despite its potential, however, besides <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> there is fairly little work on cell-free massive MIMO available in the literature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the performance of cell-free massive MIMO with zeroforcing processing was analyzed, under the assumption that all pilot sequences assigned to the users were mutually orthog-onal. Cell-free massive MIMO with beamformed downlink training was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The conclusion was that by beamforming the pilots, the performance of the cell-free massive MIMO downlink can be substantially improved. A compute-and-forward approach for cell-free massive MIMO to reduce the backhaul load was proposed and analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. All the above-cited works assumed that the APs have only a single antenna. However, the APs can be equipped with multiple antennas to increase the diversity and array gains, as well as, reduce the backhaul requirements. In addition, while it is well-known that colocated massive MIMO is energyefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, it is not yet clear how good the energy efficiency of cell-free massive MIMO is. The argument is that in cellfree massive MIMO, more backhaul links are required which potentially increase the total power consumption to such a level that can overwhelm the spectral efficiency gains. There are many works on the energy efficiency of network MIMO in the literature, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. But to the authors' best knowledge, the total energy efficiency, that takes into account the effects of channel estimation, power control, AP selection schemes, hardware and backhaul power consumption, has not been previously exploited for cell-free massive MIMO.</p><p>Motivated by the above discussion, in this work we consider a cell-free massive MIMO system with multiple antennas at each AP and time-division duplex (TDD) operation. All APs cooperate via a backhaul network to jointly transmit signals to all users in the same time-frequency resource. The transmission is performed through the use of conjugate beamforming. The total energy efficiency of this system is investigated. The specific contributions of the paper are as follows:</p><p>• We derive a closed-form expression for the spectral efficiency of the downlink channel with any finite numbers of APs and users and arbitrary pilot sequences assigned to the users. Our result is a non-trivial generalization of the results for colocated massive MIMO in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and cell-free massive MIMO with single-antenna APs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. • We investigate the total energy efficiency of our considered system taking into account the hardware power consumption and the power consumption of the backhaul. We propose an optimal power control algorithm which aims at maximizing the total energy efficiency, under a per-user spectral efficiency constraint and a per-AP power constraint. The solution to this power control problem can be approximately determined by solving a sequence of second-order cone programs (SOCPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. • We study the effect of the backhaul power consumption, and show that the backhaul power consumption significantly affects the energy efficiency, especially when the number of APs is large. To reduce this effect, we propose two AP selection schemes: received-power-based selection and largest-large-scale-fading-based selection.</p><p>Then, the performances of cell-free massive MIMO and colocated massive MIMO are quantitatively compared.</p><p>The remainder of paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the cell-free massive MIMO system model and derive the downlink spectral efficiency. In Section III, we The n-th element of vector x CN 0, σ 2  Circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance σ 2 N(0, σ 2 )</p><p>Real-valued Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance σ 2 present the power consumption model and the corresponding energy efficiency. The power control and access point selection schemes are discussed in Sections IV and V, respectively. Numerical results and discussions are provided in Section VI, while Section VII concludes the paper. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> tabulates the notation and symbols used throughout the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL AND SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Model</head><p>We consider a cell-free massive MIMO system (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) where M APs serve K users in the same time-frequency resource under TDD operation. Each AP is equipped with N antennas, while each user has a single antenna. We assume that the APs and the users are randomly located in a large area, and all APs are connected to a central processing unit (CPU) through a backhaul network. We further assume that M ≫ K. With TDD CSI acquisition, the channel estimation overhead scales as K, and is independent of M . Therefore, M can be made as large as desired, while K is limited by mobility. (It is approximately upper bounded by the coherence time divided by the channel delay-spread.) As a result, operating with M ≫ K is both a desirable and a natural operating point.</p><p>For TDD operation in the context of massive MIMO, the existing literature typically considers three phases within each coherence interval: uplink training, uplink payload data transmission, and downlink payload data transmission. In this work, we focus on the downlink, and thus the uplink payload data transmission phase is neglected. The system model is similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, but an important distinction is that the APs have multiple antennas herein. Let τ c be the length of each coherence interval (in samples). A part of the coherence interval is used for uplink training. The length of this duration is denoted by τ p , τ p &lt; τ c . The remaining duration, (τ c -τ p ), is used for the downlink payload data transmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Uplink</head><p>Training: All K users simultaneously transmit their pilot sequences to all APs. Let √ τ p ϕ ϕ ϕ k ∈ C τp×1 , where ϕ ϕ ϕ k 2 = 1, be the pilot sequence transmitted from the k-th user, k = 1, . . . , K. Then, the m-th AP receives</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y p,m = √ τ p ρ p K k=1 g mk ϕ ϕ ϕ H k + W p,m ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ρ p is the normalized transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each pilot symbol, W p,m is an N × τ p noise matrix whose elements are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) CN (0, 1) RVs, and g mk ∈ C N ×1 is the channel vector between the m-th AP and the k-th user. The channel g mk ∈ C N ×1 models the propagation as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">g mk = β 1/2 mk h mk ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where β mk represents the large-scale fading which does not depend on the antenna indexes at the AP, and h mk is an N × 1 vector of small-scale fading coefficients between the N antennas of the m-th AP and the k-th user. We assume that small-scale fading is Rayleigh fading, i.e., the elements of h mk are i.i.d.

The elements of gmk are i.i.d. CN (0, β mk -γ mk ) RVs.</p><p>2) Downlink Payload Data Transmission: After acquiring the channels from the uplink pilots, the APs use conjugate beamforming to transmit signals to the K users. Our choice of conjugate beamforming is inspired by the fact that it is computationally simple with most processing done locally at the APs. More precisely, there is no need for exchanging the instantaneous CSI among the APs or the central unit. Furthermore, when the number of APs is large, conjugate beamforming offers excellent performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Denote the symbol intended for the k-th user by q k , where E |q k | 2 = 1, k = 1, . . . , K. The vector of transmitted signals from the m-th AP, x m , is generated by first scaling the K symbols with the power control coefficients {η mk }, and then multiplying them with the conjugate of the channel estimates as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x m = √ ρ d K k=1 √ η mk ĝ * mk q k ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where ρ d is the maximum normalized transmit power (normalized by the noise power N 0 ) at each AP.

Spectral Efficiency</head><p>The k-th user will detect its desired signal q k from the received signal r k given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. To do so, the k-th user needs to know the effective channel gain</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">M m=1 √ η mk g T mk ĝ * mk .</formula><p>Since there are no downlink pilots, the k-th user uses its knowledge of the channel statistics to detect q k . More precisely, the kth user treats the mean of the effect channel gain as the true channel for signal detection. The benefits of relying on the channel statistics only are: (i) the need for downlink training is avoided; and (ii) a simple closed-form expression for the spectral efficiency can be derived which enables us to obtain important insights and to further design power control, pilot assignment, and user scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, since the number of APs is large, the effective channel gain fluctuates only slightly around its mean (this is a consequence of the law of large numbers). Consequently, detection using only the channel statistics performs well [7, <ref type="bibr">Remark 4]</ref>.

In this case, the pilot contam- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">15</ref>) disappears, and hence, the spectral efficiency can increase without bound when the number of APs increases. However, typically, the channel coherence interval is not long enough to allow for orthogonality among the K pilot sequences. As a result, the spectral efficiency is bounded even when M → ∞ (since the</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">ination term ρ d N 2 K k ′ =k |γ γ γ T k ′ k η η η k ′ | 2 in (</formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">term ρ d N 2 K k ′ =k |γ γ γ T k ′ k η η η k ′ | 2</formula><p>increases with the same rate as the desired signal power term</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">ρ d N 2 |γ γ γ T kk η η η k | 2 )</formula><p>.

Our motivation for the above maneuver is twofold. First, the objective in ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) is a linear fractional function which is much easier to handle, from a viewpoint of Charnes-Cooper transformation that we shall show shortly. Second, the reformulation given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> facilitates a customization of the branch-and-bound method based on monotonic optimization to find an optimal solution, which is described next. Specifically, the formulation of ( P1 ) reveals three important observations: (i) the objective in (27a) is monotonically increasing with t and 1/t 0 ; (ii) for a given fixed t and 1/t 0 , the constraints in (27b) and (27c) are convex; and (iii) the constraints (24c), (24d), (26) are convex. These three facts simply mean that a globally optimal solution can be found using a monotonic optimization method, i.e., the branch-andreduce-and bound (BRB) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The description of a BRB for solving ( P1 ) is quite involved and thus is omitted for the sake of brevity.

Solvers for such a convex problem do exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, but our numerical experiments reveal that they are not scalable with the problem size. To arrive at a more computationally efficient formulation, our idea is to approximate (28b) by a more tractable constraint, i.e., an SOC one. Accordingly to the SCA principle, we need to find a convex lower bound of the right hand side of (28b).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Convergence Analysis</head><p>The convergence analysis of Algorithm 1 follows standard arguments for the general framework of SCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Specifically, the following properties of Algorithm 1 are guaranteed</p><p>• A feasible solution to ( P1,n ) is also feasible to ( P1 ).</p><p>• An optimal solution of ( P1,n ) is also feasible to ( P1,n+1 ).</p><p>• Algorithm 1 generates a monotonically increasing sequence of objectives. To see the above results, let us consider the constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. In iteration n, the constraint ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">29</ref>) is replaced by (31). For ease of description, let g(c) denote the right hand side of the constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. Suppose (c,</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">u k ) is feasible to ( P1,n ), i.e., F (c, u k ; c n , u n k ) ≥ g(c). Since f (c, u k ) is jointly convex with (c, u k ), it holds that f (c, u k ) ≥ F (c, u k ; c n , u n k ) since F (c, u k ; c n , u n k</formula><p>) is simply the first order approximation of f (c, u k ) around (c n , u n k ), and thus f (c, u k ) ≥ g(c). This implies that (c, u k ) is also feasible to ( P1 ). Further, since (c n , u n k ) is an optimal solution to ( P1,n ), it is of course feasible to ( P1,n ) and also to ( P1 ), i.e., f (c n , u n k ) ≥ g(c n ). Now we note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">F (c n , u n k ; c n , u n k ) = f (c n , u n k ) since F (c, u k ; c n , u n k ) is equal to f (c, u k ) when (c, u k ) = (c n , u n k ). Thus, F (c n , u n k ; c n , u n k ) ≥ g(c n</formula><p>) which means that (c n , u n k ) is also feasible to ( P1,n+1 ). Obviously, the optimal value of an optimal problem is always larger than the objective value of a feasible solution, which proves the monotonic increase of the objective returned by Algorithm 1. We also note that due the total power constraint, the objective of (P 1 ) is bounded from above. Thus, the objective of Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to converge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. ACCESS POINT SELECTION</head><p>Compared with colocated massive MIMO systems, cell-free massive MIMO systems require more backhaul connections to transfer the data between the APs and the CPU. This is reflected by the last term of (20) (representing the total power consumption of the backhaul) which is proportional to the sum spectral efficiency and the numbers of APs. By dividing the numerator and the denominator of the total energy efficiency </p><p>We can see that the backhaul power consumption-the second term of the denominator of (38)-affects significantly the energy efficiency, especially when M increases. To improve the total energy efficiency, we can decrease the first term of the denominator of the energy efficiency in (38) or/and reduce the backhaul power consumption. With the proposed power allocation scheme in preceding sections, we just minimize the first term, ignoring the effect of the backhaul power consumption. That is, there is still room to further increase the total energy efficiency of the system. In this section, we propose two access point selection schemes which can reduce the backhaul power consumption, and hence, increase the energy efficiency. The proposed schemes are based on two main observations:</p><p>• The backhaul between the CPU and the m-th AP is used to transfer the data q 1 , . . . , q K . Thus, the backhaul power consumption depends on the spectral efficiencies S e1 , . . . , S eK . If the m-th AP serves only some users, then it needs to send only the data corresponding to these users. As a result, the backhaul power consumption depends only on the spectral efficiencies of these users. Let U m be the set of users served by the m-th AP. Then, the backhaul consumption corresponding to the m-th AP ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">19</ref>) is now modified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">P bh,m = P 0,m + B • k∈Um P bt,m S ek . (<label>39</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_58">)</formula><p>Clearly, if U m = {1, . . . , K} for all m, then (39) is identical to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. • For a given user, there are many APs which are located very far away. These APs will not add significantly to the overall spatial diversity gains. This implies that not all APs really participate in serving this user. Motivated by the above observations, and in order to save the power consumption (and therefore, increase the total energy efficiency), each user should not be served by all APs. Instead, a group of APs should be chosen for each user. In this section, we propose two simple AP selection methods: received-power-based selection and largest-large-scale-fadingbased selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Received-Power-Based Selection</head><p>Based on the optimal power control coefficients obtained from Algorithm 1, we can determine how much useful power is transferred from each AP to a given user, and hence, we can select a group of APs which effectively serves that user. With the received-power-based selection scheme, a group of APs are chosen to serve the k-th user, denoted by A k , which should fulfill the following criteria: (i) it contributes at least δ% of the total received power of the desired signal at the k-th user, and (ii) its cardinality is minimum.</p><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, the total received power of the desired signal is represented by DS k ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">DS k = √ ρ d N M m=1 √ η mk γ mk ,<label>(40)</label></formula><p>in which the m-th AP contributes an amount of √ ρ d N √ η mk γ mk .

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this section, we provide numerical results to quantitatively study the performance of cell-free massive MIMO in terms of its total energy efficiency, as well as to verify the benefit of our AP selection schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Parameters and Setup</head><p>The APs and the users are located within a square of D ×D km 2 . The square is wrapped around at the edges to avoid boundary effects. Furthermore, for simplicity, random pilot assignment is used. With random pilot assignment, each user randomly chooses a pilot sequence from a predefined set of τ p orthogonal pilot sequences of length τ p symbols.</p><p>The large-scale fading coefficient β mk is modeled as the product of path loss and shadow fading:</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">β mk = PL mk • z mk ,<label>(45)</label></formula><p>where z mk represents the log-normal shadowing with the standard deviation σ sh , and PL mk represents the three-slope path loss given by (in dB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> PL</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">mk =        -L -35 log 10 (d mk ), if d mk &gt; d 1 -L -15 log 10 (d 1 ) -20 log 10 (d mk ), if d 0 &lt; d mk ≤ d 1 -L -15 log 10 (d 1 ) -20 log 10 (d 0 ), if d mk ≤ d 0 (<label>46</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_67">)</formula><p>where L is a constant depending on the carrier frequency, the user and AP heights. In all examples, we choose σ sh = 8 dB, d 0 = 10 m, d 1 = 50 m, and L = 140.7 dB. These parameters resemble those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the power consumption parameters, unless otherwise stated, we keep the power consumption parameters as in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. These values are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In addition, we choose B = 20 MHz, a noise figure equal to 9 dB, ρ d = 1 W, ρ p = 0.2 W, and τ c = 200.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Results and Discussions</head><p>1) Power Allocation: First, we evaluate the effectiveness of our power allocation in maximizing the total energy efficiency as well as the convergence behavior of Algorithm 1. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the total energy efficiency obtained via Algorithm 1 versus the number of iterations N I , with N = 1, D = 1 km, τ p = 20, and different M , K for an arbitrary large-scale fading realization. For small network configurations, we benchmark Algorithm 1 with the optimal solution achieved by a BRB method. To do this, we modify the code for optimal downlink beamforming in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Although, there is no guarantee that SCA-based method can yield an optimal solution in theory, our numerical results show that Algorithm 1 indeed converges to an optimal solution for small size networks in most cases. However, the effectiveness of Algorithm 1 for large-scale networks is still unknown simply because the BRB method fails to work on such large-scale problems. We can also see that Algorithm 1 converges very fast, within about 10 iterations.  Therefore, hereafter we choose N I = 10 for Algorithm 1. Furthermore, we choose ǫ = 0.01.</p><p>In the next numerical experiment, we evaluate the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Specifically, we provide the average run time of our proposed power control for different M and K, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The codes are developed on MATLAB using the modeling tool YALMIP and are executed on a 64-bit operating system with 16 GB RAM and Intel CORE i7, 3.4 GHz. The convex conic solver MOSEK is chosen as the internal solver for YALMIP. We remark that our codes are not a real-time implementation and, thus, are mainly meaningful to see how the complexity of the proposed algorithm scales with the problem size. As expected, the run time of the proposed algorithms increases with both M and K, and increases rapidly after some value of M and K. This is a typical observation of interior-point methods for solving convex programs, which are the basis of MOSEK. As the focus of this paper is to investigate the potential of cell-free massive MIMO, we simply resort to off-the-self convex solvers to deal with the derived convex programs. The results shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> clearly call for more computationally efficient methods for optimization problems possibly encountered in cell-free massive MIMO due to their large scale. This opens a rich area for future research.</p><p>To further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation method, we compare the average energy efficiency of our power allocation with two simple equal power control schemes: (I) η mk = (Kγ mk ) -1 and (II)</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">η mk = K k ′ =1 γ mk ′ -1</formula><p>, ∀k = 1, . . . K (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> The average is taken over the large-scale fading realizations. The spectral efficiency target S ok is set to be equal to the spectral efficiency obtained in scheme (II). With our proposed power control, the total energy efficiency improves significantly. In particular, compared with equal power control (II), our proposed power control can improve the total energy efficiency by factors of more than 2.9 and 2.6 for the cases of (M = 100, K = 20) and (M = 100, K = 40), respectively. Hereafter, all curves are obtained by using power control. Furthermore, if the problem is infeasible, we set the total energy efficiency equal to 0.</p><p>2) AP Selection: Next, we examine the performance of our proposed AP selection schemes and the effect of backhaul power consumption on the energy efficiency. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the average total energy efficiency versus the traffic-dependent power P bt . Here we assume that P bt,m = P bt for all m, and choose M = 100, N = 1, τ p = 40, D = 1 km, and the spectral efficiency target is 1 bit/s/Hz, i.e., S ok = 1 bit/s/Hz, k = 1, . . . , K. For the AP selection schemes, we choose δ = 95 which means the chosen APs contribute at least 95% of the total received power of the desired signal at the each user. Without AP selection, the total energy efficiency decreases  noticeably as the traffic-dependent power increases. This can be compensated by using our proposed AP selection schemes. Our proposed AP selection schemes work very well and improve the energy efficiency significantly, especially at high P bt,m and large M . Furthermore, it can be seen from the figure that, the received-power-based selection scheme is better than the largest large-scale-fading-based selection one. However, the performance gap is small. Note again that the former scheme has higher computational complexity. The average numbers of APs chosen by each user are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. On average, only about 10%-20% of the total number of APs really participate in serving a given user. These results imply that, it is enough for each user to choose a small number of APs around it, which enables the practical implementation of cell-free massive MIMO. In the remaining numerical results, we consider the received-power-based selection scheme with δ = 95. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Effect of the Number of Antennas per AP:</head><p>We examine the performance of cell-free massive MIMO with different numbers of antennas per AP. For fair comparison, the total transmit power in the network is the same, and the number of service antennas is fixed, i.e., N M = 256.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the average total energy efficiency as a function of the number of antennas per AP. The curves in this figure are generated by using the received-power-based selection scheme (using Algorithm 2). For a fixed total number of service antennas, when the number of antennas per AP increases, the number of APs reduces. The reduction in the number of APs yields a reduction in backhaul power consumption. However, at the same time, the spectral efficiency may decrease since the users are now far away from the APs. This is the reason for why in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, when N increases, the energy efficiency first increases, approaches the optimal point, and then decreases. The optimal number of AP antennas depends heavily on the system parameters, especially the traffic-dependent power P bt,m , the spectral efficiency target S ok , and the size of the area. As expected, at high P bt,m , low S ok and D, we should use fewer APs with more antennas per AP, and vice versus for low P bt,m , high S ok and D.</p><p>4) Cell-Free Massive MIMO Versus Colocated Massive MIMO: Finally, we compare the energy efficiency of cellfree massive MIMO and colocated massive MIMO. Colocated massive MIMO corresponds to the case M = 1. For cell-free massive MIMO, we use the received-power-based selection scheme (Algorithm 2) and the optimal number of antennas per AP (in the sense of maximizing the average energy efficiency). Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows the energy efficiency versus the sum spectral efficiency target K k=1 S ok . Here, we choose D = 1 km and K = 20. Compared to the colocated system, cell-free massive MIMO improves the system performance significantly. For example, with S ok = 1 bit/s/Hz, for all k = 1, . . . , K, compared with colocated massive MIMO, the energy efficiency of cellfree massive MIMO improves by factors of about 7.4 and 2.2 for M N = 128 and M N = 256, respectively. This shows the strong potential of cell-free massive MIMO to boost the energy and spectral efficiency of 5G networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>We investigated the total energy efficiency of a cell-free massive MIMO system with multiple-antenna APs, taking into account the effects of channel estimation, power control (which maximizes the total energy efficiency), nonorthogonality of pilot sequences, and backhaul power consumption. Two AP selection schemes were proposed to reduce the backhaul power consumption. We showed that our power allocation algorithm together with the AP selection schemes can improve the energy efficiency significantly. For a given user, only a small number of APs really participate in serving it. In particular, the cell-free massive MIMO system can provide a very high energy efficiency, while ensuring uniformly good service for all users. With a requirement of 1 bit/s/Hz for each user, cell-free massive MIMO can improve the energy efficiency by an order of magnitude, compared to colocated massive MIMO. </p><p>Finally, we compute E |UI kk ′ | 2 .
