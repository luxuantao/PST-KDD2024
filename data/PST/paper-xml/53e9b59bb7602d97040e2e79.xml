<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we study a notion of topological complexity TC(X) for the motion planning problem. TC(X) is a number which measures discontinuity of the process of motion planning in the configuration space X. More precisely, TC(X) is the minimal number k such that there are k different "motion planning rules", each defined on an open subset of X × X, so that each rule is continuous in the source and target configurations. We use methods of algebraic topology (the Lusternik -Schnirelman theory) to study the topological complexity TC(X) . We give an upper bound for TC(X) (in terms of the dimension of the configuration space X) and also a lower bound (in the terms of the structure of the cohomology algebra of X). We explicitly compute the topological complexity of motion planning for a number of configuration spaces: for spheres, two-dimensional surfaces, for products of spheres. In particular, we completely calculate the topological complexity of the problem of motion planning for a robot arm in the absence of obstacles. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Definition of topological complexity</head><p>Let X be the space of all possible configurations of a mechanical system. In most applications the configuration space X comes equipped with a structure of topological space. The motion planning problem consists in constructing a program or a devise, which takes pairs of configurations (A, B) ∈ X × X as an input and produces as an output a continuous path in X, which starts at A and ends at B, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Here A is the initial configuration, and and B is the final (desired) configuration of the system.</p><p>We will assume below that the configuration space X is path-connected, which means that for any pair of points of X there exists a continuous path in X connecting them. Otherwise, the motion planner has first to decide whether the given points A and B belong to the same path-connected component of X.</p><p>The motion planning problem can be formalized as follows. Let P X denote the space of all continuous paths γ : [0, 1] → X in X. We will denote by π : P X → X × X the map associating to any path γ ∈ P X the pair of its initial and end points π(γ) = (γ(0), γ(1)). Equip the path space P X with the compact-open topology. Rephrasing the above definition we see that the problem of motion planning in X consists of finding a function s : X × X → P X such that the composition π • s = id is the identity map. In other words, s must be a section of π.</p><p>Does there exist a continuous motion planning in X? Equivalently, we ask whether it is possible to construct a motion planning in the configuration space X so that the continuous path s(A, B) in X, which describes the movement of the system from the initial configuration A to final configuration B, depends continuously on the pair of points (A, B)? In other words, does there exist a motion planning in X such that the section s : X × X → P X is continuous?</p><p>Continuity of the motion planning is an important natural requirement. Absence of continuity will result in instability of the behavior: there will exist arbitrarily close pairs (A, B) and (A ′ , B ′ ) of initial -desired configurations such that the corresponding paths s(A, B) and s(A ′ , B ′ ) are not close. Unfortunately, as the following Theorem states, a continuous motion planning exists only in very simple situations.</p><p>Theorem 1 A continuous motion planning s : X × X → P X exists if and only if the configuration space X is contractible.</p><p>Proof. Suppose that a continuous section s : X × X → P X exists. Fix a point A 0 ∈ X and consider the homotopy</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h t : X → X, h t (B) = s(A 0 , B)(t),</formula><p>where B ∈ X, and t ∈ [0, 1]. We have h 1 (B) = B and h 0 (B) = A 0 . Thus h t gives a contraction of the space X into the point A 0 ∈ X.</p><p>Conversely, assume that there is a continuous homotopy h t : X → X such that h 0 (A) = A and h 1 (A) = A 0 for any A ∈ X. Given a pair (A, B) ∈ X × X, we may compose the path t → h t (A) with the inverse of t → h t (B), which gives a continuous motion planning in X.</p><p>Thus, we get a motion planning in a contractible space X by first moving A into the base point A 0 along the contraction, and then following the inverse of the path, which brings B to A 0 . ⋄ Definition 2 Given a path-connected topological space X, we define the topological complexity of the motion planning in X as the minimal number TC(X) = k, such that the Cartesian product X × X may be covered by k open subsets</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X × X = U 1 ∪ U 2 ∪ • • • ∪ U k (1)</formula><p>such that for any i = 1, 2, . . . , k there exists a continuous motion planning s i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U i → P X, π • s i = id over U i . If no such k exists we will set TC(X) = ∞.</formula><p>Intuitively, the topological complexity TC(X) is a measure of discontinuity of any motion planner in X.</p><p>Given an open cover (1) and sections s i as above, one may organize a motion planning algorithm as follows. Given a pair of initial-desired configurations (A, B), we first find the subset U i with the smallest index i such that (A, B) ∈ U i and then we give the path s i (A, B) as an output. Discontinuity of the output s i (A, B) as a function of the input (A, B) is obvious: suppose that (A, B) is close to the boundary of U 1 and is close to a pair (A ′ , B ′ ) ∈ U 2 -U 1 ; then the output s 1 (A, B) compared to s 2 (A ′ , B ′ ) may be completely different, since the sections s 1 | U1∩U2 and s 2 | U1∩U2 are in general distinct. According to Theorem 1, we have TC(X) = 1 if and only if the space X is contractible.</p><p>Example.</p><p>Suppose that X is a convex subset of an Euclidean space R n . Given a pair of initial -desired configurations (A, B), we may move with constant velocity along the straight line segment connecting A and B. This clearly produces a continuous algorithm for the motion planning problem in X. This is consistent with Theorem 1: we have TC(X) = 1 since X is contractible.</p><p>Example. Consider the case when X = S 1 is a circle. Since S 1 is not contractible, we know that TC(S 1 ) &gt; 1. Let us show that TC(S 1 ) = 2. Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">U 1 ⊂ S 1 × S 1 as U 1 = {(A, B); A = -B}.</formula><p>A continuous motion planning over U 1 is given by the map s 1 : U 1 → P S 1 which moves A towards B with constant velocity along the unique shortest arc connecting A to B. This map s 1 cannot be extended to a continuous map on the pairs of antipodal points A = -B. Now define U 2 = {(A, B); A = B}. Fix an orientation of the circle S 1 . A continuous motion planning over U 2 is given by the map s 2 : U 2 → P S 1 which moves A towards B with constant velocity in the positive direction along the circle. Again, s 2 cannot be extended to a continuous map on the whole S 1 × S 1 .</p><p>Remark. Our definition of the topological complexity TC(X) is motivated by the notion of a genus of a fiber space, introduced by A.S. Schwarz <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In fact TC(X) is the Schwarz genus of the path space fibration P X → X × X.</p><p>The theory of Schwarz genus was used by S. Smale <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and V. Vassiliev <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to define topological complexity of algorithms of finding roots of polynomial equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Homotopy invariance</head><p>The following property of homotopy invariance allows often to simplify the configuration space X without changing the topological complexity TC(X).</p><p>Theorem 3 TC(X) depends only on the homotopy type of X.</p><p>Proof. Suppose that X dominates Y , i.e. there exist continuous maps f : X → Y and g : Y → X such that f • g ≃ id Y . Let us show that then TC(Y ) ≤ TC(X). Assume that U ⊂ X × X is an open subset such that there exists a continuous motion planning s :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">U → P X over U . Define V = (g × g) -1 (U ) ⊂ Y × Y . We will construct a continuous motion planning σ : V → P Y over V explicitly. Fix a homotopy h t : Y → Y with h 0 = id Y and h 1 = f • g; here t ∈ [0, 1]. For (A, B) ∈ V and τ ∈ [0, 1] set σ(A, B)(τ ) =            h 3τ (A), for 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1/3, f (s(gA, gB)(3τ -1)), for 1/3 ≤ τ ≤ 2/3, h 3(1-τ ) , for 2/3 ≤ τ ≤ 1.</formula><p>Thus we obtain that for k = TC(X) any open cover</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">U 1 ∪ • • • ∪ U k = X × X with a continuous motion planning over each U i defines an open cover V 1 ∪ • • • ∪ V k</formula><p>of Y × Y with the similar properties. This proves that TC(Y ) ≤ TC(X), and obviously implies the statement of the Theorem. ⋄</p><p>3 An upper bound for TC(X)</p><p>Theorem 4 For any path-connected paracompact space X, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">TC(X) ≤ 2 • dim X + 1.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In particular, if X is a connected polyhedral subset of R n then the topological complexity TC(X) can be estimated from above as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">TC(X) ≤ 2n -1.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>We postpone the proof. We will use a relation between TC(X) and the Lusternik -Schnirelman category cat(X). Recall that cat(X) is defined as the smallest integer k such that X may be covered by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">k open subsets V 1 ∪ • • • ∪ V k = X with each inclusion V i → X null-homotopic. Theorem 5 If X is path-connected and paracompact then cat(X) ≤ TC(X) ≤ 2 • cat(X) -1.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Proof. Let U ⊂ X × X be an open subset such that there exists a continuous motion planning s : U → P X over U . Let A 0 ∈ X be a fixed point. Denote by V ⊂ X the set of all points B ∈ X such that (A 0 , B) belongs to U . Then clearly the set V is open and it is contractible in X × X.</p><p>If TC(X) = k and U 1 ∪ • • • ∪ U k is a covering of X × X with a continuous motion planning over each U i , then the sets V i , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A 0 × V i = U i ∩ (A 0 × X)</formula><p>form a categorical open cover of X. This shows that TC(X) ≥ cat(X).</p><p>The second inequality follows from the obvious inequality</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">TC(X) ≤ cat(X × X) combined with cat(X × X) ≤ 2 • cat(X) -1, see Proposition 2.3 of [2]. ⋄ Proof of Theorem 4. It is well-known that cat(X) ≤ dim(X) + 1.</formula><p>Together with the right inequality in (4) this gives (2). If X ⊂ R n is a connected polyhedral subset then X has homotopy type of an (n -1)-dimensional polyhedron Y . Using homotopy invariance (Theorem 3) we find TC(X) = TC(Y ) ≤ 2(n -1) + 1 = 2n -1. ⋄</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Motion planning on spheres</head><p>Theorem 8 The topological complexity of motion planning on the n-dimensional sphere S n is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">TC(S n ) =    2, for n odd,</formula><p>3, for n even.</p><p>Proof. First we will show that TC(S n ) ≤ 2 for n odd. Let U 1 ⊂ S n × S n be the set of all pairs (A, B) where A = -B. Then there is a unique shortest arc of S n connecting A and B and we will construct a continuous motion planning s 1 : U 1 → P S n by setting s 1 (A, B) ∈ P S n to be this shortest arc passed with a constant velocity. The second open set will be defined as U 2 = {(A, B); A = B} ⊂ S n × S n . A continuous motion planning over U 2 will be constructed in two steps. On the first step we will move the initial point A to the antipodal point -B along the shortest arc as above. On the second step we will move the antipodal point -B to B. For this purpose fix a continuous tangent vector field v on S n , which is nonzero at every point; here we will use the assumption that the dimension n is odd. We may move -B to B along the spherical arc</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">-cos πt • B + sin πt • v(B), t ∈ [0, 1].</formula><p>This proves that TC(S n ) ≤ 2 for n odd; hence by Theorem 1 TC(S n ) = 2 for n odd.</p><p>Assume now that n is even. Let us show that then TC(S n ) ≤ 3. We will define a continuous motion planning over a set U 1 ⊂ S n × S n as above. For n even we may construct a continuous tangent vector field v on S n , which vanishes at a single point B 0 ∈ S n and is nonzero for any B ∈ S n , B = B 0 . We will define the second set U 2 ⊂ S n × S n as {(A, B); A = B &amp; B = B 0 }. We may define s 2 : U 2 → P S n as above. Now, U 1 ∪ U 2 covers everything except the pair of points (-B 0 , B 0 ). Chose a point C ∈ S n , distinct from B 0 , -B 0 and set U 3 = S n -C. Note that U 3 is diffeomorphic to R n and so there exists a continuous motion planning over U 3 . This proves that TC(S n ) ≤ 3. On the other hand, using Theorem 7 and the preceeding Example, we find TC(S n ) ≥ 3 for n even. This completes the proof. ⋄</p></div>

If |S| + |T | = |S ′ | + |T | = k, then the corresponding sets W (S, T ) and W (S ′ , T ′ ) either coincide (if S = S ′ and T = T ′ ), or are disjoint.
