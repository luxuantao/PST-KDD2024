<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A data-driven machine deep learning approach is proposed for differentiating subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC), by only analyzing noninvasive scalp EEG recordings. The methodology here proposed consists of evaluating the power spectral density (PSD) of the 19-channels EEG traces and representing the related spectral profiles into 2-d gray scale images (PSD-images). A customized Convolutional Neural Network with one processing module of convolution, Rectified Linear Units (ReLu) and pooling layer (CNN 1 ) is designed to extract from PSD-images some suitable features and to perform the corresponding two and three-ways classification tasks. The resulting CNN is shown to provide better classification performance when compared to more conventional learning machines; indeed, it achieves an average accuracy of 89.8% in binary classification and of 83.3% in three-ways classification. These results encourage the use of deep processing systems (here, an engineered first stage, namely the PSD-image extraction, and a second or multiple CNN stage) in challenging clinical frameworks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that occurs in older individuals, causing cognitive and functional deficits. The prodromal stage of AD is known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a neurological disorder characterized by a mild decline in mental abilities that does not interfere with the autonomy of the subject. Actually, MCI patients may remain stable, regress to a normal condition, whereas 10-15 % (per year) of them may develop dementia due to AD, which is a heavy progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The number of subjects affected by AD has been drastically increasing over years and it is expected to reach 15 million by 2050 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the last two decades, Electroencephalography (EEG) has been employed as a promising tool for early screening and to assist diagnosing AD. To this end, several EEG-based classification algorithms have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. EEG is a low-cost, noninvasive network of measurement, which allows for the recording of the brain's electrical activity. The EEG is commonly decomposed into four, neurophysiological sub-bands: δ (0.5-4 Hz), θ (4-8 Hz), α (8-12 Hz), β (12-32 Hz). It has been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, that abnormalities in EEG recordings, such as slowing of the rhythms, loss of complexity and altered synchronization between channels, may be indicative of brain degeneration due to AD, although not specific of the disease. A significant amount of research has been focused on the early detection of AD but it is still a challenging open issue. The EEG of AD and MCI patients shows slowing effects in the brain EEG rhythms, as the AD progression is related to the relative prevalence of low frequencies (delta and theta bands) with respect to high frequencies (alpha and beta) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This evaluation is carried out in a clinical setting by visually inspecting the EEG recordings, sometimes also by computing the relative power in the EEG subbands, by using proper functionality provided by the most common EEG review software. In particular, the Power Spectral Density (PSD), which describes the power frequency distribution of a signal, is routinely used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Empirically defined features based on the PSD have been proposed in the literature and machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely employed to classify EEGs of cognitively impaired subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However, standard ML methods are based on the explicit definition of features and are not suitable to process high-dimensional volumes of data. Deep learning (DL) is an advanced ML technique able to overcome the aforementioned limitations; indeed, it extracts the most relevant features directly from raw input data. Since DL has been turning out to be the key solution for many real-world applications (i.e. biochemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, biomedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, image detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, cybersecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>), recently, DL driven AD detection systems have been emerging. However, such systems are mostly based on neuroimaging analysis (structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI, fMRI)) especially gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and only a few DL studies address the discrimination of AD referring to EEG recordings. In this context, a dataset of 189 EEGs (63 AD, 63 MCI, 63 HC) were collected at IRCSS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo of Messina (Italy) and here used to</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T develop a DL based system. Specifically, in this study, we propose a data-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework capable of differentiating the PSD spectrograms extracted from the EEGs of AD, MCI and HC subjects. The proposed system includes an EEG signal transform into the frequency domain through the PSD estimation and a CNN architecture with a single stage of convolutional, ReLu and pooling layer (CNN 1 ), able to extract significant features after mapping the spectral profiles into 2-d gray scale images (PSD-images). It is to be noted that ReLu activation function has been utilized in this study, because it alleviates the vanishing gradient problem and introduces sparse representations (as it sets to zeros negative values) that consequently lead to better prevent the over-fitting and to a significant reduction of the free parameters of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The proposed CNN 1 is compared with standard classifiers (Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)), all of them trained over two different kind of input: 1) the raw PSD spectrograms; 2) handcrafted features manually extracted from the PSD spectrograms. Experimental results showed that the proposed CNN 1 outperformed all other approaches achieving average accuracy rate up to 89.8% in binary (AD vs HC, MCI vs HC, AD vs MCI) and 83.3% in 3-ways (AD vs MCI vs HC) classification. The list of contributions of the present paper can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• development of an innovative method based on 2-d spectral representations (PSD images) of EEG data;</p><p>• development of a data-driven DL approach based on a computationallyefficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN 1 ) for classifying AD, MCI and HC subjects by only analyzing noninvasive scalp EEG recordings;</p><p>• development of a system with potential for clinical deployment in realworld applications.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the related literature review is discussed; in Section 3 the available EEG recordings are described and the proposed methodology is introduced. Section 4 illustrates the architecture of the proposed CNN 1 . In Section 5 the achieved experimental results are presented and discussed. Section 6 and Section 7 address the discussion and conclusions, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related works</head><p>Features-based approaches have been employed to aid the diagnosis of Alzheimer by using state-of-the-art ML algorithms (i.e. LDA, SVM, ANNs). Anderer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and Pritchard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> reported significant classification performance (up to 90%) between AD patients and normal individuals, by using EEG markers as input to an ANN. Although the discussed models provided high classification performance, the literature lacks a clear and standardized EEG recording protocol for AD/MCI classification. Often, the analyzed cohorts of subjects are either small or the length of the EEG recordings is not sufficient (just a few seconds), which makes it difficult to compare the performance of the different methods and to replicate the experiments. One of the main drawbacks of the methods proposed in the literature is also the requirement for handcrafted features extraction, yielding a set of features not easily interpretable by clinicians. This issue can be overcome by using mixed DL techniques, that are able to introduce data-driven methods on well accepted data representations, like spectral data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. CNN is a DL-architecture which avoids the explicit definition of features and learns significant representations hierarchically from the input data. As CNNs provided impressive results, especially in image classification problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, recently, several CNN models based on neuroimages (structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI, fMRI)) have been emerging also in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

The Exclusion criteria were: evidence of other psychiatric or neurological disorders that might cause cognitive impairment, uncontrolled or complex systemic disorders, EEG epileptiform patterns, traumatic brain injuries. The protocol, the goals, the risks and the benefits of the present study were described to the patients and their caregivers, who signed an informed consent form. Every subject underwent a neuroimaging examination, in order to exclude other possible pathological conditions (stroke, traumatic brain injury,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>hydrocephalus or other neurological conditions) which may cause symptoms similar to AD. The possible effects of any medication like cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEis), Memantine, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and anti-epileptic drugs, were considered in AD patients. MCI subjects were under no medical treatment. EEG recording. The EEG was recorded in the morning. The patients and their caregivers were interviewed about the quality and length of the last sleep as well as about the last meal. During the EEG recording, subjects sat in a comfortable, eye-closed resting state, but did not fall asleep, as confirmed by the EEG experts who continuously monitored the EEG traces so that any sleep pattern could be promptly detected. The EEG segments affected by artifacts were marked by the EEG experts and later discarded. The EEG was recorded according to the standard 10-20 International System with the following set up: 19-channels montage (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T3, T4, T5, T6, Fz, Cz and Pz), sampling frequency of 1024 Hz, notch filter at 50 Hz and linked earlobe (A1-A2) reference. EEG preprocessing. The n-channel EEG recording was band-pass filtered at 0.5 -32 Hz through the eegfiltfft function implemented in the Matlab toolbox EEGLab ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>) which is based on the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).</p><p>Every EEG signal was downsampled to 256 Hz and then partitioned into M non-overlapping epochs (of 5 sec length), since f s =256 Hz, each epoch included N=1280 samples. Therefore, for every subject under consideration, the recorded epochs EEG ε (ε = 1, 2, .., M ), sized n x N, were stored on a computer and processed one at a time. The average EEG length, after artefactual segments rejection, was 4.1 min.</p></div>

The conventional estimate of PSD is known as periodogram. It is a nonparametric evaluation of PSD that represents the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function. Specifically, the periodogram of a signal x l of length L, is defined as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (f ) = T s L | L-1 l=0 x l e -2πif l | 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where -1 2Ts &lt; f ≤ 1 2Ts and T s is the sampling interval. When the input time-series is multiplied by a window function w l , the modified periodogram is obtained:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (f ) = T s L | L-1 l=0 w l x l e -2πif l | 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The modified periodogram smooths the edges of the signal under analysis and minimize the spectral leakage in the standard periodogram. Here, the PSD of the x th EEG time series, was computed by using the modified periodogram with rectangular windowing function, as it achieves good resolution and is well-suited for biomedical signals analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">2-d Spectral Representation (PSD-image)</head><p>In this study, the EEG spectral profiles are instead represented as images and advanced ML techniques (CNN) are employed to carry out the automatic features extraction and classification. Given the P SD ε matrix under analysis, the p i,j (with i=1,..19; j=1,..,159) element was mapped into an intensity value ranged between 0 -1 (where 0 (black pixel) and 1 (white pixel) correspond to the minimum and maximum of the P SD ε matrix, respectively) coming up with a 2-d gray scale image. Such PSD-images were firstly evaluated by visual inspection: they looked generally dark with bright bars at the frequencies corresponding to PSD peaks. This property was due to the inherent sparse nature of P SD ε matrix. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows an example of the conversion of a matrix P SD ε (every row represents the PSD vs frequency profile of a given channel) into 2-d spectral representation. The epoch belongs to a HC. As can be observed, it exhibits a white vertical bar at 8-12 Hz (alpha band), typically observed in the eye-closed resting state EEG of healthy subjects. However, it is to be noted that the PSDimages of the epochs of the same patient can vary, due to the non-stationarity of the EEG signals, the possible presence of artifacts or unexpected electrical patterns. Such abnormalities affect the PSD-images, which may cause errors in the classification process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Convolutional Neural Network</head><p>A standard CNN is composed of two main building blocks: a feature extractor, which extracts features from raw data automatically through one or multiple stages of convolution, activation and pooling layers; and a fully connected multilayer neural network which performs the classification task by using the features learned previously. The details of each level are now described briefly. Convolution Layer. Let X i ∈ R hxw be the 2d-input maps and let K j ∈ R k1xk2 be the weights matrices called kernels (or filters). The convolution operation is expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">Y j = X i * K j + B j<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where B j is the bias term and * denotes the convolution operator. The j th filter convolves with a local region of X i (called receptive field ) and then it slides over the whole input map with a stride s by sharing the same set of weights. The output Y j of each filter is referred as features map and its size is y 1 x y 2 where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y 1 = h -k 1 + 2 × p s + 1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y 2 = w -k 2 + 2 × p s + 1<label>(5)</label></formula><p>p is the zero padding parameter and it is typically used to control the output size by padding the input edges with zeros. In this study the zero padding was applied and p was set to 1 so that the input and output spatial resolution are the same. Activation Layer. It consists of a nonlinear transfer function which usually follows the convolutional layer. In standard Neural Networks, sigmoid</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(f (x) = A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 1 1+e -x ) or hyperbolic tangent (f (x) = tanh(x)</formula><p>) are widely employed as activation functions. Since recent studies have proved that a novel function called "Rectified Linear Units" (ReLu, f (x) = max(0, x)) provides better performance in terms of generalization and learning time <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> especially in CNN applications, also in the architecture proposed it was applied to Y j feature maps extracted from the previous layer.</p><p>Pooling Layer. It reduces the resolution of the input feature maps (Y j ) by taking the average (average pooling) or maximum (max pooling) of neighbour elements selected with a filter sized k1 x k2 . The filter scans the features map with stride s producing an sub-sampled representation of Y j sized ỹ1 x ỹ2 , where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ỹ1 = y 1 - k s + 1<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ỹ2 = y 2 - k s + 1<label>(7)</label></formula><p>w ith k = k1 = k2 . Although the average pooling reduces the spatial dimension, similarly to max pooling, it propagates the mean of all the input values selected by the filter to the subsequent layer. As the main objective is to detect the PSD peak (that is the maximum spectral value) in the image, the average pooling operator could also take into account those features that may not be important. Furthermore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> Scherer et al. showed empirically that the max pooling operation was significantly superior because it captures better invariant features and improves generalization performance. For these reasons, in this study, max pooling was chosen as sub-sampling operator.</p><p>Fully Connected Layer. The convolution (+ ReLu) and pooling layers are followed by one or more fully connected layers (FC). The neurons of this layer are connected to every unit of the previous layer as a standard NN. The output size of the last FC is equal to the number of possible classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Architecture Proposed</head><p>The architecture of the CNN proposed is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. The network is designed to accept fixed-size images n x F (where n=19, number of EEG channels; F=159, number of frequencies ranged 0.5-32 Hz). The number of filters (K) and its size (k 1 x k 2 ), have been chosen empirically after several experimental tests. Here, the convolutional layer (Conv 1 ) has K=16 learnable filters sized 3 x 3. Each filter convolves with the input image with a stride s=1, producing 16 features maps with the same input size 19 x 159. Indeed, according to Eq. 4, 5:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">y 1 = h -k 1 + 2 × p s + 1 = 19 -3 + 2 × 1 1 + 1 = 19<label>(8)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">y 2 = w -k 2 + 2 × p s + 1 = 159 -3 + 2 × 1 1 + 1 = 159 (9) A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>At this stage the CNN has W conv = K x k 1 x k 2 = 16 x 3 x 3 = 144 weights and B conv = 16 biases, for a grand total of 144 + 16 = 160 learnable parameters. The convolutional layer is followed firstly by the ReLu and then by the max pooling layer (MaxPool 1 ) which reduces the features maps size from 19 x 159 to 9 x 79 by using 3 x 3 filters with a stride s=2. Indeed, according to Eq. 6, 7:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ỹ1 = y 1 - k s + 1 = 19 -3 2 + 1 = 9 (10) and ỹ2 = y 2 - k s + 1 = 159 -3 2 + 1 = 79<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The features extracted are the input of a FC layer with U F C =300 hidden units.</p><p>The number of weights W conv-F C depends on the output size of the previous convolutional layer (ỹ 1 x ỹ2 ), the number of filters (K) and the number of hidden units in the FC (U F C ); indeed, W conv-F C = ỹ1 x ỹ2 x K x U F C = 9 x 79 x 16 x 300 = 3412800 weights. In this case, the number of parameters is 3412800 + 300 (biases)= 3413100. The network ends with a soft-max (SF) layer to estimate the class predictions in binary and three way classification. In this layer, the number of weights (W SF ) depends on number of neurons of the previous FC layer (U F C ) and number of neurons of the SF layer (U SF ); consequently, W SF = U F C x U SF = 300 x 2 = 600 weights for the 2-ways classification and W SF = U F C x U SF = 300 x 3 = 900 weights for the 3-ways classification. As an example, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref> reports the overall number of learnable parameters of the 2-ways classifier. </p></div>

However, in order to exploit higher features levels and to find out the optimal CNN configuration, additional processing layers were tested. Specifically, a second convolutional layer (Conv 2 ) followed by ReLu and max poling layer (MaxPool 2 ) was added in the CNN 1 model described in Subsection 4.1, coming up with a CNN 2 model. In the second convolution, 32 kernels of size 3 x 3, stride s=1 and padding parameter p=1 were used, producing 32 features maps of size 9 x 79. Then, the max pooling layer with window size 2 x 2 and s=2 produced 32 features maps sized 4 x 39. Finally, the features extracted 32 x 4 x 39=4992 were the input of a fully connected layer with 300 hidden units followed by a soft-max layer employed to estimate the class predictions in the 2-ways and 3-ways classification. The reason why additional layers did not impact well on the performance may be due to the sparsity of the PSD spectrograms, described in Section 3.2. PSDimages were indeed characterized a widespread darkness with sharp bright bars related to PSD peaks, an example is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. Furthermore, PSD-images are inherently simple, the dataset of three groups essentially differ in the number, positioning and width of the bright bars. An increased complexity in the structure of the CNN may therefore cause overfitting, taking into account the limited size of the database here analyzed. It is worth to be noted that the small feature maps (sized 4 x 39) extracted from MaxPool 2 did not allow to add further convolutional layers and test deeper convolutional networks.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 5.1.1.</formula><p>Comparison with standard classifiers (MLP -SVM -LDA) based on raw PSD In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach, the architecture (CNN 1 ) was compared with three baseline machine learning techniques: Multi Layer Percerptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine with linear kernel (l-SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Given the i th (i =1,2..,117) EEG recording, for every epoch ε, the ε th PSD-image, sized 19 x 159, was flattened into a 1-d vector sized 1 x 3021 (1-d PSD input). Afterwards, the 1-d PSD inputs were fed into the MLP, l-SVM and LDA classifiers to identify EEG patterns of AD, MCI and HC. Three MLP classifiers were trained and tested: MLP 1 classifier with one hidden layer of 1510 neurons; MLP 2 classifier with two hidden layers of 1510 and 755 neurons, respectively; MLP 3 classifier with three hidden layers of 1510, 755 and 300 neurons, respectively. All MLP classifiers were followed by a softmax output layer to perform the binary or 3-way classification. The topology of the classifiers was chosen empirically after several experimental tests. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> reports the epoch-based test results of CNN 1 , MLP 1 , MLP 2 , MLP 3 , l-SVM and LDA classifiers in terms of F-measure (which includes also precision and recall information) and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN 1 outperformed the other approaches in all classifications (AD vs HC, AD vs MCI, MCI vs HC and AD vs MCI vs HC), achieving an accuracy up to 89.8% in 2-ways classifier and 83.3% in 3-ways classifier. This result was confirmed also by the analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) for the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). As can be observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>, the CNN 1 classifier shows the highest AUC value in each scenario (AD vs HC, AD vs MCI, MCI vs HC and AD vs MCI vs HC). Specifically, it is to be noted that the CNN 1 achieved better AUC values in the most challenging classifications, AD vs MCI and AD vs MCI vs HC with AUC of 0.93 and 0.94, respectively. 5.1.2. Comparison with standard classifiers (MLP -SVM -LDA) trained on handcrafted features extracted from PSD The proposed CNN 1 was also compared with standard classifiers trained on quantitative features manually extracted from the PSD spectrograms. Spectral features, relevant to the analysis of AD/MCI EEGs, were computed to be used as input to standard MLP, l-SVM and LDA classifiers. Specifically, given the i th (i =1,2..,117) EEG recording, for each ε th epoch under analysis, nine relevant  discriminating spectral features of the EEG were computed: -The ratio α 3 /α 2 was introduced by Moretti et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> as a prognotic value for MCI to AD conversion; -The ratios θ/(α+β 1 ) and (δ+θ)/(α+β 1 +β 2 ) were introduced by Bennys et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> to discriminate between AD and healthy controls; -Transition Frequency (TF) and Individual alpha frequency (IAF), defined as the minimun power in the theta band and the maximum peak in the alpha frequency range, respectively, were introduced to discriminate mild AD from healthy elderly scontrols <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref> reports the epoch-based test results of the proposed CNN 1 and MLP 1 , l-SVM and LDA classifiers in terms of F-measure and accuracy. Among the conventional classifiers the MLP 1 (with one hidden layer and five hidden neurons) outperformed the l-SVM and LDA classifiers, achieving average accuracy rate up to 75.42% in binary classification and only 59.40% in AD vs MCI vs HC classification. However, as can be observed, the proposed CNN 1 outperformed the MLP 1 and subsequently the SVM and LDA classifiers in all comparisons. Similar outcomes were achieved by the analysis of AUC reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>where the CNN 1 classifier showed the highest AUC value in AD vs HC (0.97), AD vs MCI (0.93), MCI vs HC (0.97) and AD vs MCI vs HC (0.94) classifications. This result has confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach over conventional classifiers based on the handcrafted extraction of spectral features from the PSD of EEG signals. The PSD spectrogram, taken as a whole, seems to carry more information than a set of features extracted from it, even though relevant features. PSD-images indeed display the behaviour of EEG over the frequency and over the channels (the i-th row of the PSD-image represents the PSD vs freq profile of the i-th EEG signal) in this way describing the behaviour of EEGs over frequency and over space. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Patient-based Classification</head><p>Since CNN 1 classifier showed the best performances in the epoch-based classification (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>, 5), it was employed to perform the patient-based classification that estimates the probability that patient j th belongs to class AD, MCI or CNT, depending on how his/her epochs were labelled by the classifier. Specifically, given the j th (j =1,2..,72) EEG recording, the PSD-images (i.e. EEG epochs) were extracted and fed into the CNN 1 classifier. If the number of images classified as c (for example, AD) was larger than 50%, then the j th EEG recording was labeled as belonging to c class (i.e. AD). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref> shows the results of the overall patient classification analysis. The AD vs HC classifier was able to correctly classify 23 AD patients out of 24 and 15 HC subjects out of 24, respectively. In the AD vs MCI classification, only 11 out of 24 AD patients were correctly discriminated as AD, whereas 13 were misclassified as MCI. This is probably related to the different stages of AD and MCI included in the present database. Similarly, 11 out of 24 MCI patients were correctly classified. Good performances were obtained also in the MCI vs HC discrimination: 12 out of 24 HC subjects and 18 out of 24 MCI patients were correctly classified, respectively. Finally, the 3-way classifier reported acceptable results: 13 AD, 5 MCI and 11 HC were properly classified.  </p></div>

Indeed, the proposed CNN 1 performed very well both in binary and three ways classification, even when additional hidden layers are taken into account. Specifically, the number of learnable parameters in CNN 1 was more than 3 millions with an average computational cost of 2024 secs. When the second convolutional layer was added (CNN 2 ) the learnable parameters were about 1.5 millions but the computational cost was of 5434 secs. It is to be noted that, in this study, the increasing of computational complexity (and consequently of computational cost) led to a reduction of performances in the dementia stages classification. Hence, CNN 1 was experimentally determined as the optimal trade-off in terms of processing and classification performance. Moreover, experimental results have shown that the proposed CNN 1 classifier outperforms conventional MLP, SVM and LDA classifiers not only when raw PSD-images are used as input but also when handcrafted features (manually extracted from spectral profiles) are used. This result has confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed PSD-based CNN rather than conventional machine learning techniques and might represent a remarkable breakthrough in realworld clinical applications. However, the proposed method suffers from some limitations. The major limitation lies in the nonstationarity of the EEG epochs of each patient under analysis, which, of course, reflects upon the variability of the PSD-images. In fact, when the CNN attempts to discriminate epochs of the same patient, some of them are misclassified mainly because of the position of power peaks in the frequency domain. A normal subject in a resting eyes-closed condition is characterized by a dominant activity in the alpha rhythm, especially in the parieto-occipital area. This is clearly visible in the spectral domain, where a peak in the alpha band, which corresponds to a white vertical line in the 2-d gray scale image, can be observed. The presence of artifacts, the unexpected lack of the dominant peak in alpha or a shifting towards low-frequencies (typically observed in the spectra of AD or MCI patients), may lead to the misclassification</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T of that epoch. Similarly, epochs of an AD (or MCI) patient may not have steady PSD characteristics, resulting in a high variability of the PSD-images over the time. Moreover, the differences between the PSD of AD and MCI patients can be very mild, due to the fact that AD develops gradually thus, for example, a mild AD could have frequency characteristics more similar to MCI than to severe AD. This clarifies why CNN failed in classifying correctly all of the epochs of the same subject (AD, MCI or HC) causing a performance deterioration in the overall patient classification (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref>).</p></div>

Nevertheless, the proposed classification system remains deficient in the patient-based classification. (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref>). The findings suggest that the power spectral analysis is not enough to detect the anomalies of EEG recording, but we believe that DL techniques can identify a significant set of variables that may support clinicians in the diagnosis of AD.</p><p>In the future the proposed PSD-based CNN architecture will be trained by using more powerful graphic processing units (GPU) in order to optimize the training times. A larger cohort of AD/MCI/HC subjects will be taken into account to further demonstrate and fully exploit the generalization potential of deep learning techniques in clinical applications. Classifications over the average PSD-image of whole EEG recordings will also be analyzed, since such as approach is likely to reduce the effects of epoch variability. In addition, different methods to map the spectral characteristics of the EEG, that may be more sensitive to the specific characteristics of AD or MCI patients, will be investigated. Finally, motivated by the preliminary, though promising results obtained in this paper, using limited available clinical data, future works will explore integrating the EEG-based CNN model proposed in this paper, with contextual processing of volumetric medical images <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> of the patient's brain. This will lead to development of a more personalized, context-aware and multi-modal diagnostic system.</p></div>

Deep Learning (DL) is an emerging machine learning technique able to automatically learn latent discriminating variables (f eatures) from the input data automatically. DL overcomes the limitations that come with standard learning algorithms: in principle, it allows to bypass the handcrafted feature extraction process. The visual inspection of PSD of the EEG recordings is a common practice to investigate anomalies in the spectrum of patients affected by AD. Accordingly one of the main contributions of this study was developing an innovative method based on spectral representation of EEG data.
