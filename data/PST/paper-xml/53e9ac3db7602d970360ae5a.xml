<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Open source software (OSS) development is relatively new. The initiative sprang from the idea that software should be free and open instead of sold or licensed as precompiled binary code. OSS normally guarantees free access to the source code, so that users can fix bugs or make modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. OSS is usually developed by a community of voluntary participants that are geographically dispersed and communicate through the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Today, OSS is significantly influencing the software industry and society. Some successful open source programs, like Linux, Apache and Mozilla, are widely used by commercial companies, government organizations and individual users. Many companies are adopting open source as a new software development organization form <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Unlike commercial software, OSS is usually developed by volunteers who participate in OSS projects for such reasons as reputation building, fun, or skill learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The developers' voluntary participation is an essential part of OSS development <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Involvement plays an important role in inducing an individual to participate, since a highly involved person believes that a project, job, or product has great importance and relevance. OSS development takes an Internet-based community as its organizational form, but the project administrator does not have formal control over the behavior of the developers, and thus their voluntary contribution and performance depends on self-initiatives. Therefore, in the context of OSS development, a developer's involvement was expected to be very important. The purpose of our study was to investigate the role of involvement on the developer's performance in an open source project and to investigate its antecedents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theory and research model</head><p>OSS development is significantly different from traditional software development in both organization and process. Open source project communities occur when an individual or a group contributes an initial functional prototype of the software. People then examine the prototype and may merely adopt it or work collaboratively to continue developing it <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The persons starting the project usually become the project leaders or administrators; then a successful project community grows as more and more people are attracted into the project. Members play different roles:</p><p>(1) the project leaders are in charge and maintain the versions; (2) core developers perform most of the software development and maintenance, including creating patches, adding features, and fixing bugs; (3) peripheral developers report bugs, suggest new features, and occasionally contribute code. There are also many passive end users, who only utilize the OSS without contributing to its development, but they are important in assessing its popularity.</p><p>The software evolves through rapid development iterations. In the development process, the core developers offer most of the contributions and perform most of the development work. After they submit a code patch, it is reviewed by the project leader to see whether it should be accepted. Then the source code is tested and reviewed by the peripheral members and their reports and requests are reviewed by the leaders and core members as ways to further improve the software.</p><p>The core developers' contributions are critical to the success of software development. We chose them as the target for study. Our research model placed them at the focal point of the study, and included performance as the consequence of their involvement. We proposed and tested antecedent factors, including developer's individual motivations (personal software needs, reputation and skills gaining, enjoyment in open source coding), and important community factors (leadership effectiveness, interpersonal relationship, and community ideology). The research model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Involvement</head><p>Involvement reflects an individual's beliefs or feelings about an object. It has been used to describe a subjective psychological state reflecting the importance and personal relevance of an issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, of an advertisement or product <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, or of an individual's job <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It has been studied extensively in various contexts; for example, Lodahl and Kejner <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> defined job involvement as the ''extent to which employees psychologically identify with their job, or the degree of importance of the job'', while Barki and Hartwick <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> defined it in IS development as ''a subjective state, reflecting the importance and personal relevance of a new system''. We defined the voluntary developer's involvement as ''a belief that the open source project in which he or she was participating was both important and personally relevant.'' Involvement is different from participation. It is a psychological state while participation refers to actions and individual efforts. Indeed, involvement is often a determinant of the level of participation and is related to the degree to which a person is engaged with a task or object. Thus, highly involved individuals perform better because they believe the tasks are more important and personally relevant, and therefore put much effort into their performance.</p><p>In the context of OSS projects, in which project leaders normally have little formal authority to control the behaviors of the volunteers, the developer's involvement is very important in inducing knowledge contribution to the project. We defined the OSS developer's performance as ''the amount and quality of knowledge contributed to the project.'' By being involved, the developer is likely to be more motivated to identify problems and fix them, will be more curious about aspects of the system, and will be more likely to attend to other developer inputs. In short, the psychological engagement that constitutes involvement will be associated with more interaction between the details of the project and the developer's own knowledge and skills. Accordingly, we hypothesized:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis (1).</head><p>A voluntary developer's involvement in an open source project is positively related to the developer's performance. The more involved the developer is, the higher the performance in the project.</p><p>We investigated two primary sources of factors that determined the level of a developer's involvement: individual motivations of the developer and community factors that could serve to encourage or deter the developer.</p><p>The first of these, individual motivations, are factors that motivate a person to be an OSS developer. The motivational factors we found in prior literature were software needs, reputation and skills enhancement, and enjoyment in open source coding. We did not include financial incentives because the work we studied was voluntary and financial incentives, such as obtaining a better job, would be secondary effects derived from reputation enhancement and skills learned.</p><p>The second category arises from the fact that OSS development has online community as its organizational form. The community factors we found were leadership effectiveness, interpersonal relationship, and community ideology. These are situational factors that affect how extensively a developer wants to be involved in a project. Therefore, in our model, factors from two major factors, individual motivational and community, were included as antecedents to voluntary developer involvement in an open source project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Individual motivations</head><p>Prior studies have reported that multiple factors (such as, expectation of increased reputation and skills, personal software need, and enjoyment of coding) motivated open source participation, but developers were not equally motivated by these factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The variances in motivations were expected to influence the level of involvement of the volunteers in a specific open source project. A person who was better motivated would regard the project as more personally relevant and more important, which would result in more involvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Software needs</head><p>Many volunteers participate in open source projects because they personally need the software being developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The presence of personal software needs was thus expected to influence a developer's feeling that the project was more important and relevant. Hence:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis (2).</head><p>A voluntary developer's personal software need is positively related to the developer's involvement in the OSS project. The more the developer needed the software, the more he or she was involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Reputation and skills gaining</head><p>The possibility of enhancing one's reputation is an important motivator for voluntary knowledge contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. In the context of open source, the reputation gained from project participation may help the developer's future work opportunities. In addition, many persons participate because they can learn software skills through working with others. Such expectation influences an individual to take part in OSS development. The developer thus has a greater level of involvement and</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis (3).</head><p>A voluntary developer's expectation for reputation building and skills learning is positively related to the developer's involvement in the OSS project. The more the developer wants to gain reputation and skills, the more he or she would be involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Enjoyment in open source coding</head><p>Intrinsic psychological rewards, such as joy or enjoyment also affect human behavior. Individuals who experience immediate pleasure or joy from an activity are likely to involve themselves more extensively in it. Researchers have found that enjoyment sustains individuals' community involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Many people participate in OSS development because they think open source coding is enjoyable. Thus, a developer who enjoys it is more likely to consider the project as important and relevant, which means a greater level of involvement; thus:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis (4).</head><p>A voluntary developer's enjoyment in open source coding is positively related to the developer's involvement in the OSS project. The more enjoyable the developer believes open source coding is, the more he or she is involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Community factors</head><p>As a special form of social community, an open source project effort is an online social environment in which community characteristics can influence participant behaviors. We chose three types of community factors as antecedents to participants' involvement: leadership effectiveness, interpersonal relationships, and ideology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Leadership effectiveness</head><p>Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> suggested that success of a virtual community may be obtained through positive ''interference'' or support from managers. In an online community environment, the leader's enthusiasm towards the members contributes to their positive attitude, and consequently their involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In the open source context, voluntary developers work for a sense of achievement and recognition of their participation. Support, respect, and recognition from project administrators were expected to affect the participants' attitudes about the project, including their view of it as more important and relevant. Thus:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Hypothesis (5).</formula><p>Leadership effectiveness in the open source project is positively related to a voluntary developer's involvement in the project. The higher the leadership effectiveness, the more the developer was involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Interpersonal relationship</head><p>It has been empirically confirmed that interpersonal trust significantly affects the performance of collaboration in a virtual environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, since trust facilitates cooperation and knowledge sharing which is critical to innovation and learning. In virtual communities, formation of interpersonal relationships between members is important in generating positive attitudes, and thus forming the feeling of belonging and attachment to the community as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The social ties among members can promote participants' contribution and performance in open content communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Therefore, it was reasonable to believe that a developer's relationship with others would influence his or her feelings of importance and relevance of the project. We hypothesized:</p><p>Hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>Interpersonal relationship in the open source project community is positively related to a voluntary developer's involvement in the project. The greater the interpersonal relationship the developer feels towards others in the same project, the more he or she would be involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Ideology</head><p>The similarity-attraction paradigm suggests that people with similar attitudes, beliefs, and values are likely to become attached to one another; they join organizations whose general core or dominant values are the same as theirs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Shared values bind members in the community by reflecting the similarity among them: in the open source context, the ideology of the project community was important to the behavior of participants and thus to the outcome of the project <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Ideology can influence participants' sense of belonging and their view that the project was important and relevant. Thus we hypothesized: Hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>Ideology of the open source project community is related to a voluntary developer's involvement in the project. The more the developer shares the ideology, the more he or she was involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sampling procedure</head><p>Our target was the behavior of voluntary developers in open source projects; data were collected using a Web survey. Open source projects were selected from Sourceforge.net, which provides free hosting to tens of thousands of open source projects and is an online centralized platform for open source developers to meet for OSS development. The projects covered a wide variety of topics, including Internet communication, multimedia, database, games, etc. We selected one of the most popular types: Internet communication. To ensure that the selected projects had not been abandoned, only active ongoing projects were included in our sample: the projects were required to have some activity in the month before data collection by contributions to the code repository, requests for bug fixes, support, patches, or features. Since our research was related to social relational factors only open source projects with at least three participants were eligible for inclusion in our study. One hundred thirty five projects met these criteria. The projects were in various development phases, and had different license types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Construct measures</head><p>A developer's performance was defined as ''the amount and quality of knowledge contribution.'' A developer's contribution can be measured as the number of code patches made and accepted in the project. However, due to the differences in the size and complexity of patches, this number may not be a good measure. A second measure could be the number of lines of code produced in a given time; but to account for potential productivity differences between programming languages, the number of code lines in each patch had to be converted to some other unit and we used function points by converting from lines of code using standard language conversion factors. Thus, a developer's performance was measured by the number of function points made and accepted into the project during the observed time period.</p><p>Other constructs in the model were assessed using multiple items and were based on well-established scales from IS, social psychology, and organizational behavior. Some minor modifications or adaptations were made to them to fit our context. We used a 7-point Likert scale for all items. Those for involvement were developed and adapted from Hartwick and Barki <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; items for software needs were developed and adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>; items for reputation and skills gaining were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>; items for enjoyment are adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>; items for leadership effectiveness are adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>; items for interpersonal relationship are adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>; and items for ideology were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Control variables</head><p>Previous literature suggested that work experience and education might affect knowledge contribution behavior. In some studies of OSS development, developers' experience and education were treated as control variables when investigating motivational factors and their effect on developers' participation and performance. In our study, education and experience were treated as control variables when testing for the influence of involvement on performance. For these two control variables, education was measured by the highest academic degree held by the developer, while experience was measured by number of years performing software development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Data collection</head><p>Data were collected through an online survey and by searching project archives. On Sourceforge.net, each developer was uniquely identified with a user account, and the developer's performance was assessed through the number of function points accepted by the project in a certain time period, obtained through conversion and calculation from the project's code repository. Data for other constructs were obtained from the developers' response to the online survey. To make sure that the survey questions could be understood correctly by the potential respondents, and to estimate the response rate, a pilot study was first conducted. Ten projects with 136 developers were chosen from the 135 projects. As a result of the analysis of this pilot study, some minor changes were made to the survey.</p><p>The selected 135 ongoing projects had a total of 1385 developers, who became the pool of respondents for our study. The email address of each developer was obtained from the project web pages and an email invitation was sent to each of them. The content explained the purpose of our research and invited the recipient to help by responding to the Web survey. In order to obtain a higher response rate, a week after the initial solicitation, an email reminder was sent to ask them to respond if they had not already done so. Altogether 373 emails were automatically returned due to incorrect addresses or security protection. Thus, 1012 emails were believed to have reached potential respondents. By the end of the data collection, 178 responses were received. Six of these were invalid due to missing answers, so a total of 172 responses were usable in our analysis. The responses were from developers in 75 different projects, each of which had one or more responders. These open source projects were in various phases of development, were of different size (from a standpoint of number of developers) and had different license types (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The developers in the sample varied in gender, age, education, and differed in software development and open source project participation experience (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>The response rate was 17%. Non-response bias was estimated using the extrapolation method, which is based on the assumption that subjects who respond slowly were more like non-respondents than respondents. There were two waves of responses in our study, the first followed the first round of invitations, and the second followed the reminder emails. Responses from the two waves were compared, and no significant differences were found. This indicated that the respondents represented the whole sample, and thus we assumed that the analyzed results could be generalized to the entire population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data analysis</head><p>We used the partial least squares (PLS) method for data analysis. It is a structural equation modeling technique that simultaneously assesses the reliability and validity of the measures of constructs and estimates the relationships among them. We used PLS-Graph Version 3.00 in this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Measurement model</head><p>We followed the recommended two-stage analytical procedure.</p><p>To validate the measurement model, two types of validity were assessed: convergent and discriminant. We assessed the first by examining composite reliability and average variance extracted from the measures. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the composite reliability values ranged from 0.88 to 0.96, which were greater than 0.7 and thus indicated reliable constructs while the average variance extracted by a measure, a score of 0.5 indicates acceptability. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that the average variances extracted range from 0.72 to 0.88, which were above the acceptability value.</p><p>To evaluate discriminant validity, the square roots of average variance extracted were compared with the correlations among the latent variables. The results in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> confirmed the discriminant validity: the square root of the average variance extracted for each construct was greater than the correlations involving the construct.</p><p>A second way to evaluate convergent and discriminant validity was to examine the factor loadings of each indicator; each indicator should load higher on the construct of interest than on any other factors. The loadings of the constructs are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>. They were greater than 0.70, which indicated a good convergent and discriminant validity. The final constructs and items are shown in the Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Structural model</head><p>Eight factors were studied: performance, involvement, software needs, reputation and skills, enjoyment, leadership effectiveness, interpersonal relationship, and ideology. Two factors, education and experience, were included as control variables. With an adequate measurement model, the hypotheses were tested with PLS. The results are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Discussion</head><p>The results showed that a voluntary developer's involvement in an open source project had a significant effect on performance at the (P &lt; 0.01) level. This indicated that in the online communitybased OSS development context, the developer's involvement was critical to the knowledge contribution. Furthermore, the individual  motivations and community factors explained 70% of the total variance in developer's involvement. In the individual motivational factors, developer's personal needs for the software had a significant effect on involvement in the project at the P &lt; 0.01 level, the developer's expectation of reputation and skills gains, and his or her enjoyment in open source coding had significant effect on involvement at the P &lt; 0.1 level. These results parallel findings of previous studies. We also found that a developer's personal needs for the software was more important to involvement in the project than the prospect of reputation enhancement or enjoyment (significant at P &lt; 0.1). Interpersonal relationship and leadership effectiveness in the project community had  significant effects on developer's involvement at the P &lt; 0.01 level, and community ideology had significant effect on a developer's involvement at the P &lt; 0.05 level. Therefore, the project members were influenced by the community environment, and the quality of an open source project community was important in promoting the project members' involvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Our research applied the theory of involvement to explain OSS developers' performance. It confirmed that involvement was a critical factor and found that it was affected by individual motivational factors, including personal software needs, expected reputation and skills gained from participation, and perceived enjoyment. Also involvement was positively affected by project community factors, including leadership effectiveness, interpersonal relationships, and community ideology.</p><p>Promoting voluntary developer involvement was very important. Project leaders could influence the software development outcome by taking action to attract and retain volunteers with strong motivation. Project leaders could also demonstrate leadership effectiveness, fostering interpersonal relationships, and exploiting community ideology, specifically by facilitating communications, resolving conflict, and enhancing trust.</p><p>There were some limitations to our study; the most noticeable was in the external validity of the results beyond specially defined and selected samples. To assess the external validity, the respondents and the setting in which the study was conducted needed to be evaluated. Although Sourceforge.net had the largest number of open source projects, some big ones, like Linux and Mozilla, have their own Websites and were not included in our study. In addition, only ongoing projects were considered, so projects that had failed or were already completed were not included.</p><p>The respondents were not randomly sampled from the entire population of open source participants and the responses were purely voluntary, so there may have been response bias. However, the set of ongoing projects selected for our study covered a wide range of topics, license types, and development stages. This enhanced the generalizability of our findings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
