<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a well-known and complex combinatorial problem, which has received considerable attention in recent years. This problem has been addressed using many different techniques including both exact and heuristic methods. The VRPTW benchmark problems of Solomon [Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints, Operations Research 1987; 35(2): 254-65] have been most commonly chosen to evaluate and compare all algorithms. Results from exact methods have been improved considerably because of parallel implementations and modern branch-and-cut techniques. However, 24 out of the 56 high order instances from Solomon's original test set still remain unsolved. Additionally, in many cases a prohibitive time is needed to find the exact solution. Many of the heuristic methods developed have proved to be efficient in identifying good solutions in reasonable amounts of time. Unfortunately, whilst the research efforts based on exact methods have been focused on the total travel distance, the focus of almost all heuristic attempts has been on the number of vehicles. Consequently, it is more difficult to compare and take advantage of the strong points from each approach. This paper proposes a robust heuristic approach for the VRPTW using travel distance as the main objective through an efficient genetic algorithm and a set partitioning formulation. The tests were produced using real numbers and truncated data type, allowing a direct comparison of its results against previously published heuristic and exact methods. Furthermore, computational results show that the proposed heuristic approach outperforms all previously known and published heuristic methods in terms of the minimal travel distance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) has been extensively studied in the operations research community. Firstly, because VRPTW is still one of the most difficult problems in combinatorial optimization and consequently presents a great challenge. Secondly, in a more practical aspect, this problem contributes directly to a real opportunity to reduce costs in the important area of logistics. Transportation management, and more specifically vehicle routing, has a considerable economical impact on all logistic systems. In the VRPTW, a fleet of K identical vehicles supplies goods to N customers. All vehicles have the same capacity Q. For each customer i, i =1, . . . , N, the demand of goods, q i , the service time s i , and the time window [a i , b i ] to meet the demand in i are known. The component s i represents the loading or unloading service time at the customer i and a i describes the earliest time when it is possible to start the service. If any vehicle arrives at customer i before a i it must wait. The vehicle must start the customer service before b i . This type of time window constraints is known as a hard time window. All vehicle routes start and finish at the central depot. Each customer must be visited once. The locations of the central depot and all customers, the minimal distance d ij and the travel time t ij between all locations are given. The objective is to find the feasible solution with the minimal total travel distance or with the minimal number of vehicles. In this paper, only the first objective is considered.</p><p>Significant improvements in Solomon's benchmark problem instances were established by Rochat <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> using a tabu search metaheuristic method. In that publication (1995), Rochat improved or reached 47 heuristic solutions from 56 Solomon's original instances. Another important characteristic is the postoptimization technique used by Rochat. This technique consists of saving all partial solutions identified during the tabu search algorithm for future usage. The routes of each intermediate solution are included in a set T. Then, after the stop criterion of tabu search has been achieved, the best solution that can be built using routes from T may be found by solving a set partitioning problem using CPLEX MIP software. Although Rochat has minimized the travel distance (TD) for the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), their results for the Solomon's test (VRPTW) were obtained using the number of vehicles (NV) as the first objective.</p><p>In general, when heuristic methods were used, the number of vehicles was chosen as the first objective and the total TD only as the second. However, considering the results for the Solomon's test problems, the number of vehicles found was the same in many works, so the second objective, TD, was the distinguishing criterion. In fact, NV and TD represent concurrent objectives. Strategies which treat each objective separately in distinguished phases, have reached the best results at the moment in the literature.</p><p>Berger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> have improved some of the results of Solomon's benchmark using parallel twopopulation co-evolution genetic algorithms, Pop1 and Pop2. The objective in Pop1 is to minimize the total distance for a fixed number of vehicles using feasible individual solutions within the population. On the other hand, in Pop2 the individual solutions have the number of vehicles fixed in one unit less than in Pop1, hence in principle they are infeasible solutions. The GA objective in Pop2 is to minimize the total violated time windows. The global objective is primarily to minimize NV and then to minimize TD as a secondary objective. Each time a feasible individual is found in Pop2, the population Pop1 is replaced by Pop2 and the fixed numbers of vehicles considered in both populations are decreased by one. The algorithm ensures that at least one feasible solution is present in Pop1. Therefore the difference in the number of vehicle in Pop1 and Pop2 is always equal to one unit.</p><p>Berger has also tested the algorithm for the classical 56 Solomon's instances. Although there are two parallel evolutions, only one machine was used (Pentium IV 2.4 GHz). The stop criterion was a 1800-second limit for each run. The parameters were adjusted empirically by running the same Solomon's test set before the actual evaluation runs. The parameters were fixed in all instances, except for the clusterized classes C1 and C2. Berger found 6 new results (R108, R110, RC105, RC106, R210 e R211). Currently, three out of these continue to be the best known and published solutions (R108, RC105 e RC106) considering NV as primary objective and TD as secondary objective. One of the most important advantages of this work is the total NV for all 56 instances of Solomon, with 405 vehicles, one of the best results in the literature.</p><p>Homberger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have also presented good results for many Solomon's benchmark problems using two evolutionary meta-heuristic methods in a similar two-stage strategy. Two different heuristic methods were proposed, ES1 and ES2. These heuristic methods reduced the number of vehicles in two class R1 instances (R104 and R112). In the R109 instance, the ES1 strategy still produced a new result, maintaining NV and reducing TD. In the same way, ES2 improved the results of TD in R105 and R107. In the R2 class, five new results were produced by ES1 and three by ES2. The results in the clusterized classes, C1 and C2, were equivalent to the best known for all problems. ES2 still produced two new results for RC1 and two others for RC2, while ES1 produced two other new results for RC2. In total, a set of 20 new results were produced, out of which only 2 still continue to be undefeated.</p><p>Presently, the best results for the Solomon's benchmark problems, using NV as primary objective and TD as secondary objective, are distributed through many publications. They are summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Few papers on heuristic methods have addressed total TD as the first objective to be minimized, as indicated in Rousseau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> the authors seem to compare their primary objective, TD, with results from research efforts in the literature where the focus was on NV, and the specific comparison criteria are not clear.</p><p>While NV was selected in almost all previous efforts based on heuristics, almost all exact works have elected TD as the only objective. In fact, the choice of the most appropriate objective depends on specific rules and peculiarities of each individual business. In Brazil, for example, a significant portion of goods delivering companies have limited the number of vehicles in their own fleet to less or equal to 70% of their actual requirement. Consequently, a large amount of goods are delivered by third-parties, usually small business or even self-employed owners of individual trucks. These third-party companies are generally named "aggregated trucks". The payment rule applied to aggregated trucks is normally based on the total travelled distance. In this case, minimization of the TD is the most attractive and primary objective for the hiring company. Another typical scenario, where the minimization of TD is also appropriate, occurs when the amount of goods is smaller than the total capacity of the available fleet. Consequently, many real-life situations justify the study of new algorithms and techniques to improve the VRPTW results in terms of total travelled distance. The deficiency of heuristic approaches in this direction justifies this effort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The set partitioning model for the VRPTW</head><p>The VRPTW described in the previous section can be formulated as a set partitioning problem (SPP) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min r∈R c r x r (2.1) s.t. r∈R ir x r = 1 ∀i ∈ C (2.2) x r ∈ {0.1} (2.3)</formula><p>where R is the set of routes, C the set of customers, c r the travel distance on the route r, x r the decision variable, 1 if the route r is considered in the solution and 0 otherwise, ir the auxiliary parameters to indicate the set of customers present in each route r, 1 if the customer i is served by the route r and 0 otherwise.</p><p>The search for the optimal integer solution, using the SPP model above, where all possible routes are included in the set R is only possible for instances with a small number of customers. Supposing a problem with 50 customers where time and capacity constraints are sufficient to restrain possible routes up to 10 customers, the number of possible routes is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">10 n=1 50! (50 -n)! ≈ 3.8 × 10 16 (2.4)</formula><p>Consequently, it is not possible for the SPP model to handle directly any MIP algorithm even in instances with 50 customers or less. A common solution is the application of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method which divides the problem into a master problem, with a reduced number of routes, and a secondary problem, where the objective is to find routes (columns) with negative reduced cost to be inserted in the master problem. When no routes with negative reduced cost exist, the solution of the master problem is the solution of the original global problem. The results in the literature show that it continues to be very hard to solve to optimality, despite the fact that decomposition seems to be an option to avoid the increasing number of columns in the original SPP model. Modern branch-and-cut techniques have been used to improve convergence which made possible the identification of new optimal results for previously unsolved VRPTW problems in the literature. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for modern branch-and-cut techniques applied to routing problems. Exact approaches using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition for the VRPTW can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Many problems, as the majority in the classical Solomon's test sets R2 and RC2 continue to be unsolved for 50 and 100 customers. The problems in the real world normally present more than 100 customers which indicated that heuristic methods for the VRPTW are also necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Genetic and set partitioning two-phase algorithm</head><p>The solution framework was motivated by the fact that a local minimum for the VRPTW has a significant possibility of containing routes that are also found in the global optimum. This fact can be confirmed by the comparison of the global optimal results produced by exact methods with many of the reasonable quality results produced by heuristic methods. If several local optimal solutions are produced with reasonable quality, it is possible to join these routes in a set R and then apply the SPP model described in the previous section. If the total number of routes considered in the R set is not large enough, a reasonable amount of time will be required to produce an improved quality solution using R. In addition, the time required to produce some heuristic quality solution, can be smaller than the amount of time required by heuristic methods dedicated to a final solution. This occurs because the amin effort is focused on escaping from local minimal solutions and then on doing fine adjustments to obtain better quality solutions. This idea is not entirely new. Rochat <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has used a similar approach as a post-optimization technique after a tabu search. However, there are new characteristics in the current proposal. First of all, the focus of Rochat's work remained mainly in the quality of the local search result, where the SPP model was used only as a refinement. Using a different approach, a fast genetic algorithm is proposed here as a route generator for the main SPP formulation, where both the amount of time required to identify several local minimal solutions and their diversity are more important than the quality of any single individual solution. Rochat has also mentioned that no significant improvement in the solution was obtained using their post-optimization technique, often less than 1%. The second difference with the current approach is that Rochat used intermediate solutions from a continuous improvement procedure to produce the set of routes for the SPP run against independent and different local minimal solutions. Finally, the objective function used by Rochat is the minimization of the number of vehicles rather than the total travel distance as primary objective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Searching for local minimal solutions</head><p>The objective in the first phase, as summarized above, is to produce high quality routes to be inserted in the SPP model, Eqs. (2.1) to (2.2). However, to find quality routes is normally a hard task. Many classical heuristic methods, like PFIH <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> have been proposed in the literature to produce routes for the VRPTW. If each route is produced independently, without considering the global problem, it is often very difficult that these routes combined can produce a good solution for the whole problem. It seems there is no evident way to evaluate the quality of any distinct route separately. Consequently, desirable routes to be included in the set R of Eq. (2.1), with more chances to produce a nearly optimal solution, are those routes evaluated as part of a complete solution, i.e., those found in a good local minimal solution.</p><p>In order to produce the set of R routes, a fast genetic algorithm was implemented and executed independently many times. Each independent genetic algorithm execution is considered to be an island of evolution, because there is no influence or genetic material interchange between them. The island idea, from the natural evolution theory, is related to a limited set of individuals with more possibility of occurring a crossover and consequently of exchanging their genetic material. As a result, the evolution of each island is completely isolated from each other, enabling the necessary diversity. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for more information about islands in genetic algorithms. Additionally, it is important to distinguish this approach from re-start methods. In the first approach, the solutions from many islands will be combined afterwards to obtain a higher end-quality solution using the SPP model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">The genetic algorithm</head><p>The first algorithms that use a natural evolution as the central strategy to solve problems were published in the 1950s, such as Fraser <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Box <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In 1966, Forgel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed a method called Evolutionary Programming. Following that, in 1973, Rochenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> introduced the method so called Evolution Strategies. The Genetic Algorithm itself, or simply GA, was proposed by Holland <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> in 1975. All these proposals were based in the natural reproduction, selection and evolution of Darwin's th eory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, 1859. Ever since, GA has been popular because it can contribute to find good solutions for complex mathematical problems, like the VRP and other NP-hard problems, in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>A basic GA with a global population substitution was used in this work, as illustrated in the pseudo code of Algorithm 1 The individual representation is very simple. Each customer has a unique integer identifier i, i = 1, . . . , N, where N is the number of customers. The chromosome was defined as a string of integers, representing a route to be served by only one vehicle. An individual, who represents a complete solution, and consequently many routes, is a set of chromosomes. The central depot is not considered in this representation, because all routes necessarily start and end on it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.1.">Initial Population</head><p>A fast and simple heuristic procedure to distribute all customers in the vehicles, if used to obtain the first individual generation, can reduce significantly the GA time necessary to reach the reasonable local minima. Because of this, the heuristic method proposed by Solomon <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, called Push Forward Insertion Heuristic (PFIH), has been frequently used by many researchers with this purpose. For a detailed description of the PFIH method, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In the present work a modified PFIH, called stochastic PFIH, is applied. In the original PFIH, the Eq. (3.1), defines the first customer in each new route. As subsequent customers are chosen one by one minimizing the cost, the original PFIH is totally deterministic. In the proposed stochastic PFIH, a total randomized choice is used to define the first customer to be inserted in each new route. That is necessary to produce distinguished individuals in the first GA generation. After the first customer has been randomly selected, the second one will be the one with the minimal insertion cost. Each feasible customer position in the route in construction is evaluated. A new route is created only if no more customer feasible insertions are possible.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">c i = -d 0i + b i + ((p i /360)d 0i ) (3.1)</formula><p>where is the 0.7 (empirically calculated by Solomon <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>); the 0.1 (empirically calculated by Solomon <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>); the 0.2 (empirically calculated by Solomon <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>); d 0i the distance from customer i to the central depot; b i the upper time window limit to reach the customer i; p i the polar angle of the customer i from the central depot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.2.">Selection</head><p>Through this step, pairs of individuals are selected to crossover. There are many methods proposed in the literature for selection in GAs. The two most popular are roulette wheel selection and tournament selection. In the roulette wheel selection method, the probability of an individual to participate in a crossover is directly proportional to his relative fitness. This method is very sensitive to the evaluation function and almost always some additional control is necessary, for example fitness scaling. In this paper, a k-way tournament selection method is used in the GA. In a k-way tournament, k individuals are selected randomly. Then, the individual who presents the highest fitness is the winner. This process is repeated until the number of selected individuals necessary to the crossover phase has been reached. Two individuals are selected for each crossover, which produces only one new offspring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.3.">Fitness</head><p>The fitness function to evaluate the individuals is always related to the objective function, but not necessarily identical. The inverse of the total travel distance is used to represent the fitness of the individuals, Eq. (3.2).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">fitness = 1 T D . (3.2)</formula><p>3.1.1.4. Crossover In the proposed GA, the search space is limited to the feasible region. Therefore, every individual is always feasible. Consequently, caution is necessary in the crossover and mutation operators, because a simple exchange between two customers can violate time and capacity constraints. Consequently, a more complex operator is necessary to be introduced without bringing a bias in any particular direction. A new crossover strategy is proposed to address the following features:</p><p>• to inherit as many routes as possible from each parent, equally;</p><p>• to avoid high distance routes when adjustments are necessary to inherit them;</p><p>• to avoid excessive customer exchange during the crossover, increasing the function cost;</p><p>• to avoid new individuals with number of vehicles higher than their parents.</p><p>In order to achieve these objectives the crossover operator described in the Algorithm 2 was written: In the first step, the algorithm makes a randomly route choice from each parent individual in turns. After all feasible routes have been inserted in the offspring, the insertion of remainder customers are tested in existing routes (second step). If some customers continue to be unrouted; there is no other option than to insert them in empty vehicles (new routes). In this step, the stochastic PFIH is again applied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Algorithm 2.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.5.">Elitism</head><p>In order to guarantee that GA never retreats in the quality solution, elitism strategy was adopted. This method consists of bringing the best individual from the current population to the next population. However, to enable mutation over the previous selected individual, two copies of this individual are done. The first copy is subject to mutations, while the second remains intact to the next cycle of evaluation, selection and crossover, as showed in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.6.">Mutation</head><p>A total of eight different operators were used in the mutation phase of the GA proposed. The mutation process is necessary for the insertion of new characteristics in the current population. Not considering mutation, the GA search is limited to a very small area of the total feasible search space. In the present work, some very specialized operators were created to speed up the evolution of the individuals, as explained below.</p><p>Mutation_01 (Random customer migration): This operator chooses a vehicle randomly and a random customer associated to it; a migration of this customer to other non-empty vehicle is tried. If the insertion results a feasible route, that is accepted independently of the new function cost (See Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>

Nevertheless, it is very important to improve the GA convergence. It verifies all possibilities to exchange a couple of customers and only carries it out if a reduction in the total travel distance is obtained (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>).</p><p>Mutation_06 (Merge two routes): This operator chooses two random routes and tries to merge them in a random way. Very often, the remainder customers are inserted in other routes or in a new one.

These sub-region based methods can be useful for problems without capacity and time window constraints. However, for the VRPTW, any artificial sub-region can have the effect of forcing the creation of additional routes in the solution; or of routes with higher travel distances. This occurs in the VRPTW because the time window constraints obstruct routes according to the physical proximity of the customers.</p><p>On the other hand, it may be easier for the GA to find out little imperfections in a subset of routes previously produced, like wrong customer order or changed customers between routes. In this way, additional evolutions are applied using the GA described above, where a subset of customers is eliminated, reducing the problem to 30% in size. The customers are grouped in accordance with the intermediate solution produced using the SPP model over the subset of routes R from the previous phase, described in Section 3.1.2. Again, many islands of evolution are generated; each island uses a different set of routes, randomly chosen. The routes from the SPP solution are used only to decide what customer will be inserted in the subproblem, but new routes are obtained using the stochastic PFIH to generate each initial GA population. The SPP is solved to optimality, using the GLPK MIP software. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">12</ref> shows the flow of this process and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> summarizes the phases to generate the subproblem. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The complete algorithm</head><p>In the previous sections, the proposed GA is applied in two different phases to produce quality routes to the set R from Eq. (2.1). These routes are from independent local minimal solutions. Initially handling the whole problem, where all customers are considered, and in a second phase, using a reduced problem. Even though the quality of these produced routes is directly related to the whole solution quality of the GA, it is necessary to produce as many routes as possible, increasing the possibility to find the desired set of routes present in the global optimum.</p><p>These two sequential phases can be considered as diversification and intensification steps. The first has a diversification bias because many independent and fast evolution are done, generating many different local minimal solutions. Thus, the SPP model is solved to obtain the best combination of routes in an unique solution. The successive GA evolutions can be considered as an intensification search step because any subproblem generated will require similar routes solutions, once the customers are divided based on the SPP solution. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> it is possible to see this tendency in the set of customers to the subproblem.</p><p>The framework is composed by successive cycles of diversification and intensification, i.e., islands of evolution handling the whole problem and the subproblem. Finally, a global set of routes, R GLOBAL , are constructed to provide a global and final SPP MIP solution, obtaining a near global optimal solution. Since the entirely framework can be considered as a column generation heuristic method, it is denominated CGH. All parts together can be showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>. The whole process showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref> can be summarized as follows. At first, MAX_ISLAND islands of GA evolutions are generated considering the original instances of Solomon, represented by the blocks with labels A, B and C. The set of routes R are coming up using the routes from the best individuals from each island, block B. When the number of evolutions NIsland achieves the maximal number of islands (MAX_ISLAND) the SPP is solved using the GLPK MIP package over the set of routes R, block D. Based on the SPP solution, the algorithm decides how the customers will be clustered to generate many different reduced problems. As mentioned before, each route found in the SPP solution has the possibility of 30% of having its customers inserted in a reduced problem. This step is represented by the block E in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>. Again, the same GA is executed to optimize travel distance over this reduced problem, block F. Here, the only parameter changed in the GA is the time horizont, reduced to 50%. In the same way, many islands are generated (MAX_ISLAND2), but then with different set of customers, because the routes selected are different each time. When MAX_ISLAND2 is reached, the set R contains additional routes. This step can be considered as an improvement in the former result, because the division of the customers based on the current SPP solution will lead the search in that region. The entire set of routes R is added to the global set R GLOBAL and made empty. If time is not reached (Total Time, block I), the cycle described starts again. Actually, the process can be also interrupted between any GA generations and is not represented in the flow chart to simplify it. When the limited time expires, normally after many cycles, the global set R GLOBAL is used in the final SPP formulation, where all produced routes are considered. The MIP GLPK package is also used to find an integer optimal solution considering this set R GLOBAL . The results in the next section show that this local minimum is very close or even coincident with the global optimal solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Computational results</head><p>The Solomon's test set was proposed in 1987 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for three different customers space classes: the classes R1 and R2 have customers randomly disposed; the classes C1 and C2 have customers clustered in some groups; and, finally, the classes RC1 and RC2 contain a subset of customers randomly disposed and the other part clustered. The distance between two customers is the simple euclidean distance. One unit of time is necessary to run one unit of distance by any vehicle. Each customer i has a time window [a i , b i ], which represents the time interval to arrive in that customer. Different capacity constraints are considered for the vehicle in each class of instance, as well as the demands from the customers. There are a total of 56 instances for each dimension category problem, that are 25, 50 and 100 customers. Because the Solomon's test set represents relatively well different kinds of scenarios, it has been chosen to evaluate many solution proposals in the literature. However, the incomplete definition of the problem has resulted in different assumptions, and consequently it is more difficult to compare the works. The first lack of agreement in the literature is the objective function of the problem. Many different objectives have been chosen in the literature for the Solomon's test set, like total travel distance minimization, number of vehicle minimization, total wait time minimization and the combinations of them. The second important lack of agreement is related to the data type, real or truncated numbers. Many authors justify the use of integer numbers, to reduce the influence of computer hardware, but in other cases the double precision arithmetic has been chosen. However, the instances of Solomon continue to be the best way to evaluate a new approach, and were used in this work. In order to reduce these weaknesses mentioned above and make possible a more complete comparison, both real and integer numbers have been considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">General GA parameters adjustment</head><p>Appropriated adjustment of parameters in GAs can make a significant difference in terms of performance. Some values can provide very high performance in specific instances while giving premature convergence in others, even over the same kind of problems. Today, robust GAs with very specialized and complex operators are developed for many problems. For the VRPTW, these characteristics are very critical, because there is not only one kind of instance but many classes of problems. For example, some instances are very relaxed in terms of time window constraints. In other instances, customer sequences are absolutely necessary to satisfy time restrictions. In this work it is possible to define a satisfactory set of operators to allow a fast algorithm. Considering the set partitioning problem used to complete the search, there is not much possibility to entrap in the local minimum, once the GA has many opportunities to obtain different solutions.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>, MAX_POP represents the constant used to define the number of generations used in the GA for the original problem. The value of 170 is empirically chosen to MAX_POP. Differently, the number of generation used in the same GA for the reduced problem, MAX_POP2, is 120. Using these parameters it is possible to generate an island of evolution sufficiently fast. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> it is shown the average time measured by islands of evolution using each Solomon's classes of problems.</p><p>The k-way tournament selection process is tested using groups of 2, 3 and 4 individuals. Groups of 3 randomly selected individuals have obtained the best results. It is fixed, before adjusting all other parameters.</p><p>The number of times to execute all mutation operators is adjusted empirically as follows. The operators are divided in two blocks, one that increases the diversification search (block A) and another that permits an intensification search (block B). In this work, intensification stands for the operation in a current solution which ensures a positive gain in the travel distance. On the other hand, diversification stands for random moves which can deteriorate the current solution. If a preponderant intensification search is used in the GA, the population generally stops in a premature local minimum. In opposite, an excessive diversification search is equivalent to a random and/or blind search in the feasible solution space.</p><p>Initially, the numbers of execution for these blocks applied in each GA generation were decided by feeling, considering basically the time complexity cost of the related algorithm. This procedure has enabled to find the best rate of each block in total, using empirical tests. Tests have been done using different problem types. After the best mutation amount was selected for these two blocks, a fine adjustment is done, changing the number of execution for each specific mutation. These two steps are repeated many times, sequentially, using different problems. Finally, all parameters were fixed to test the solution for all instances. The values of the parameters found can be seen in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> and<ref type="table">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Results for total distance minimization</head><p>The proposed heuristic method, CGH is evaluated using 56 Solomon's problems with 100 customers. Although many heuristic approaches have been tested using this Solomon's test set, there is no information about previous heuristic methods considering total travel distance as the first objective together with integer numbers (first decimal truncated) to make possible the comparison with exact method solutions. Although data type seems to be a simple detail, it can change significantly the results because it can decide if a route will be feasible or not. The inputs of the problem like coordinates, capacity, customer demands and others are multiplied by 10 and all subsequent calculations are truncated to integers.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> shows the results obtained by the CGH for all Solomon's problems with 100 customers and the exact results obtained by optimization methods, when they are known. The objective function applied is only the total TD. The NV found in the solutions were presented only as reference. Results emphasized in bold in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> represent the exact solution reached by CGH. The blank cells in the exact solution column mean that the exact solution for these problems has not been obtained yet. The CGH results represent the best after 3 algorithm runs. The time limit to the execution is 60 min, including many intermediate MIP solutions (block D in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>). These SPP problems, although always executed to optimality, have few routes and do not represent an expressive time spender. The final SPP solved (block J in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>) can spend a bit more time, in spite of the set R GLOBAL still continue small. The necessary time in this step are not included in the limited time of 60 min. No limit is imposed to any MIP steps in the algorithm. Even the last stage generally the results of the SPP problem come up after few seconds. The results show that many previously known optimal solutions from exact methods have been reached, 24 out of 33 (72.7%). Globally, the TD average results are only 0.29% higher considering the 33 instances where the optimal solutions are known. In RC101, RC103 and RC201, the numbers of used vehicle in the solution are not the same. Larsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> suggests heuristic methods using TD as the only objective and the truncated number criterion, making it easier to compare the results between the algorithms. The results presented here, seem to be the first in this way, and consequently current heuristic benchmark under these conditions.</p><p>It is possible to improve the knowledge of the heuristic performance under the same arithmetic assumptions and the same objective adopted in exact works. Additionally, the same heuristic CGH is tested making use of real arithmetic (double precision) and the results are also compared with real arithmetic heuristic solutions in the literature, although few works have considered Solomon's benchmark problems minimizing TD. The results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> together with the best solution known in the literature. It is possible to see that the algorithm proposed continues to be very competitive in terms of total TD. Although some works have considered TD as the first objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, the best previous result comes from heuristic methods minimizing the number of vehicles as the first objective, becoming difficult to compare with CGH results. Following, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> shows the results by problem class, including results from other relevant works in the literature. In this table, the increased percentages from the best results (TD%) are presented for each author. The CGH has reduced significantly the best results. Another interesting fact is that the previous best results considering TD do not match with the best results considering NV only for 10 problems indicated with (*) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> as summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. All these results came from the Rochat work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which reports a better TD but worse NV, with one more vehicle. In Table <ref type="table">7</ref> is possible to see the gain obtained with the SPP formulation over the set of routes R. Those results confirm the viability of this hybrid CGH approach for TD minimization in the VRPTW.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presents a contribution to overcome two of the main weaknesses in the VRPTW literature. Firstly, the behaviour of a heuristic method is compared against exact methods, considering the number of global optimal solutions found using the same assumptions used in the exact methods: truncated calculation and total distance minimization. Secondly, few papers have addressed distance minimization using heuristic methods. The results obtained by CGH are very expressive, establishing many new Table <ref type="table">7</ref> The best Genetic Algorithm (GA) parcial solutions found and the final CGH results. The last column reports the percentages gain with the SPP MIP formulation benchmark solutions. It is possible to see that the number of vehicles and total distance are very competitive objectives, because the CGH results overcome the previous minimal TD results, generally increasing the number of vehicles.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
