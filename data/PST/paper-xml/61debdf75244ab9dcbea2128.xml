			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>BGP prefix hijacking caused by a misconfiguration or malicious route announcements brings great trouble to today's Internet. Outsourcing mitigation is a recently proposed automatic hijacking mitigation method. It mitigates hijacking incidents by attracting and redirecting the hijacked traffic to the origin AS so the deployment of the AS that performs the attracting and redirecting behaviors is important for improving the effectiveness of mitigation. However, traditional methods fail to guarantee mitigation effectiveness, i.e., simply selecting the neighbor AS of the origin AS to mitigate. Therefore, how to measure the mitigation effectiveness of different ASes and effectively select the mitigators are key issues of outsourcing mitigation.</p><p>In this paper, to measure the mitigation effectiveness of ASes, (1) we use a new metric for evaluating the mitigation effectiveness, and propose a strategy called AS Reachability Influence Selection (ARS) for effectively selecting ASes with high mitigation effectiveness. (2) We conduct extensive analysis to deeply study different characteristics (e.g., AS type, degree, provider, region) that influence the mitigation effectiveness. As the results show, ARS can put ASes with high mitigation effectiveness in front. The results also show that ASes with many Tier-1 providers or high tier providers may achieve higher mitigation effectiveness than Tier-1 ASes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Today's Internet is composed of tens of thousands of networks called Autonomous Systems (ASes). These ASes use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for routing information exchange. Because of the weaknesses in the BGP design, the Internet suffers from different security issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> including BGP prefix hijacking and route leak, which are two most common types of incidents in the BGP network. BGP prefix hijacking involves an attacker announcing a prefix that does not belong to itself, which causes ASes who trust those false routing announcements to send their traffic to the wrong destination. A route leak occurs when the attacker propagates a valid route beyond the scope intended by the routing policy of the ASes involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In this paper, we mainly consider the BGP prefix hijacking. BGP prefix hijacking can be used for various malicious activities such as spamming, phishing, and traffic blackholing. A well-known hijacking incident is that an ISP from Pakistan hijacked the prefix of YouTube in 2008, causing YouTube to be inaccessible for 2 h worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Moreover, the study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> also demonstrates that BGP prefix hijacking can be used to attack the Bitcoin network.</p><p>Over the last two decades, great efforts have been made by researchers to secure the inter-domain network and a variety of BGP defense mechanisms are proposed, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. These mechanisms can be categorized into two types: proactive defense and reactive defense. The main difference between the two kinds of defense mechanisms is that proactive defense aims at preventing the attack before it is launched and reactive defense focuses on how to accurately detect and mitigate the attack when it has already happened. Due to technical and financial issues, proactive defense mechanisms like BGPsec <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and RPKI <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have not been deployed globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and they bring meager security in partial deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. For example, BGPsec cannot secure a routing path if there is an AS that does not support BGPsec in the path, because BGPsec requires each AS of the path to validate all previous signatures and sign their signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. According to a survey in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, compared with proactive defense mechanisms, reactive defense mechanisms require a simpler deployment and less modification on the current network infrastructures, so it is easier for operators to adopt reactive defense mechanisms.</p><p>The reactive defense mechanism often includes two parts: detection and mitigation. In the reactive defense mechanism, if the detection system detects that a hijack is happening, it will notify network operators of the hijack incident. After getting the notification, there are mainly two ways in practice to mitigate the hijack, announcing the disaggregated prefix (e.g., hijacked prefix 119.63.0.0/23 can be disaggregated to 119.63.0.0/24 and 119.63.1.0/24) or contacting network operators https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.108650 Received 21 July 2021; Received in revised form 22 November 2021; Accepted 23 November 2021 of other ASes. However, the effects of these two mitigation strategies are very limited. For instance, the effect of prefix-disaggregation is not ideal when the hijacked prefix is more than /25 prefix since most routers filter prefixes more specific than /25 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Contacting with or waiting for other networks to react to the hijack costs unpredictable delay or even impossible <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Sometimes the victims have to publicly disclose the hijacking incident in the mail to other network operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, large-scale BGP hijacking may last for a long time such as incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> both lasted more than 2 h, which had a serious impact on the Internet. There is a need for a more efficient way to mitigate the hijacking quickly. Therefore, in addition to improving the hijacking detection accuracy, how to effectively mitigate the negative impact of the detected hijacking is also important, especially when there are no other direct methods to eliminate the malicious routes.</p><p>The work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a new method for mitigating BGP prefix hijacking (we call it outsourcing mitigation). In outsourcing mitigation, the mitigator (AS) attracts misdirected traffic by announcing the hijacked prefix, then redirects the hijacked traffic to the victim. This method is capable of efficiently mitigating the impact of hijacking incidents and does not need large-scale cooperation between ASes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> or disaggregate the hijacked prefix. It only requires the agreement between the victim whose prefix is hijacked and the mitigator who does the mitigating action. The mitigation effectiveness of outsourcing mitigation is affected by the selection of mitigators who perform the traffic redirection because different ASes acting as mitigators will attract different numbers of ASes to accept their routes instead of the attackers' routes. For example, we have done a simple experiment, in which AS-33657 is the hijacker and hijacks the prefix of AS-398373. In this hijack event, around 96% ASes accepted the wrong route announced by the hijacker. If AS-20940 is selected as the mitigator, the number of ASes accepting the wrong route can be reduced to around 4.7%. However, if AS-174 is selected as the mitigator, the percentage can only be reduced to around 80%. Therefore, the mitigator deployment is crucial for maximizing the effect of outsourcing mitigation. However, the traditional way such as selecting the neighbor of the origin AS to mitigate <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> cannot guarantee the effectiveness of mitigation.</p><p>In this paper, we study the deployment problem of outsourcing mitigation, and propose a metric to quantify the mitigation effectiveness of mitigators. To further analyze the effectiveness, we propose a mitigator selection strategy named ARS to help select ASes with high mitigation effectiveness, and conduct extensive analysis to study different factors affecting the mitigation ability of different mitigators. Except for the BGP prefix hijacking, we also study the effectiveness of outsourcing mitigation in mitigating route leaks. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to comprehensively study the deployment of outsourcing mitigation by evaluating the mitigation effectiveness of different ASes from the perspective of network topology.</p><p>Our main contributions are summarized as follows: first, a new metric for evaluating the mitigation effectiveness of the hijack-mitigation simulation is proposed. Then, a mitigator selection strategy called ARS is proposed to help filter out ASes with high mitigation effectiveness. After that, different characteristics of ASes that influence the mitigation effectiveness (i.e., AS types, providers, degree, region) are analyzed and different deployment strategies including ARS are evaluated using the proposed evaluation metric. The relationships between the mitigator and hijacker/victim are also investigated. The results show that providers of ASes play a crucial role in mitigating BGP prefix hijacking. The ASes with many Tier-1 providers or high tier providers are more likely to achieve high mitigation effectiveness than Tier-1 ASes. The results also show that ARS can put ASes with a high potential of mitigation ability in front.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The overview of the outsourcing mitigation is presented in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the methodology of this paper, including the BGP hijackmitigation model, the evaluation of mitigation effectiveness, the definition of ARS, and the simulation setup. Section 4 analyzes mitigation effectiveness with different AS types, AS metrics, and regions. Following that, Section 5 illustrates important findings from the analysis. Section 6 extends the outsourcing mitigation to route leak mitigation and introduces the route leak mitigation details and evaluation results. The related work and conclusions are shown in Section 7 and Section 8 respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background: Outsourcing mitigation overview</head><p>The outsourcing mitigation aims at attracting and redirecting the hijacked traffic to the victim (origin AS). The AS providing outsourcing mitigation service is called mitigator. When the mitigator receives a mitigation request from its client, it then purges its malicious routes about the hijacked prefix and announces this prefix. After the mitigator receives the hijacked traffic, it has two ways to redirect the traffic to the victim <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The first way is to send hijacked traffic to the victim through tunnels. The second way is redirecting the traffic through direct peering links which can be achieved by an IXP <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, it also limits the positions of the mitigator.</p><p>To better show the importance of selecting mitigators, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates an example of hijack and mitigation scenarios, where AS-1 is the false origin that hijacks prefix 1.2.3.0/24 owned by AS-8. There are two types of relationships between ASes, customer-provider and peer-peer, which are marked as gray arrows and gray straight lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> respectively. For instance, the relationship between AS-8 and AS-4 is the customer-provider relationship, where AS-8 is a customer of AS-4 and AS-4 is a provider of AS-8. The ASes prefer routes learned from their customers, then peers and last providers. The detail about the routing policy included in this example will be discussed later in Section 3.1. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), AS-2, AS-5, AS-6, and AS-7 accept the malicious route and are referred to as polluted ASes. Different ASes can bring different mitigation performances when they serve as the mitigator. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>) and 1 (c) illustrate two hijack-mitigation scenarios using AS-2 and AS-5 as the mitigator respectively. If selecting AS-2 as the mitigator, the number of polluted ASes is 3. If selecting AS-5 as the mitigator, the number of polluted ASes is reduced to 1. Therefore, AS-5 is better at mitigating hijacking than AS-2 in this case.</p><p>Outsourcing mitigation against prefix hijacking has benefits, but it also has several concerns. (1) One concern is that the mitigators may announce prefixes that they do not own. Therefore, the mitigation behavior seems like a malicious prefix hijacking. However, the behavior is benign in fact, since the big difference between prefix hijacking and outsourcing mitigation is that the misdirected traffic caused by the mitigator is completely redirected to the victim without being intercepted or forged. (2) Therefore, there is a trust issue in the practical application, since the victim ASes have to believe the mitigation behavior of the mitigators is reliable, and the mitigators must check whether the hijacked prefixes actually belong to the victims before providing mitigation services. (3) It is possible that the hijacked traffic attracted is huge, which may cause the mitigator to collapse under the unexpected load. Thus, the selected ASes should be capable of coping with a large amount of hijacked traffic without a single point of failure. Analyzing the ability to handle traffic of different ASes is beyond the scope of this study. Instead, we focus on analyzing mitigation effectiveness based on topology information.</p><p>As mentioned above, outsourcing mitigation has its pros and cons. In this paper, we aim to provide advice on how to choose appropriate mitigators for the hijacking, and to learn more about the mitigator to build a bridge of trust, rather than directly solving these concerns. Therefore, in order to observe in-depth which characteristics are related to the selection of mitigators, a statistical metric for evaluating mitigation effectiveness is proposed. In terms of the evaluation metric, different aspects of mitigators are analyzed, such as the type of ASes according to their business service and tiers, graph features like degree and core number, AS business relationship, and region distribution. By analyzing these characteristics, we can better understand the outsourcing mitigation.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this section, we introduce the methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of outsourcing mitigation. The structure of the methodology is outlined in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Because it is difficult and risky to do a large-scale mitigation simulation in the real network (e.g., it may affect the normal routing of the Internet), similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a suitable BGP routing model for simulating prefix hijacking and mitigating behaviors is built. The built model has over 70,000 ASes, so to improve the efficiency of the evaluation and better focus on those with high mitigation effectiveness, we have removed some ASes that have low connectivity and are unlikely to become mitigators.</p><p>From the analysis on the BGP routing policy, we assume that the mitigation effectiveness is related to the performance of routing announcement reachability. To demonstrate our assumption, a mitigator selection strategy ARS based on characterizing the reachability of a mitigator's routing announcements is proposed.</p><p>Following that, a new evaluation metric for quantifying the mitigation effectiveness of the simulation is introduced. Based on the simulation and evaluation, we have analyzed different characteristics of ASes on influencing mitigation and compared the results of different selection strategies, which will be discussed in Section 4. The notations and parameters used in our methodology are summarized in Tables <ref type="table">1  and 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">BGP routing model</head><p>To simulate the prefix hijacking and mitigation, we briefly model the network as an AS-level graph. As shown below, the modeling process has four parts, including the construction of AS-level topology, the routing policy of BGP, the selection algorithm for mitigation candidates, and how to simulate the hijacking and mitigation behaviors using the routing model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AS-Level topology.</head><p>The graph is constructed using the AS relationship dataset collected from CAIDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Problink <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which is mainly inferred from the BGP table snapshots collected by public measurement points at Route Views and RIPE RIS. In the AS relationship dataset, each connection between two ASes has a business relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>: customer-provider, provider-customer, or peer-peer. In a customer-provider relationship, the customer pays its provider for reaching the rest of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In a peer-peer relationship, the two ASes offer each other free transit service for their own routes or routes from their customers. We briefly represent the AS relationship dataset as a directed AS-level graph 𝐺 = (𝑉 , 𝐸), in which 𝑉 denotes the AS set and 𝐸 denotes connections between ASes with the label of business relationship. The route is a sequence of ASes with a target prefix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Routing policy. A well-known AS business relationship model -Gao-</head><p>Rexford model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is used to simulate the BGP routing policy. First, assuming that all ASes in the graph 𝐺 obey the valley-free rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. That is, the route learned from their providers or peers can only be announced to their customers, and the route learned from their customers can be announced to their providers, peers, and customers. Therefore, when an AS receives multiple routes targeting at the same prefix, the routing decision process is as follows:</p><p>• Local Preference (LP) -First, ASes prefer routes from customers, then peers, and last providers. • Path Length (PL) -Second, ASes prefer shorter paths.</p><p>If an AS receives multiple routes from its neighbors, it will first rank them according to their local preferences, then according to their path lengths. After executing the LP and PL policies, there may be multiple equally preferred paths with the same local preference and path length. So, let 𝑔(𝑣, 𝑑, 𝑥) be the number of equally preferred paths from node 𝑣 to prefix 𝑥 through origin node 𝑑 and let 𝑔 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥) be the total number of equally preferred paths from 𝑣 to prefix 𝑥.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mitigation candidates.</head><p>The outsourcing mitigation can be seen as a competition, where mitigators and attackers compete to persuade other ASes to accept their own routing announcements. Therefore, the ASes with higher mitigation might be more resilient to hijacking. That is, their prefixes are hard to be hijacked <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Accordingly, based on the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> that ASes provider with more Tier-1 ASes or other big ISPs are more resilient to hijacking, we propose a method that filters out a subset of ASes with the highest likelihood of mitigation as mitigation candidates, which are denoted as 𝑀.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1 Computing Mitigation Candidates</head><p>Group ASes into 4 tiers: clique, high_tier, low_tier, stub_ tier</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Mitigation candidates 𝑀 ← ∅ 𝑀 ← 𝑀 ∩ 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑒 ∩ ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ_𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑟 for AS 𝑣 ∈ 𝑙𝑜𝑤_𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑟 ∩ 𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑏_𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑟 do if 𝑣 ∉ 𝑀 and 𝑣 has more than one provider in 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑒 or ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ_𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑟 then 𝑀 ← 𝑀 ∩ 𝑣 end if end for</formula><p>Algorithm 1 shows the filtering procedure and the details are as follows. First, ASes in the graph are categorized into four types <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>: clique, high tier, low tier, stub tier (Note that clique contains all ASes in Tier-1). The candidates 𝑀 start with ASes in the clique and high tier since they have rich connections. The ASes in the low tier and stub tier that have more than one clique or high tier provider are also added to the candidate set. In this way, ASes with low connectivity that are unlikely to have high mitigation effectiveness can be removed.</p><p>Hijacking and mitigating simulation. The simulation mainly focuses on the exact prefix hijacking, where the attacker hijacks the prefix announced by the true origin AS (victim). The BGP simulator proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is used for computing equally preferred paths under the above routing policy. But different from work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that uses AS nodes as the destination and computes paths from the source AS to the destination AS, in the simulation, we use the prefix as the destination and aim to compute all equally preferred paths from all the source ASes to the destination prefix. When an AS announces a prefix, assume the AS has a provider-customer relationship with the prefix. For example, in a hijacking scenario, the victim and the attacker both announce the target prefix, so the target prefix has two providers (the victim and the attacker). In a mitigation scenario, the victim, attacker, and mitigator all announce the target prefix, so the target prefix has three providers (the victim, attacker, and mitigator). Based on the last hop of the target prefix, we can determine whether the source AS reached the target prefix through the hijacker, victim, or mitigator. In this way, the hijacking and mitigating of prefixes can be simulated.</p><p>Taking Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>) for example, the destination is prefix 1.2.3.0/24. The preferred path from AS-3 to the prefix 1.2.3.0/24 is (AS-3, AS-4, 1.2.3.0/24) and the last hop of the target prefix is true origin AS-4, which means AS-3 is not polluted. The preferred path from AS-7 to the prefix 1.2.3.0/24 is (AS-7, AS-6, AS-5, AS-1, 1.2.3.0/24) and the last hop of the target prefix is false origin AS-1, so the AS-7 is polluted. Similarly, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>), the last hop of AS-6 and AS-7 is mitigator AS-5, so the AS-6 and AS-7 are mitigated by AS-5 (Please note that the mitigator will eventually redirect the traffic of AS-6 and AS-7 to true origin AS-1).</p><p>The key of the hijacking and mitigation simulation based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is to build a routing tree 𝑇 , which contains all equally preferred next hops for each node to reach the target prefix 𝑥. By using these next hops in 𝑇 we can obtain the equally preferred paths from every node to the target prefix and then determine which ASes are polluted. To better understand the computation, the building procedure of 𝑇 can be divided into three parts. In each part, a certain relationship type of AS links is used to build a partial BFS routing tree. The detail of building the partial BFS routing tree is shown in Algorithm 2. The entire process of using Algorithm 2 to build the routing tree 𝑇 is shown in 3. </p></div>

Based on this assumption, the metric ReachInf is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑅𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝐼𝑛𝑓 (𝑑) = ∑ ℎ ℎ𝑜𝑝𝑠(𝑑, ℎ) ⋅ 1 ℎ |𝐶|<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ℎ𝑜𝑝𝑠(𝑑, ℎ) is the number of nodes reaching the origin node 𝑑 with ℎ hops, |𝐶| is the number of nodes who cannot reach the origin node 𝑑.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Mitigation evaluation</head><p>As discussed in the previous example, different mitigator selection strategies will affect different numbers of polluted ASes. In order to evaluate the effects of mitigator selection after the simulation, a new metric Mean Reduced Pollution Rate (MP) is proposed. Before introducing the MP, we first describe the definition of pollution rate.</p><p>Pollution rate. The pollution rate is used for measuring the possibility of ASes who will accept the wrong routes announced by the hijacker. For each iteration of mitigation simulating, one hijack-mitigation triplet (𝑎, 𝑡, 𝑚) is selected to announce the given prefix where 𝑎 is the hijacker, 𝑡 is the true origin AS and 𝑚 is the selected mitigator. Based on the number of preferred paths passing through these three ASes respectively, the possible pollution rate of an AS 𝑣 denoted as 𝜃 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥) after the mitigation can be calculated by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑔 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥) = 𝑔(𝑣, 𝑎, 𝑥) + 𝑔(𝑣, 𝑡, 𝑥) + 𝑔(𝑣, 𝑚, 𝑥) &gt; 0 (2) 𝜃 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥) = 𝑔(𝑣, 𝑎, 𝑥) 𝑔 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the 𝑔(𝑣, 𝑎, 𝑥) denotes the number of equally preferred paths from node 𝑣 to attacker 𝑎 to reach prefix 𝑥 and 𝑔(𝑣, 𝑡, 𝑥) is the number of equally preferred paths from 𝑣 to true origin 𝑡 to reach prefix 𝑥. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) guarantees that 𝑣 has at least one path to reach 𝑥.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mean reduced pollution rate (MP).</head><p>The MP is used to measure the mitigation effectiveness of mitigators. Let 𝐴 be the attacker-victim set and 𝑆 be the node set that can reach prefix 𝑥. The MP of mitigator 𝑚 denoted as 𝑀𝑃 (𝑚) is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">θ𝑚,𝑎,𝑡 = 1 − ∑ 𝑣∈𝑆−{𝑎,𝑡,𝑚} 𝜃 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥)∕ ∑ 𝑣∈𝑆−{𝑎,𝑡} 𝜃(𝑣, 𝑥) (4) 𝑀𝑃 (𝑚) = ∑ (𝑎,𝑡)∈𝐴 θ𝑚,𝑎,𝑡 |𝐴|<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝜃(𝑣, 𝑥) and 𝜃 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥) are the pollution rate before and after the mitigation respectively. |𝐴| is the number of hijacking incidents. The high MP means high mitigation effectiveness. Therefore, the goal of mitigator selection strategies can be transformed into filtering as many as ASes that have a high MP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Simulation setup</head><p>In this subsection, we give a summary of simulation setup. The BGP simulation framework used in this paper is introduced in Section 3.1. The simulation for computing equally preferred paths is shown in Algorithm 3 and is implemented by C++. The experiments are conducted on a server with 48 CPUs: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU 2.20 GHz, Memory: 64 GB, and OS: Ubuntu 20.10. The detail of simulation procedure is shown as follows:</p><p>• AS-level topology construction. An AS-level graph is constructed by using historical BGP data in November 2020 collected from the CAIDA Relationship dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Problink dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The CAIDA Relationship dataset is generated from the public BGP routing data, Ark traceroute data, and multilateral peering <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The Problink dataset reveals more complex relationships than the CAIDA Relationship dataset and it is used as a supplement to the CAIDA in the simulation. The constructed graph consists of 70,661 ASes and 454,690 AS links. Each AS link is labeled with a business relationship type using the relationship dataset mentioned above. • Mitigation candidate AS set selection. Using the filtering algorithm in Algorithm 1 to obtain a mitigation candidate set with a size of 20,486. • Hijacking event deployment. The hijacking events used in the simulation are from BGPstream possible hijack reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. We collected 1,855 hijack incidents from December 2019 to December 2020. Each hijacking event includes a hijacker AS, a victim AS, and a target prefix. The hijacker AS and victim AS both announce that they can directly reach the target prefix. • Mitigator evaluation. Using selecting strategies (e.g., ARS, selecting an AS with the most number of providers, etc.) to select an AS from the mitigation candidate set as the mitigator to mitigate the hijacking event. In the mitigation, the mitigator also announces that it can directly reach the target prefix of the hijacking event. Then, we compute the equally preferred paths of each AS to reach the target prefix. Repeat the mitigation for every hijacking event. Finally, we can compute the MP of the mitigator using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) to evaluate its mitigation effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Characterizing mitigation effectiveness</head><p>In this section, we conduct extensive experiments for capturing more features of ASes with high mitigation effectiveness: (1) First, we explore the mitigation effectiveness of different AS types including AS business types and AS tier types. (2) Second, several metrics used to measure the importance of ASes (e.g., core number, degree, provider, ReachInf ) are analyzed, and then their relevant selection strategies are compared in the performance of mitigation. Through this analysis, we can have a better understanding of how different metrics affect the mitigation effectiveness. (3) After that, we study how the mitigation effectiveness varies by region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Mitigation effectiveness with AS types</head><p>In this subsection, we explore mitigation effectiveness of different AS types. There are two kinds of AS types considered, AS business type and AS tier type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AS business type.</head><p>The AS business types are categorized based on the business services ASes provide, which include the following three categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>: Content, Transit/Access, and Enterprise. To explore which business types may have high mitigation effectiveness, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(a)</ref> shows the MP distribution (CDF) of different AS business types. The results show that the Content performs better than both Transit/Access and Enterprise in the MP. One of the reasons for this observation is that Content providers are expanding their network infrastructures due to the Internet flattening and connect more networks to enrich their network reachability <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, which also makes them occupy a decisive position in mitigation effectiveness. Large Content Providers like Akamai (AS-20940) and Cloudflare (AS-13335) even rank in the top two of the MP.</p><p>AS tier type. previously introduced in Section 3.1, there are three AS tier types: clique, high tier, low tier, and stub tier. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b</ref>) illustrates the MP distribution (CDF) of different tiers. The results show that ASes of the high tier have higher mitigation effectiveness than those of other tiers. Around 60% of high tier ASes have more than 0.4 MP value. Moreover, we note that the ASes in the clique are not suitable for providing mitigation services due to their poor performance in the MP (e.g., All ASes in Clique have less than 0.3 MP value).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Mitigation effectiveness with AS metrics</head><p>In this subsection, we shift focus to the comparison of mitigation effectiveness with different AS metrics: graph metrics (degree, core number), AS business relationship metrics (customer cone size, provider, Tier-1 provider), and ReachInf. To get a perspective on the relationship between these AS metrics and mitigation effectiveness, we analyze the top 100 ASes (denoted as Top100) that have the highest MP value in the mitigation candidate set. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the value of these metrics in the Top100 where Perc(X,q) returns the q-th percentile of the data X <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. For example, Perc(Core number, 50) is the average core number of ASes in the mitigation candidate set.</p><p>(1) Core number. In a k-core subgraph, all nodes have more than k degrees. If a node is in a k-core subgraph but not in (k+1)-core subgraph, then its core number is k. The core number can represent the density of a graph. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(a)</ref> show that only 14% of ASes have the largest core number and the core number has no significant relationship with mitigation effectiveness in the Top100 list. The ASes in the Top100 are all larger than the 50th percentile of core number and most of them (67%) are larger than the 90th percentile. Additionally, it indicates that ASes with the high mitigation abilities may not be in the core of the Internet but may have a larger core number than 90% of ASes.</p><p>(2) Degree. The degree is a simple metric that measures the number of connections between nodes. It does not consider the business relationships of AS neighbors. Fig. <ref type="figure">4(b)</ref> shows that all ASes from the Top100 have a higher degree than the average. But these spikes in the figure also show that a higher degree does not always mean higher mitigation effectiveness. For example, AS-6939 and AS-24482 both have more than 4000 degrees, but they are not in the Top100. Besides, 31% of ASes in the Top100 have lower degrees than 90% of ASes in the mitigation candidate set. Therefore, the degree metric can provide some references but still cannot filter AS with a high MP value very well.  Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Different metrics in the Top100 where Perc(X, q) returns the q-th percentile of the X.</p><p>(3) Customer cone size. The customer cone size data is collected from CAIDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which describes the influence of an AS through customer networks. Fig. <ref type="figure">4(c)</ref> shows the customer cone size of the Top100. It can be seen that the customer cone size does not strongly relate to the mitigation effectiveness. One possible reason for this observation is that the routes from providers are in the lowest local preference, which makes mitigation very difficult to go on.</p><p>(4) Providers. The routes from customers have the highest local preference, which makes ASes with a large number of providers more likely to spread their routes to other ASes. Fig. <ref type="figure">4(d)</ref> shows the number of providers in the Top100. From the results we can see, the number of providers of all ASes in the Top100 exceeds the average. The AS-20940 and AS-13335 are the two ASes with the most number of providers, and they have over 100 providers each. It can be seen that the number of providers is closely related to MP value, that is, MP increases with the number of providers.</p><p>(5) Tier-1 providers. According to observations made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, ASes with more Tier-1 providers are more likely to have strong attacking abilities. Attacking power can also be considered as a mitigating ability. Thus, the number of tier-1 providers of ASes is analyzed. The Tier-1 ASes can provide their customers with as many opportunities as possible to reach other ASes. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(e) shows the number of Tier-1 providers in the Top100. About 97% of ASes in the Top100 are above average and 75% of ASes own more than 3 Tier-1 providers. There are 3 ASes without Tier-1 providers, namely AS-134176, AS-60592, and AS-134526, of which AS-134176 and AS-134526 are both from the same country. Even though they are not customers of Tier-1 ASes, they provider with many ASes in the Top100, such as AS-60592 has 3 providers in the Top100 and AS-134176 even has 5 providers in the top 30 of Top100. Therefore, it can be deduced that connecting to ASes with a high MP value might enhance its mitigation capability.</p><p>(6) ReachInf . The ReachInf defined in Section 3.2 is proposed to measure the mitigation ability. The ASes who can spread their routes to more other ASes with short distances might have a high ReachInf value. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(f) shows that the ReachInf value of all ASes in the Top100 is much higher than the top 90% of ASes in mitigation candidates. Moreover, compared with results in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(d)</ref>, ReachInf shows a clearer decreasing trend with the decreasing of MP.</p><p>Combined with the results in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, it can be concluded that among these metrics, the majority of ASes in the Top100 are above the average and the ReachInf has the strongest relationship with mitigation effectiveness compared with other metrics. In order to show the relationship more clearly, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(f)</ref> shows the linear regression model fit of different metrics in the Top100. In addition, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients between these metrics and MP. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. The Pearson correlation coefficients can measure the degree  of correlation between two variables and their value range from −1 to 1. According to the results, ReachInf has a higher correlation coefficient than Providers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of different mitigator selection strategies.</head><p>To further assess the impacts of the above metrics on mitigation effectiveness, we compare the mitigator selection strategies based on these metrics to determine which metrics have the most impact on the mitigation performance. The strategies are shown below:</p><p>• Core, selecting ASes with the largest core number from the AS set 𝑉 . • AS Rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, selecting ASes with the largest customer cone size from the AS set 𝑉 . • Degree, selecting ASes with the largest degree from the AS set 𝑉 .</p><p>• Provider, selecting ASes with the largest number of providers from the AS set 𝑉 . • Tier1-P, selecting ASes with the largest number of Tier-1 providers from the AS set 𝑉 . • ARS, selecting ASes with the largest ReachInf value from the AS set 𝑉 .</p><p>Each strategy selects 100 ASes for mitigation and sorts them by MP value. The previously mentioned Top100 is used for comparing how far the results are from the optimal ones. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows that the ARS strategy performs best, which demonstrates that ARS can put ASes with high mitigation effectiveness in front. The ASes with a large number of providers also perform well.</p><p>From results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, no matter what strategy is selected, there are always around 30% ASes that have an MP value over 0.7. The observation demonstrates that these selection strategies can select a small part of ASes with good mitigation effectiveness. However, ideally, we expect the strategy can filter out as many ASes with high mitigation effectiveness as possible. Thus, ARS is the first best choice. However, if it is hard to calculate the ReachInf value of all ASes, the following advice learned from the above analysis is offered:</p><p>1. First, selecting ASes that own a large number of providers. 2. Second, carefully observing their providers. If they provider with many ASes from Tier-1, high tier, or large degree list, these ASes might have high mitigation effectiveness. 3. Content providers and ASes from high tier might have high mitigation effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Attack message delivering using mitigators 4.4. Mitigation effectiveness with regions</head><p>To get a perspective of how mitigation effectiveness of mitigators varies in different places of the world, we analyze the mitigation effectiveness with different regions, including continent-level and country-level analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continent-level.</head><p>The mitigation data from experiments are grouped by continent. The ASes in mitigation candidates 𝑀 are from North America (NorA, 39.4%), Europe (EU, 37.5%), Asia (AS, 10.9%), South America (SA, 8.1%), Oceania (OC, 2.44%), and Africa (1.66%). The MP data are discretized into 10 levels of the same width. The mitigators with the highest MP are in MP level 10 and the lowest MP are in MP level 1. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the distribution of mitigation effectiveness per continent. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(a), the mitigators in North America and Europe see the largest number of ASes with a high MP value. It is observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(b) that the peak of North America is located in the smallest MP level 3 while Asia is located in the level MP group 5 in comparison to other continents. Therefore, even though North America accounts for the most fraction of ASes with high mitigation effectiveness, it also has a large proportion of mitigators that perform unsatisfactorily in mitigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Country-level.</head><p>To analyze country distribution of ASes that have high mitigation effectiveness, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> illustrates the area distribution of the Top100. It can be seen that the United States, China, Netherlands, and Switzerland all hold an important part in the number of Top100 and the United States accounts for almost half of them.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Learn from mitigation incidents of hijacking</head><p>In this section, the key findings from mitigation incidents are presented to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hijacker/victim and the mitigator. Besides, the hijacking-mitigation scenarios where the ASes with high mitigation effectiveness become attackers are discussed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Cut off the main malicious routing</head><p>In some cases, the spread of malicious routes is highly dependent on one or several neighbors of the hijacker, that is, these neighbors play a vital role in malicious routing. Cutting off the main malicious routing may contribute a lot to the mitigation. For example, there is a hijacking incident (AS-202322, AS-134176) in which AS-202322 hijacks the prefix of AS-134176. By studying the malicious routes, we found that the routing of AS-202322 mainly depends on its Based on this observation, an experiment is conducted to further study the relationship between the hijacker, victim, and AS with the highest mitigation effectiveness for a hijacking incident. In each hijacking incident, there is a triplet (𝑎, 𝑣, 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ ) where 𝑎 is the hijacker, 𝑣 is the victim, and 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is the AS with the highest mitigation effectiveness for hijacking incident (𝑎, 𝑣). We count the number of hijacking incidents that the AS 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is the neighbor of the hijacker 𝑎 or victim 𝑣. The results show that such incidents accounted for around 55.9% of the total number of hijacking incidents.</p><p>According to the results, the 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ of around 67% hijacking incidents is AS-20940. To reduce the bias, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> illustrates the results considering with and without 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ =AS-20940 respectively. The 𝑥-axis shows the percentage of incidents in each relationship to the total number of incidents. In the top subfigure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, there are about 46.9% 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is neither a neighbor of the hijacker or a of the victim and around 84.3% 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is not the neighbor of the victim. In the bottom subfigure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, after remove the incidents that 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ =AS-20940, the percentage of Relation(𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ , hijacker)=IsNeighbor is much higher than that of Relation(𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ , hijacker)=IsNotNeighbor. Based on the results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, the 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ has more relationships with the hijacker than the victim. When the 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is the neighbor of the hijacker, the possibility that the 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is a provider of the hijacker is higher than other types of relationships. Therefore, cutting off main malicious routing can start with selecting the provider of the hijacker as the mitigator.</p><p>Similar to the methodology used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, we continue to investigate the relationship between 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ and the neighbor (provider, peer, customer) of hijacker/victim to find out whether 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is close to the hijacker/victim. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>. It can be seen that if the 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is a neighbor of the hijacker's provider, 𝑚 ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ and the hijacker might have the same provider. Thus, except for the provider of the hijacker, the customer of the hijacker's provider can also be effective in mitigation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">ASes with highest mitigation effectiveness</head><p>There is another important thing that should be noticed: what if an AS with high mitigation effectiveness becomes an attacker? Who can efficiently mitigate the malicious propagation? Based on this assumption, the top 3 ASes of Top100 are selected, AS-20940, AS-13335, and AS-21859. They show a high mitigation effectiveness in the experiment results and have appeared in the list of attackers reported in the history of BGPstream possible hijacking. For example, according to the BGPstream report, AS-20940 might have hijacked a prefix of AS-61689 on February 8, 2020. So, we simulate hijacking incidents where the attacker is one of three (AS-20940, AS-13335, AS-21859) and analyze the relative mitigation results. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> shows that the MP of top 100 ASes under 3 different attackers. In the cases that AS-13335 and AS-21859 are attackers, AS-20940 is always the best choice for mitigating. It can be seen that most of ASes have less than 0.4 MP value under these three attackers. This observation reflects that the polluted ASes caused by attackers with high mitigation effectiveness are hard to be mitigated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Extension: Mitigation effectiveness in route leaks</head><p>For route leak mitigation, it faces similar challenges as prefix hijacking mitigation introduced earlier. The mitigation of route leaks mainly depends on manual correction after the network operators or administrators receive alerts from the detection system, e.g., route leak detection service provided by Cloudflare <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In a route leak, since the propagated AS path contains a valid first set of ASes, the length of offending paths tends to be longer than the original paths. So, the outsourcing mitigation may also be available for reducing the impact of route leaks by directly announcing the target prefix. In this section, we extend the outsourcing mitigation to mitigate route leaks and study mitigation effectiveness in route leaks. First, we describe the leaking and mitigating simulation, and then give the mitigation evaluation metrics for route leaks. Last, the mitigation results are presented.</p><p>Leaking and mitigating simulation. As mentioned before, route leaks occur when the route propagation violates the agreed routing policy, which is the valley-free rule in this simulation. That is, if the attacker leaks the route learned from one of its provider or peer to another provider or peer, it is a route leak incident. The attacker is called a leaker in the route leak and the ASes accepting the wrong route are called polluted ASes. The leaking simulation is more complicated than hijacking since it needs to change the routing policy. So we customize the event-driven simulator in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to simulate the leaking and mitigation. In the simulator, all nodes follow the valley-free rule. If a node is a leaker, we change its original routing policy in the simulator to allow it to leak routes. In a leaking scenario, the victim announces the target prefix and the leaker leaks the learned route from its provider or peer to all other providers or peers. In a mitigation scenario, the victim and mitigator both announce the target prefix, and the leaker continues to leak the learned route. After the simulation, each AS will have a selected AS path to the target prefix. By checking whether the AS path selected by the AS violates the valley-free rule, we can determine whether the AS is polluted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pollution rate and MP for route leak mitigation.</head><p>The pollution rate is a little different in route leak mitigation from in hijacking mitigation since not all paths pass through the attacker are illegitimate. Whether the path is legitimate or not depends on whether it violates the valleyfree rule. Thus, we use the  𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑡, 𝑥) to denote the number of equally illegitimate preferred paths from node 𝑣 to true origin 𝑡 to reach prefix 𝑥 that violates the valley-free rule due to the attacker 𝑎. The  ¬𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑡, 𝑥) denotes the number of equally legitimate preferred paths from node 𝑣 to true origin 𝑡 to reach prefix 𝑥. The  𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑚, 𝑥) and  ¬𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑚, 𝑥) are the number of equally illegitimate and legitimate preferred paths from node 𝑣 to mitigator 𝑚 to reach prefix 𝑥 respectively. Therefore, the polluted rate 𝜃 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥) for route leaks after the mitigation is defined as follows:</p><p> ′ (𝑣, 𝑥) =  𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑡, 𝑥) +  ¬𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑡, 𝑥) +  𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑚, 𝑥) +  ¬𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑚, 𝑥) (6)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝜃 ′ (𝑣, 𝑥) =  𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑡, 𝑥) +  𝑎 (𝑣, 𝑚, 𝑥)  ′ (𝑣, 𝑥)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The MP calculation equation for route leaks is consistent with Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) while 𝐴 represents the leaking pairs of true origin and leaker (𝑡, 𝑎), and</p><p>|𝐴| represents the number of leaking events. Simulation setup. The AS-level graph remains the same as the graph in Section 3.4. The leaking events used in the simulation are from possible BGP leak reports of BGPstream <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. We collected 409 route leak incidents from December 2019 to December 2020. The BGP simulator refers to the simulator in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> introduced before and is implemented by Kotlin.</p><p>Results. The same six selection strategies (Core, AS rank, Degree, Tier1-P, Provider, ARS) introduced in Section 4.2 are used in the experiments. Each selection strategy provides 100 ASes as mitigators.</p><p>For each route leak event, the mitigation simulation is performed for every mitigator selected by selection strategies. As shown in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>), the mitigation for route leaks is affected by the number of ASes passing through the leaked route. As a result, if paths that reach the target prefix announced by the mitigator successfully avoid passing through the leaker, it may reduce more polluted ASes than before, resulting in a positive MP. If these paths primarily pass through the leaker, it may add more polluted ASes than before, resulting in a negative MP. From the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> we can see, most of the mitigators selected by Provider and ARS have more positive MPs and less negative MPs than other strategies, which indicates that these two strategies can effectively select mitigators for route leaks. The bottom subfigure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11(b</ref>) compares the results between the MP ranges of 0 and 1 captured in the top subfigure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11(b</ref>). Around 80% ASes selected by ARS have more than 0.8 MP, which is better than Provider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Related work</head><p>Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed an automatic reactive mitigation mechanism to help mitigate hijacking by cleaning and correcting false routes. It selects several ASes known as lifesavers before the hijacking. When a hijacking incident is detected, all lifesavers begin to clean the malicious routes, and a promoter AS set selected from lifesavers promotes the valid route by putting ASes in AS_PATH into AS_SET. However, this mechanism needs complex cooperation with all lifesaver ASes. Tower Defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> studies two types of mitigation methods: reflecting, redirecting traffic to another destination, and mirroring, imitating the true destination to respond to incoming traffic. Compared with reflecting, the mirroring mitigation is harder to be widely used because it requires a copy of services on victims. Tower Defense aims at deploying prefix hijacking detection and mitigation systems. It uses several mitigation systems for one hijacking event, which is more complicated for practical application, and its greedy algorithm used for mitigation system deployment is inefficient because every time it selects a mitigation system, it needs to evaluate the mitigation impact of all other unselected ASes on the hijacking event.</p><p>ARTEMIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is an automatic and real-time hijack detection and mitigation system. It uses prefix-disaggregation for mitigation or outsources mitigation to organizations that offer outsourced services. Unlike the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, outsourcing mitigation does not need complex or large-scale cooperation with other networks. Therefore, compared with correcting false routes like <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, traffic redirecting like Tower Defense and ARTEMIS are more practical. However, ARTEMIS does not comprehensively analyze the mitigation effectiveness of different ASes. In order to better mitigate the prefix hijacking, it is crucial to identify properties of ASes with high mitigation effectiveness. This paper focuses on studying the impact of outsourcing mitigation from different aspects and systematically investigates the mitigation effectiveness of different ASes when they are selected as mitigators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we analyze various factors that influence the mitigation effectiveness of ASes, such as the number of providers, Tier-1 providers, degree, core number, AS type, and region. We also proposed a metric ReachInf to measure the mitigation potentiality of ASes and a selection method named ARS to select mitigators. According to the analysis, ASes with many Tier-1 providers or high tier providers may achieve higher mitigation effectiveness than Tier-1 ASes, and ARS can filter out ASes with high mitigation effectiveness. This work contributes to a better understanding of the mitigation power of ASes and the outsourcing mitigation mechanism. In addition, ARS's success in selecting mitigators demonstrates that routes announced by mitigators with high mitigation effectiveness are more acceptable than others. Therefore, based on this capability, a notification mechanism can be designed where the mitigators are used for transporting the hijack information in the BGP community, which will be put in our future work.</p></div>
