<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recently, Ajtal discovered a fascinating connection between the worst-case complexity and the average-case complexity of some wellknown lattice problems. Later, Ajtai and Dwork proposed a cryptosystem inspired by Ajtai's work, provably secure if a particular lattice problem is difficult in the worst-case. We present a heuristic attack (to recover the private key) against this celebrated cryptosystem. Experiments with this attack suggest that in order to be secure, implementations of the Ajtal-Dwork cryptosystem would require very large keys, making it impractical in a real-life environment. We also adopt a theoretical point of view: we show that there is a converse to the Ajtai-Dwork security result, by reducing the question of distinguishing encryptions of one from encryptions of zero to approximating some lattice problems. In particular, this settles the open question regarding the NP-hardness of the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem: from a recent result of Goldreich and Goldwasser, our result shows that breaking the Ajtal-Dwork cryptosystem is not NP-hard, assuming the polynomial-time hierarchy does not collapse. is completely open: CVP is presumably hard to approximate within a factor 0 0.99 .</p><p>2(1 g n) as shown m [5] but a result of Goldremh and Goldwasser <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> suggests that unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses, this inapproximability result cannot be extended to v ~.</p><p>Recently, in a beautiful paper, Ajtai [2]  found the first connection between the worst-case and the average-case complexity of SVP.

This reduction was improved in [8].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Lattices are discrete subgroups of some n-dimensional space and have been the subject of intense research, going back to Gauss, Dirichlet, Hermite and Minkowski, among others. More recently, lattices have been investigated from an algorithmic point of view and two basic problems have emerged: the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP). SVP refers to the question of computing the lattice vector with minimum non-zero euclidean length while CVP addresses the non-homogeneous analog of finding a lattice element minimizing the distance to a given vector. It has been known for some time that CVP is NP-complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Ajtal has recently proved that SVP is NP-hard for polynomial random reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The celebrated LLL algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> provides a partial answer to SVP since it runs in polynomial time and approximates the shortest vector within a factor of 2 n/~ where n denotes the dimension of the lattice. This has been improved to the bound (1 + e) n by Schnorr <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Babai <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> gave an algorithm that approximates the closest vector by a factor of (3/V~) n. The existence of polynomial bounds At this point, it was natural to ask whether or not the security level offered by the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem is exactly measured by the hardness of approximating lattice problems. In other terms, is there a converse to the Ajtai-Dwork security result ? The present paper shows that this is actually the case by reducing the question of distinguishing encryptions of one from encryptions of zero to approximating CVP or SVP (recall that AD encrypts bits). More precisely, we prove that if one can approximate CVP within a factor cn l'3s, then one can distinguish encryptions with a constant advantage d, where c and d are related constants. This is especially interesting in view of the result of Goldreich and Goldwasser quoted above since it seems to rule out any form of NP-hardness for AD, which was an open question. We prove a similar result for SVP, with a more restrictive factor. This shows that AD is essentially equivalent to approximating the shortest vector within a polynomial ratio and allows to reverse the basic paradigm of AD: for dimensions where lattice reduction algorithms behave well in practice, AD is insecure. This opened the way to a practical assessment of the security of AD for real-size parameters. We answer this question by presenting a heuristic attack suitable for implementation. First experiments showed that this attack was able to recover the private key in a short time for small parameters. Current experiments suggest that the attack is feasible even for real-size parameters: in order to be secure, implementations of the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem would require very large keys.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem is described. Section 3 presents our heuristic attack (to recover the private key) and practical experiments. Sections 4 and 5 deal with a converse to the Ajtai-Dwork security theorem. Section 4 uses a CVP approximation oracle, while section 5 uses a SVP approximation oracle. The reduction obtained in section 4 shows that breaking the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem is not NP-hard if the polynomial-time hierarchy does not collapse. Due to lack of space, section 4 and 5 do not include full proofs. These can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The appendix includes the missing proofs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Ajtai-Dwork Cryptosystem</head><p>In this section we recall the construction of Ajtai and Dwork <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, with the notations and the presentation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For any e between 0 and 1 ~, we denote by Z -4-e the set of real numbers for which the distance to the nearest integer is at most e. We denote the inner product of two vectors in the Euclidean space R n by (x,y). Given a set of n linearly independent vectors wl,... ,wn, the parallelepiped spanned by the w~'s is the set P(wx,... ,wn) of all linear combinations of the wi's with coefficients in [0,1[. Its width is the minimum over i of the Euclidean distance between wi and the hyperplane spanned by the other wj's. Reducing a vector v modulo a parallelepiped P(wl,..., wn) means obtaining a vector v' E P such that v' -v belongs to the lattice spanned by the wi's, which we denote by v' = v (mod P). To simplify the exposition, we present the scheme in terms of real numbers, but we always mean numbers with some fixed finite precision. Given a security parameter n (which is also the precision of the binary expansion for real numbers), we let m = n 3 and Pn = 2 nl~ We denote by Bn the big n-dimensional cube of side-length Pn. We also denote by Sn the small n-dimensional ball of radius n -s.</p><p>Given n, the private key is a uniformly chosen vector u in the n-dimensional unit ball. For such a private key, we denote by 7-/u the distribution on points in Bn induced by the following construction:</p><p>1. Pick a point a uniformly at random from {x E Bn : (x, u) E Z}. 2. Select ~l,.-., 6n uniformly at random from Sn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Output the point v ---a + ~i 6~.</head><p>The public key is obtained by picking the points wl,..., wn, vl,..., vm independently at random from the distribution 7/u, subject to the constraint that the width of the parallelepiped w = P(wl,..., wn) is at least n-2pn (which is likely to be satisfied, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>).</p><p>Encryption is bit-by-bit. To encrypt a '0', uniformly select bl,..., bm in {0,1}, and reduce the vector ~i~l blvi modulo the parallelepiped w. The vector obtained is the ciphertext. The ciphertext of '1' is just a randomly chosen vector in the parallelepiped w. To decrypt a ciphertext x with the private key u, compute 7" = (x,u). If 7" E Z 4-n -~, then x is decrypted as '0', and otherwise as '1'.</p><p>Thus, an encryption of '0' will always be decrypted as '0', and an encryption of T has a probability of 2n -1 to be decrypted as '0'. These decryption errors can be removed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). The main result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> states that a probabilistic algorithm distinguishing encryptions of a '0' from encryptions of a '1' with some polynomial advantage can be used to find the shortest nonzero vector in any n-dimensional lattice where the shortest vector v is unique, in the sense that any other vector whose length is at most nSllvll is parallel to v.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A Practical Attack</head><p>We describe in this section a heuristic attack to recover the private key. We first present the ideas underlying our attack, the attack itself and then the ex- We now use the notion of an orthogonai lattice introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>: if L is a lattice in Z n, the orthogonal lattice L • is defined as the set of points in Z n that are orthogonal to all the lattice points. Consider the vector V in Z rn whose coordinates are the ~'s. Theorem 1 shows that sufficiently short vectors of A~ correspond to vectors in V • which is a m-1 dimensional lattice in Z m. Corollary 3 shows that many such short vectors exist. We conjecture that there exist at least m -1 sufficiently short and linearly independent vectors in AB.</p><p>If one knows m-1 linearly independent vectors in V • then one can determine the one-dimensional lattice (V•177 one can find a vector V' E Z m generating (V• • There exists ~ e Z such that V = ~V ~. If all the ~'s are coprime (which happens with overwhelming probability), then e = -~1. Since one can exchange -u for u, one can assume that e = 1. And if one knows the V~'s, one can obtain an approximation of the private key u by solving a linear system. This is because each (v~, u) ~ V~ gives rise to a linear equation whose unknowns are the coordinates of u. If A is the matrix representing (Vl,..., vn) with respect to the canonical basis, then the multiplication of A -1 by the vector formed by V1,..., Vn is an approximation of u (one does not need to know all the ~'s, n of them are enough). The approximation is good because (vi, u) is close to I~ (difference less than n -7 in absolute value) and the coefficients of A -1 are very small (we omit the details but one can justify that they are roughly around p~-i in absolute value, because the coefficients of A can almost be considered as independent and uniformly distributed over ] -,on, pnD.</p><p>The attack is the following:</p><p>1. Obtain vectors in V l by finding short linear combinations of the vi's using lattice reduction algorithms. 2. When enough vectors in V • are found, compute (V• • and ~V. 3. Solve the linear system A.u ~ = W to obtain an approximation u ~ to the private key u, where A is the matrix representing vl,... ,Vn and W is the vector formed by V1,..., Vn.</p><p>For step 1, we do not reduce a complete lattice AZ (whose dimension m might be too large): we only keep m ~ random columns and reduce them. There are heuristic arguments explaining why one can still expect to find short linear combinations with only m ~ vectors vi's instead of m. Due to lack of space, we omit the details here: it is related to the fact that, given a low-dimensional lattice, a reduced basis for the corresponding orthogonal lattice is much smaller than for the lattice itself (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>). To find enough vectors, one repeats the random selection of columns. Since short vectors are found in an apparently random fashion, one can expect to find as many vectors as wanted.</p><p>For step 2, one has to compute a basis of the orthogonal lattice of a given lattice. To do so, one can use the polynomial time algorithm given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which uses lattice reduction algorithms. But there is a more practical method here: since the orthogonal lattice is one-dimensional only, one can compute it by a basic cross product, that is determinant computations. Actually one does not need to compute the complete cross product: n determinants suffice instead of m, because in step 3, only n coordinates of V are used. Note that each determinant is a n log n-bit integer.</p><p>We used the NTL library <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to conduct our experiments. Timings are given for a 170 Mhz Ultra-SPARC-I. We used the floating point variant (double and quadratic precision) of the LLL algorithm as our lattice reduction algorithm: no stronger algorithms were needed. Only steps 1 and 2 are time-consuming. For n = 8, we reduced the complete 512-dimensional lattice A~: step 1 took 3 hours, step 2 took less than half an hour and step 3 was immediate. The approximation u ~ was matching u with the n-bit precision. For n = 32, we chose rn ~ = 300 : each reduction of a partial 300-dimensional lattice gave 60 vectors in V -L in less than 4 hours. Actually, this running time might be decreased, as a complete LLL reduction is unnecessary. Hence, one could expect to find enough vectors in less than 100 days on a single machine, and the computations can easily be parallelized (each random combination of 300 columns can be reduced independently) to reduce the running time. Step 2 requires the computation of 32 determinants of huge but sparse matrices. The dimension of these matrices is 32,767, and there are less than 300 non-zero entries per line, making the computation feasible. Assuming that step 2 determined the Vi's, step 3 immediately gave a perfect approximation of u.</p><p>Hence a successful attack even for n = 32 looks feasible. Note that at least n 5 logn bits are required to store the public key (the vi's): for n = 32, this amounts to 20 megabytes, and the ciphertext for each bit is 6144 bits long. This shows that the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem is hardly practical even with marginal security.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>Deciphering with a CVP-oracle</p><p>We define an (n, k)-CVP-oracle to be any algorithm which, given a point x E R n and a n-dimensional lattice L, outputs a lattice point c~ E L such that for every /3 E L: dist(x, a) &lt; kdist(x,/3), where dist denotes the Euclidean distance. Each oracle call made by a Turing machine contributes by a single unit to the overall complexity of the machine.</p><p>Using such an oracle, we will see how one can distinguish in probabilistic polynomial time ciphertexts of '0' from ciphertexts of T, thanks to some properties of the keys. To any choice of the keys, we associate a particular lattice. Given a ciphertext, one can build a vector such that: if the ciphertext is a ciphertext of '0', this vector is likely to be close to the lattice ; and if the ciphertext is a ciphertext of '1', this vector is unlikely to be close enough. To check whether this vector is close enough, one calls an oracle.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have shown how to reduce the question of distinguishing encryptions of one from encryptions of zero in the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem to approximating CVP or SVP. For the sake of simplicity, our results were proved with the choice of constants from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Of course, the method extends to a more general setting as well, with the same proofs. In particular, the CVP-reduction implies that breaking the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem is unlikely to be NP-hard.</p><p>We have also presented a heuristic attack to recover the private key, given only the public key. It has been successfully implemented in the case of small parameters, and latest expriments suggest that the attack could be applied to real-life parameters in a reasonable time. This shows that unless major improvements are found, the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem is only of theoretical importance.</p><p>The expectation would be equal to zero if there was an odd power instead of 2k. Now, let v = a + )'~i 5i be a randomly chosen point from the distribution 7/u. We have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">E [dist(Z, (u, v)) 2k] &lt; E (u,<label>51</label></formula><p>) .</p><p>If we expand this product, we obtain a sum of m z~ terms. But all the terms for which some (u, 5i) has an odd exponent disappear. By the multinomial formula and the independence of the 5j's, this expectation is therefore equal to: Thus, by the moment inequality, (4) is satisfied with probability at least 1 -el with respect to the choice of Wl,..., wn, if we let M1 = 4krr2k(2k)! 2k+1. For <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, as in the proof of (2), we bound the expectation when the bi's are fixed. A first bound is obtained when the vi's are independent random variables uniformly distributed over the hypercube Bn. Then, we show that with the actual distribution of the vi's, the additional error is negligible, so that the bound of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is satisfied for sufficiently large n, thanks to Markov's inequality.</p><p>For the first bound, we generalize Lemma 7 with the same tricks we used to generalize Lemma 5. Let t = (tl,..., tn) be a vector in the n-dimensional unit sphere. Let s = (sl,..., Sn) be a randomly chosen point with uniform distribution from Bn. We have:</p><p>If we expand this product, we obtain m 2k terms. But all the terms for which some sj has an odd exponent disappear. We obtain by the multinomial formula: </p></div>
