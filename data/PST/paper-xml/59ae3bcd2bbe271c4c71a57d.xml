<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mobile edge computing (MEC) has risen as a promising technology to augment computational capabilities of mobile devices. Meanwhile, in-network caching has become a natural trend of the solution of handling exponentially increasing Internet traffic. The important issues in these two networking paradigms are computation offloading and content caching strategies, respectively. In order to jointly tackle these issues in wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing, we formulate computation offloading decision, resource allocation and content caching strategy as an optimization problem, considering the total revenue of the network. Furthermore, we transform the original problem into a convex problem and then decompose it in order to solve it in a distributed and efficient way. Finally, with recent advances in distributed convex optimization, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation results with different system parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>With the radically increasing popularity of smart phones, new mobile applications such as face recognition, natural language processing, augmented reality, etc. are emerging constantly. However, traditional wireless cellular networks are becoming incapable to meet the exponentially growing demand not only in high data rate but also in high computational capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In order to address the data rate issue, the heterogeneous network structure was recently proposed, in which multiple low-power, local coverage enhancing small cells are deployed in one macro cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Since the same radio resource could be shared among small cells and with the macro cell, small cell networks have been considered as a promising solution to improving spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, therefore consisting one of the key components of next generation wireless cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. C. Wang, Q. Chen and L. Tang are with the Chongqing Key Lab of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecomm. (CQUPT), Chongqing, 400065, P. R. China (e-mail: wangchen-meng09@gmail.com, chenqb@cqupt.edu.cn and tangl@cqupt.edu.cn).</p><p>C. Liang and F. R. Yu are with the Dept. of Systems and Computer Eng., Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada (e-mail: Richard.yu@carleton.ca and chengchaoliang@sce.carleton.ca).</p><p>Nevertheless, severe inter-cell interference may be incurred due to spectrum reuse, which will significantly deteriorate network performance. Without effective spectrum resource allocation mechanism, the overall spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency of the network might become even worse than that of a network without small cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To address the spectrum allocation issue, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposes a graph colouring method to assign physical resource blocks (PRBs) to UEs. The study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> presents a spectrum allocation algorithm based on game theory, in which the PRB allocation can reach a Nash equilibrium of the game.</p><p>On the other hand, to address the computational capability issue, mobile cloud computing (MCC) systems have been proposed to enable mobile devices to utilize the powerful computing capability in the cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In order to further reduce the latency and make the solution more economical, the fog computing has been proposed to deploy computing resources closer to end devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. A similar technique, called mobile edge computing (MEC), has attracted great interest in wireless cellular networks recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. MEC enables the mobile user's equipment (UEs) to perform computation offloading to send their computation tasks to the MEC server via wireless cellular networks. Then each UE is associated with a clone in MEC server, which executes the computation tasks on behalf of that UE. A number of previous works have discussed the computation offloading problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, from latency reduction and energy saving, or QoS (Quality of Service) promoting perspectives.</p><p>In addition, the server in MEC system can realize an innetwork caching function <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, similar to the function provided by information-centric networking (ICN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which is able to reduce replicate information transmissions. According to the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, in-network caching has the capability of significantly improving the quality of Internet content transmissions (e.g., reducing latency and increasing throughput) by moving the content closer to users. A number of research efforts have been dedicated to content caching strategies. The caching strategies proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> are based on where routers are located in the topology, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> designs the strategy according to the content popularity.</p><p>Although some outstanding works have been dedicated to studying computation offloading, resource allocation and content caching, these important aspects were generally considered separately in the existing works. However, as shown in the following, it is necessary to jointly address these issues together to improve the performance of next generation wireless networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to jointly consider computation offloading, spectrum and computation resource allocation and content caching in order to improve the performance of wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing. The motivations behind our work are based on the following observations.</p><p>• Computation offloading, resource allocation and content caching are all parts of the entire system, and they all contribute to the end-to-end user experience, which can be hardly guaranteed by the optimization of one single segment of the whole system <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. • If multiple UEs choose to offload their computation tasks to the MEC server via small cell networks simultaneously, severe interference can be generated, which will decrease the data rate. Moreover, the MEC server could be overloaded. In this case, it is not beneficial for all the UEs to offload their tasks to the MEC server. Instead, some UEs should be selected to offload their computations, while others should execute their computations locally. • Different amounts of spectrum and computation resources should be allocated to different UEs to fulfill different user demands. • Due to limited caching space of the MEC server, different caching strategies should be applied upon different contents, in order to maximize the caching revenue. Therefore, an integrated framework for computation offloading, resource allocation and content caching has the potential to significantly improve the performance of wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the joint design of computation offloading, resource allocation and content caching has not been addressed in previous works. The distinct features of this paper are as follows.</p><p>• We formulate the computation offloading decision, resource allocation, and content caching in wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing as an optimization problem. • We transform the original non-convex problem into a convex problem and provide the proof of the convexity of the transformed problem. • We decompose the problem and apply alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in an efficient and practical way. • Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with different system parameters. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system model under consideration is described in Section II. The original optimization problem is formulated and is transformed into a convex problem in Section III. Furthermore, it is decomposed in order to employ a distributed problem solving method. Section IV presents the progress of problem solving by ADMM. Simulation results are discussed in Section V. Finally, we conclude this study in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>In this section, the system model adopted in this work is described. We first describe the network model, then we present the communication model, computation model and caching model in details. Finally, the utility function of the optimization problem is proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Network Model</head><p>An environment of one macrocell and N small cells in the terminology of LTE standards is considered here. The macro cell is connected to the Internet through the core network of cellular communication system. An MEC server is placed in the macro eNodeB (MeNB), and all the N small cell eNodeBs (SeNBs) are connected to the MeNB as well as the MEC server. In this paper, it is assumed that the SeNBs are connected to the MeNB in wired manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The set of small cells is denoted by N = {1, 2, ..., N }, and we use n to refer to the nth small cell (SeNB). It is assumed that SeNB n is associated with K n mobile UEs. We let K n = {1, 2, ..., K n } denote the set of UEs associating with SeNB n, and k n refers to the kth UE which associates with the nth SeNB. In this paper, we consider single-antenna UEs and SeNBs. The network model is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>We assume that each UE has a computationally intensive and delay sensitive task to be completed. Each UE can offload the computation to the MEC server through the SeNB with which it is associated, or execute the computation task locally. UEs can request content from the Internet, then the Internet content will be transmitted through macro base station (MeNB) to UEs. Upon the first transmission of any particular Internet content, the MEC server can choose whether to store the content or not. If the content were stored, it can be used by other UEs without another transmission from Internet in the future. In this paper, we consider two logical roles in the network: mobile network operator (MNO) and MEC system operator (MSO). The mobile network operators possess and operate the radio resources and physical infrastructures of the wireless network, including spectrum, backhaul, radio access networks, transmission networks, core networks, etc., while the MEC system operators own the MEC servers, lease physical resources (e.g., spectrum and backhaul) from MNO and provide mobile edge computing services to UEs. The MSO will charge the UEs for receiving mobile edge computing services.</p><p>Similar to many previous works in mobile cloud computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and mobile networking <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, to enable tractable analysis and get useful insights, we employ a quasi-static scenario where the set of mobile device users K n , ∀n remains unchanged during a computation offloading period (e.g., within several seconds), while it may change across different periods. Since both the communication and computation aspects play a key role in mobile edge computing, next the communication and computation models are introduced in detail.</p><p>The notations that will be used in the rest of this paper are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Communication Model</head><p>Every SeNB in the network is linked to the MEC server, so each UE could offload its computation task to the MEC server via the SeNB to which it is connected. We denote a kn ∈ {0, 1}, ∀n, k as the computation offloading decision of UE k n . Specifically, we have a kn = 0 if UE k n were determined to compute its task locally on the mobile device. We have a kn = 1 if UE k n were chosen to offload the computation to the MEC server via wireless access. So we have a = {a kn } kn∈Kn,n∈N as the offloading decision profile.</p><p>In this paper, we consider the case where spectrum used by small cells is overlaid, which means there exists interference between small cells. However, spectrum within one small cell is orthogonally assigned to every UE, so there will be no interference within one small cell. Only uplink direction transmissions are considered, which means transmission is from a UE to the SeNB to which it is associated, and interference is from a UE to a neighboring SeNB. In this paper, we assume that the interference only occurs when UEs served by various SeNBs are occupying the same frequency simultaneously. The whole available spectrum bandwidth is B Hz. The backhaul capacity between MeNB and MEC server is L bps, and the backhaul capacity of SeNB n is L n bps. According to Shannon bound, the spectrum efficiency of UE k n is given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e kn = log 2      1 + p kn G kn,n σ + N ∑ m=1,m̸ =n Km ∑ i=1 p im G im,n      , ∀n, k,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where p kn is the transmission power density of UE k n , and G kn,n , G im,n stand for the channel gain between UE k n and SeNB n, the channel gain between UE i m and SeNB n, respectively. σ denotes the power spectrum density of additive white Gaussian noise.</p><p>We denote s kn ∈ [0, 1], ∀n, k as the percentage of radio spectrum allocated to UE k n by small cell n, thus ∑ kn∈Kn s kn ≤ 1, ∀n. We have s = {s kn } kn∈Kn,n∈N as the radio spectrum allocation profile. Then the expected instantaneous data rate of UE k n , R kn is calculated as R kn (a, s) = a kn s kn Be kn , ∀n, k.</p><p>(</p><p>The data rate cannot exceed the backhaul capacity of SeNB n, thus ∑ kn∈Kn R kn ≤ L n , ∀n must hold. The total data rate of all the UEs cannot exceed the backhaul capacity of MeNB, thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn R kn ≤ L must hold.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Computation Model</head><p>For the computation model, we consider that each UE k n has a computation task W kn (Z kn , D kn ), which can be computed either locally on the mobile device or remotely on the MEC server via computation offloading, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Here Z kn stands for the size of input data, including program codes and input parameters, and D kn denotes the total number of CPU cycles required to accomplish the computation task W kn . A UE k n can use the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to obtain the information of Z kn and D kn . We next discuss the computation overhead in terms of processing time for both local and MEC computing approaches.</p><p>1) Local Computing: For the local computing approach, the computation task W kn is executed locally on each mobile device. We denote f (l) kn as the computational capability (i.e., CPU cycles per second) of UE k n . It is allowed that different UEs may have different computational capabilities. The computation execution time T (l) kn of task W kn executed locally by UE k n is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T (l) kn = D kn f (l) kn . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>2) MEC Server Computing: For the MEC server computing approach, a UE k n will offload its computation task W kn through wireless access to SeNB n, then through the connection from SeNB n to the MEC server. Then the MEC server will execute the computation task instead of UE k n . For offloading the computation task, a UE k n will incur the consumption on time when transmitting computation input data to the MEC server. According to the communication model presented in Subsection II-B, the time costs for transmitting the computation input data of size Z kn are calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T (e) kn,of f (a, s) = Z kn R kn (a, s) . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>The MEC server will execute the computation task after offloading. Let f (e) kn denote the computational capability (i.e., CPU cycles per second) of the MEC server assigned to UE k n . Then the execution time of the MEC server on task W kn is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">T (e) kn,exe = D kn f (e) kn .</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">)<label>5</label></formula><p>Then the total execution time of the task of UE k n is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T (e) kn (a, s) = T (e) kn,of f (a, s) + T (e) kn,exe .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In Section V, we will use this expression to assess the average UE time consumption for executing computation tasks in simulations. Similar to the study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the time consumption of computation outcome transmission from the MEC server to UE k n is neglected in this work, due to the fact that the size of computation outcome data in general is much smaller  than that of the computation input data including the mobile system settings, program codes and input parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Caching Model</head><p>We denote h kn ∈ {0, 1}, ∀n, k as the caching strategy for UE k n . Specifically, we have h kn = 1 if the MEC server decides to cache the content requested by UE k n and h kn = 0 otherwise. So we have h = {h kn } kn∈Kn,n∈N as the caching decision profile.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, the reward of caching in wireless networks can be the reduction of backhaul delay or the alleviation of backhaul bandwidth. In this paper the alleviated backhaul bandwidth between macro cell and the Internet is adopted as the caching reward. Thus, the reward (alleviated backhaul bandwidth) of caching the content requested by UE k n can be given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Caching reward = q kn Rh kn , (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where R is the average single UE data rate in the system, and q kn is the request rate (by other UEs) of the content first requested by UE k n . According to the statistics of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, if the requested content has a constant size, the request rate follows Zipf popularity distribution, therefore can be calculated as q(i) = 1/i β , where i stands for the i-th most popular content, and β is a constant whose typical value is 0.56 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Therefore, if the size of the content first requested by UE k n is known, the request rate of other UEs upon the same content could be derived from the equation given above. In fact, the modeling of request rates of the caching content is still under research by many scholars. Since we adopt constant request rates in this paper, the modeling of request rates is above the scope of this paper.</p><p>It is worth noting that the storage capability of the MEC server is not unlimited, thus the sum size of all the cached content cannot exceed the total storage capability of the MEC server. In other words,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn h kn o kn ≤ Y must hold,</formula><p>where Y is the total storage capability of the MEC server, and o kn is the size of the content first requested by UE k n . In this paper, it is assumed that o kn ∀k, n is constant and we adopt o kn = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Utility Function</head><p>In this paper, we set the maximization of the revenue of MSO as our goal. MSO rents spectrum and backhaul from MNO, and the unit price for leasing spectrum from small cell n is defined as δ n per Hz, while the unit price of backhaul between small cell n and macro cell is defined as η n per bps. The MSO will charge UEs for transmitting computation input data to MEC server, and the unit price being charged is defined as θ n per bps. So the net revenue of MSO for assigning radio resources to UE k n is calculated as ι kn = s kn Ψ kn = s kn (θ n Be kn -δ n B -η n Be kn ).</p><p>We next calculate the revenue of MSO for allocating computation resource to UEs. First, we define c kn ∈ [0, 1], ∀n, k as the percentage of MEC server computation resource allocated to UE k n , thus ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn c kn ≤ 1. We have c = {c kn } kn∈Kn,n∈N as the computation resource allocation profile. Without losing generality, the different sizes of computation tasks and different local computation capability of different UEs should be taken into account. So we define that the MSO will charge UE k n only for the difference between MEC computation resource allocated to every unit computation task and the local computation resource assigned to every unit computation task, and the unit price is λ n for small cell n. Then the net revenue of allocating computation resource to UE k n is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Ω kn = λ n (c kn F /D kn -f (l)</formula><p>kn /D kn ), where F stands for the total computation resource of MEC server. Note that the reciprocal of c kn F/D kn is the time consumption for MEC server executing computation task D kn , and the reciprocal of f (l) kn /D kn is the time consumption for UE k n locally executing task D kn . This implies that the amount of computation resource assigned to every unit computation task can reflect the time consumption of executing this task.</p><p>We next discuss the revenue of MSO for caching Internet content requested by UEs. We define the unit price of leasing the backhaul between the macro cell and Internet is ζ per bps, and the cost in the memory for caching one content is ϖ. If the content first requested by UE k n was stored by the MEC server, the alleviated backhaul bandwidth in the future should be ζq kn R. And the memory cost for storing that content is ϖ. So the long term revenue of caching the Internet content first requested by UE k n is calculated as, Λ kn = ζq kn R -ϖ.</p><p>Next we formulate the utility function of MSO as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">U = ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn u (a kn ι kn + a kn Ω kn ) + h kn Λ kn = ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn u [ a kn s kn Ψ kn + a kn λ n ( c kn F D kn - f (l) kn D kn ) ] + h kn Λ kn = ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn a kn u ( s kn Ψ kn + c kn λ n F D kn - λ n f (l) kn D kn ) + h kn Λ kn ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where u(•) is an utility function which is nondecreasing and convex. Since h kn Λ kn is always non-negative due to problem optimality, it can be put outside of the function u(•). It is equivalent to take a kn outside of the function u(•). If a kn = 0, it means UE k n will not offload the task to the MEC server, so MSO will not earn, then a kn u(s kn , c kn ) = u(a kn , s kn , c kn ) = 0; if a kn = 1, it means MSO may earn, and a kn u(s kn , c kn ) = u(a kn , s kn , c kn ). Here the logarithmic function, which has been used frequently in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, is adopted as the utility function, given as, u(x) = logx when x &gt; 0 and u(x) = -∞ otherwise.</p><p>Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">U ′ = ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn a kn u ( s kn Ψ kn + c kn λ n F D kn ) + h kn Λ kn . (9) Because λ n f (l)</formula><p>kn /D kn is constant, when U ′ reaches the maximum value, U reaches the maximum as well, i.e., the MSO reaches the maximum income. Let λ n F/D kn = Φ kn , next we will use <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> as our objective function of the optimization problem.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">U ′ = ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn a kn u (s kn Ψ kn + c kn Φ kn ) + h kn Λ kn</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM FORMULATION, TRANSFORMATION AND DECOMPOSITION</head><p>In order to maximize the utility function of MSO, we formulate it as an optimization problem and transform it into a convex optimization problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Formulation</head><p>We adopt the utility function proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">∑ m∈N /{n} ∑ km∈Km a km p km G km,n ≤ I n , ∀n C4 : ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn a kn c kn ≤ 1 C5 : a kn ( c kn F D kn - f (l) kn D kn ) ≥ 0, ∀k, n C6 : ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn h kn ≤ Y.</formula><p>(11) The first set of constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> C1 guarantee that in every small cell, the sum of spectrum allocated to all the offloading UEs cannot exceed the total available spectrum of that small cell. Constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> C2 mean the sum data rate of all offloading UEs which associate with SeNB n cannot exceed the backhaul capacity of small cell n. If too many UEs are allowed to offload computation tasks to the MEC server, the transmitting delay will be high due to high interference. In order to guarantee a relatively high data rate, constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> C3 are proposed to ensure that the interference on SeNB n caused by all offloading UEs which are served by other SeNBs doesn't exceed a predefined threshold, I n . Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> C4 is due to the request that the sum of computation resource allocated to all offloading UEs in the whole system cannot exceed the total amount of computation resource (total computational capability) of the MEC server. Because we removed (-λ n f (l) kn /D kn ) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">8</ref>), we need constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> C5 to guarantee that the computation resource allocated to each offloading UE k n is no less than that of itself. Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> C6 guarantees that the sum size of all the cached content doesn't exceed the total storage capability of the MEC server.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem Transformation</head><p>Problem ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) is difficult to solve due to the following observations:</p><p>• Due to the fact that a and h are binary variables, the feasible set of problem ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) is not convex. • There exist product relationships between {a kn } and linear function of {s kn }, as well as {c kn }, so that the objective function of problem ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) is not a convex function.</p><p>• The problem has a quite large size. If we assume that the average number of UEs in one small cell is k, the number of variables in this problem could reach 4kN , and the complexity for a central algorithm to find a globally optimal solution will be O((kN ) x ) (x &gt; 0, x = 1 implies a linear algorithm while x &gt; 1 implies a polynomial time algorithm) even if we simply consider all the variables as binary variables.</p><p>In addition, the number of small cells in one macro cell is increasing as time goes on, which results in an even more radically increasing complexity in our problem. As is shown, problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> is a mixed discrete and non-convex optimization problem, and such problems are usually considered as NP-hard problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Therefore, a transformation and simplification of the original problem are necessary. The transformation of the problem is composed of the following two steps:</p><p>1) Binary variable relaxation: In order to transform the non-convex feasible set of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> into a convex set, we need to relax binary variables a and h into real value variables as 0 ≤ a kn ≤ 1, 0 ≤ h kn ≤ 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The relaxed variables can be interpreted as the time fraction of access to the MEC computation resource of UE k n and the time fraction of sharing the content cache introduced by the request of UE k n , respectively.</p><p>2) Substitution of the product term: Due to the nonconvex objective function, the problem is still intractable even though we relax the variables. Next we will propose a proposition of the equivalent problem of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> to make the problem solvable.</p><p>Proposition 1: If we define skn = s kn a kn , ckn = c kn a kn , and a kn u[(s kn Ψ kn + ckn Φ kn )/a kn ] = 0 when a kn = 0, the following formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn ckn ≤ 1 C5 : ckn F D kn -a kn f (l) kn D kn ≥ 0, ∀k, n C6 : ∑ n∈N ∑ kn∈Kn h kn ≤ Y C7 : a kn ≥ skn , a kn ≥ ckn , ∀k, n. (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>Proof: This proof of proposition 1 is motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. If we substitute skn = s kn a kn and ckn = c kn a kn into (12), we can recover the original optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> except the point when a kn = 0. Next we will discuss about this point. Suppose a kn = 0, then s kn = 0 and c kn = 0 will certainly hold because of the problem optimality. Apparently, if UE k n will not offload computation task to MEC server, SeNB n will not allocate any spectrum resource to UE n, and MEC server will not assign any computation resource to it, either. Thus, the complete mapping between {a kn , s kn , c kn } and {a kn , skn , ckn } is as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">s kn = { skn /a kn , a kn &gt; 0, 0, otherwise,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">c kn = { ckn /a kn , a kn &gt; 0, 0, otherwise.

Note that constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> C7 guarantee that skn and ckn don't exceed a kn , and that is because of s kn ∈ [0, 1] and c kn ∈ [0, 1].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Convexity</head><p>In this subsection, we will discuss the convexity of problem (12) using the well known perspective function <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Proposition 2: If problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">12</ref>) is feasible, it is jointly convex with respect to all the optimization variables a, s, c and h.</p><p>Proof: This proof of proposition 2 is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. f (t, x) = x log(t/x), t ≥ 0, x ≥ 0 is the well-known perspective function of f (x) = log x.

Since (s kn Ψ kn + ckn Φ kn ) are linear with respect to skn and ckn , log(s kn Ψ kn + ckn Φ kn ) is a concave function. Then a kn log[(s kn Ψ kn + ckn Φ kn )/a kn ] is concave due to the fact that it is the perspective function of log(s kn Ψ kn + ckn Φ kn ). The perspective function of a concave function is concave <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Furthermore, h kn Λ kn is linear, then it is obvious that our objective function of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, i.e., a kn log[(s kn Ψ kn +c kn Φ kn )/a kn ]+h kn Λ kn is concave. On the other hand, all the constraints of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> are linear (the feasible set of the problem is a convex set), so problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">12</ref>) is a convex optimization problem.</p><p>A lot of methods could be applied to solve a convex optimization problem. But as far as our problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">12</ref>) is concerned, as mentioned above, the size of the problem becomes appreciably large as the number of small cells grows. In addition, if a centralized algorithm is adopted in the MEC server, the signaling overhead of delivering local information (e.g., channel status information (CSI)) to the MEC server could be extremely high. Therefore, it will be more efficient to employ a distributed algorithm which is running on each SeNB as well as the MEC server. In the next section, we will decouple the optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> in order to enable the application of a distributed optimization problem solving method, namely alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Problem Decomposition</head><p>In order to make it possible for each SeNB to participate in the computation for problem solving, we need to separate problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> so that it can be solved in a distributed manner. However, optimization variables a, c and h in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> are considered as global variables, which are not separable in the problem (Specifically speaking, it is constraints (12) C3, C4 and C6 that make the problem inseparable). Thus, in order to make the problem separable, we introduce the local copies of the global variables. Since the global variables concern all the small cells in the network, which means they cannot be handled in any single small cell, we create a copy for every global variable in each small cell. Thus each small cell can independently conduct their computation for problem solving with their local copies. For ease of description, we define the following set as the local variable feasible set of each small cell n ∈ N :</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">ξ n =                                  ân sn ĉn ĥn ∑ kn∈Kn skn ≤ 1 ∑ kn∈Kn skn Be kn ≤ L n ∑ j∈N /{n} ∑ kj ∈Kj ân kj p kj G kj ,n ≤ I n ∑ j∈N ∑ kj ∈Kj ĉn kj ≤ 1 ĉn kj F/D kj -ân kj f (l) kj /D kj ≥ 0, ∀k, j ∑ j∈N ∑ kj ∈Kj ĥn kj ≤ Y ân kn ≥ skn , ân kn ≥ ĉn kn , ∀k                                  , ∀n.</formula><p>(19) Note that ξ n is proprietary for small cell n and is completely decoupled from other small cells.</p><p>Next we give the local utility function of each small cell n ∈ N as follows (</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">v n =            - [ ∑</formula><p>Now it is obvious that in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> the objective functions v n with feasible sets ξ n are separable with respect to all the small cells in the system. But the consensus constraints (21) C1-C3 remain coupled upon all the small cells. That is exactly what we want. The separation of the objective functions enables each small cell to independently handle the subproblem related to itself, while the persistence of coupling of the consensus constraints (21) C1-C3 guarantees the consistency of all the local copies with each other, as well as with the real global variables. In the next section we will apply Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in a distributed fashion.</p></div>

We adopt the following algorithm 2 to recover the binary variables a and h. In algorithm 2 we use a as an example, and the same algorithm is applied to h. It should be mentioned that the recovery of binary variables creates a gap between our results and the upper bound results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Feasibility, Complexity and Summary of the Algorithm</head><p>If the computational capability and storage capability of the MEC server is too low, or the cost of the spectrum is too high, the utility function of our problem may become nonpositive under all possible solutions. In that case, the optimal solution would be {a * , s * , c * , h * } = { -→ 0 , -→ 0 , -→ 0 , -→ 0 }, which means that all the UEs in system will execute their computation tasks locally, and no spectrum and computational resources are allocated to any UE. Besides, no requested Internet content will be stored by the MEC server. This case may be treated as the problem becomes infeasible. However, except for the extreme cases, the MEC server could allow at least one UE offload its computation task or store at least one content, and gain a positive revenue, due to the fact that a typical MEC server could always have a much higher computational capability and storage capability than a single UE. Now let us discuss about the complexity of our algorithm by comparing it with the complexity of the centralized algorithm. First we assume that the average number of UEs in each small cell is k, and the total number of small cells is N . Thus the size of input for the centralized algorithm would be kN . If the centralized algorithm adopted the primal-dual interior-point method for convex optimization problem solving at each input, the complexity would be O((kN ) x ) with x &gt; 0, where x = 1 implies a linear algorithm while x &gt; 1 implies a polynomial time algorithm.

Thus the sum of time complexity in each iteration would be O(k x ) + kN y + kz = O(k x ). Assuming P stands for the number of iterations needed for the algorithm convergence, the overall time complexity of the distributed algorithm would be O(k x )P . As will be shown in simulation, the number of iterations before algorithm convergence is not large. So it can be seen that our proposed distributed algorithm can significantly reduce the time complexity compared to the centralized algorithm. Our overall resources allocation algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>In this section, simulation results of the proposed decentralized scheme are presented in comparison with the centralized scheme and several baseline schemes. The simulation is run on a Matlab-based simulator. Unless   otherwise mentioned, most of the simulations employ the following scenario. We consider 10-50 small cells that are randomly deployed in a 120 × 120 m 2 area. It is worth noting that most of the results of simulation studies in this section are based on an average over a number of Monte Carlo simulations for various system parameters. There are 4-10 UEs connected to one SeNB, as mentioned in Section II. The transmission power of single UE, P n is set to 100 mW. The channel gain models presented in 3GPP standardization are adopted here. The total size of the Internet content is 1000 files, and the storage capability of the MEC server is 1000 files. The main simulation parameters employed in the simulations, unless mentioned otherwise, are summarized in table II.</p><p>We first present the convergence of the proposed ADMM-based algorithm with different values of parameter ρ. As is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, the utilities of ADMM-based algorithm increase dramatically in the first 15 iterations and then enter a stable status within the first 40 iterations. So it is proper to say that the decentralized algorithm can converge quickly. All the three iterative progresses converge to the same utility value eventually. The progress with a ρ value ρ = 1.2 converges fastest, while ρ = 0.4 slowest, but the difference is not significant. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, the gap between ADMM-based algorithm and centralized algorithm is narrow. Next the percentages of offloading UEs in all UEs with an increasing total number of small cells are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>. Here the number of UEs connected to each SeNB is set as 6. The offloading UE percentages of ADMM-based algorithm and centralized algorithm are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>. The percentage of offloading UEs remains 100 with small total number of small cells, but as the total number of small cells keeps increasing, the percentage of offloading UEs begins to decline. This is because when the total number of small cells is small enough, all the UEs are allowed to offload their computation tasks in order to maximize the network revenue, on the other hand, when the total number of small cells becomes large enough, there will be more UEs that tend to offload their computation tasks to the MEC server, and this would cause severe interference to each other, so the algorithm automatically rejects some of the offloading requests generated by UEs.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> show the spectrum and computation resources distribution among all the UEs in system, respectively. Here we only set 4 small cells in system, and there are 4 UEs associating to each SeNB. In this case all the 16 UEs are allowed to offload their computation tasks to the MEC server. As we can see, due to different channel conditions and sizes of computation tasks of different UEs, the resource allocation among UEs is not uniform, in order to reach the optimal utility value. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>, the resource allocation decisions of our ADMMbased algorithm are compared with that of the centralized algorithm. As is shown, except for slight discrepancies on a few UEs, they approximately coincide with each other. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows the total alleviated backhaul usage with respect to an increasing number of small cells. Note that total alleviated backhaul means the accumulated alleviation of backhaul usage upon all the UEs in system. As is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>, the alleviated backhaul of our proposed ADMMbased algorithm is very close to that of the centralized algorithm. The alleviated backhaul of both algorithms keeps increasing with an increasing number of small cells     Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> shows the revenue of MSO (utility value) with respect to the increasing computational capability, where the total number of SeNBs is 20. The revenue of ADMMbased algorithm is shown by the red line, in comparison with revenue of centralized algorithm (in blue line) and other benchmark solutions (Which are, ADMM solution without caching, ADMM solution with spectrum uniformly allocated, ADMM solution with computation resource uniformly allocated, spectrum and computation resource uniformly allocated, respectively). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>, 8 and 9, we also calculate the revenue before the binary variables are recovered and present them, which serve as the upper bound results and are given the legend "Upper bound", to demonstrate that the binary variables recovery operation does not significantly reduce the algorithm performance. The centralized algorithm achieves the highest revenue among all the solutions, but it is obvious that the gap between ADMM-based algorithm and centralized algorithm is not wide. In contrast, ADMM with uniform spectrum allocation solution and ADMM with uniform computation resource allocation solution can just achieve much lower revenue. This is because uniform resource allocation usually cannot reach the optimal revenue. Then it is no wonder the solution with uniform spectrum and computation resource allocation achieves the lowest MSO revenue. Finally, without the revenue of alleviated backhaul bandwidth, ADMM solution without caching can only achieve a much lower total revenue compared to joint ADMM-based solution.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> shows the revenue of MSO (utility value) with respect to the increasing number of small cells. It can be seen that with an increasing number of small cells, the revenues of all the solutions increase dramatically at first, because with more and more small cells joining into the system, the spectrum can be reused among more and more small cells, then the MSO could gain more from allocating spectrum to more small cells. Nevertheless, when the number of small cells reaches about 10, the acceleration of the increasing revenue significantly goes down. The main reason is that when there are too many small cells in the system, all those UEs will cause severe interference to each other during the computation tasks offloading process, so the algorithm automatically declined some of the offloading requests generated by the UEs. Besides, the computation resource of the MEC server cannot be reused at the same time, so if there are too many offloading UEs, the amount of computation resource assigned to each UE will decrease, which implies that the MSO will gain less from a single UE. The centralized algorithm and our proposed ADMMbased algorithm achieve relatively high revenue among all the six solutions. Again, because of the uniform allocation of spectrum and computation resources, the other three solutions in which uniform resource allocation strategies are adopted can just achieve much lower revenue. Similarly, due to lack of revenue from alleviated backhaul bandwidth, the revenue of ADMM solution without caching is also low.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>, the revenue of ADMM is compared with those of the centralized algorithm and the other four baseline solutions. In this figure, the number of small cells is set as 20. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref> that the revenue of our proposed ADMM algorithm is close to the revenue achieved by the centralized algorithm under various spectrum bandwidth conditions. The solution of ADMM with uniform computation resource allocation but optimal spectrum allocation can achieve relatively higher revenue compared with the other two uniform solutions (ADMM with uniform spectrum allocation and uniform spectrum and computation resource allocation). This is mainly because of the fact that spectrum allocation usually plays a more important role in earning interest of MSO, and this in turn is due to the fact that unlike computation resource of MEC server, the spectrum resource could be reused simultaneously among UEs in different small cells.</p><p>Next we discuss the average UE time consumption in the system for executing computation tasks, and the execution 1536-1276 (c) 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.  time expression proposed in Section II-C2 is employed here to present the results. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">10</ref> shows the average UE time consumption of ADMM based algorithm compared with that of the centralized algorithm, local computation solution and other three baseline solutions. The number of small cells here is 20. The y axis is the average time consumptions of all the UEs in system and the x axis is the size of computation tasks W kn (including Z kn and D kn ), expressed in times of the regular size of computation task. Without losing generality, different UEs are considered to have different regular sizes of computation tasks, but the regular sizes are all around the values shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">II</ref>. The largest time consumption is achieved by local computation solution, in which all the UEs in system execute their computation tasks on local devices. Because of the shortage of computational resources, the local computation solution consumes much time, especially when the size of computation task is large. The benchmark solution in which both MEC computation and spectrum resources are uniformly achieves less time consumption compared with local computation solution. This is due to the fact that the MEC server is more powerful than the UE devices. Because the resource allocation is not optimized, the advantage over local computation solution is not significant. ADMM with uniform computation resource allocation and ADMM with uniform spectrum resource allocation consume less time than the two solutions discussed above. The centralized algorithm consumes the least time among all the solutions. But as we can see, the gap between centralized algorithm and our proposed ADMM based algorithm is narrow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we presented an ADMM-based decentralized algorithm for computation offloading, resource allocation and Internet content caching optimization in heterogeneous wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing. We formulated the computation offloading decision, spectrum resource allocation, MEC computation resource allocation, and content caching issues as an optimization problem. Then, in order to tackle this problem in an efficient way, we presented an ADMM-based distributed solution, followed by a discussion about the feasibility and complexity of the algorithm. Finally, the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme was presented in comparison with the centralized solution and several baseline solutions. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed scheme can achieve better performance than other baseline solutions under various system parameters. Future work is in progress to consider wireless network virtualization in the proposed framework.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This work is jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61571073), the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2014AA01A701), and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).</figDesc></figure>
