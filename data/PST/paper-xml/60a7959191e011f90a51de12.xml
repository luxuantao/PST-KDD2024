<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable the traditional recommender systems to explicitly acquire user preferences towards items and attributes through interactive conversations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely adopted to learn conversational recommendation policies to decide what attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at each conversation turn. However, existing methods mainly target at solving one or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated conversation and recommendation components, which restrict the scalability and generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In the light of these challenges, we propose to formulate these three decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to systematically integrate conversation and recommendation components, we develop a dynamic weighted graph based RL method to learn a policy to select the action at each conversation turn, either asking an attribute or recommending items. Further, to deal with the sample efficiency issue, we propose two action selection strategies for reducing the candidate action space according to the preference and entropy information. Experimental results on two benchmark CRS datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enhances the scalability and stability of CRS.</p></div>

Since it has the natural advantage of explicitly acquiring user's preferences and revealing the reasons behind recommendation, CRS has become one of the trending research topics for recommender systems and is gaining increasing attention. Unlike traditional recommender systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> or interactive recommender systems (IRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, which mainly focus on solving the problem of which items to recommend, there exists generally the other two core research questions for CRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, namely what questions to ask and when to ask or recommend. Recent works have demonstrated the importance of interactivity of asking clarifying questions in CRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. More importantly, deciding when to ask or recommend is the key to coordinating conversation and recommendation for developing an effective CRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>Different problem settings of CRS have been proposed, either from the perspective of dialog systems, being a variation of taskoriented dialog <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, or from the perspective of recommender systems, being an enhanced interactive recommender system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. In this work, we study the multi-round conversational recommendation (MCR) setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, where the system asks questions about users' preferences on certain attributes or recommends items multiple times, and the goal is to make successful recommendation with the minimum number of interactions.</p><p>In MCR scenario, the CRS is typically formulated as a multi-step decision-making process and solved by reinforcement learning (RL) methods for policy learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(a), RL-based IRS is only required to learn the policy to decide which items to recommend. However, the situation is more complicated in CRS, since there are two components that need to be coherently considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, i.e., conversation and recommendation components. Existing methods CRM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and EAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> employ policy gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to improve the strategies of when and what attributes to ask, while the recommendation decision is made by an external recommendation model. In order to reduce the action space in policy learning, another state-of-the-art method SCPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> only considers learning the policy of when to ask or recommend, while two isolated components are responsible for the decision of what to ask and which to recommend. The policy learning frameworks of these two kinds of CRS are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(b) and 1(c).</p><p>Despite the effectiveness of these methods, there are some issues remained to be tackled for real-world applications: (i) The models trained with existing CRS methods lack generality to different Work done when Yang Deng was an intern at Alibaba. This work was supported by Alibaba Group through Alibaba Research Intern Program, and a grant from the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project Codes: 14200719).   <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, EAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and SCPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>domains or applications, since there are three different decisionmaking processes to be considered in CRS, including what attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend. It requires extra efforts to train an offline recommendation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> or pretrain the policy network with synthetic dialogue history <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. (ii) The policy learning is hard to converge, since the conversation and recommendation components are isolated and lack of mutual influence during the training procedure.</p><p>To address these issues, in this work, we formulate the aforementioned three separated decision-making processes in CRS as a unified policy learning problem to harness the ultimate goal of CRS as well as fill the gap between the recommendation and conversation components during the training procedure. Such unified conversational recommendation policy learning (UCRPL) aims at learning a unified policy to decide the action, either ask an attribute or recommend items, at each conversation turn to maximize the cumulative utility over the whole MCR process. The overview of the proposed unified policy learning for CRS is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>However, the UCRPL problem comes along with two challenges: (i) How to systematically combine conversation and recommendation components for unified policy learning? (ii) How to deal with sample efficiency issues? As the action space becomes overwhelmingly large in UCRPL, including all available attributes and items, it requires tremendous amount of interaction data to learn the optimal policy. Fortunately, the graph structure, capturing the rich correlated information among different types of nodes (i.e., users, items, and attributes), enables us to discover collaborative user preferences towards attributes and items. Thus, we can leverage the graph structure to integrate the recommendation and conversation components as an organic whole, where the conversation session can be regarded as a sequence of nodes maintained in the graph to dynamically exploit the conversation history for predicting the action at the next turn. On the other hand, although the connectivity of the graph can also be used to eliminate invalid actions by path reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, there are still a large number of candidates left for action searching. Since users are not likely to be interested in all items and attributes, we can focus on the potentially important candidates to improve the sample efficiency of UCRPL.</p><p>To this end, we propose a novel and adaptive graph-based reinforcement learning framework, namely UNIfied COnversational RecommeNder (UNICORN). Specifically, due to the evolving nature of CRS, we leverage a dynamic weighted graph to model the changing interrelationships among users, items and attributes during the conversation, and consider a graph-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) environment for simultaneously handling the  In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• We formulate three separated decision-making processes in conversational recommender systems, namely when to ask or recommend, what to ask, and which to recommend, as a unified conversational recommendation policy learning problem. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORKS</head><p>Conversational Recommendation. Based on the problem settings, current CRS studies can be categorized into four directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>: (1) Exploration-Exploitation Trade-offs for Cold-start Users <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. These approaches leverage bandit approaches to balance the exploration and exploitation trade-offs for cold-start users in conversational recommendation scenarios. (2) Question-driven Approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> aim at asking questions to users to get more information about their preferences, which is often addressed as "asking clarification/clarifying question".

Under this problem setting, the system asks questions about the user's preferences or makes recommendations multiple times, with the goal of achieving engaging and successful recommendations with fewer turns of conversations. Among these problem settings, we focus on the MCR problem. RL in Recommendation. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely introduced into recommender systems due to its advantage of considering users' long-term feedbacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. RL-based recommendation formulates the recommendation procedure as an MDP of the interactions between the user and a recommendation agent, and employs RL algorithms to learn the optimal recommendation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Recent works on sequential recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> and interactive recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> adopt RL to capture users' dynamic preferences for generating accurate recommendations over time. The goal of these approaches typically is to learn an effective policy for determining which items to recommend. As for CRS, RL-based methods are adopted to improve the strategies of the other two decision processes, including (i) what attributes to ask <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> and (ii) when to ask or recommend <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In order to simplify the overall framework of MCR with better scalability and generality, we formulate these three core decision processes in CRS as a unified policy learning problem.</p><p>Graph-based Recommendation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROBLEM DEFINITION</head><p>Multi-round Conversational Recommendation. In this work, we focus on the multi-round conversational recommendation (MCR) scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, the most realistic conversational recommendation setting proposed so far, in which the CRS is able to ask questions about attributes or make recommendations multiple times. Specifically, on the system side, the CRS maintains a large set of items V to be recommended, and each item 𝑣 is associated with a set of attributes P 𝑣 . In each episode, a conversation session is initialized by a user 𝑢 specifying an attribute 𝑝 0 . Then, the CRS is free to ask the user's preference on an attribute selected from the candidate attribute set P cand or recommend a certain number of items (e.g., top-𝐾) from the candidate item set V cand . Following the assumptions from Lei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the user preserves clear preferences towards all the attributes and items. Thus, the user will respond accordingly, either accepting or rejecting the asked attributes or the recommended items. The CRS updates the candidate attribute and item sets, and decides the next action based on the user response. The system-ask and user-respond process repeats until the CRS hits the target item or reaches the maximum number of turn 𝑇 . Unified Conversational Recommendation Policy Learning. Multi-round conversational recommendation aims to make successful recommendations within a multi-round conversation session with the user. At each timestep 𝑡, according to the observation on past interactions, the CRS selects an action 𝑎 𝑡 , either asking an attribute or recommending items. In return, the user expresses his/her feedback (accept or reject). This process repeats until the CRS hits the user-preferred items or reaches the maximum number of turn 𝑇 . Such MCR task can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The goal of the CRS is to learn a policy 𝜋 maximizing the expected cumulative rewards over the observed MCR episodes as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝜋 * = arg max 𝜋 ∈Π E ∑︁ 𝑇 𝑡 =0 𝑟 (𝑠 𝑡 , 𝑎 𝑡 ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝑠 𝑡 is the state representation learned from the system state and the conversation history, 𝑎 𝑡 is the action that the agent takes at timestep 𝑡, and 𝑟 (•) is the intermediate reward, abbreviated as 𝑟 𝑡 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">METHODOLOGY</head><p>The overview of the proposed method, UNICORN, is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, which consists of four main components: Graph-based MDP Environment, Graph-enhanced State Representation Learning, Action Selection Strategy, and Deep Q-Learning Network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Graph-based MDP Environment</head><p>The MDP environment is responsible for informing the agent about the current state and possible actions to take, and then rewards the agent based on how the current policy fits the observed user interactions. Formally, the MDP environment can be defined by a tuple (S, A, T , R), where S denotes the state space, A denotes the action space, T : S × A → S refers to the state transition function, and R : S × A → R is the reward function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">State.</head><p>As for the graph-based MDP environment, the state 𝑠 𝑡 ∈ S at timestep 𝑡 is supposed to contain all the given information for conversational recommendation, including the previous conversation history and the full graph G that includes all the users, items, and attributes. Given a user 𝑢, we consider two major elements:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑠 𝑡 = [H (𝑡 ) 𝑢 , G (𝑡 ) 𝑢 ],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H (𝑡 ) 𝑢 = [P (𝑡 ) 𝑢 , P (𝑡 ) rej , V (𝑡 )</formula><p>rej ] denotes the conversation history until timestep 𝑡, and G (𝑡 ) 𝑢 denotes the dynamic subgraph of G for the user 𝑢 at timestep 𝑡 (The graph construction will be introduced in Section 4.2). P 𝑢 denotes the user-preferred attribute. P rej and V rej are the attributes and items rejected by the user, respectively. The initial state 𝑠 0 is initialized by the user-specified attribute 𝑝 0 , i.e., cand to ask attributes. Following the path reasoning approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑠 0 = [[{𝑝 0 }, {}, {}], G (0) 𝑢 ].</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">V (𝑡 ) cand = V P (𝑡 ) 𝑢 \ V (𝑡 ) rej , P (𝑡 ) cand = P V (𝑡 ) cand \ (P (𝑡 ) 𝑢 ∪ P (𝑡 ) rej ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where V P (𝑡 ) 𝑢 is the set of item vertices directly connecting all P (𝑡 ) 𝑢 (i.e., items satisfying all the preferred attributes), and P V (𝑡 ) cand is the set of attribute vertices directly connecting to one of V (𝑡 ) cand (i.e., attributes belonging to at least one of the candidate items).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.1.3</head><p>Transition. We consider that the current state 𝑠 𝑡 will transition to the next state 𝑠 𝑡 +1 when the user responds to the action 𝑎 𝑡 . In specific, if CRS asks an attribute 𝑝 𝑡 and the user accepts it, the next state 𝑠 𝑡 +1 will be updated by P 4.1.4 Reward. Following previous MCR studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, our environment contains five kinds of rewards, namely, (1) 𝑟 rec_suc , a strongly positive reward when the user accepts the recommended items, (2) 𝑟 rec_fail , a negative reward when the user rejects the recommended items, (3) 𝑟 ask_suc , a slightly positive reward when the user accepts the asked attribute, (4) 𝑟 ask_fail , a negative reward when the user rejects the asked attribute, and (5) 𝑟 quit , a strongly negative reward when reaching the maximum number of turns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Graph-enhanced State Representation</head><p>As we formulate conversational recommendation as a unified policy learning problem over a graph-based MDP environment, it is required to encode both the conversational and graph structural information into the latent distributed representations. In order to make use of the interrelationships among users, items, and attributes, we first adopt graph-based pre-training methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> to obtained node embeddings for all the nodes in the full graph G. </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝑢 ∪ P (𝑡 ) cand ∪ V (𝑡 ) cand (4) 𝑨 (𝑡 ) 𝑖,𝑗 =          𝑤 (𝑡 ) 𝑣 , if 𝑛 𝑖 = 𝑢, 𝑛 𝑗 ∈ V 1, if 𝑛 𝑖 ∈ V, 𝑛 𝑗 ∈ P 0, otherwise<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝑤 (𝑡 )</formula><p>𝑣 is a scalar indicating the recommendation score of the item 𝑣 in the current state.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.2</head><p>Graph-based Representation Learning. In order to comprehensively take advantage of the correlation information among the involved user, items, and attributes from the connectivity of the graph, we employ a graph convolutional network (GCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to refine the node representations with structural and relational knowledge. The representations of the node 𝑛 𝑖 in the (𝑙 + 1)-th layer can be computed by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝑒 (𝑙+1) 𝑖 = ReLU ∑︁ 𝑗 ∈N 𝑖 𝚲 𝑖,𝑗 𝑾 𝑙 𝑒 (𝑙) 𝑗 + 𝑩 𝑙 𝑒 (𝑙) 𝑖 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where N 𝑖 denotes the neighboring indices of the node 𝑛 𝑖 , 𝑾 𝑙 and 𝑩 𝑙 are trainable parameters representing the transformation from neighboring nodes and the node 𝑛 𝑖 itself, and 𝚲 is a normalization adjacent matrix as 𝚲 = 𝑫 − 1 2 𝑨𝑫 − 1 2 with 𝑫 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑗 𝑨 𝑖,𝑗 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Sequential Representation</head><p>Learning. Apart from the interrelationships among the involved user, items, and attributes, the CRS is also expected to model the conversation history in the current state. Unlike previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> that adopt heuristic features for conversation history modeling, we employ Transformer encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for capturing the sequential information of the conversation history as well as attending the important information for deciding the next action. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, each Transformer layer consists of three components: (i) The layer normalization is defined as LayerNorm(•). (ii) The multi-head attention is defined as MultiHead(𝑸, 𝑲, 𝑽 ), where 𝑸, 𝑲, 𝑽 are query, key, and value, respectively. (iii) The feed-forward network with ReLU activation is defined as FFN(•). Take the 𝑙-th layer for example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝑿 * = MultiHead(𝑿 (𝑙) , 𝑿 (𝑙) , 𝑿 (𝑙) ),<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">𝑿 (𝑙+1) = LayerNorm(FFN(𝑿 * ) + 𝑿 (𝑙) ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where 𝑿 ∈ R 𝐿×𝑑 denotes the embeddings, and 𝐿 is the sequence length. In our case, the input sequence 𝑿 (0) is the accepted attributes</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P (𝑡 )</formula><p>𝑢 in the current conversation history with the learned graph-based representation {𝑒 (𝐿 𝑔 ) 𝑝 : 𝑝 ∈ P (𝑡 ) 𝑢 }, where 𝐿 𝑔 is the number of layers in GCN. After the sequential learning with 𝐿 𝑠 Transformer layers, we can aggregate the information learned from both the graph and the conversation history by a mean pooling layer to obtain the state representation of 𝑠 𝑡 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝑓 𝜃 𝑆 (𝑠 𝑡 ) = MeanPool(𝑿 𝐿 𝑠 ). (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>For simplicity, we denote the learned state representation of 𝑠 𝑡 as 𝑓 𝜃 𝑆 (𝑠 𝑡 ), where 𝜃 𝑆 is the set of all network parameters for state representation learning, including GCN and Transformer layers.</p></div>

Thus, it attaches great importance to handle the overwhelmingly large action space in UCRPL. To this end, we propose two simple strategies to improve the sample efficiency for candidate action selection.</p><p>Preference-based Item Selection. In general, for candidate items to be recommended, we can consider only the action of making recommendations from a small number of candidate items that fit the user preference the most, since users are not likely to be interested in all items. To achieve this, we select top-𝐾 𝑣 candidate items from V (𝑡 ) cand into the candidate action space A 𝑡 at each timestep 𝑡, which is ranked by the recommendation score 𝑤 (𝑡 ) 𝑣 in Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>). Weighted Entropy-based Attribute Selection. Whereas for candidate attributes to be asked, the expected one is supposed to be able to not only better eliminate the uncertainty of candidate items, but also encode the user preference. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we adopt weighted entropy as the criteria to prune candidate attributes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">𝑤 (𝑡 ) 𝑝 = −prob(𝑝 (𝑡 ) ) • log(prob(𝑝 (𝑡 ) )),<label>(11)</label></formula><p>prob(𝑝</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(𝑡 ) ) = ∑︁ 𝑣 ∈V (𝑡 ) cand ∩V (𝑡 ) 𝑝 𝑤 (𝑡 ) 𝑣 ∑︁ 𝑣 ∈V (𝑡 ) cand 𝑤 (𝑡 ) 𝑣 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where V 𝑝 denotes the items that have the attribute 𝑝.

Following the standard assumption that delayed rewards are discounted by a factor of 𝛾 per timestep, we define the Q-value 𝑄 (𝑠 𝑡 , 𝑎 𝑡 ) as the expected reward based on the state 𝑠 𝑡 and the action 𝑎 𝑡 . As shown in the rightmost part of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the dueling Q-network <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> employs two deep neural networks to compute the value function 𝑓 𝜃 𝑉 (•) and advantage function 𝑓 𝜃 𝐴 (•), respectively.

The experience (𝑠 𝑡 , 𝑎 𝑡 , 𝑟 𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑡 +1 , A 𝑡 +1 ) is then stored into the replay buffer D. To train DQN, we sample mini-batch of experiences from D, and minimize the following loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">𝑄 * (𝑠 𝑡 , 𝑎 𝑡 ) = E 𝑠 𝑡 +1 𝑟 𝑡 + 𝛾 max 𝑎 𝑡 +1 ∈A 𝑡 +1 𝑄 * (𝑠 𝑡 +1 , 𝑎 𝑡 +1 )|𝑠 𝑡 , 𝑎 𝑡 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPERIMENT 5.1 Dataset</head><p>We evaluate the proposed method, UNICORN, on four existing multi-round conversational recommendation benchmark datasets, and further conduct evaluation on a real-world E-Commerce platform. The statistics of these datasets are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref>.</p><p>• LastFM and Yelp. The LastFM dataset is used for evaluation on music artist recommendation, while the Yelp dataset is for business recommendation. Lei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> manually categorize the original attributes in LastFM into 33 coarse-grained groups, and build a 2-layer taxonomy with 29 first-layer categories for Yelp. • LastFM* and Yelp*. Lei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> consider that it is not realistic to manually merge attributes for practical applications, so they adopt original attributes to reconstruct these two datasets. For a fair comparison, we adopt both versions for experiments. • E-Commerce. In order to evaluate the proposed method in realworld E-Commerce scenario, we collect the dataset by sampling logs from Taobao, the largest E-Commerce platform in China, in the same way as LastFM and Yelp. We randomly sample 30,000 items from the Women_Dress category and a certain number of users who have interacted with these items. And we treat the concatenation of the product property and the property value as the attribute to be asked, e.g., "Color=Red", where "Color" is a product property and "Red" is a property value. Following the MCR data construction described in Lei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we obtain the E-Commerce dataset with the statistics shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref>. As for graph construction, we consider two kinds of relations, including "purchased_by (item→ user)" and "belong_to (attribute→ item)". Compared with the imbalanced ratio of #items:#attributes at LastFM (0.88:1) and Yelp (119:1), the E-Commerce dataset preserves a large number of items as well as attributes, which is more in line with real-world applications in E-Commerce.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">User Simulator.</head><p>Due to the interactive nature of MCR, it needs to be trained and evaluated by interacting with users. Following the user simulator adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, we simulate a conversation session for each observed user-item interaction pair (𝑢, 𝑣).</p><p>We regard the item 𝑣 as the ground-truth target item and treat its attribute set P 𝑣 as the oracle set of attributes preferred by the user 𝑢 in this conversation session. The session is initialized by the simulated user who specifies a certain attribute randomly chosen from P 𝑣 . Then the session follows the process of "System Ask, User</p><p>Respond" <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> as described in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.2.2</head><p>Baselines. We compare the proposed method with several state-of-the-art methods on MCR as follows:</p><p>• Max Entropy. This is a rule-based strategy to decide the next action, where the CRS selects an attribute to ask based on the maximum entropy within the current state, or chooses to recommend the top-ranked items with a certain probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. • Abs Greedy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This method only performs recommendation actions and updates itself until the CRS makes a successful recommendation or exceeds the maximum turns of conversation. • CRM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This method is originally designed for single-round conversational recommendation, which employs policy gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to learn the policy deciding when and which attributes to ask. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to adapt this method into MCR scenario. • EAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A three-stage method is proposed to enhance the interaction between the conversation and recommendation components with a similar RL framework as CRM.</p><p>• SCPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This is the state-of-the-art method on MCR setting, which leverages interactive path reasoning on the graph to prune off candidate attributes and adopts the DQN <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> framework to determine when to ask or recommend. Following previous studies on multiround conversational recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, we adopt success rate at the turn 𝑡 (SR@𝑡) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> to measure the cumulative ratio of successful conversational recommendation by the turn 𝑡. Besides, average turn (AT) is adopted to evaluate the average number of turns for all sessions (if the conversation session reaches the maximum turn 𝑇 , the turn for such session is also counted as 𝑇 ). The higher SR@𝑡 indicates a better performance of the CRS at a turn 𝑡, while the lower AT means an overall higher efficiency.</p><p>Although SR@𝑡 and AT are widely adopted for the evaluation of CRS, both of them are not sensitive to the rank order in the recommendation results and only consider a certain aspect of the performance of CRS. In order to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CRS, we propose to extend the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG@𝐾) to be a two-level hierarchical version, namely hNDCG@(𝑻, 𝑲 ), with the definition as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">ℎ𝐷𝐶𝐺@(𝑇 , 𝐾) = ∑︁ 𝑇 𝑡 ∑︁ 𝐾 𝑘 𝑟 (𝑡, 𝑘) 1 log 2 (𝑡 + 2) + 1 log 2 (𝑡+1) − 1 log 2 (𝑡+2) 1 log 2 (𝑘+1) ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where 𝑇 and 𝐾 represent the number of conversation turns and recommended items in each turn, 𝑟 (𝑡, 𝑘) denotes the relevance of the result at the turn 𝑡 and position 𝑘. Then hNDCG@(𝑇 , 𝐾) can be drawn from hDCG@(𝑇 , 𝐾) with the same way as the original NDCG@𝐾. Since there is only one target item for each session in MCR, we simply use hDCG@(𝑇 , 𝐾) for evaluation. The intuition behind hNDCG@(𝑇 , 𝐾) is that the less number of turns of a successful session is favorable for the CRS, while the target item is expected to be ranked higher in the recommendation list at the success turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4">Implementation Details.</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we split the E-Commerce dataset by 7:1.5:1.5 for training, validation, and testing, and set the size 𝐾 of the recommendation list as 10, the maximum turn 𝑇 as 15. We adopt TransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> from OpenKE <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to pretrain the node embeddings in the constructed graph with the training set. We adopt the user simulator described in Section 5.2.1 to interact with the CRS for online training the model using the validation set.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Overall</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref> shows the performance comparison between the proposed method, UNICORN, and all baselines across five datasets. In general, UNICORN outperforms all the baselines by achieving a significantly higher success rate and less average turn, which is also comprehensively validated by the improvements on hDCG. As for the real-world E-Commerce dataset, SCPR outperforms EAR and CRM, whose performance is largely affected by the large action space in E-Commerce dataset. Despite the effectiveness of SCPR to handle the issue of large action space in CRS, its performance in such a real-world application is still restricted by the separation of its conversation and recommendation components. Our UNICORN not only enables the conversation and recommendation to be mutually enhanced during the training process, but also attains an effective sample efficiency with the proposed action selection strategies. This leads to a substantial margin  from these baselines, about 18% for SR@15, 2 turns for AT, and 30% for hDCG. Detailed analyses can be found as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Training Efficiency.</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> shows the test performance curves of different methods. Since Max Entropy and Abs Greedy are unsupervised methods, their curves are presented as two lines for comparisons. It can be clearly observed that UNICORN is trained more stably and requires fewer training episodes (i.e., interaction data) to achieve a better performance than other strong baselines. Among these baselines, the curve of SCPR is the most vibrant, since only considers the policy of when to ask or recommend, while the decisions of question-asking and recommendation are made by two separated components. As for EAR and CRM, due to the large action space in the last three datasets, there is no much performance increase during the online training process, even getting worse. These results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed unified policy learning for CRS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Comparison at Different Conversation Turns.</head><p>Besides SR@15, we also present the performance comparison of success rate at each turn (SR@𝑡) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>. In order to better observe the differences among different methods, we report the relative success rate compared with the state-of-the-art baseline SCPR. For example, the line of 𝑦 = 0 represents the curve of Success Rate* for SCPR against itself. There are several notable observations as follows:</p><p>(i) The proposed UNICORN substantially and consistently outperforms these baselines across all the datasets and almost each turn in the conversation session.</p><p>(ii) Due to the nature of greedy recommendation approach (Abs Greedy), it may successfully hit target items at the early stage of the conversation, leading to a relatively strong performance at the first few turns, but the performance falls quickly as the turn increases.</p><p>(iii) UNICORN achieves an outstanding performance in the middle stage of the conversation, where there are still a large number of candidate items and attributes to be pruned. This shows the strong scalability of UNICORN to effectively handle large candidate action space in different situations.</p><p>(iv) The performance of SCPR is getting closer to UNICORN at the latter stage of the conversation, as the candidate item and attribute set is getting smaller and the task becomes easier.</p><p>(v) EAR and CRM share similar performance as Abs Greedy in those datasets with a large candidate attribute set, i.e., Yelp* and E-Commerce, indicating their policy learning is merely working when encountering a large action space.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref> (row (c-d)) presents the results that we replace pretrained TransE embeddings with randomly initialized embeddings (row (c)) and pretrained embeddings from FM model described in Lei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> (row (d)).

One alternative attribute selection strategy is to adopt the same strategy as the preference-based item selection by changing the object from items to attributes. Another one is to use the original maximum entropy function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The results (row (e,f)) show that the performance of UCRPL suffers a noticeable decrease when adopting the preference-based or entropy-based strategy, indicating that it is required to consider both the user preference and the capability of reducing candidate uncertainty when deciding the asked attribute. Without attribute selection, we observe that the impact on applications with small action space (e.g., LastFM and Yelp) is less than those with large action space (e.g., LastFM*, Yelp*, and E-Commerce). UNICORN is merely working without item selection, since there are no pretrained recommendation components in the framework and the preference-based item selection serves as an auxiliary item recall process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Parameter Sensitivity Analysis</head><p>The upper part in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> summarizes the experimental results (hDCG) by varying the number of selected candidate actions. Since similar conclusions can also be drawn on other datasets, we only report the results on LastFM* and E-Commerce datasets due to space limit. As for the number of selected attributes, it is likely to discard the important attributes when only selected the attribute with the highest weighted entropy (e.g., 𝐾 𝑝 =1). However, within a certain training interaction period (10,000 episodes in our case), UNICORN generally achieves the best performance when only selecting a small number of candidate items for policy learning.</p><p>The results also demonstrate the necessity of pruning the available actions when there is a large action search space in UCRPL. The lower part shows the experimental results by varying the number of network layers. As for GCN, 1-hop aggregation (𝐿 𝑔 =1) is not enough for capturing all the useful information for graph representational learning. However, there is no much difference between 2-hop (𝐿 𝑔 =2) and 3-hop (𝐿 𝑔 =3). Besides, for Transformer, we can see that 1-layer (𝐿 𝑠 =1) is sufficient for a good performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Qualitative Analysis</head><p>In order to intuitively study the difference between the proposed UNICORN and other state-of-the-art CRS methods, we randomly sample a real-world interaction from the E-Commerce dataset. The generated conversations by UNICORN, SCPR, EAR, and CRM with the user simulator are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>. Facing the large candidate action space, CRM tends to only trigger the recommendation component to make recommendations, and EAR continuously asks the questions that are not preferred by the user. Despite the success of SCPR in predicting user-preferred attributes, the policy learning in SCPR only decides when to ask or recommend, based on the number of candidate items, which leads to some unnecessary or redundant question-asking turns. UNICORN systematically addresses these issues by making a comprehensive decision of the next action.</p></div>
