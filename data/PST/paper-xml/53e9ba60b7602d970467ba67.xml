<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Context: Variability management (VM) is one of the most important activities of software product-line engineering (SPLE), which intends to develop software-intensive systems using platforms and mass customization. VM encompasses the activities of eliciting and representing variability in software artefacts, establishing and managing dependencies among different variabilities, and supporting the exploitation of the variabilities for building and evolving a family of software systems. Software product line (SPL) community has allocated huge amount of effort to develop various approaches to dealing with variability related challenges during the last two decade. Several dozens of VM approaches have been reported. However, there has been no systematic effort to study how the reported VM approaches have been evaluated. Objective: The objectives of this research are to review the status of evaluation of reported VM approaches and to synthesize the available evidence about the effects of the reported approaches. Method: We carried out a systematic literature review of the VM approaches in SPLE reported from 1990s until December 2007. Results: We selected 97 papers according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected papers appeared in 56 publication venues. We found that only a small number of the reviewed approaches had been evaluated using rigorous scientific methods. A detailed investigation of the reviewed studies employing empirical research methods revealed significant quality deficiencies in various aspects of the used quality assessment criteria. The synthesis of the available evidence showed that all studies, except one, reported only positive effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The findings from this systematic review show that a large majority of the reported VM approaches have not been sufficiently evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods. The available evidence is sparse and the quality of the presented evidence is quite low. The findings highlight the areas in need of improvement, i.e., rigorous evaluation of VM approaches. However, the reported evidence is quite consistent across different studies. That means the proposed approaches may be very beneficial when they are applied properly in appropriate situations. Hence, it can be concluded that further investigations need to pay more attention to the contexts under which different approaches can be more beneficial.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Software product-line engineering (SPLE) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> has gained significant attention over the recent years. It is claimed that SPLE provides a promising way to develop a large range of softwareintensive systems faster, better, and cheaper <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Some cases of SPLE have reported improvements in the order-of-magnitude with respect to cost, quality, and time-to-market <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The range of products, which a software product line aims to support, often differs from each other to support different, individual customers or address entirely different market segments. As a result, variability is a key concept in SPLE. It refers to the ability of an artifact to be configured, customized, extended, or changed for use in a specific context <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The variability in various artifacts to be used for building different products in a software product line (SPL) must be defined, represented, exploited, implemented, and evolved throughout the lifecycle of that SPL <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. This is what researchers and practitioners mean when they refer to variability management in SPLE <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. This is also what we mean by variability management in this research.</p><p>Variability management is a fundamental activity in SPLE <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. It is also considered one of the key feature that distinguishes SPLE from other software development approaches or traditional software reuse approaches <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. Variability management (VM) is a non-trivial undertaking as it involves extremely complex and challenging tasks, which need to be supported by appropriate approaches, techniques, and tools <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref>. There has been a great deal of research to address various challenges of variability management. Feature-oriented domain analysis (FODA) method <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, which was published in 1990, is one of the first contributions to variability management. Since then, a large number of effort has been spent on developing approaches for better managing variability. Diverse approaches have been reported through various publication venues. However, there are only a few reviews of the literature on VM in SPLE. Sinnema and Deelstra <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> have provided a detailed classification of six variability modelling techniques that have been selected to form a representation of a subset of available techniques for variability modelling, which is an important aspect of variability management. Svahnberg et al. <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> presented a taxonomy of variability realization techniques.</p><p>However, there has been no effort to systematically analyse how variability management approaches have been evaluated, and to systematically collect and synthesize the existing evidence regarding the effects of the reported approaches. We believe that these are important aspects to investigate as the results of rigorous evaluation, e.g., in the form of evidence about the benefits and limitations of the proposed approaches, can play an important role in transferring the research outcomes to industrial practices <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. Hence, we decided to conduct a systematic literature review of variability management (VM) in SPLE in order to provide a snapshot of the state-of-the-art with respect to evaluation of the reported approaches.</p><p>We published an early report in EASE 2009 <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> from our systematic review, whose extended methodological details and findings are reported in this paper. Compared with the early report <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, this paper has made several revisions and extensions; some of the more significant extensions include more details about the used research methodology and identification of specific search strings used for different search engines (Section 2), further findings from more analysis of the data extracted to answer the initial two questions (i.e., first two questions enlisted below) of this systematic review (Sections 3.2), complete tabulated scores for quality assessment of each study (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">11</ref>), an elaborative discussion and enlisting of highly cited papers on VM approaches published without evaluation components (Section 4); another major extension is the addition of a research question aimed at synthesizing the literature studying the effects of various VM approaches (Section 3.5). Some of the data and findings from this review were also used in a study on the variability management challenges and solutions as reported in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. The systematic review reported in this paper addresses the following research questions:</p><p>How have the variability management approaches in SPLE been evaluated? What is the quality of the reported evaluations of the variability management approaches? What evidence is available about the effects of variability management approaches?</p><p>We believe the results of such a study will benefit both researchers and practitioners. The review will provide researchers with important research gaps regarding the evaluation of variability management approaches. For the industrial readership, the review will provide practitioners with useful information about the evaluation of the available variability modelling approaches. They can use the findings reported in this paper as a reference when they select a variability management approach for their own settings and situations.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology of the systematic review which follows the guidelines as presented in <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Section 3 presents the results, while Section 4 discusses the results. Section 5 discusses the limitations of the study. Finally, Section 6 finishes the paper by drawing some conclusions based on the reported review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Review method</head><p>This section reports the details about each step of the systematic literature review (SLR), called systematic review or review hereafter, process followed in this study. A systematic review is a defined and methodical way to identify, evaluate, and synthesize the available evidence concerning a particular technology (i.e., method, technique, and tool) to understand the current direction and status of research or to provide background in order to identify research challenges. A systematic review enables researchers to assess and interpret research pertaining to a research question, subject matter, or event of interest <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. There can be several motivating factors for carrying out a systematic review such as: to review the existing evidence regarding a treatment or technology, for example, to review existing empirical evidence of the benefits and limitations of a specific method or tool for supporting variability management; to identify research gaps that will lead to topics for further investigation and/or; to provide a context/framework so as to properly place new research activities.</p><p>We followed Kitchenham's guideline for this systematic reviews as reported in <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. We developed and evaluated a protocol to describe the plan for the review. A systematic review involves several steps, which can be grouped into three main phases: planning a review, conducting a review, and reporting a review. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the phases and steps involved in a systematic review. This section details the procedure followed and relates it to the specifics of our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Planning the review</head><p>The steps involved in planning a review are: identification of the need for a review, development of a review protocol and validation of the protocol.</p><p>Identification of the need for a review: The reason for conducting this systematic review has partially been addressed in the introduction and was motivated by the perceived need of systematically extracting and synthesizing, and critically analysing the literature on variability management in the context of software product lines with respect to the evaluation of the published approaches. There has not been any systematic study conducted on this topic that could report the state-of-the-art with respect to the evaluation of VM approaches developed since the publication of FODA <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, which is considered one of the first approaches aimed to address variability issues in software product lines. Such a study is expected to provide useful insight about the status and nature of assessments performed to support the claimed strengthens and to identify the potential limitations of VM approaches. The outcomes of such a study can identify the gaps which need immediate attention of SPL as well as empirical software engineering researchers. The findings from reviewing the evaluation of VM approaches can help practitioners to determine which claims of the VM approaches have been supported by scientific studies.</p><p>Development of a review protocol: The second step of planning is the development of a review protocol, which specifies the steps and procedures to be followed by researchers during a review. It is a prerequisite to have review protocol defined and validated for conducting a systematic review. It is also one of the main differences between a systematic review and a conventional literature review. The protocol is expected to help researchers to ensure that the results are not influenced by researchers' expectations and desires. A systematic review protocol usually has the following elements: research questions to be answered; strategy to search for primary studies/papers; criteria and procedure for inclusion/exclusion decision when selecting studies; checklist and procedure for assessing the quality of studies; strategy and procedure for data extraction and; procedure for synthesizing the extracted data.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, we describe each of the elements of the protocol that we developed to guide the systematic review reported in this paper. Next step was to design and test the search strings to be used for finding the primary studies. It is vital that major terms in a search string are determined from the topic area being studied. The search strings used in this review were constructed using the following strategy, which is also used in other systematic reviews: derive main terms from the questions based on the population, intervention, and outcome to be studied; determine and include synonyms, related terms, and alternative spelling for major terms; check the keywords in any relevant papers researchers already knew for example <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">16]</ref>, and initial searches on the relevant databases; incorporate alternative spellings and synonyms using Boolean ''OR''; link main terms from population, intervention, and outcome using Boolean ''AND''.</p><p>Following this strategy, and after a series of test executions and reviews, we constructed the search strings as bellow: &lt;&lt;software AND (product line OR product lines OR product family OR product families) AND (variability OR variation OR variant)&gt;&gt; Due to the varying nature of the search facilities and features provided by the main digital sources of software engineering literature (such as IEEExplore, SpringerLink, and ACM Digital Library), we realized that it was not possible to use a single search string for all the literature sources. For example, when searching the ACM Digital Library, we had to construct three search strings in order to obtain searches that could be considered an equivalent to another literature source such as IEEExplore or Springer). Other researchers have also reported similar problems in using ACM Digital Library for systematic reviews <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. Hence, we decided to design and use different search strings for different sources of literature like other researchers <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. All the digital sources and their respective search strings are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. This is considered one of the limitations of conducting systematic reviews in software engineering caused by the variations in the mechanisms of the search engines available <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. However, we made every effort to ensure that the search strings used were logically and semantically equivalent if it was not possible to have syntactically identical search strings for all the searched databases. We performed several test searches with different search engines digital libraries of software engineering literature. The results from the test searches were continuously discussed in order to refine the search string until we were fully satisfied with the capability of the search string to bring the required material.</p><p>Considering the descriptive nature of the literature to be retrieved, we also decided to perform a pre-review search to ascertain its general format and presentation and to inform the development of the data extraction and synthesis strategies. The pre-review search provided us with an initial indication of the scope of the literature available on the topic studied in this research. The pre-review search was performed using IEEExplore, Science Direct, Citeseer, and Google Scholar. 2  As an indication of inclusiveness, the results were checked for three known relevant papers (i.e., <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref>). All three relevant papers were found during the pre-review search. For further assessment of the review protocol, we contacted an independent expert on systematic reviews in software engineering and requested feedback on our review protocol. The expert provided us with very useful comments, which helped us to improve the protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Conducting the review</head><p>Identification of primary studies: For identifying the candidate primary studies, we carried out the search process based on our own knowledge of published VM research and searches on electronic databases using the search strings listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Apart from the electronic databases, we also manually checked two sources for candidate papers: proceedings of the software product line conference (SPLC) series; SEI's technical reports on SPL (Note that SEI's serial of technical reports is the main channel of grey literature in the research area reviewed in this study).</p><p>We decided to manually search proceedings of SPLC series because SPLC is the main venue for variability management researchers to publish their results and the proceedings of some early editions of this conference are not included in any of the electronic data sources listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. We decided to manually search SEI's technical reports because SEI's series of technical reports is the main channel of grey literature in the research area.</p><p>Our search from all sources found 628 papers after removing the duplicates. These papers were downloaded and imported into an Endnote library where all duplicates were removed by using the duplicate removal feature of Endnote. This was followed by a series of manual checks to ensure no duplicates remained in the library. Each downloaded paper had an entry in the Endnote library containing the publication title, abstract, author(s), source and date stored. We did not restrict our search based on publication year. We ensured that our search applied to journals, magazines and conferences proceedings in the databases that we searched. However, we did not perform secondary researches by following the references from all the found primary studies. We decided not to follow this step for two reasons: all the well-known papers were identified through our primary searches for the primary studies; secondary searches based on the references of the studies retrieved through the primary searches would have required significantly huge amount of resources.</p><p>Selection criteria and procedure: During this step, each identified candidate paper is assessed for inclusion or exclusion based on predefined criteria. The selection criteria used in our review comprises these points: the paper was included if it: introduced an approach to dealing with some aspect of VM in SPLE or; reported an evaluation of an existing VM approach.</p><p>The paper was excluded if: it did not deal with VM in SPLE; it did not include an evaluation of a VM approach; it was a short paper.</p><p>The following specific subjects are intended when we refer to ''variability management'' in general: requirements variability; design variability; architecture variability; feature modelling; product derivation; test variability. Any doubt whether or not a paper addressed variability management was discussed among the research team; if the doubt could not be resolved through discussions, we included the paper in the next stage of the review.</p><p>The papers were selected based on careful reading of the abstracts (and conclusions where necessary) of the papers identified through all searches after removing the duplicates. Having applied the selection criteria, we selected 261 papers for inclusion in the rest of the review process. Since the main objective of this research was to determine the status of evaluation of the published VM approaches, a second phase of the filtering was performed to exclude papers where an evaluation of the reported approach was not presented. After this filtering, there were 146 papers left in the process.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, only 97 papers qualified for data extraction and appraisal purposes because we excluded 49 papers during the data extraction phase. These papers were excluded for two reasons: Web of science TS=((software AND (''product line⁄'' OR ''product famil⁄'')) AND (variability OR variation OR variant)) 2 We decided not to use Google Scholar for the main search as it brought a huge number of irrelevant studies in the pre-review search and we found that we could find the studies from other search engines with a lot less irrelevant studies.</p><p>the researchers included every paper for data extraction if they were in doubt about excluding a particular paper after reading the abstract and conclusion. However, a reading of the full paper enabled them to completely apply the selection criteria; we decided to introduce the third exclusion criterion during the data extraction phase, when we felt that the space limitation of short papers might not have enabled authors to describe the full details of the presented approaches and their respective evaluations, if any.</p><p>Finally 97 primary papers were included in this systematic review.</p><p>Assessing the publication quality: During a systematic review, each paper is usually subjected to a quality assessment in order to address <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>: Bias -A tendency to produce results that depart systematically from the 'true' results. Unbiased results are internally valid. Internal validity -The extent to which the design and conduct of the study are likely to prevent systematic error. External validity -The extent to which the effects observed in the study are applicable outside of the study's context.</p><p>We used two kinds of quality assessment. The first kind intended to assess the quality of the papers with respect to their ability and suitability to answer our research questions, and with respect to the impact on the drawn conclusions. The second type served as an instrument to answer one of our main research questions. In a systematic review, the main purpose of quality assessment is to assess the impact of the quality of the primary studies on the conclusions drawn from the systematic review. For example, if the quality of the primary studies is low, the conclusions based on these primary studies are unlikely to be strong and reliable. Considering the objective of our research, the first kind of quality assessment treated each paper equally assuming that each of them was of sufficient quality as all but one of them were published in peer reviewed journals, conferences, and workshops. There was only one non-peer reviewed technical report published by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), which is considered highly credible institute for software engineering research. We will discuss the second kind of quality assessment used in this study later.</p><p>Assessing the quality of reported evaluation studies: We also intended to assess the quality of the reported evaluation studies of VM approaches. For this purpose, we decided to use the quality assessment criteria developed by Dybå and Dingsøyr <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref>, who based their quality assessment criteria on the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[22]</ref> and principles of good practice of conducting empirical research in software engineering <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. We only made a few minor changes to customize the detailed sub-criteria presented in Appendix B of <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> for our study. A summary of the quality assessment criteria is presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. We present the findings from assessing the quality of the reported evaluation studies using the criteria described here in Section 3.4.</p><p>We decided to use a ternary (''Yes'', ''Partial'' or ''No'') scale to grade the reviewed studies on each element of the quality assessment criteria. To quantify the result, we assigned these values: 1 to Yes, 0.5 to Partial, and 0 to No. The first author was responsible for applying the quality assessment under the supervision of the second author who applied the quality assessment to a smaller set of randomly selected papers for verification purposes. Any disagreement found was resolved through discussion. The same arrangement of work distribution was kept for the next step of data extraction and synthesis.</p><p>Extracting and synthesizing the data: Having gone through the paper selection and quality assessment steps, the next step was data extraction. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> shows the attributes for which the data </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 3</head><p>Quality criteria used in this review (taken from <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> without any changes).</p><p>1. Is the paper based on research (or is it merely a ''lessons learned'' report based on expert opinion)? 2. Is there a clear statement of the aims of the research? 3.

The data were extracted and stored in a spreadsheet after reading each paper using the data extraction form presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. Whenever there was a doubt about a piece of data reported in the review paper, we resolved the doubt through discussions until a consensus was formed (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>).</p><p>During the data extraction, each paper was also rigorously scrutinized using the inclusion and exclusion criteria reported in Section 2.2. If the discussions among the research team concluded that the paper did not meet the selection criteria, the paper was excluded from the data extraction process. During data extraction, we also captured short notes about the proposed method, variability expression, evaluation method, and industry evaluation in appropriate columns. We made every effort to capture as much information as possible in those short notes but also to keep them as succinct as possible in order to avoid any potential influence of a taxonomic or classification framework on our results.</p><p>Meta-analysis is a common approach to synthesize the data in secondary studies. However, we assert that the meta-analysis based techniques may not be suitable for synthesizing the data extracted from the literature based on qualitative research <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. Since most of the papers in our review were expected to be grounded in qualitative research, a meta-analytical approach was not suitable for synthesizing the data extracted from the reviewed papers <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. Hence, we decided to manually review and link the extracted data in spreadsheets, where it had been stored using the attributes shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> as column headings and rows representing each paper from which the data were extracted. Like other researchers, <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>, we also found that tabulating the data is a useful mean of aggregation. We decided to use descriptive statistics (e.g., sum, average) for analysing and reporting the findings from the extracted data. Apart from capitalizing on the storage structure and different features provided by a commercial spreadsheet application, we also manually scanned and synthesized the data based on the short notes attached to the extracted data. We used frequency analysis for determining the findings. Frequency analysis has also been used by other systematic reviews, which mainly deal with qualitative data <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Overview of studies</head><p>We begin the presentation of the results from analyzing the data extracted from the primary studies included at different stages of this systematic review. Before reporting the findings about the evaluation aspects of the reviewed VM approaches, we provide an overview of the reviewed papers with respect to their publication venues and trends, and the kinds of approaches reported in those papers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Demographic data</head><p>With respect to the publication sources, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> shows that SPLC has the largest number of papers (11%, 11.34%), followed by SCP journal (6%, 6.19%), PFE (5%, 5.15%), and RE (5%, 5.15%) conferences. The reviewed papers appeared in 56 different publication sources. There were 39 venues with only one reviewed paper published. These 39 venues also included TSE, TOSEM and IEEE Software. There was no paper published in the Empirical Software Engineering Journal, which is a premier venue for publishing studies on empirical evaluation and assessment. These figures show that literature on VM is scattered in different publication venues. The premier events of the SPL community (i.e., SPLC, PFE) do not have clear dominance. We found that most of the papers were published in conferences or workshops (75 of 97, 77.62%), while only 21 (21.65%) papers appeared in scientific journals and 1 was a technical report. Regarding the year of publication of the reviewed papers, shows our review does not include any paper on VM published prior to 1990 as our search string could not find any such paper published before 1990. There were only four papers reporting VM approaches published before 2000. However, from 2000 onwards, we found an increased number of papers published with a peak in 2004 when there was also a special issue of Journal of Science of Computer Programming on variability management in software product-line engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">VM approaches identified from the reviewed papers</head><p>This study has identified 91 unique approaches reported to deal with VM from different aspects and during different development phases. Considering the main objective of this systematic review, a detailed analysis and discussion on the different aspects of the published VM approaches was not within the scope of the study reported in this paper. However, we have also conducted a detailed analytical review of a smaller set of VM approaches in a separate study reported in <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. That study reviewed 33 VM approaches from different aspects (such as descriptive overview, chronological history, issues addressed by them, types of variability models used, and variability support for different lifecycle phases). For the study reported in this paper, we have categorized the identified 91 approaches using a generic classification scheme based on the variability expression techniques used by each of the VM approach published in the reviewed papers.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref> shows different categories of the identified VM approaches reported in the 97 reviewed papers and their relative frequencies (accumulated frequency is greater than 91 as some approaches can be placed into more than one category). Our results show that a large majority of VM approaches are based on feature modelling and/or UML based techniques. There are also a small number of approaches based on some other mechanism of expressing variability such as natural language, mathematical notation and domain-specific languages. It is important to note that there are very few approaches (4%, 4.40%) based on mathematical techniques. These approaches can be evaluated by mathematical proves, and are usually considered difficult to evaluate empirically. For all other approaches, only empirical evaluation tends to be suitable. Hence, a large majority of the VM approaches are quite amenable to empirical evaluation.</p></div>

One of the main objectives of this review was to identify the kinds of evaluation approaches used by VM researchers. For classifying the evaluation approaches reported in the primary studies, we did not find any suitable classification scheme in the literature. For this study, we decided to develop a scheme for classifying the evaluation approaches used in the reviewed studies based on the work of Glass <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>, Shaw <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> and Carmen et al. <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. The scheme for categorizing evaluation methods used in this review is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref> presents the kinds of approaches used to evaluate the VM approaches reported in the reviewed papers. It is evident that ''example application'' is the most frequently used means of evaluation followed by ''experience reports'' and ''case studies.'' Other evaluation approaches used are ''laboratory experiment with software subjects'', ''laboratory experiment with human subjects'', ''field The scheme for categorizing the evaluation approaches designed and used for this review.</p><p>RA -Rigorous analysis Rigorous derivation and proof, suited for formal model <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> CS -Case study An empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context; when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident; and in which multiple sources of evidence are used <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref> DC -Discussion Provided some qualitative, textual, opinion-oriented evaluation. e.g., compare and contrast, oral discussion of advantages and disadvantages <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref> EA -Example application Authors describing an application and provide an example to assist in the description, but the example is ''used to validate'' or ''evaluate'' as far as the authors suggest <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> EP -Experience</p><p>The result has been used on real examples, but not in the form of case studies or controlled experiments, the evidence of its use is collected informally or formally <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> FE -Field experiment Controlled experiment performed in industry settings <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> LH -Laboratory experiment with human subjects Identification of precise relationships between variables in a designed controlled environment using human subjects and quantitative techniques <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref> LS -Laboratory experiment with software subjects A laboratory experiment to compare the performance of newly proposed system with other existing systems <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref> SI -Simulation Execution of a system with artificial data <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>, using a model of the real word <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref> experiment'', ''simulation'', ''rigorous analysis'', and ''discussion''. We observed that ''rigorous analysis'' is usually applied when formal methods are used in VM approaches. It is also a notable finding that a majority of the evaluation approaches used in the reviewed studies falls into the categories of ''example application'', ''experience report'', and ''discussion'', which are not scientific approaches to rigorously evaluating a specific technology. We also found that the authors of a large majority the reviewed studies claimed to use case study methodology to evaluate their approaches. However, an analysis of those studies revealed that only a few of them could meet the criteria for a case study reported in <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>.</p><p>We also observed that many authors claimed to have their approaches evaluated using industrial case studies, however, they provided a paragraph or less on the evaluation part of the reported approach. An author claimed to use industrial experiment, which was described in just one sentence. These findings reveal that a large majority of the VM approaches awaits rigorous empirical evaluation, which is important for successful technology transfer <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>.</p><p>An analysis of the temporal distribution of the evaluation approaches reported in the reviewed papers did not find a clear trend of improvement. It was also found that a large number of recently proposed VM approaches do not provide any rigorous evaluation of their utility, which is very disappointing. Another significant finding was the absence of replication studies. We found that 87 (96%) of the presented approaches were evaluated in only one study. There was only one study <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> that can be considered as an independent evaluation. Rest of the approaches have been evaluated by their developers themselves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Evaluation performed in an industrial setting</head><p>Software engineering research is expected to provide practitioners with solutions to real problems <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. This systematic review was also aimed at determining the number of approaches evaluated in an industrial context. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">10</ref> presents the results from an analysis of evaluation methods used in industrial settings. It is evident that a large majority of the reviewed approaches (65 out of 91, 71.43%) have never been evaluated in an industrial setting. Among those approaches that have been tried in industrial settings, more than half of them were reported as experience reports. Some of them were reported as case studies. Few of them were also reported as example application. Only one of them was reported as field experiment, which is a rigorous form of evaluation. We also found that it was not clear how many of the approaches were adopted in industry based on the reported trials. However, we observed from the available data that only a small number of the approaches claimed to be evaluated in industry was accepted. One common characteristic of these approaches was that all of them were developed in close collaboration with industrial partners. Hence, this finding supports the claim that industrial acceptance of a technology can be a strong indicator of the success of the research output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Quality of evaluation</head><p>It has been indicated that we intended to assess the quality of the reported evaluation studies included in our review. According to the quality criteria described in Section 2.2, if the answer to the first criterion was ''No'', it was expected that most of the remaining criterion would not be applicable. Hence, we decided not to apply the whole quality assessment criteria to the studies using example application (EA), experience reports (ER) and discussion (DC) as the means of evaluation of the proposed approaches. The criteria were not applicable to studies using rigorous analysis either. This decision left us with only 18 studies to assess using the quality assessment criteria.</p><p>We only applied the 11 elements of the criteria (presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) on the selected papers as all studies were rated ''Yes'' on the first criterion. However, there were only seven studies with a clear statement of the aims of the reported research; others were rated ''Partial.'' All studies had some form of description of the context in which the research was carried out, but the context description of one study was not clear enough to gain a reasonable understanding. There were only three studies, which provided both justification and description of the research design used; all other studies had some sort of description of the research design. There were six studies that reported an appropriate recruitment strategy, rest of the 11 studies went directly into the description of the participants or cases without explaining how and why they were identified and recruited.</p><p>We found only three studies that included one or more control groups. The description of the data collection protocols and data analysis procedures were reported in only 7 and 5 studies respectively; others studies mentioned the data collection and analysis protocols or procedures but did not provide any explanation or justification. None of the reviewed studies mentioned any possibility of researchers' bias. We found that five studies described both the findings and discussed validity threats; other 13 studies did not discuss any validity threats at all. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">11</ref> presents the scores assigned to each of the 18 studies on each of the criteria used for the quality assessment. Regarding the score of individual studies as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">11</ref>, none of the reviewed studies scored more than 9.5 marks. Three studies scored 9 or more but below 10, two studies scored 8 and 8.5, two studies scored 7, eight studies scored between 6 or more but below 7, and two studies got the lowest score of 5.5 marks.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the authors of the highest scoring study <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> and the second highest scoring study <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> appear to have consulted the literature on evaluation methodologies as they referenced the work on empirical evaluation approaches published by researchers from the empirical software engineering community such as <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>. Whereas, the authors of other studies do not appear to have consulted literature on empirical software engineering as there was no reference to any literature on performing rigorous empirical evaluation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">11</ref> also shows the average score assigned for each criterion. It is evident that there is a significant gap regarding the recognition of researcher bias (scored 0) and the control group to compared to the treatments (scored 0.17) respectively. Except the first and the last criterion, and the criterion regarding the description of the context, there is a significant gap (scored around 0.60) that needs to be filled in order to improve the quality of the evaluation of VM approaches in SPLE.</p><p>The details about the bibliographic information about the 18 papers to which quality assessment was applied can be found in Appendix C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Evidence about the effects of VM approaches</head><p>In order to answer the third research question, we investigated the reported evidence about the effects of VM approaches. For this analysis, we excluded the studies that used ''discussion'' or ''rigorous analysis'' for evaluation of the reported approaches. We decided to exclude the studies using these research methods because these evaluation methods are not meant to provide evidence. We also excluded studies using ''example applications''. The evidence based on ''example applications'' is considered quite weak. Thus, we had only 35 studies for this analysis.</p><p>During the investigation, we found that some of the 35 studies did not provide clear and concrete statement of the observed evidence (e.g., some papers merely stated that the approach is ''promising'' or ''effective'' without providing any further details). Many experience reports that were included in our study did not clearly report the effects of the applied approach. Some of these experience reports only described how a particular approach was used without describing any specific effect of using the approach (e.g., merely stating that ''the approach has already been applied in some industrial applications'' <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, or ''our experience with application of the method has demonstrated the effectiveness of the method'' <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>). Several case studies were descriptive or illustrative, so the evidence regarding the effects of the reported approaches was not clearly stated. Hence, we decided not to synthesize the evidence from the papers with vague descriptions of the effects of the reported approaches. This decision left us with 15 papers as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">12</ref>. For each of these 15 papers, we extracted the data about the items such as the kind of product line on which the reported approach was applied, size of the product line, effects, domain applied, and possible confounding factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1.">Synthesizing evidence</head><p>To synthesize the evidence for the reported effects of VM approaches, we organized the evidence around the aspects of the presented approaches' effects. We call these aspects ''attributes'' (as listed in the second column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">13</ref>). This list of attributes was identified by going through each study and analysing the aspects of the reported effects of the presented approaches. Thus, this list only includes the kinds of attributes that have been studied and supported by the reported evidence. It does not mean that this is the list of attributes affected by the reviewed VM approaches. To avoid any interpretation bias, we tried to report what the authors of the reviewed studies had stated in their papers instead of making inferences about the used attributes.</p><p>It is shown in the second column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">13</ref> that the attributes studied are diverse in aspects and granularity. The studied attributes cover the aspects of software development (e.g., productivity and dependency on experts), quality attributes (e.g., maintainability, flexibility of change, and ease of evolving), the complexity of artefacts (e.g., program complexity, number of variable features, and complexity of core models), and quality attributes regarding runtime characteristics of the resulting system (e.g., memory usage and performance). The studied attributes were also reported at different levels of granularity. For example, the attributes of test generation efforts and number of configuration iterations are described at a more fine-grained level than the attribute of productivity. The differences in the level of granularity used indicate the diversity of the focus of different approaches. We further clustered the attributes reported by the studies to several attribute groups (as shown in the first column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">13</ref>). Based on these groups of attributes, we briefly describe the reported evidence-based effects of the reviewed approaches in the following paragraphs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">13</ref> shows that productivity is the most studied (12 out of 15, 80%) group of attributes with respect to the effects of VM approaches. We found that all the reviewed studies reported an increase in productivity after applying the proposed VM approaches.</p><p>One study <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref> has reported that the required effort dropped from 88 man-days to 28 man-days. Sinnema et al. have reported an enormous amount of reduction in man-hours required for product derivation (i.e., derivation effort of a typical product reduced from one day to within a quarter of an hour) <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>. Ardis et al. have reported the productivity improvements of as much as four to one <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>. The reduction of the overall development effort has been reported in <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>; four to eight fold reduction of effort has been reported in <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>; Sinnema and Deelstra <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> have reported that their approach took only 38% of the required product derivation time previously recorded in the studied company. The effort for adding a new feature can be reduced from 1 month to 3 days as reported in <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>. Beuche et al. have reported that finding a new working configuration used to be so complicated that the developers used only two or three well know configurations. However, a new working configuration could typically be created within a few minutes when using CONSUL <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>. Other researchers have also reported reduction in required test efforts by using the VM approach <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>.</p><p>The findings reported in these studies show that the degree of productivity increase appears to be quite dramatic. The attributes of test generation efforts and number of configuration iterations are directly related to productivity. An increase up to 57% in reuse benefit compared to application of single system testing techniques was reported in <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>. It has also been reported that a typical product derivation process can be reduced from 10-12 iterations to 0-2 iterations <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>. 42% reduction in number of iterations has been reported in <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Complexity of SPL artefacts is the second most (5 out of 15, 33.33%) studied group of attributes. All the reviewed studies claimed reduction in complexity after applying the reported VM approaches. A reduction of 26.5% in code size has been reported in <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>; more than 22% reduction in lines of code of product line architecture and 37% reduction in lines of code in the generated product members have been reported in <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. Batory et al. have reported significant reduction in program complexity measured by number of methods, lines of code, and number of tokens per class <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>. Loesch and Ploedereder have reported a reduction of 50% in the number of variable features after applying variability optimization <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>. Estublier and Vega have reported a 10-fold reduction in the core model size <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Reduced dependency on experts has been also reported in <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. It has been reported that some tasks that originally could only be performed by product line experts were performed by engineers that were not involved in developing a product family when using COVAMOF <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>. Based on another study, it has been reported that the engineers that had not been involved in the development of a product family were able to derive new products in 100% of the cases when using COVAMOF, compared to 29% of the cases without COVAMOF <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Lee et al. have reported an increased maintainability as a result of applying their VM approach reported in <ref type="bibr">[50]</ref>. The increase of maintainability was measured by the number of functions that had to be modified or added when specific hardware devices and communication protocols were changed. It has been reported that the number of functions affected by the change was dramatically reduced after applying ASADAL method <ref type="bibr">[50]</ref>.</p><p>Batory et al. have reported an increased flexibility in change <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>. An ease in evolving SPL architecture has been reported in <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. Junior et al. have reported that more variabilities were identified after the introduction of variability management process <ref type="bibr">[51]</ref>.</p><p>The ability in detecting defect has been studied by Denger and Kolb <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. The researchers compared two defect detection techniques (i.e., code inspections and functional testing) to investigate their defect finding potential on reusable components with variable features. The study found that both techniques were ineffective in identifying variant-specific defects. This is the only study in our review that has reported negative effects of the VM approach evaluated in this study.</p><p>Apart from the abovementioned attributes, one study (i.e., <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>) also reported positive effects of the reported VM approach on memory usage and performance. It has been reported that the product created using XVCL, XML-based Variant Configuration Language, ran almost 7.5% faster than the corresponding original product and the memory usage decreased by 8.4%.</p><p>It can be observed that all the reviewed studies, except the one reported in <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>, have reported positive effects of the proposed VM approaches on the studied attributes. The synthesized results show that the reported evidence about the effects of VM approaches is quite sparse. However, the reported evidence appears to be quite consistent, which is one of the four key elements that determine the strength of evidence according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref>. It is also interesting to note that almost all the reviewed studies did not appear to have paid attention to control and manage the impact of confounding factors, especially other SPL practices, on the observed effects of the evaluated VM approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2.">Studied objects</head><p>The VM approaches reported in the reviewed studies have often been applied to different kinds of software product lines in order to evaluate their claimed effects. We refer to these software product lines or artifacts used for evaluating the reported VM approaches as the studied objects. We believe that this is an important aspect to investigate for obtaining a concrete understanding of the reported evidence about the effects of VM approaches. We also assert that the characteristics of the studied objects can have important implication for the relevance and applicability of the evaluated approaches to industrial practices. We gathered as much information as possible based on the description available from the papers that reported the approaches. For example, the description of the size of a product line that a particular approach was applied to was quite diverse and sometimes very vague. During the data extraction stage, we tried to keep what the authors stated instead of making our own inferences.</p><p>We summarize the gathered information in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">14</ref>. It can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">14</ref> that most of the approaches (12 out of 15, i.e., 80%) were tried on software product lines from the industrial or real World settings. Most of these product lines were large and drawn from different domains such as web-based systems, embedded systems, safety critical systems, and operating systems. Hence, the results from such studies should be quite relevant to industrial settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The findings from this systematic review have revealed that variability management research in software product lines has produced a diverse set of approaches (i.e., 91 different approaches such as feature modelling, decision modelling, and orthogonal VM). However, this study has revealed that a large majority of these approaches await rigorous evaluation. A significant number of the reviewed approaches do not provide any evidential support for the claimed utility of the proposed approach. The results also reveal that researchers have used various evaluation approaches to provide the evidence for supporting the presented VM approaches. The evaluation approaches used by a large majority of the researchers can be categorized as ''example application.'' However, it should be noted that we applied the criteria for reporting case studies reported in <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref> quite strictly. That is why there may be a likelihood that some of the reviewed studies could not have been categorized as case studies during our assessment because their reporting might have missed certain pieces of information expected to be included in a case study as recommended by Runeson and Höst <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref>.</p><p>This study has also revealed that a large majority of the studies (80.41%) report evaluation of the presented approaches using scientifically less rigorous evaluation approaches such as ''example application'', ''experience report'' and ''discussion''. This finding indicates a general lack of robust assessment of the large majority of the VM approaches. It should also be noted that some studies provided only one or two lines of statements about the evaluation claimed to be performed. Apart from a general lack of rigorous evaluation, a detailed investigation of the reviewed studies employing empirical research methods revealed several quality deficiencies in the majority of the reported studies on most (8 of 11, 72.73%) of the elements of the quality assessment criteria used. However, it should be noted that some of these approaches were in their early stages of development. Some authors also reported that they intended to rigorously evaluate the reported approaches in future.</p><p>The results also reveal a general lack of replicated studies, as 95.60% of the proposed approaches have been evaluated by only one study. The results show that almost all of the studies, except one <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>, were conducted by the researchers who proposed the approaches. This might have caused some bias and subjectivity to the reported effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Moreover, without independent evaluation and replication, it is difficult to develop any useful theoretical foundations for a phenomenon or provide solid and reliable evidence to support a particular technology. We also note that most of the evaluation studies of the reviewed VM approaches do not show any depth of enquiry or a strong evidence to support the claims made in support of the proposed approaches. This lack of replicated studies also makes the conduction of meta-analysis almost impossible. This confirmed that our decision of not performing meta-analysis was correct.</p><p>Another important issue that this systematic review has revealed is the lack of industrial evaluation of the reported approaches. Hence, like other disciplines of software engineering (e.g., requirements and software architecture), evaluation of a large Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">14</ref> The objects studied using VM approaches reported in the reviewed papers.</p></div>

Contrary to a general perception that some well-known publication channels of VM in SPLE will be the dominant sources of studies, the dominance of these well-known channels is not very clear. The implication of this finding for researchers is that limiting the scope of search of primary studies to a short list of well-known publication channels is likely to miss a large number of primary studies, which may only be detected through extensive searches during a comprehensive literature review like ours.</p><p>With respect to the evidence of the effects of VM approaches, all but only one study <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> reported positive effects of the reported approaches. Many of the reviewed studies reported huge positive effects. However, the evaluation methods used do not appear to be scientifically rigorous. It can be said that the lack of scientific rigor regarding the applied evaluation methods might have hidden some confounding factors that could have contributed to the huge positive effects (e.g., dramatic productivity improvements). It might have also hidden the pre-conditions of successfully applying variability management approaches. Based on the reported evidence, it can be concluded that if a VM approach is successfully applied, significantly positive results can be expected. The empirical research efforts should give attention to the question: under what condition different VM approaches could be successfully applied. Based on this review, we can also assert that one major challenge of empirically assessing VM approach is to isolate the effectiveness of the evaluated approach from other software engineering practices (e.g., SPL practices and software configuration management practices). Without such isolation, it is difficult to ascertain the real effect of the evaluated approaches.</p><p>When excluding the papers without an evaluation component during the paper selection stage of our review (see Section 2.2), we also paid attention to the potential impact of the excluded papers based on the number of citations reported on Google Scholar. We noticed that some of the papers that proposed VM approaches but did not have evaluation components were excluded from our systematic review. However, these papers appear to be considered quite influential by software product line community as these papers were highly cited. We decided to enlist some of such papers in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">15</ref>, which shows that all of them got more than 40 citations. Generally the citation number for papers in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">15</ref> is higher than the number of citation of those papers with an evaluation component included in this systematic review. One possible explanation for this finding can be that the researchers in this community may not pay much attention to whether or not an approach has been scientifically evaluated. We also found that the papers in the area of VM of software product lines rarely reference empirical research methodologies published by researchers in empirical software engineering community; for example, guidelines for empirical studies <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>, reporting controlled experiments <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref>, and case studies <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref>. This may be an indication of a general lack of awareness about the available empirical evaluation methods reported by the empirical software engineering community. To improve the status of empirical evaluation of VM approaches, there appears to be an important need of an increased interaction between the software product line and Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) communities. Through such interactions, the SPL researchers can learn about different aspects of the available empirical evaluation methods, while the ESE researchers can become aware of evaluation problems in VM research.</p><p>The findings from this systematic review have revealed that the status of evaluation of VM approaches is unsatisfactory rather poor in certain areas. Not only is the available evidence sparse, but the quality of the reported evaluations is very low. Hence, any estimate of the potential effect of the reviewed VM approaches based on the available evidence can hardly be considered reliable. Empirical evaluation and assessment are expected to play a vital role in rigorous evaluation of the VM approaches. While the findings of this systematic review have several implications for the SPL researchers and practitioners, it also identifies the areas where empirical software engineering community can be encouraged to work with the SPL community to improve the state of the practice of rigorously evaluating research outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Limitations</head><p>The findings of this systematic review may have been affected by certain limitations such as bias in selection of the reviewed papers, inaccuracy in data extraction, inaccuracy in classifying the reported evaluation approaches, and inaccuracy in assigning scoring to each study on each element of the quality assessment criteria used for this study.</p><p>We tried our best to search all papers that had published on VM in SPLE. However, it is possible that we may have not found those papers whose authors might have used other terms for variability management in the early stages of the research on VM or because of the reasons reported by other researchers for their systematic reviews <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">61]</ref>. Our systematic review may also have missed those VM approaches that have been commercialized but have not been reported in the literature with an evaluation component. Since we mainly relied on search engines to retrieve the primary studies, the quality of the used search engines could have influenced the completeness of the identified primary studies. We do not consider this point as a limitation of our review rather an observation, which many other systematic reviewers have reported.</p><p>We also found that many papers lacked sufficient details about the design and execution of the reported studies. That was why sometimes we had to infer certain pieces of the required information. There is, therefore, a possibility that the extraction process may have resulted in some inaccuracies.</p><p>The process of classifying the evaluation approaches used (such as case study, example application, and field experiment) involved subjective decisions by the researchers. To minimize these limitations, whenever there was doubt about evaluation method used in a particular paper, we discussed the reported evaluation method from different perspectives in order to resolve all discrepancies. The subjectivity involved in assessing the quality of the reported studies is another limitation that should be taken into account while interpreting the results of this systematic review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Variability management (VM) is a key activity in software product-line engineering <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. It has been studied for almost 20 years since the early 1990s <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. A large number of VM approaches have been reported during the last two decades. However, there was no attempt to systematically investigate how the VM approaches have been evaluated and what evidence regarding their effectiveness is available. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review of evaluation of VM approaches in SPLE.</p><p>We identified 628 papers from searching the literature, of which 97 papers qualified for data extraction phase after applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria as described in Section 2. These 97 papers reported 91 different VM approaches. A large majority of them are based on feature modelling and/or UML based techniques. There are also a small number of approaches based on some other mechanisms of expressing variability such as natural language, mathematical notation, and domain-specific languages.</p><p>Our systematic review has revealed that VM approaches have been evaluated using a diverse set of evaluation approaches, ranging from ''example application'' to ''field experiment.'' However, a large majority of the papers (80.41%) used ''example application'', ''experience report'', and ''discussion.'' These kinds of approaches lack scientific rigor and discipline. We also found that a large majority of the VM approaches (95.60%) were evaluated by only one study. Moreover, it has been revealed that 71.43% of them have never been evaluated in an industrial setting. These results indicate that a majority of the published VM approaches lack robust assessment. A detailed investigation of the studies employing empirical research methods revealed that a majority of the studies were deficient on most (8 of 11, 72.73%) of the elements of the quality assessment criteria used. Hence, we can conclude that the status of evaluation of VM approaches in software product-line engineering is quite dissatisfactory.</p><p>With respect to the evidences of the effects of VM approaches provided by the evaluation studies, except one study <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>, all others reported positive effects of the reviewed VM approaches. The reported positive effects include improvement of productivity, reduction of complexity, reduction of dependency on experts, improvements on the maintainability, changeability, and evolvability of the product line. Some of the reported positive effects are even dramatic (e.g., several folds of productivity improvement). On the other hand, the lack of scientific rigor and quality of the evaluations may hide some confounding factors that might have contributed to the positive effects reported. Despite these limitations, the existing evidence indicates that SPLE in general and VM in particular are indeed promising in improving productivity as well as quality of the produced products.</p><p>We believe the findings from this review can provide an important contribution to both practitioners and researchers as it can provide them with useful information about different aspects of the VM research outputs. For practitioners, we have identified and synthesized the available evidences of the effects of VM approaches in software product line from very broad literatures. The low quality of evaluation studies revealed by this systematic review can help practitioners to correct misunderstanding and over interpretation of the reported effects of VM approaches in the literature. For researchers, the revelation of paucity of empirical evidence and the scattered distribution of papers over a large number of publication venues can be useful information for those who are going to do literature review in this area.</p><p>The results also highlight the areas, which need immediate attention by researchers to collaborate with practitioners as more active collaboration between these two communities is expected to result in VM technologies, which would have higher potential of industrial adoption. Moreover, the findings of this systematic review should also be of interest to the empirical software engineering community as there is a vital need for conducting high quality empirical studies of VM approaches reported in the literature and the empirical software engineering community is well placed to make significant contributions in this respect by performing independent evaluation of the available VM approaches. For the software product line research community, it is very important that they follow a two-pronged strategy: development of new approaches to managing variability in increasingly large and complex family of systems, and rigorous evaluation of the existing and new VM approaches in order to increase the likelihood of their industrial adoption. -Is there a rationale for why the study was undertaken? -Is the study's focus or main focus on VM in SPLE? -Does the study present empirical data? -Is there a clear statement of the study's primary outcome (i.e., model, method, process or matrix, etc.)? -Is there a clear statement of research question? Context 3. Is there an adequate description of the context in which the research was carried out? Consider whether the researcher has identified: -The industry in which products are used (e.g., banking, telecommunications, consumer goods, travel, etc.) -The nature of the software development organization (e.g., in-house department or independent software supplier) -The skills and experience of software staff (e.g., with a language, a method, a tool, an application domain) -The type of software products used (e.g., a design tool, a compiler) -The software processes being used (e.g., a company standard process, the quality assurance procedures, the configuration management process) Research design 4. Was the research design appropriate to address the aims of the research? Consider: -Has the researcher justified the research design (e.g., have they discussed how they decided which methods to use)? Sampling 5. Was the recruitment strategy appropriate to the aims of the research? Consider: -Has the researcher explained how the participants or cases were identified and selected? -Are the cases defined and described precisely? -Were the cases representative of a defined population? -Have the researchers explained why the participants or cases they selected were the most appropriate to provide access to the type of knowledge sought by the study? -Was the sample size sufficiently large?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B. Detailed quality assessment criteria</head><p>The detailed quality assessment criteria were taken from the work of Dyba and Dinsøyr as reported in <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref>. They based their quality assessment criteria on the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[22]</ref> and principles of good practice of conducting empirical research in software engineering <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. We only made a few minor changes to customize the detailed sub-criteria presented in Appendix B of <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> for our study. Table <ref type="table">16</ref> shows the detailed sub-criteria we used.</p><p>Control group 6. Was there a control group with which to compare treatments? Consider: -How were the controls selected? -Were they representative of a defined population? -Was there anything special about the controls? -Was the non-response high? Could non-respondents be different in any way? Data collection 7. Was the data collected in a way that addressed the research issue? Consider: -Were all measures clearly defined (e.g., unit and counting rules)? -Is it clear how data was collected (e.g., semi-structured interviews, focus group, etc.)? -Has the researcher justified the methods that were chosen? -Has the researcher made the methods explicit (e.g., is there an indication of how interviews were conducted, did they use an interview guide)? -If the methods were modified during the study, has the researcher explained how and why? -Whether the form of the data is clear (e.g., tape recording, video material, notes, etc.) -Whether quality control methods were used to ensure completeness and accuracy of data collection Data analysis 8. Was the data analysis sufficiently rigorous? Consider:</p><p>-Was there an in-depth description of the analysis process? -If thematic analysis was used, is it clear how the categories/ themes were derived from the data? -Has sufficient data been presented to support the findings? -To what extent has contradictory data been taken into account? -Whether quality control methods were used to verify the results Reflexivity (research partnership relations/recognition of researcher bias) 9. Has the relationship between researcher and participants been considered adequately? Consider: -Did the researcher critically examine their own role, potential bias and influence during the formulation of research questions, sample recruitment, data collection, and analysis and selection of data for presentation? -How the researcher responded to events during the study and whether they considered the implications of any changes in the research design. -Are the findings explicit (e.g., magnitude of effect)? -Has an adequate discussion of the evidence, both for and against the researcher's arguments, been demonstrated? -Has the researcher discussed the credibility of their findings (e.g., triangulation, respondent validation, more than one analyst)? -Are limitations of the study discussed explicitly? -Are the findings discussed in relation to the original research questions? -Are the conclusions justified by the results?</p><p>Value of the research 11. Is the study of value for research or practice? Consider: -Does the researcher discuss the contribution the study makes to existing knowledge or understanding (e.g., do they consider the findings in relation to current practice or relevant research-based literature)? -Does the research identify new areas in which research is necessary? -Does the researcher discuss whether or how the findings can be transferred to other populations, or consider other ways in which the research can be used?
