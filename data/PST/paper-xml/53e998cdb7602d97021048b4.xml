<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The distribution of goods or the delivery of services is vital for both customers and modern business activities, since the relevant operating costs constitute a large proportion of the overall field expenses of a company. The problem intensifies from a practical perspective when the vehicle fleet is hired, that is, vehicles do not constitute company assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). In such cases, effective planning is a critical success factor for the operational efficiency and the resulting service level, since non-company resources are responsible for the physical interface with the final customer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The open vehicle routing operational framework is faced by a company which either does not own a vehicle fleet at all, or its fleet is inappropriate or inadequate to satisfy the demand of its customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Thus, the company has to contract all or part of its distribution activities to external carriers. These contractors have their own vehicles, they pay their own vehicle costs (e.g. capital, operating, maintenance and depreciation), and they usually consider a compensation model based on mileage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Whenever the company does not need the contractor or the vehicle back at the depot, the paths followed by the vehicles must not include the vehicle trip after the last delivery (i.e. the return trip to the depot) that will add extra mileage to the compensation model.</p><p>The allocation of distribution functions to third party logistic (3PL) providers is a beneficial business practice for several companies. For example, when a company has its own fleet and customer demand varies over time, the solution to the open vehicle routing problem (OVRP) will provide the proper combination of owned and hired vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Similarly, companies that have a large number of deliveries encounter the same type of problem. Although hiring vehicles is more expensive per unit distance traveled (DT), a number of costs, such as capital, maintenance and depreciation costs, do not occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Typical real-life OVRP examples are the home delivery of packages and newspapers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Recently, Repoussis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> developed a web-based decision support system for a real-life OVRP application concerning the distribution of lubricant products. In all cases, the contractors who are not employees of the delivery company use their own vehicles and do not return to the depot, but their invoice is based on the total DT from the depot to the final customer. When all deliveries are completed, the travel distance and time associated with each vehicle is logged and drivers are free to return to their preferred location, since this portion of travel is not reimbursed. Furthermore, it is assumed that the cost of an additional vehicle will always outweigh any traveling costs that could be saved by its use. The latter reflects the tradeoff between the vehicle hiring cost and transportation cost expressed in terms of DT.</p><p>The OVRP can be described as the problem of designing least cost routes from a depot to a set of customers. Let an incomplete graph G = (V, A), where V = {0, 1, . . . , n} is the node-customer set, A = {a i,j : 0 i, j n, i j} is the arc set and the depot is represented by the node 0. Customers are geographically dispersed within a distance radius that allows their service to be performed via a homogeneous fleet of non-depot returning capacitated vehicles. Each customer i has a demand d i and a service time e i . Furthermore, there is a non-negative distance cost c ij , associated with the travel from i to j. Let m denote the necessary number of vehicles (NV) required to service all customers in a feasible manner, each traveling exactly one route and M = {1, 2, . . . , m} be the set of vehicles. Each vehicle k ∈ M has a maximum capacity C and a maximum route length L that limits the maximum distance it can travel. A solution consists of a set of feasible vehicle routes = {r 1 , r 2 , ... , r m } that correspond to Hamiltonian paths in G over the subset of customers that start from node 0. The routes must be designed such that each customer is visited only once by exactly one vehicle. Furthermore, feasible routes must satisfy both loading and route length constraints. The former state that the accumulated service up to any customer must not exceed the capacity of the vehicle, while the latter bounds to an upper limit the total traveling time of each vehicle route. The objective of the OVRP is first to find the minimum NV required and second to determine the sequence of customers visited by each vehicle such that the total DT is minimized. This paper develops a population-based hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for solving the OVRP. The approach utilizes the basic solution framework of evolutionary algorithms (EA) combined with a memory-based trajectory local search algorithm. The main effort is to monotonically evolve a population of individuals on the basis of the ( + )-evolution strategy (ES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, following a strictly generational course of evolution and an elitist scheme for the selection of survivors. Initiating from a population of adequately diversified individuals, at each generation a new intermediate population of individuals is produced via mutation. For this purpose, a discrete arc-based representation of individuals is utilized, combined with a binary vector of strategy parameters that determines the corresponding mutation rates. A multi-parent recombination operator enables the self-adaptation of the strategy parameters, based on the frequency of appearance of each arc and the diversity of the population. Finally, each offspring is further modified-improved via a hybrid memory-based local search algorithm. The latter uses the basic tabu search (TS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> solution framework to drive the local search process, while the exploration of the solution space is performed on the basis of a guided local search (GLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> augmented objective function. Computational experiments on small and large-scale data sets of the literature demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution method.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a comprehensive literature review on methods proposed for the OVRP. Section 3 elaborates the proposed hybrid ES and provides a detailed description of all algorithmic components. Computational experiments assessing the proof of concept and the quality of the proposed method, along with a comparative performance analysis, are presented in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 conclusions are drawn and pointers for further research are suggested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head><p>Due to its wide applicability and high complexity, the OVRP has generated substantial research considering both its modeling and solution aspects. During the last eight years, tabu search, deterministic annealing, large neighborhood search and branch-and-cut, among other methods, have been successfully applied to the OVRP. Although optimal solutions can be obtained using exact methods, the computational time required to solve adequately large problem instances is still prohibitive. For this reason, the focus of most researchers is given to the design of metaheuristic approaches capable of producing high quality near optimum solutions with reasonable computational burdens. However, research on the large-scale data set of Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is limited so far.</p><p>Bodin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are among the first to address real-life applications that fit the OVRP operational framework. They consider an express airmail distribution problem with several side constraints, such as delivery and pickup time windows, caps on the total route length, vehicle capacities, open routes and other features. Two routing problems (deliveries and pickups) are separately solved, using the well-known savings heuristic of Clarke and Wright <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Sariklis and Powell <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> developed a two-phase construction heuristic, cluster first route second (CFRS), for the OVRP with capacitated vehicles and unlimited route lengths. In the first phase, clusters of customers are formed considering only the capacity of the vehicles. The clusters are subsequently balanced and improved by reassigning customers. In the second phase, open routes are built by solving a minimum spanning tree problem (MSTP). Penalties used to modify the MSTP solution and to restore the feasibility.</p><p>Brandão <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a TS metaheuristic algorithm. Initial solutions are generated using the nearest neighbor heuristic and the K-tree method. Each solution is submitted to an unstringing and stringing procedure for route improvement. The proposed implementation employs the 1-0 Relocate (insert) and the 1-1 Exchange (swap) neighborhood structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A particular feature is that infeasible intermediate solutions (in terms of capacity and maximum route length) are also considered. The objective function is penalized to manage the infeasibilities, while two penalty terms for the over-capacity and over-duration are introduced.</p><p>Pisinger and Ropke <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> developed an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) approach, which contains a set of large neighborhoods that compete to modify the current solution. A predefined set of N -and N + operators are chosen to remove and insert customers from the current solution. At each iteration, the modified solution is accepted if particular criteria defined by a simulated annealing (SA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> master framework are satisfied. An adaptive layer stochastically controls which neighborhood to chose (roulette wheel) with a bias towards its past performance. For diversification, a noise function is used within all operators. Finally, in terms of fleet size minimization, an additional stage prior to LNS is applied.</p><p>Fu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> suggested a TS algorithm. A sequential farthest first insertion-based construction heuristic is used to generate initial solutions. The local search employs four intra-and inter-route neighborhood structures namely node reassignment, node swap, 2-Opt, and tails swap. At each TS iteration, a couple of nodes (customer or depot, on the same route or different routes) and a local move are randomly selected.</p><p>Tarantilis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed a threshold accepting (TA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> approach called backtracking adaptive threshold accepting (BATA). TA is a deterministic version of SA in which a threshold value is specified as the upper bound on the amount of objective function increase allowed. The notion behind the BATA method is the employment of a backtracking policy for the threshold when no acceptances of feasible solutions are encountered during the search. The threshold is not only reduced monotonically during the search, but it may also incorporate an occasional increase, called backtracking. This nonmonotonic behavior results in an oscillating strategy that achieves a dynamic balance between diversification and intensification.</p><p>In a similar fashion, Tarantilis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed a list-based threshold accepting (LBTA) solution method. LBTA incorporates a long-term memory mechanism within the basic TA framework. LBTA uses a list of threshold values (a pre-defined number of solutions visited during the search) that guides intelligently the search process. A competitive advantage of LBTA is the use a single parameter (size of the list). Finally, both BATA and LBTA oscillate stochastically among 2-Opt, 1-1 Exchange and 1-0 Relocate local moves, and consider as primary objective the minimization of the total DT. Tarantilis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> developed an adaptive memory programming (AMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> approach, called BoneRoute. AMP focuses on the exploitation of a collection of memory structures to guide the search. The rationale behind BoneRoute is to produce iteratively new provisional solutions out of sequences of nodes (bones) of routes of previously obtained solutions. The bones are periodically extracted from the adaptive memory (pool of solutions visited during the search). Two selection criteria are considered, a bone must belong to the structure of a pre-specified number of solutions and it must consist of a pre-specified number of nodes. Finally, a construction heuristic is employed to complete the partial provisional solution that had been generated out of the extracted bones, followed by a TS for further improvement.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed a so-called record-to-record travel algorithm. The latter is a deterministic variant of SA approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Initial solutions are produced using a sweep algorithm. Each customer is used as a starting point in the sweep algorithm, so that one solution is generated for each customer. The starting solution for the RTR is the first solution obtained with the smallest possible NV. Let s denote the current solution, at each iteration a s of a neighborhood (s) is selected if f (s ) &lt; Record+Deviation. Record denotes the total distance of the best solution observed so far, while Deviation is defined as k% × Record. Finally, a fixed-length neighbor list of 20 customers is considered.</p><p>Li and Tian <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> developed an ant colony system hybridized with local search and a post-optimization procedure. At each iteration, a set of artificial ants probabilistically build the solutions, exploiting a given pheromone model. The generated solution is then improved by local search. The latter oscillates at random among four intraand inter-route neighborhood structures, following both the firstand the best-accept strategy until no further improvement can be obtained. Next, each ant builds its solution, while the current best found solution is used to update the pheromone trail. Furthermore, a local pheromone update procedure is also included. Finally, a postoptimization procedure is applied to the best encountered local optimum solution. The latter utilizes the aforementioned neighborhood structures in a different order.</p><p>Fleszar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed a multi-start variable neighborhood search (VNS) <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. Initial solutions are produced using a best-fitdecreasing-demand (BFDD) heuristic. Throughout the local search process, intermediate solutions are generated such that the vehicle capacity constraint is satisfied, but not necessarily the maximum traveling time restriction. Another feature of the proposed VNS implementation is an attempt to intensify the search by repeating the examination of each neighborhood, of a particular size, for a predefined number of times. The neighborhood structures employed are intra-route segment reversal and inter-route segment exchange. Finally, at each restart a sampling mechanism is introduced within the BFDD heuristic.</p><p>Finally, Letchford et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> developed a branch-and-cut solution method for the OVRP. Compared to other exact approaches proposed in the literature for the closed and asymmetric capacitated VRP, a number of modifications are introduced regarding the integer programming formulation, the cutting planes and the separation algorithms. Optimum solutions are produced for both small-and medium-scale OVRP instances, while the relative difficulty between the open and closed route variants of the problem is also examined.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Motivation and structure</head><p>The goal is to monotonically evolve a population of individuals on the basis of an ( + )-ES. Let P(t) denote a population of size at generation t and P (t) a population of offspring. At each generation, the survivors from the union of parents P(t) and offspring P (t) are selected to form the next generation population P(t + 1) = [P (t) ∪ P(t)]. Herein, a strictly generational course of evolution is adopted such that one offspring is produced per population individual ( = ). Recombination in terms of solution vectors is omitted and new offspring are generated via mutation. For this purpose, a discrete representation of individuals is utilized, combined with a binary vector of strategy parameters. The latter determines the corresponding mutation rates and evolves by means of a multi-parent recombination operator. On the other hand, the mutation operator exploits the information provided by the strategy parameters and initiates a new offspring following the ruin-andrecreate principle. The idea is first to ruin part of the parent preserving only the components dictated by the strategy parameters, and then reinsert the removed components in a probabilistic-heuristic fashion.</p><p>The rationale behind the above described twin track learning process is first to trace "promising" components of the solutions visited during the search and second to allow the offspring generated via mutation to inherit directly all these components exhibited in parent individuals. Inspired by earlier works of Tarantilis and Kiranoudis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Tarantilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the solution components selected to guide the proposed evolution process are frequently observed arcs. Assuming that high quality solutions share common componentsarcs with other medium quality solutions, the main effort is to evolve each individual in a sequential cooperative fashion and create new offspring out of parental components that appear frequently in other population individuals.</p><p>In an effort to intensify the search within regions of the solution space close to local optimum solutions, each offspring is further improved via a novel hybrid trajectory local search algorithm. The proposed algorithm, called reactive guided tabu search (ReGTS), adopts at the higher level the basic short-term memory TS solution framework to direct the local search process, while the exploration of the neighboring space at the lower level is performed on the basis of a GLS augmented objective function. The use of the GLS penalties within the basic TS framework can be seen as soft taboos that guide the search away from local optimum solutions, controlled by a long-term memory structure as penalties build up during the search.</p><p>Finally, it is important to ensure the evolvability of the population and to maintain a balance between quality and genetic diversity. Although, mutation guarantees to some extent that novel genetic information penetrates the population, the premature convergence to a particular local optimum solution must be avoided. For this purpose, each individual is evaluated according to its quality and distance among the individuals. The latter measures the total number of different arcs (dissimilarity) and the so-called median position of the population with respect to the fittest individual.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Initialization</head><p>A probabilistic insertion-based modification of the well-known savings heuristic of Clarke and Wright <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is utilized during the initialization phase. Since the solution to the ORVP corresponds to open vehicles routes, according to the generalized insertion-based merging scheme proposed by Liu and Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> at least three different merging combinations can be obtained. Let two routes r = {0, w, ... , i, j, ... , z} and r = {0, u, ... , l}, where indexes i, j, w, z, u, l denote customers. The first combination is to insert r after r , i.e. r = {0, w, ... , i, j, ... , z, u, ... , l}, with a corresponding saving c 0uc zu . The second is to insert r in front of r , i.e. r={0, u, ... , l, w, ... , i, j, ... , z}, with a saving c 0wc lw . The third is to insert r within all positions between consecutive customers i, j, i.e. r = {0, w, ... , i, u, ... , l, j, ... , z}. The resulting saving formula can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c ij + c 0u -c iu -c lj .</formula><p>The proposed construction scheme features two further modifications compared to the generic savings heuristic of Clarke and Wright <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. First, merging operations with negative savings are also accepted, while the proposed construction scheme iterates until non-feasible merger can be obtained. Since the first objective of the OVRP is to minimize the total NV, the benefit of merging routes with negative saving overrides the impact on the total DT. Second, a sequential manner of construction similar to traditional insertion construction methods is favored. In fact, if during early stages of construction merging is performed mostly between routes with many customers, the final output tends to be poor in terms of NV deployed, due to the route length restrictions. To this end, an effort is made to boost the merging between routes containing only one customer and routes containing at least two customers. The resulting saving is multiplied by a parameter that represents the degree of sequential construction.</p><p>Similar to greedy randomized construction approaches, a probabilistic mechanism is introduced and it works as follows: First, n single customer vehicle routes are initialized such that each customer is serviced by one vehicle. Subsequently, for each possible pair of routes the associated savings are determined and ordered in a list, called restricted savings list (RSL), composed of the most beneficial savings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. To this end, one saving-merger is selected at random from the list (equal selection probability), but not necessary the top one of the list. The selected merger is applied, while the overall probabilistic construction scheme iterates until no feasible merger can be obtained. The value of determines the extent of "randomization" and "greed" of construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In the proposed implementation, the RSL is cardinality-based and fixed to a predefined size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Arc-guided representation of individuals</head><p>Let a solution = {r 1 , r 2 , ... , r m } that consists of a set of feasible vehicle routes. Clearly, the solution can be seen either as a vector of nodes, i.e. x node = {0, i, j, ... , 0, u, z, ...}, where i, j, u, z ∈ V and the sequence of routes is delimited by the depot nodes. The node vector can be directly transformed into the equivalent vector of arcs, i.e. x arc = {a 0,i , a i,j , ... , a 0,u , a u,z , ...} with n + k ranked discrete coordinates, where k denotes the cardinality of set . On the other hand, the vector of strategy parameters is defined as follows: each element x i of x arc is allocated to exactly one element i of that is used to adjust the mutation rate. Since x is composed of discrete elements, a binary vector ∈ {0, 1} n+k is considered. Our intuition is to let the strategy parameters contain encoded information with respect to the individual's components (arcs in our case) that will be subject to mutation. If the value of the element i is 1, this indicates that the corresponding element x i will be maintained to the next generation offspring; otherwise it will be subject to mutation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Multi-parent recombination</head><p>Given the above described arc-based representation of individuals, the question is how to facilitate the self-adaptation of the strategic parameters aiming at the improvement of the individuals. For this purpose, a multi-parent recombination operator is applied to the strategy parameters of each solution vector. The rationale is to select and extract promising solution components from each population individual in a purely deterministic fashion.</p><p>Initially, the frequency of appearance i,j of each arc a i,j within the population is determined. Additionally, a threshold frequency of acceptance ∈ N + is defined with respect to the size and the current diversity of the population. The threshold indicates the least number of population individuals that must include a particular arc. As such, the element a i,j of a solution vector x is considered as promising, if a i,j is exhibited in more than individuals. Therefore, each i ∈ is set to 1, if i,j of the corresponding element x i ∈ x is greater than or equal to ; otherwise it is set to 0.

Assuming that during early stages of the evolution large distances among individuals are observed, is forced to small values (low mutation rates) in order to ensure convergence reliability. On the contrary, over the course of evolution and as individuals are getting more similar and tend to converge to the best encountered solution, will progressively increase (high mutation rates) in order to diversify the search. Herein, the mutation rate is expressed as the total number of customers mutated-modified (changed positions) during the reproduction of an offspring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Mutation</head><p>During mutation, a new offspring is generated from a single parent. The goal is first to remove a selected set of customers from the individual, and then to add the removed customers to the partially ruined individual in a probabilistic-heuristic fashion. The strategy parameters dictate which elements of the solution vector will be removed and preserved, respectively.</p><p>From the implementation viewpoint, the mutation operator works as follows: initially, the arc-based solution vector x arc is transformed into the equivalent node-based x node vector. Next, nodes-customers are removed sequentially from x node such that arcs a i,j with strategy parameters equal to 0 are removed from the equivalent x arc . Thus, the resulting x arc corresponds to a vector of strategy parameters where all elements i ∈ are equal to 1. Finally, single customer vehicle routes are generated to service the removed set of customers, while the partially ruined solution vector is re-constructed via the probabilistic construction heuristic described in Section 3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Reactive guided tabu search</head><p>Hybrid metaheuristics aim at exploiting the strengths of different concepts and strategies. Interaction can take place either at lowlevel or at high-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The proposed ReGTS belongs to the first category. It utilizes the short-term memory TS framework to direct a trajectory local search process, while the exploration of the neighboring space is performed on the basis of a GLS algorithm. Whenever the search is trapped, GLS selects and penalizes a predefined set of solution features. The idea is to penalize unfavorable features, i.e. long arcs (large inner-customer distances), that are unlikely to occur in an optimum solution.</p><p>GLS associates a cost and a penalty to each feature and augments the objective function by adding penalties to the selected features. The features selected to guide the search process in our case is the set A of all possible undirected arcs {(i, j) : 0 i, j n, i j} of a solution vector. The feature costs are derived from the associated arc distances c ij . Let a solution be represented by s and f (s) the objective cost function. GLS defines a new augmented function h(s) that replaces f (s) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">h(s) = f (s) + (i,j)∈A (p i,j I i,j (s))<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where is a scaling parameter, p i,j is the penalty value for each feature (i, j) (arc a i,j ) and I i,j is an indication of whether s exhibits feature (i, j).</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">I i,j (s) = 1 if s exhibits feature (i, j) 0 otherwise<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Clearly, a high cost feature affects the overall cost more compared to other features. However, one should consider the number of times a feature has already been penalized. The more often a feature appears and is penalized, the less likely it is to be penalized further. Thus, the utility U i,j (s * ) of penalizing an arc a i,j , under a local optimum solution s * , can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">U i,j (s * ) = I i,j (s * )c i,j 1 + p i,j<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The utility function <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> states that the higher the cost c i,j the greater the utility of penalizing arc a i,j . On the other hand, the more times a feature has been penalized, the lower the utility of penalizing it again. Similarly, if a feature a i,j is not exhibited in s * the utility is 0. Therefore, given a local optimum solution the feature with the greatest utility will be penalized and its penalty value will increase by 1 (p i,j = p i,j + 1). Furthermore, since undirected arcs are considered herein, the arc a j,i is also penalized. As stated in Voudouris and Tsang <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, by taking cost and penalty values into consideration, the search can focus on more promising regions that exhibit low cost features and prevent the search from directing all efforts to any particular region.</p><p>Important to the efficiency of the search is the parameter . As mentioned in Voudouris and Tsang <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, is instance dependent; however, appropriate values can be found by dividing the cost of the current local optimum solution f (s * ) with the total number of penalized features present, times a scaling factor that is relatively instance independent. In this case, can be dynamically tuned during the search. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, if the current local optimum solution contains a significant amount of penalized features, is forced to small values in order to fade out the effect of the penalties.</p></div>

These soft taboos are controlled by a long-term memory structure as penalties build up during the search and they are reinitialized whenever a new local optimum solution is reached. Another point of particular importance is the use of twin aspiration conditions. In particular, the tabu status of a neighboring solution can be overridden if s improves the current local optimum solution s * or s is the best encountered solution with respect to the GLS augmented function. The advantage of monitoring both the actual and augmented values guarantees that improved solutions are not missed during the search.</p><p>The neighborhood structures y used within ReGTS are based on traditional edge-exchange local moves (see for details <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>), namely inter-and intra-route 2-Opt, 1-0 Relocate and 1-1 Exchange. The selection of neighborhood structures is purely stochastic, while equal selection probability level is assigned to all of them. At each iteration, given the allowed set y (s), the best admissible neighbor s or s replaces the current solution s, while the forward and reversal attributes of the corresponding local move are stored within the tabu list. The latter keeps track of the most recently visited solution attributes and forbids moves towards them. As such, solutions possessing attributes of recently visited ones are temporarily declared "tabu". The duration the solution attributes remain tabu is called tenure.</p><p>In the literature, several search techniques have been proposed to speed up the neighborhood examination at no quality loss. When handling edge-exchange neighborhood structures it is not necessary to evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution, but only to keep track of the differences with respect to the edges (arcs) that change state (being deleted or added). Additionally, it is unnecessary to evaluate the whole neighborhood at each step, since the effect of such edge-exchanges is limited to the routes they modify, which are at most 2 in our case. Thus, once an exchange is executed, only those exchanges involved within the modified routes are re-evaluated, while it is sufficient to store only the best admissible exchange for each structure.</p><p>On the other hand, in order to work efficiently with the augmented objective function, the move evaluation mechanism described above needs to be modified. Clearly, it is not necessary to evaluate the augmented objective function for each neighboring solution, but only to calculate the difference h in the amount of penalties. Similar to the edge-exchange move evaluation mechanism, one needs to take into account only the penalties of the features that are being deleted or added. To this end, the penalties p ij of each arc a i,j are arranged in a non-symmetric penalty matrix [p ij ]. Thus, h is derived from the difference between the sum of the penalties over all features added and the sum of the penalties over all features deleted, multiplied by .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Evaluation and selection</head><p>The evaluation and selection strategy adopted in this paper is purely deterministic and elitist towards high quality individuals. The main effort is to account for attractiveness both in terms of solution quality and level of dissimilarity, in order to ensure in the long term the evolvability of the population. In particular, three criteria in a hierarchical order are used for the evaluation of individuals. The first is the fleet size, the second is the total traveling cost and the third is the number of different arcs with respect to the fittest individual.</p><p>Initially, all individuals s of P(t) are placed into P(t + 1). Then, each offspring s of P(t) is compared to the corresponding parent individual s and if s performs better than s, then P(t + 1) is updated accordingly. Next, the best and the worst fit individuals s * and s w of P(t + 1) are identified and the median similarity M s * P(t+1) is determined. Subsequently, the remaining offsprings s of P (t) (if any) are competing against individuals currently placed into P(t + 1) with respect to the level of similarity. More specifically, if s performs better than s r and its level of similarity D s * s is lower than the current M s * P(t+1) , then s replaces s r . In addition, if s performs better than any individual s ∈ P(t + 1) and its level of similarity D s * s is lower than D s * s of s, then s replaces s .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Parameter settings</head><p>The proposed solution method introduces six parameters, namely the degree of sequential construction , the size of the restricted savings list, the tabu tenure (size of the short-term memory), the maximum number of iterations maxCount without observing any further improvement, the size of the population and the GLS scaling parameter . Most of these parameters are commonly used within metaheuristic implementations proposed in the literature for vehicle routing problems and several authors suggest appropriate ranges and settings. Below, the influence of each parameter is discussed and suitable value ranges are provided. </p></div>

Clearly, must be greater than or equal to 1 in order to boost the effect of sequential construction. However, large values of may affect the impact of the other types of savings. Based on computational experiments, a value range between 1.1 and 1.6 was found to fit well for most problem instances. In the proposed implementation, is set equal to 1.3.</p><p>On the other hand, parameter determines the extent of randomization and greed during construction (initialization) and re-construction (mutation) of individuals. The degrees of freedom throughout the evolution process are significantly reduced if the initial population contains similar individuals. The larger the effect of randomization the larger is the diversity. However, one should note that as is getting larger, the loss in terms of quality also increases and the gain regarding diversity is relatively small. Repoussis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> conducted a series of experiments for the vehicle routing problem with time windows and suggested that values of &gt; 10 can generate adequately distant solutions. Our findings are similar for the OVRP. In particular, a range between 6 and 16 was found to be adequate.</p><p>The influence of can be seen as follows: small values favor intensification and do not allow the continuous penetration of novel genetic information. The latter results in less diversified individuals and rapid increase in the average similarity without the analogous output in terms of solution quality (premature convergence to low quality solutions). On the other hand, larger values provide a better sampling of the solution space and ensure a reasonable convergence velocity. However, as increases the convergence speed reduces due to the larger diversity of the strategy parameters. On the basis of the above, = 8 was found to provide a good compromise in terms of speed and reliability, diversity and quality for both small and largescale problem instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Local search parameters</head><p>Three parameters need to be defined during the local search; the size of the tabu list, the scaling parameter and the maximum number of iterations maxCount. A tabu tenure between 20 and 40 is mostly used by standard TS implementations of the literature for intensification search. Since the forward and reversal attributes of local moves are stored, herein the tenure is set equal to 40. Based on computational experiments and following the suggestions of Voudouris and Tsang <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for the traveling salesman problem, values within the range 0.05 and 0.25 seem to fit well for parameter .</p><p>It is important to control the amount of time invested for local search by means of ReGTS. One may expect that large values of maxCount could increase the efficiency. However, a balance between efficiency and effectiveness is necessary, since large values may result in excessive computational time consumption. During experimental tests, a range between 60 and 180 was found to provide a good compromise for both small and large-scale problem instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Population size</head><p>Sensitive to the global search capabilities of the proposed method is the population size . The size of the population can affect significantly the overall performance and the quality of the solutions produced. Small values of (less than 15) are certainly not sufficient to handle the amount of information included by the individuals, especially for large-scale instances. On the contrary, larger values of (greater than 50) can exploit the larger diversity of the strategy parameters. However, there is a tradeoff in terms of time consumption as increases, since the amount of time consumed from local search also increases and the convergence speed reduces. To this end, it seems reasonable to relate with the total number of customers n. During our experiments, better results on average are obtained if varies as a function of n. However, for problem instances with more than 300 customers, the time consumption increases rather rapidly. On the basis of the above, a population size of more than 30 individuals was found to be adequate.</p></div>

One simulation run is considered for each instance with fixed parameter settings and a maximum allowed CPU time consumption of 2000 s. However, average results from multiple executions with the same parameter set are also reported to indicate how much variability can be expected.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presented a hybrid ES for solving the OVRP. The suggested method evolves a population of individuals by means of a ( + )-ES. Following a deterministic selection scheme of survivors, offsprings are produced exclusively via mutation out of arcs extracted from single parent individuals. The latter utilizes a discrete arc-based representation combined with a binary vector of strategy parameters that dictate the mutation rates. In addition, a multiparent recombination operator is applied to the strategy parameters of each individual, based on the frequency of appearance of each arc and the diversity of population. Each offspring is further improved through a novel memory-based trajectory local search algorithm tuned for intensification search. The basic TS framework is used to direct the local search process, while the exploration of the solution space is performed via a GLS augmented objective function that penalizes undirected arcs.</p><p>Results on well-known benchmark data sets of the literature demonstrated the competitiveness and accuracy of the proposed method with fixed configuration of parameters and reasonable computational burdens. Compared to the state-of-the-art, it proved to be highly efficient producing several new best solutions, while it obtained the minimum published fleet size for both small and largescale problem instances. Furthermore, a general solution framework is introduced, which can be adopted to address other vehicle routing problem variants or similar discrete permutation flow combinatorial optimization problems. A research direction worth pursuing is towards the investigation of more sophisticated recombination operators that will incorporate intelligent pattern-identification mechanisms. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Benchmark data sets of<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> </figDesc><table><row><cell>Problem instance</cell><cell>n</cell><cell>C</cell><cell>L</cell><cell>e</cell><cell>K min</cell></row><row><cell>C1</cell><cell>50</cell><cell>160</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>5</cell></row><row><cell>C2</cell><cell>75</cell><cell>140</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>10</cell></row><row><cell>C3</cell><cell>100</cell><cell>200</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>C4</cell><cell>150</cell><cell>200</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>12</cell></row><row><cell>C5</cell><cell>199</cell><cell>200</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>16</cell></row><row><cell>C6</cell><cell>50</cell><cell>160</cell><cell>180</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>5</cell></row><row><cell>C7</cell><cell>75</cell><cell>140</cell><cell>144</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>10</cell></row><row><cell>C8</cell><cell>100</cell><cell>200</cell><cell>207</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>C9</cell><cell>150</cell><cell>200</cell><cell>180</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>12</cell></row><row><cell>C10</cell><cell>199</cell><cell>200</cell><cell>180</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>16</cell></row><row><cell>C11</cell><cell>120</cell><cell>200</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>7</cell></row><row><cell>C12</cell><cell>100</cell><cell>200</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>10</cell></row><row><cell>C13</cell><cell>120</cell><cell>200</cell><cell>648</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>7</cell></row><row><cell>C14</cell><cell>100</cell><cell>200</cell><cell>936</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>10</cell></row><row><cell>F11</cell><cell>71</cell><cell>30,000</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell>F12</cell><cell>134</cell><cell>2210</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>7</cell></row><row><cell>Table 2</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Benchmark data sets of [3]</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Problem instance</cell><cell>n</cell><cell></cell><cell>C</cell><cell></cell><cell>K min</cell></row><row><cell>O1</cell><cell>200</cell><cell></cell><cell>900</cell><cell></cell><cell>5</cell></row><row><cell>O2</cell><cell>240</cell><cell></cell><cell>550</cell><cell></cell><cell>9</cell></row><row><cell>O3</cell><cell>280</cell><cell></cell><cell>900</cell><cell></cell><cell>7</cell></row><row><cell>O4</cell><cell>320</cell><cell></cell><cell>700</cell><cell></cell><cell>10</cell></row><row><cell>O5</cell><cell>360</cell><cell></cell><cell>900</cell><cell></cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>O6</cell><cell>400</cell><cell></cell><cell>900</cell><cell></cell><cell>9</cell></row><row><cell>O7</cell><cell>440</cell><cell></cell><cell>900</cell><cell></cell><cell>10</cell></row><row><cell>O8</cell><cell>480</cell><cell></cell><cell>1000</cell><cell></cell><cell>10</cell></row></table></figure>
