<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>P ROVIDING multimedia access capabilities to mobile terminals requires low-complexity signal processing algorithms to combat fading and intersymbol interference (ISI) which arise in the context of multipath propagation, while trying to minimize the power requirements (and thus the cost) of the reception unit. Turbo equalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> combines equalization and channel decoding in a jointly optimized scheme and provides a reliable solution to improve the radio link performance of single-carrier transmissions in severe frequency-selective environments.</p><p>The optimal realization of the turbo equalizer relies on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) equalizer to combat ISI <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In spite of its excellent performance, its use is essentially restricted to short delay-spread channels and low-order modulations (typically binary phase-shift keying BPSK and quaternary phaseshift keying QPSK) for complexity issues. Therefore, alternative equalization strategies have been proposed in the literature. Among them, the class of sub-optimum reduced-state trellisbased equalizers appears as a promising candidate for use in a turbo equalization scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. However, they generally require the use of a front-end prefilter in order to concentrate the energy in the first taps of the equivalent minimum-phase channel to achieve satisfactory performance. Moreover, with the exception of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, they do not strictly address the increasing complexity issue arising from the use of higher-order modulations. Turbo equalization relying on linear filtering operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> thus offers a reliable alternative able to deal with multilevel modulation schemes at a relatively low computational cost.</p><p>Considering current mobile digital cellular systems such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) in Europe or Industry Standard (IS) 136 in the United States, linear equalization (LE) has been discarded in favor of maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) because of the resulting noise enhancement. However, when used in a turbo equalization scheme, the performance achieved by LE with a priori information compares favorably with MAP equalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> while retaining a significantly lower complexity.</p><p>In this paper, we derive the infinite-length linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear equalizer with a priori information which may be viewed as a particular instance of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) equalizer. By determining the theoretical transfer function of the infinite-length MMSE equalizer, this paper completes publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> where the equalizer was realized entirely in adaptive form without paying particular attention to the exchange of probabilistic information between the equalizer and the decoder. In addition, we expose a suboptimal finite-length realization of this equalizer, where the filter coefficients are computed from preliminary channel estimates using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Finally, the performance of the proposed receiver is investigated for various code rates in the context of the enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the turbo equalization model, where the information data bits are coded, interleaved and then transmitted over a frequency selective channel, using M-ary phase-shift keying ( -PSK) or M-ary quadrature amplitude-modulated ( -QAM) signaling. The optimum infinite-length MMSE linear equalizer with a priori information is derived in Section III in the turbo equalization context. In Section IV, we describe a low-complexity computation procedure relying on the FFT to realize the equalizer in finite-length form. Application scenarios for EGPRS radio links are investigated in Section V. Conclusions are given in Section VI. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Transmission Scheme</head><p>Let us consider the transmission scheme depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A rate convolutional encoder (punctured or not) is fed by independent binary data taking values in with equal probability. A random interleaver shuffles the resulting coded data sequence. Each set of successive interleaved binary coded bits ;</p><p>is mapped onto an -ary complex symbol with variance at the symbol rate . We restrict ourselves to a Gray labeling map in this work. For -QAM signals, the real and imaginary parts of symbol take values in the set with . The signal at the output of the discrete-time equivalent channel is corrupted by additive, zero-mean, circularly symmetric white Gaussian noise with total variance . The receiver observes the noisy channel output <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where the set denotes the coefficients of the discrete-time equivalent channel model. The transfer function of the channel is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> with <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> and where integration is carried out over the Nyquist band in the previous expression. The SNR at the turbo equalizer input is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SNR (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where average received energy per information bit; one-sided noise power spectral density at the receiver input; discrete-time autocorrelation function of the channel impulse response, defined by (5)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Turbo Equalization Principle</head><p>Following the turbo principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> as applied to the decoding of serially concatenated turbo codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the turbo equalizer is an iterative receiver where the equalization and decoding operations are repeated several times on the same set of received channel symbols. Each equalization and decoding step is carried out by a module supplied with the channel observations as well as with a priori information on the coded bits in log-likelihood ratio (LLR) form delivered by the previous module. We will now describe the structure of a turbo-equalization module.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, a soft-input soft-output (SISO) symbol mapper first computes soft estimates about the transmitted symbol from the a priori LLRs available at the input. Together with the channel observation, the resulting symbol estimates enter a linear equalizer. At the equalizer output, a memoryless SISO symbol demapper delivers a sequence of extrinsic information that is deinterleaved and submitted as a priori information, denoted , to the channel decoder input. Note that, as shown Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the SISO demapper should exploit the a priori information in order to improve performance when nonbinary signal sets are considered, especially for labeling rules other than Gray mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The cascade of the SISO mapper, MMSE inner equalizer and SISO demapper forms an overall SISO MMSE equalizer. On the basis of the extrinsic LLRs delivered by the demapper, the SISO channel decoder implements the Log-MAP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and computes a posteriori LLRs on the coded bits <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> These a posteriori LLRs are interleaved again and delivered to the next module as updated a priori information for a new equalization and decoding step. This soft information exchange allows the equalizer to benefit from the coding gain and vice versa.</p><p>Note that in contrast with common practice, we purposely feed back here the entire a posteriori information from the decoder to the equalizer. When considering MMSE turbo equalization of high-order modulation, we have noticed non negligible performance degradations when feeding back only the extrinsic information. Interestingly, other researchers have come up with the same observation in a similar context <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Theoretical Infinite-Length MMSE Equalizer</head><p>In this section, we derive the expression of the infinite-length MMSE linear equalizer in the presence of a priori information about the transmitted symbols, which is referred to as the "ISI Canceller-Linear Equalizer" (IC-LE) in the sequel. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> depicts the equalizer structure, which consists of two transversal filters operating on the received samples and the soft estimates , respectively.</p><p>From (1) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the output of the equalizer is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where and are the coefficients of the transversal filters with respective transfer functions and , and where we have introduced the transfer function with coefficients defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> Following the turbo-principle, the output of the equalizer should be independent of the a priori symbol at time . Consequently, and as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we impose the condition , being the reference tap of the feedback filter. From ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), the equalized sample at time can be expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where denotes the residual interference and the filtered noise at the equalizer output. We shall assume in the sequel that follows a complex Gaussian distribution with zero-mean and variance . Although this assumption does not rigorously hold, it simplifies the derivation and gives good results in practice. Then, we can define the signal to noise ratio at the equalizer output as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> The transfer function of the equalizer has been calculated according to the maximization of the quantity (see the Appendix). We obtain the following theoretical transfer functions for the infinite-length IC-LE filters (16) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Different equalizers are obtained depending on the value of the scalar parameter . For example, setting yields the infinite-length unbiased MMSE IC-LE. Here, we consider the particular case of the minimization of the mean-square error (MSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> We obtain the following value for (see the Appendix) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where we have introduced the quantity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Interestingly, it turns out that the equalizer performance is completely characterized by the knowledge of the single reference Using ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>), one easily obtains the variance characterizing the Gaussian conditional distribution at the equalizer output <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> This parameter is required by the SISO demapper (see Section III-C).</p><p>One readily verifies from ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) that for the particular values and , the IC-LE becomes equivalent to a classical MMSE LE <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and to an ideal MMSE IC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, respectively. Consequently, the IC-LE presents a configurable structure that adapts the equalization strategy according to the reliability of the soft symbol estimates , as measured by the parameter .</p><p>Note finally that the structure of the IC-LE depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> can be modified in order to decrease the overall number of filters coefficients. The resulting configuration is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and can be identified with the equalization scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, we showed that under finite-length realization constraints, the IC-LE becomes rigorously equivalent to the approximate MMSE LE </p></div>

SISO Demapper</head><p>The SISO demapper <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> computes a posteriori LLRs on the coded bits given the knowledge of the two observations and which are the equalizer output and the a priori LLRs feeding the SISO decoder, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> Applying Bayes rules, (25) becomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> where denotes the set of symbols whose th bit has value .</p><p>Using the results of Section III-B, the conditional probability is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> according to the Gaussian assumption at the equalizer output.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PRACTICAL REALIZATION OF THE INFINITE-LE</head><p>We focus in this paper on burst transmissions over quasi-static multipath Rayleigh-fading channels where the channel coefficients are assumed to be constant over the burst duration. Hence, the equalizer settings need only be computed once per burst. The optimum transfer function for the MMSE LE with a priori information was derived in Section III-B in infinite-length form, and thus does not lend itself to a direct implementation with finite impulse response (FIR) filters. Different approaches can be used in practice to obtain the filter coefficients under finite-length realization constraints.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the equalizer coefficients were computed using standard adaptive filtering algorithms with complexity, where is the number of filter taps. This method does not require any preliminary channel estimation step. However, a long training sequence may be necessary for the equalizer to reach its steady-state, thereby restricting the application of this strategy for long bursts or continuous-mode transmissions over time-invariant or slow-fading channels. Considering now short burst transmissions, the equalizer coefficients are usually computed from an estimate of the channel impulse response, which is in turn typically obtained from known short training sequences embedded into each data block. Calculation of the optimum filter coefficients under finite-length realization constraints then involves a matrix inversion that can be carried out with operations when the channel convolution matrix is Toeplitz. In this context, we showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> that the finite-length IC-LE becomes rigorously equivalent to the approximate MMSE-LE (I) proposed by TÃ¼chler et al. in [12, sec. III-B], so that the time-recursive computation procedures suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> apply as well. In this paper, we consider instead a computationally efficient (but suboptimal) alternative method relying on the FFT to calculate the equalizer coefficients.</p><p>This method involves evaluating the infinite-length transfer function in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) at the set of uniformly-spaced discrete frequencies , yielding</p><p>Such a computation can be carried out efficiently in operations with the FFT when is chosen as a power of 2. Then, performing an inverse FFT on the sampled frequency-response returns the impulse response of the equalizer over points in the time-domain. The impulse response of the feedback filter given by ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) is then finally obtained as the convolution of with . We emphasize that the proposed computation procedure is inherently suboptimal with respect to the matrix approach since it technically involves approximating a Toeplitz matrix by a circulant matrix, an assumption that rigorously holds only asymptotically, for . Hence, its accuracy will depend on the number of points considered in the FFT operations. This issue will be examined in greater detail in Section V-C.</p><p>We have focused so far on the computational cost associated with the determination of the equalizer coefficients. However, the filtering operations are usually more expensive in terms of implementation complexity. We have restricted ourselves to time-domain filtering in this paper. Frequency-domain filtering and more generally frequency-domain equalization may nevertheless be preferable over very long delay-spread channels, as pointed out for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Burst Transmission Over Mobile Radio Channels</head><p>Simulations of the proposed scheme were conducted in the context of EGPRS that is part of the enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE) radio access scheme. The burst structure is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. A burst includes a middle training sequence of 26 symbols and 8.25 guard symbols at the end. It carries 2 58 payload data symbols, each symbol comprising 3 bits. EGPRS uses 8-PSK modulation combined with a linearized Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) pulse shaping filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, [32], allowing 8-PSK to fit into the GSM spectrum mask. We will show in the sequel that this pulse introduces ISI, which makes equalization mandatory at the receiver side, even on the ideal bandlimited additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. A Gray-labeling map was considered in our simulations. The additional signal set rotation that is advocated before transmit filtering in the GSM technical specification <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> was not taken into account, for the sake of simplicity. Note, however, that the influence of this rotation on the performance is negligible <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>For the system simulations, we used the following channel models specified in the GSM standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>: static (ST) (time-invariant channel with no time dispersion); typical urban (TU); hilly terrain (HT); and equalizer test (EQ) with 6 taps. For the TU, HT, and EQ channels, we considered a slow-varying Rayleigh-fading channel (i.e., low mobility). The channel coefficients are then assumed to remain constant during the transmission of a burst. Moreover, we assume ideal frequency hopping (iFH) so that consecutive bursts face independent channel realizations. The receiver filter is a square-root raised cosine filter with roll-off factor 0.3.</p><p>The overall channel model accounting for the linearized GMSK transmit pulse, the mobile radio channel and the receiver filter was computed with an oversampling factor equal to 36. The power distribution of the resulting channel impulse response for the different channel profiles is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. We observe that the length of the overall impulse response depends on the channel model. After symbol-rate sampling, the discrete-time equivalent channel model spans and 7 symbol periods for the ST, TU, HT, and EQ profiles, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Simulation Context for EGPRS</head><p>The EGPRS specifications define nine coding schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. Five among them (MCS-5 to MCS-9) employ 8-PSK signaling. For the sake of simplicity, the performance results will be examined only over the user data which are encoded by a rate-nonrecursive nonsystematic convolutional encoder with constraint length 7 and octal generator polynomials 133, 171, 145. Different puncturing patterns are used to obtain various code rates. In our simulations, we focused on the MCS-5, MCS-8, and MCS-9 coding schemes with user data code rates , , and , respectively. Our implementation closely follows the GSM technical recommendations, with the exception of the deterministic interleaver which has been replaced by a pseudorandom permutation. The coded punctured user data bits combined with the header part and the flag result in a block of 1392 bits. These bits are partitioned over 4 data blocks of 348 bits, i.e., 2 58 8-PSK symbols, which are finally mapped onto four different bursts.</p><p>The radio link performance is characterized by the block error rate (BLER) measured after decoding versus (4). A packet (458 information bits) is rejected if at least one information bit is erroneous after decoding. Note that this criterion is more pessimistic than the more practical one based on the use of a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code. Simulations are stopped when 250 packets have been discarded. The bit-error rate (BER) versus is also evaluated. Our simulations assume both perfect channel estimation and synchronization. Note that does not take into account the bandwidth expansion caused by the training sequence.</p><p>The reference curve, represented by a dashed-dotted line, corresponds to the ideal matched filter bound (MFB). It was obtained experimentally from the IC-LE equalizer supplied with perfect knowledge about the transmitted data symbols (see Section III-B). Note that for the ST channel, the discrete-time equivalent channel has three time-invariant coefficients equal to , respectively. In this case, the MFB corresponds to the performance of the coded transmission scheme over an ISI-free AWGN channel. Five iterations are performed  at the receiver side. They are represented as solid lines on the plots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Accuracy of the FFT-Based Coefficient Computation Procedure</head><p>In this section, we investigate the accuracy of the low-complexity coefficient computation procedure described in Section IV according to the number of FFT points, and compares it with the optimum calculation method involving a matrix inversion. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> presents the BLER performance of the turbo-equalizer obtained over the TU channel model with the MCS-8 coding scheme at the first iteration. Note that the IC-LE then reduces to a classical MMSE LE. This constitutes a worst-case study since as the reliability of the data estimates increases across the iterations, the IC-LE converges toward an ideal MMSE IC which generally requires fewer coefficients than an MMSE LE. We observe that choosing points for the FFT method provides close to optimum performance in this context, except at high SNR. In the latter case, when the noise variance is small, the MMSE LE approaches a zero-forcing LE and more coefficients are then required with the FFT method to compensate for deep fading in the channel frequency response.</p><p>We retained the FFT computation procedure with coefficients for the following simulation results in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Performance Comparison Between MMSE and MAP Turbo Equalization</head><p>We define a MAP turbo equalizer and an MMSE turbo equalizer as the iterative receivers employing a MAP equalizer or the MMSE IC-LE of Section III, respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> presents the simulation results (BLER and BER) obtained over the time-invariant ST channel model in the MCS-5 context. At SNRs greater than 3 dB, only four iterations are necessary to reach a steady-state of the iterative process which closely approaches the reference (MFB) performance. We thus observe that the intersymbol interference caused by the GSM pulse is almost completely cancelled by the turbo equalizer without noise enhancement at high enough SNR. We also note that MAP turbo equalization outperforms MMSE turbo equalization at low SNR 3 dB . However, the performance gain remains marginal with respect to the complexity required by the MAP equalizer (64 states). Finally, we notice a significant  performance improvement of several decibels between the first and the fifth iteration, independently of the equalizer considered. This demonstrates the benefits offered by an iterative equalization and decoding process in this context. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> compares the performance obtained with the MAP and MMSE turbo equalization schemes over the time-varying TU channel in the MCS-5 context. At the third iteration, the BLER performance of the MAP turbo-equalizer reaches the MFB bound even at low SNR, whereas we observe a performance loss of about 1 dB in terms of BER. This phenomenon actually results from the fact that one erroneous block can cause a large number of bit errors and thus severely affect the BER performance. Note also that although the performance of the MMSE turbo equalizer is slightly worse than that of MAP turbo equalization, its complexity is significantly lower. The MMSE IC-LE equalizer involves only linear filtering operations whereas the corresponding MAP equalizer operates here on a 512-state trellis.</p></div>

Performance of the MMSE IC-LE Turbo-Equalizer Over Long Delay-Spread Channels</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> presents the performance of the MMSE IC-LE turbo equalizer in the EGPRS/MCS-5 context over the HT and EQ time-varying channels. The ability of the MMSE turbo equalizer to exploit the high diversity offered by long delay-spread channels is demonstrated in the EQ channel simulation. We observe in particular that MMSE turbo-equalization achieves significant power gains over the conventional approach where equalization and decoding are performed separately, using only a few <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> iterations. In addition, it is worth noting that the performance gain is greater in terms of BLER than in terms of BER, a situation that is particularly attractive for packet transmissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Performance of the MMSE IC-LE Turbo Equalizer as a Function of the Code Rate</head><p>Finally, Figs. 10 and 11 present the performance of the MMSE turbo equalizer in EGPRS/MCS-8 and MCS-9 contexts over the time-invariant ST channel and the time-varying TU channel. Again, we observe that the iterative receiver offers remarkable performance gains between the first and the fifth iterations. These results actually demonstrate that turbo-equalization may be beneficial even for transmission scenarios with very high code rates. We recall that the code rate is increased from 1/3 to 1 by proper puncturing in the MCS-9 context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper describes an infinite-length MMSE turbo equalizer that relies on a low-complexity linear equalizer. A computationally efficient coefficient computation procedure  relying on the FFT has been described in order to realize the equalizer in finite-length form. The resulting receiver appears as a promising candidate for improving the performance of existing single-carrier packet transmission schemes. Simulations of the turbo equalizer in EGPRS/MCS-5, MCS-8, and MCS-9 contexts show that 3-5 dB power gains can be achieved on the BLER performance in comparison with conventional receivers performing one-time equalization and decoding. Moreover, owing to its low complexity, this receiver overcomes the difficulty arising with high-order modulation (8-PSK and above) in comparison with existing reduced-complexity trellis-based equalization algorithms. In particular, the prefilter that is usually required at the receiver front-end in the latter case in order to concentrate the channel energy in the first taps is no-longer necessary. Note finally that the proposed receiver is particularly interesting when the channel exhibits long delay-spreads with high diversity. Low-complexity MMSE turbo-equalization thus appears as an attractive solution for future single-carrier broad-band wireless access systems operating in nonline-of-sight environments.</p></div>
