<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The sensitivity of microwave emission at different frequencies to soil moisture in bare and vegetated soils has been investigated using experimental data. Since the best frequency for the measurement of soil moisture (L-band) is absent in current satellite sensors, it is necessary to seek alternative solutions. An algorithm is proposed for the retrieval of soil moisture based on the sensitivity to moisture of both the brightness temperature and the polarization index at C-band, one that is able to correct for the effect of vegetation by means of the polarization index at X-band. The algorithm has been tested by using experimental data collected with airborne microwave radiometers on agricultural areas and validated by using the data sets of special sensor microwave/imager (SMM/I) and scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR). These research activities are planned in view of coming new satellites: AQUA (NASA) and ADEOS-II (NASDA), which will be launched by the end of 2001. These will have new generation microwave radiometers (AMSR-E and AMSR) onboard, which show much better characteristics with respect to the previous sensors, in particular an enhanced spatial resolution.</p></div>

The possibility of measuring soil moisture on a large scale from satellites, with complete and frequent coverage of the Earth's surface, is, therefore, extremely attractive for hydrometeorological and climatological applications.</p><p>The sensitivity to soil moisture of the brightness temperature measured at low microwave frequencies is a well known phenomenon already investigated by many scientists. Many research activities carried out worldwide in the past have lead to the conclusion that emission at 1.4 GHz (L-band) is definitely related to the moisture of a soil layer, the depth of which depends on soil characteristics and moisture profile [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>]. Further research carried out at the Institute of Research on Electromagnetic Waves (IROE), Florenence, Italy, has pointed out that not only the brightness temperature, but also the polarization difference at L-band is sensitive to soil moisture <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the L-band is not available from current satellite sensors. Thus, research has focused on the potential of existing frequencies for the retrieval of soil moisture. The C-band for instance, is still sensitive to SMC, although it is more influenced by vegetation and surface roughness than is the L-band <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Many efforts, in terms of experimental activities and electromagnetic or semi-empirical models, have been carried out in the past to correct these effects on soil moisture measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In accordance with these considerations and the state of the art of the research, it seems that the moment has arrived to build up a network that is able to measure SMC routinely and operationally, adequately integrating in situ and satellite measurements with inversion algorithms. In order to pursue this goal, a new sensor generation has been planned that is destined to be launched onboard future space platforms. Two new multifrequency microwave radiometers from space are the advanced microwave scanning radiometers AMSR and AMSR-E, which will be launched by the end of 2001 onboard the advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) by NASDA and the U.S. Earth observation system (EOS) PM-1 AQUA satellite by NASA, respectively. These sensors, the frequencies of which range from 6.9 GHz to 89 GHz, show better technical characteristics than those of previous radiometers. In particular, they have a better ground resolution, which is the main handicap for operational measurements of soil moisture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, a multifrequency algorithm capable of retrieving SMC from C-band data and, in the meantime, correct vegetation effects using X-band emission, is described. The algorithm was first tested with the brightness temperature 0196-2892/01$10.00 ©2001 IEEE data sets collected in agricultural regions in Southern France and Italy with IROE airborne or ground-based radiometers. Since many satellites have observation angles higher than 40 , the use of the polarization index (PI) may be an alternative to the brightness temperature, with the advantage that PI is a parameter that is normalized for surface temperature variations. The next step in the research was to test the algorithm on a much wider spatial scale, using sensors with ground resolution on the order of several tens of kilometers. For this purpose, NASDA provided scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) (at 6.6 [C-band] and 10 [X-band] GHz) and SSM/I data (at 19 [Ku-band] and 37 [Ka-band] GHz) collected over several Russian ground stations, together with the corresponding soil moisture values for the first 10-cm soil layer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. IROE Sensors</head><p>The instrument for radio observation of the Earth (IROE) sensor consists of five microwave channels, the L-band (1.4 GHz) can operate at V or H polarization, the C-(6.8 GHz) and X-(10 GHz) bands measure H and V polarization simultaneously, and the highest frequency channels (19 GHz Ku-band and 37 GHz Ka-band) provide the measurement of the first three Stokes parameters. The microwave instruments were self-calibrating digital radiometers with an internal calibrator <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The four higher frequencies of the instrument operated from the ARAT, a French aircraft (Fokker 747) made available within the framework of the European Community Scientific Training and Access in Aircraft for Atmospheric Research Throughout Europe (STAAARTE) Project. L-band measurements were carried out using ultra-light aircrafts. Measurements were performed at two different incidence angles: 20 and 40 /50 for all frequencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. SSM/I and SMMR Microwave Radiometers</head><p>SSM/I is a seven-channel, four-frequency, linearly polarized, conical scanning passive microwave radiometer, onboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) series satellites. The frequencies are 19.35 (V and H polarization), 22.23 (V polarization), 37.0 (V and H polarization), and 85.5 (V and H polarization) GHz, with an incidence angle of 51 and a swath width of 1394 km. The 3 dB footprint size ranges from 15 km to 69 km along-track and 13 km to 43 km cross-track, according to the observation frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>SMMR was an imaging five-frequency radiometer: 6.63 (V and H polarization), 10.69 (V and H polarization), 18.0 (V and H polarization), 21.0 (V polarization), and 37.0 GHz (V and H polarization), flown on the Seasat and Nimbus-7 Earth satellites launched in 1978, and no longer operational <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>The IROE multifrequency radiometric sensors have been operating from aircraft and ground-based platforms since the early 1980s on several test-sites both in Italy and France and were Emission at all these frequencies is much more influenced by vegetation and surface roughness than that at L-band. However, an investigation of the sensitivity to SMC of microwave emission at C-band and higher frequencies is motivated by the lack of L-band channel in the present and midtime available satellite sensors. Up until now, most investigations regarding the measurement of SMC by means of microwave radiometry have been based on single-frequency, single-polarization brightness data. An alternative approach is based on the use of the polarization index measured at different frequencies. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the relationship between the SMC (%) of some agricultural fields and the PI measured at C-band and incident angle . The spread of points indicates to what extent roughness and vegetation affect sensitivity but also a possible discrepancy between the point and average measurements carried out with local and remote sensors, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. By separating experimental points into different groups, according to their leaf area index (LAI) values, three regression lines can be drawn. In this case</p><p>• bare soils (LAI ): SMC ; • low vegetated fields (0 ): SMC ; • vegetated fields (LAI ): SMC . The correlation coefficients and the standard error of estimate of these three regression lines were , , and , respectively. However, it should be noted that only a few data were available for vegetated fields, and consequently, the latter correlation is less significant. In the meantime, a relationship was established between the PI at X-band and the vegetation biomass. By using a model based on the radiative transfer theory, which simulates vegetation as a uniform layer over a soil surface, PI at both X-and Ka-bands was related to the vegetation biomass of some crop types through two plant parameters: plant water content (PWC in kg/m ) and leaf area index (LAI in m m ). The following equations were determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1) (2)</formula><p>where PI from bare soil (assumed to be equal to 50); (incidence direction); wavelength (m); empirical correlation factor between PWC and LAI; factor depending on the crop type and ranging between m for sunflower and m for alfalfa. According to (1) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), PI at X-band tends to saturate for for alfalfa and for corn. On the basis of this sensitivity of PI (X-band) to vegetation biomass, we can assume that, in principle, it is possible to select the correct regression line between PI (C-band) and SMC, according to the value of LAI that is retrieved from the PI (X-band).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. THE ALGORITHM</head><p>On the basis of the results obtained in the previous section, an algorithm for computing SMC from two dual polarized frequency measurements, at C-and X-bands, has been proposed. PI at C-band can be used to retrieve the soil moisture of bare soils, in accordance with the regression lines represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which have the following generic form:</p><p>(3) When the soil is covered by vegetation, the slope of the regression line decreases and the intercept may also change. On the other hand, the PI at higher frequencies and in particular at X-band is more sensitive to the vegetation biomass and can discriminate between several levels of LAI. We can therefore assume that PI at X-band could be related to the slope and intercept of the regression line between PI at C-band and SMC, according to equations of the following type:</p><p>(4) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Substituting these relationships in (3), we can choose more adequate coefficients for the regression line of SMC retrieval, which becomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> This procedure can be summarized in the flow chart of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In our case, since , we assumed an equation between and of the type , where depends on according to the following experimental relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (7) A comparison of SMC retrieved from radiometric measurements by using ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), with SMC measured on the ground, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, which refers to experimental data collected in the agricultural area of Les Alpilles in Southern France using the airborne IROE sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The resulting correlation coefficient is , and the standard error of estimate is .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SATELLITE DATA</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. SMMR Russian Data Set</head><p>In order to verify the applicability of this algorithm to a larger spatial scale, we used C-and X-band satellite data from SMMR. NASDA kindly provided us with a data set of SMMR collected over 79 Russian agro-meteorological stations during a period of about three years (from October 1978 to December 1981), together with the corresponding ground-measured values of gravimetric SMC. The latter data, archived by Dr. K. Masuda and Dr. V. Savelin, represented the average value of the first 10-cm layer: they were obtained, with a time interval of ten days, from April to October. Five SMMR data were picked up within an area around the target station.</p><p>Temporal trends of and PI at C-band, which were retrieved for a preliminary analysis and are represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, show a good agreement with the temporal trend of SMC. First of all, a selection between the stations was carried out according to the number of data available, the temporal coverage (i.e., sites with very few data or data concentrated only in a few months have been disregarded), and the canopy cover. In this case, only stations characterized by herbaceous agricultural crops have been considered. After this preliminary choice between the sites, and PI were directly related to SMC values. It has been ob-Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. SMC % estimated with the algorithm of ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) as a function of SMC % of the first 5-cm layer measured on ground. The line represents the 1:1 line. Symbols refer to different crop types:</p><p>= alfalfa, = bare soil, x = sunflower, and = wheat. served that, in general, both parameters show a fairly good correlation with the soil moisture, although the presence of vegetation strongly affects their sensitivity. Experimental data corresponding to different sites can be separated into groups which are evidently characterized by different types and amounts of vegetation. In the diagram of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, the correlation between in (a) H polarization and (b) PI with the SMC of a few sites is shown as an example of the different regression line slopes that can be obtained over the whole area. Each site is identified with a specific symbol and a regression line.</p><p>Relationship between PI at C-band and SMC.</p><p>The relation between the PI (X-band) and the slope of the equation was represented by the following regression line, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> From experimental data, results . The final equation for the retrieval of SMC therefore becomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> By using this equation, the retrieval of SMC was poor, showing a very low correlation between estimated and measured SMC . There are two main problems affecting the results of the algorithm: the very coarse ground resolution of SMMR at the lowest frequency (of the order of 100-150 km) on the one hand, and the uncertainty in polarization channels balance calibration on the other. Indeed, although PI has the advantage of being a parameter that is normalized for the temperature effects, in this case, the calibration error between the two polarization channels may strongly affect the results of the algorithm. It has thus been preferred to modify the algorithm by substituting in H-polarization at C-band to PI at the same frequency.</p><p>Relationship between at C-band and SMC. Also in this case, the slope and the intercept of the regression line were related to the corresponding values of PI at X-band . In this case, we found that <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> The results of this algorithm, which was tested at several agrometeorological stations, is shown in the following diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), where SMC measured on the ground was compared with SMC computed from SMMR data with the algorithm.</p><p>Although the dispersion of experimental data is still rather high, Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. SMC % estimated from SMMR data of (T ) at C-band using ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) versus SMC % measured on ground. Different symbols refer to different Russian stations.</p><p>we see that, at least for some ground stations, the algorithm is able to retrieve reasonable data of SMC with on the order of 0.70 and SE ranging between three and nine. Also in this case, the main problem of this validation lies in the considerable coarse ground resolution of the SMMR at C-band. The retrieval of SMC can work only in the case of highly homogeneous areas, for which the SMC values measured at the agrometeorological station can be assumed to be representative of the entire surrounding zone. In order to understand why the algorithm works better for some stations than for others, an analysis of the landscape surrounding the stations was carried out by means of the NDVI, obtained from the AVHRR, 1 km, 10 days, composite data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. From an analysis of the NDVI histograms, two types of surface can be basically identified (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>):</p><p>1) low vegetated areas, corresponding to an average NDVI ; 2) heavy vegetated terrains, corresponding to an average NDVI . The ground stations can therefore be separated on the basis of their NDVI histograms. In general, we observed that the ground stations that showed the best performances with the algorithm such as the one represented by in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> were characterized by histograms with peak values .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. SSM/I Russian Data Set</head><p>The same algorithm, although modified, was tested on data collected by a more recent satellite sensor SMM/I, which shows a better ground resolution with respect to SMMR and better polarization channel intercalibration. In this case, however, the available frequencies were not the most suitable ones for the retrieval of soil moisture, the lowest frequency being 19 GHz (Ku band) and, therefore, even more affected than C-band by vegetation cover. Ninety-five areas, corresponding to the same number of Russian meteorological stations, were selected for this data set. Five SSM/I data were selected within each area around the station, as for SMMR. SSM/I data were saved in a time sequence from January 1992 to December 1995. Temporal trends of and PI at Ku-and Ka-bands (19 and 37 GHz, respectively) were analyzed together with the trends of SMC measured in the first 10-cm soil layer. The annual variations of SMC, which showed a maximum in the spring (April) and/or fall (October) and a minimum in summer (June-July) were fairly well followed by the variations in PI at both Kuand Ka-bands. This is quite reasonable, since in autumn and spring there is a minimum of vegetation cover over wet soils and this causes very high PI values. On the contrary, summer is characterized by dry soils with well developed vegetation, and this situation corresponds to very low PI values. Since the effect of vegetation is predominant at these frequencies, it was noted that, when rainfalls occur during the summer, PI at both Ku-and Ka-bands is unable to identify the increase in soil moisture because emission from the soil is masked by thick vegetation.</p><p>Retrieval of SMC A direct correlation between SMC and PI at Ku-bands is shown in the diagram of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, where the symbols identify data from different ground stations. As expected, also in this case, a unique correlation between PI and SMC does not exist, and the points appear very dispersed. However, although little information is available concerning the landscape close to the stations (i.e., the presence of forests, agricultural fields, rangelands, etc.), the very high PI values found at some ground stations should be due to the presence of very smooth bare fields or water bodies (lakes, ponds, marshes), whereas lower values of PI, for similar values of SMC, can be attributed to the presence of rougher and/or vegetated soils. We can therefore assume that the correlation lines, corresponding to three different clusters of points, are functions of the amount of biomass:</p><p>• SMC (bare soils); • SMC (slightly vegetated soils); • SMC (vegetated soils).  In order to retrieve the SMC with a reasonable accuracy, the correct regression line should be selected. In this case, this choice can be obtained by using the sensitivity of PI at Ka-band to vegetation biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, three ranges of corresponding to different vegetation covers (bare soils, slightly and well vegetated surfaces) were identified and assigned to the three correlation lines between and SMC. Basically, the information concerning the amount of vegetation was retrieved from the Ka-band and the estimated value of SMC from Ku-band.</p><p>By using this statistical algorithm, the diagram of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref> was obtained, where the SMC computed is compared to the groundmeasured SMC. In spite of some dispersion in data, we can see that the algorithm is quite able to simulate the correct value of SMC with a correlation coefficient and a standard error of estimate , provided that the data have been previously separated into classes of vegetation cover according to the PI values at Ka-band.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The work carried out pointed out that the PI of microwave emission measured at C-band (6.8 GHz) seems able to estimate SMC in different conditions of roughness and vegetation biomass, provided that a correction for the vegetation effect is introduced. An algorithm has been tailored for correcting these effects by using the sensitivity of PI at X-band (10 GHz) to vegetation biomass (LAI). The algorithm was tested with SMMR data collected on Russian test areas. Major problems were due to the coarse ground resolution of the C-band channel of SMMR and to the poor calibration accuracy between the two polarization channels. In order to avoid intercalibration problems, the algorithm was modified using the brightness temperature in H polarization at C-band, instead of the PI at the same frequency. A selection of test sites made according to the homogeneity of the area and the thickness of the vegetation cover was carried out using the NDVI histograms of the different regions. The areas selected with NDVI average values were in fact the ones for which the algorithm worked better. The analysis of SSM/I data on the same regions has shown that, although the available frequencies are not the most suitable ones for estimating SMC, the PI at Ku-band (19 GHz) can be correlated to SMC, provided that the correction for vegetation effect is carried out by using the PI at the higher frequency (Ka-band, 37 GHz). Thus, the SMC was retrieved with satisfactory accuracy by using the PI both at 19 and 37 GHz.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
