<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, the problem of generalized state estimation for an array of Markovian coupled networks under the round-Robin protocol (RRP) and redundant channels is investigated by using an extended dissipative property. The randomly varying coupling of the networks under consideration is governed by a Markov chain. With the aid of using the RRP, the transmission order of nodes is availably orchestrated. In this case, the probability of occurrence data collisions through a shared constrained network may be reduced. The redundant channels are also used in the signal transmission to deal with the frangibility of networks caused by a single channel in the networks. The network induced phenomena, that is, randomly occurring packet dropouts and randomly occurring quantization are fully considered. The main purpose of the research is to find a desired estimator design approach such that the extended ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) -γ -stochastic dissipativity property of the estimation error system is guaranteed. In terms of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii methodology, the Kronecker product and an improved matrix decoupling approach, sufficient conditions for such an addressed problem are established by means of handling some convex optimization problems. Finally, the serviceability of the proposed method is explained by providing an illustrated example.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>C OMPLEX coupled networks (CCNs), which can be described by a series of nodes and appropriately coupled matrices, have been successfully applied in many practical fields, including smart power grids, mobile manipulators, social interactions, metabolic networks, biological neural networks, and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Hence, an enormous amount of research has been emphatically contributed to the discussions on CCNs during the last decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In these works, the coupling connection topology (CCT) of CCNs is invariant. However, as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, under some undesirable networked environments, compared with such a constant CCT, the time-varying CCT is more realistic relying on the fact that the implemented CCT in practice often varies according to the different situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Sometimes, the changes of CCT for CCNs are randomly occurring and obey the Markov process. In this regard, such CCNs are referred to as the Markovian coupled networks (MCNs). Recently, more and more research attentions have been concentrated on the dynamic analysis problems for MCNs, including, but are not limited to, synchronization, stability and stabilization, target control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and the references therein.</p><p>In another research direction, state estimation serves as a significant role in the research of CCNs, and one of the main purposes of which is to accurately obtain state information of CCNs limited by prescribed property requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. As a result, the past few decades have seen a great amount of interests on this fundamental research issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It is generally acceptable that the objective of such an issue is to construct an estimator with compatible structure, where the network system state is estimated based on the available measurements. Up to now, considerable achievements concerning multiple state estimation problems for CCNs have been studied in the outstanding literature. For instance, the recursive state estimation issue through a variance-constrained method has been introduced for time-varying CCNs with missing measurements which are modeled by a group of stochastic variables according with the prescribed probabilistic distributions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Recently, due to increasing research interests in the resulting error system satisfying certain performance index, a battery of worth mentioning and crucial state estimation methods have been proposed, for instance, dissipative state estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, passive state estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, H ∞ state estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, l 2l ∞ state estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>2168-2267 c 2018 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.</p><p>See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.</p><p>Along with networked systems have developed rapidly, the complexity of tasks generated by networked systems to be accomplished is increasing, and the number of data from the networks inclines to be enormous. These phenomena have brought a large number of burden to the networks of communication capacity constraint, which could give rise to some network-induced problems, in particular data collisions and disorder. Therefore, how to prevent and maintain signal transmissions from these network-induced phenomena is an interesting question. In this regard, signal communication naturally becomes a critical element in the study of networked systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The common point of these studies is to utilize an effective approach which schedules the signal transmissions in the light of certain network protocol. In view of this, the round-Robin protocol (RRP) may be a good candidate. RRP is one of the most well-known periodic mechanisms which has been widely applied to network communication and allocation of server resources. For example, the problem of distributed state estimation subject to finite-time boundedness, RRP and fading channels has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, in which RRP was taken into account to overcome the limited bandwidth of networks, and channels fading is modeled by a set of multiplicative noises. Zou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have concerned the state estimation issue for CCNs subject to time-varying delays and disturbances under the RRP, which was utilized to coordinate the nodes transmission order.</p><p>As a fundamental problem in applications over CCNs, the issues of reliability for data transmission have been recurrently investigated in literatures over the last few decades. Since one channel is modeled by fluctuating performance that is affected by sudden environmental changes or unavoidable system failures. Therefore, the redundant channel communication scheme has potential advantages in the improvement of communication reliability in modern industry, and it has been applied in networked control and state estimation problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Under redundant channel communication scheme, it is preferable to overcome the fragility of communication networks commonly configured by a single channel. In this case, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the distributed H ∞ filtering issue for T-S fuzzy systems has been considered, where the time-varying delays have been studied and the sensor nodes have been added with redundant channels.</p><p>In response to the above considerations, our focuses are devoted to the extended dissipative estimation issue for MCNs under the RRP and redundant channels by designing a desired type of estimator in this paper. The main advantages of this paper are four aspects as follows.</p><p>1) Directed at a class of MCNs, we investigate the extended dissipative estimation, which could be used to cope with many estimation issues including standard dissipative estimation, l 2l ∞ estimation, H ∞ estimation, and passive estimation. Consequently, a more general issue is taken into account. 2) A Markov chain is used to show the randomly varying coupled condition which is affected by external disturbances.</p><p>3) The transmission order of nodes is availably orchestrated with the aid of the commendable use of the RRP. In this case, at each time instant, only one node is allowed to transmit data through a shared constrained network. 4) The redundant channels are used in the signal transmission to deal with the frangibility of communication networks caused by a single channel in the networks. This paper is organized as follows. The dynamic of coupled networks and networked constrained measurements are described in Section II. The study of the analysis and design of extended dissipative state estimator for the considered MCNs is carried out in Section III. A trustworthy example is given to validate the serviceability of our given approach in Section IV. This paper is finally concluded in Section V.</p><p>Notation: The notation employed in this paper is standard. The a-dimensional Euclidean space is denoted as R a .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Dynamic of Coupled Networks</head><p>Let us pay close attention to the following dynamical network represented by a stochastic discrete-time MCNs composing of N coupled nodes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ x i (k + 1) = f (x i (k)) + N j=1 ijσ (k) σ (k) x j (k) + E i υ(k) z i (k) = L i x i (k) (1)</formula><p>for i ∈ N {1, 2, . . . , N}, where x i (k) ∈ R n stands for the state vector of the ith node. The output vector to be estimated for the ith node is described as z i (k) ∈ R m . υ(k) ∈ R p denotes the exogenous disturbance that belongs to l 2 [0, ∞). E i and L i are real constant appropriate dimensional system matrices. The nonlinear vector-valued function f (•) satisfies the sectorbounded condition in the following form <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f (τ 1 ) -f (τ 2 ) -1 (τ 1 -τ 2 ) T × f (τ 1 ) -f (τ 2 ) -2 (τ 1 -τ 2 ) ≤ 0 ( 2 )</formula><p>where f (0) = 0, ∀τ 1 , τ 2 ∈ R n , 1 and 2 are constant real appropriate dimensional matrices.

Since the structure of coupled networks is modeled by coupling matrices, in order to accurately investigate CCNs, it is incontrovertible that the randomly varying coupling becomes a significative research direction. In this paper, a Markov stochastic process has been applied to describe the outer-coupling and inner-coupling matrices which can stochastically shift or jump from one mode to another during different time intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Networked Constrained Measurements</head><p>Throughout this paper, the measurement output y i (k) of the MCNs (1) received from the plant through two different channels which are chosen in a random way and both are quantized, is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y i (k) = α i (k)(C i Q 1 (x i (k)) + D i υ(k)) + (1 -α i (k)) × β i (k)(F i Q 2 (x i (k)) + G i υ(k))<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where y i (k) ∈ R q is the measured output. The matrices C i , D i , F i , and G i are real constant appropriate dimensional matrices.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q 1 (•) and Q 2 (•) represent the quantization effects, the following logarithmic quantizer Q h (•), h ∈ {1, 2}, is considered [24]: Q h (x i (k)) = q h1 (x i1 (k)) • • • q hn (x in (k)) T .</formula><p>For each q hl (x il (k)), l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, we obtain the following set of quantization levels:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">U hl = ±ū (n) hl , ū(n) hl = μ (n) hl ū(0) hl , n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . ∪ {0}</formula><p>where 0 &lt; μ hl &lt; 1 is used to describe the quantization density and ū(0) hl &gt; 0 stands for a segment of the input of quantizer so as to that the whole segment is mapped to such a quantization level by the quantizer. The notation q hl (•) for the logarithmic quantizer is represented in the following form: where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">q hl (x il (k)) ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ ū(n) hl , 1 1+ζ hl ū(n) hl &lt; x il (k) ≤ 1 1-ζ hl ū(n) hl 0, x il (k) = 0 q hl (-x il (k)), x il (k) &lt; 0 (4)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">ζ hl = (1 -μ hl )/(1 + μ hl ).</formula><p>Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, using the sector bound approach, the quantization problem can be transformed into the robust problem without conservatism. Then, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q h (x i (k)) = (I + hi (k))x i (k), h ∈ {1, 2}<label>(5)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">| hi (k)| ≤ ζ hl for each l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}.</formula><p>Two Bernoulli distributed white sequences α i (k) and β i (k) are mutually independent and take values 0 or 1, which are used to model both randomly occurring packet dropouts and quantization in two channels, respectively. Particularly, they are explicitly stated by the probability distribution laws in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Pr{α i (k) = 1} = E{α i (k)} = ᾱi Pr{β i (k) = 1} = E{β i (k)} = βi<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the scalars ᾱi ∈ [0, 1] and βi ∈ [0, 1] are known.</p><p>Clearly, for the Bernoulli distributed white sequences α i (k) and β i (k), one has</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">E{α i (k) -ᾱi } = 0, E |α i (k) -ᾱi | 2 = ᾱi (1 -ᾱi ) E β i (k) -βi = 0, E |β i (k) -βi | 2 = βi 1 -βi .</formula><p>Remark 2: As we all know, the signal transmission of single channel may be intermittently interrupted due to its fragility and poor anti-interference capacity, which inevitably increases the packet dropout rate of the communication network. Hence, one redundant channel is used to the communication network to lower the possibility of packet dropouts caused by single channel in this paper. So far, few research efforts have been devoted to the issue for MCNs that both of two channels have signal quantization before transmission and the quantization densities of two channels are different.</p><p>Remark 3: It is to be observed that the measurement output y i (k) described in (3) provides a more general type to investigate the phenomena of quantization and randomly occurring packet dropouts in two channels. In particular, if</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">α i (k) = 0, β i (k) = 1, or α i (k) = 1,</formula><p>only a channel with quantization transmits its information. In the two cases mentioned above, the packet dropouts are not occurred, it is worth noting that as a special case of α i (k) = 0 and β i (k) = 0, two channels are both useless, and the packet dropouts occur.</p><p>In this paper, because of the capacity of communication channel constraints, which can be conjectured that only one node is scheduled to send data via the communication channel at each transmission constant so as to avoid data collisions. Under the circumstances, the RRP can be effectively employed to determine which node gets access to the network in a prescribed transmission moment. It should be worth noting that the RRP is a static one, which transmits the packets in a fixed order.</p><p>For the sake of problem formulation, the first transmission instant of the ith node is assumed to be i, one could consider that a round has been finished as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> when the entire nodes are got the access one after another in a circle. Then, the signal transmissions of measurement outputs subject to the RRP can be described by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, in which y i (k), (i ∈ N) means that the ith node's measurement output gets access to the network at time k, let ȳ</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(k) = [ ȳT 1 (k) • • • ȳT N (k)</formula><p>] T , and ι(k) = mod(k-1, N)+1 means that ι(k)th node obtains access to the communication network.</p><p>Remark 4: In the communication fields, the RRP is always adopted to cut down the network burden and lower the risk of data collisions for its simple structure. Under the RRP, all nodes are transmitted in a particular sequence, and only one node has the authority to send measurement information to the constructed estimator at different transmission instants. Meanwhile, the access permissions will be turned over to the first node after the accomplishment for communication link of last node, we say that a cycle has been completed later.</p></div>

The outer-coupling matrices have two cases as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_54">W 1 = ⎡ ⎣ -0.6 0.6 0 0.6 -1.1 0.5 0 0.5 -0.5 ⎤ ⎦ W 2 = ⎡ ⎣ -0.6<label>0</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_55">L 1 = 0.2 0.2 , L 2 = 0.2 0.4 L 3 = 0.2 0.5 .</formula><p>Due to the fact that the l 2 -l ∞ state estimation, standard dissipative state estimation, H ∞ state estimation, and passive state estimation issues are a special form of the extended dissipative state estimation issue, we will subsequently focus on two cases in order to verify such a point as follows.</p><p>Case 1: l 2 -l ∞ state estimation problem. Under the circumstances, ρ = 1, we designate quantization densities μ 1l = 0.1, μ 2l = 0.8, l ∈ {1, 2}, and set β1 = β2 = β3 = β, ᾱ1 = ᾱ2 = ᾱ3 = ᾱ, 3 = diag{γ 2 , γ 2 , γ 2 }, 4 = diag{1, 1, 1}. In order to ensure that two channels only have the difference of quantization density, other parameters of the measurement output in (3) are taken as </p><formula xml:id="formula_56">C 1 = F 1 = 0.5 -0.4</formula><formula xml:id="formula_57">C 2 = F 2 = 0.3 0.2 C 3 = F 3 = 0.4 -0.5 D 1 = G 1 = 0.9 0.8 0.6 D 2 = G 2 = 0.7 0.9 0.8 D 3 = G 3 = 0.6 0.8 0.7 .</formula><p>Our aim is to straighten out the impact of ᾱ and β on the l 2l ∞ performance of MCNs for (1) measured by γ min in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we can find two change principles. One is that under ᾱ = 0, it is easy to know that the better optimal l 2l ∞ performance index γ min decreases through increasing value of β, it means that the probability of randomly occurring packet dropouts is smaller, the better performance of the system can be obtained. Meanwhile, the other is that the value of γ min at ᾱ = 1 is worse than ᾱ = 0 and β = 1, which implies that quantization densities μ hl have great influences on the l 2l ∞ performance index γ min of the system.</p><p>Case 2: ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) -γ -dissipative state estimation problem. In this case, ρ = 0, we suppose the quantization densities μ 1l = 0.2, μ 2l = 0.7, l ∈ {1, 2}, and let 2 = diag{1, 1, 1}, 1 = -diag{1, 1, 1}, 3 = diag{2, 2, 2}. Other parameters of the measurement output in (3) are chosen as C 1 = 0.5 -0.4 , C 2 = 0.3 0.2 C 3 = 0.4 -0.5 , D 1 = 0.9 0.8 0.6 D 2 = 0.7 0.9 0.8 , D 3 = 0.6 0.8 0.7 F 1 = 0.6 0.4 , F 2 = 0.5 0.3 F 3 = 0.6 0.5 , G 1 = 0.8 0.6 0.9 G 2 = 0.7 0.8 0.6 , G 3 = 0.9 0.7 0.6 .</p><p>And the Bernoulli-distributed white noise sequences α i (k)(i = 1, 2, 3) and β i (k) are assumed to satisfy the condition (6) with ᾱ1 = 0.26, ᾱ2 = 0.47, ᾱ3 = 0.76 β1 = 0.48, β2 = 0.27, β3 = 0.82.  Under the above obtained estimator gains, the stochastic variable α i (k) is randomly given, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the state trajectories of zi (k) subject to a possible mode evolution are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, where x 1 (0) = [ 0.1 -0.15 ] T , x 2 (0) = [ 0.17 0.1 ] T , x 3 (0) = [ 0.1 -0.2 ] T . The simulation has verified that our theoretical analysis is indeed effective for the addressed extended dissipative state estimation for MCNs subject to the RRP and redundant channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The problem of the extended dissipative estimation for a class of MCNs under the RRP and redundant channels has been investigated in this paper. A novel and more general performance index has been introduced. Based on this, we can conveniently solve l 2l ∞ state estimation, standard dissipative state estimation, passive state estimation, and H ∞ state estimation by changing some parameters. Meanwhile, we have utilized some uncorrelated Bernoulli distributed white sequences to describe both of the quantization and packet dropouts occurred stochastically. By employing a commendable matrix decoupling approach and choosing an advisable Lyapunov function, the solvability of the issue under consideration has been ensured by establishing some available sufficient conditions. A demonstrated example has finally been supplied to the advantages and serviceability of the developed method. It is desired that our method could be employed to deal with the study of the social networks in the statistical physics framework, which will be one of our future research directions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>ijσ (k) = 0 if the node r i can receive the data from node r j and N j=1 ijσ (k) = 0, ∀i ∈ N, σ (k) ∈ M.
