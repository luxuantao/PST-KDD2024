<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We consider the downlink of a wireless system where the base-station has M ≥ 1 antennas and K user terminals have one antenna each. We study the weighted rate sum maximization in the case of non-perfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). Some relevant downlink optimization problems, such as the stabilization of the transmission queues under random packet arrivals and the proportional fair scheduling for infinite backlogged systems, can be solved as special cases of the proposed problem. We restrict the transmitter strategy to be based on Gaussian coding and beamforming. Even under this simplifying condition, the problem at hand is non-convex and it does not appear to lend itself to a simple algorithmic solution. Therefore, we introduce some approximations that yield a definition of signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) commonly used in the classical arrayprocessing/beamforming literature. For the simpler (but still nonconvex) approximated problem, we propose a powerful heuristic solution based on greedy user selection and a gradient iteration that converges to a local maximum of the objective function. This method yields very competitive results with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive simulations show that, in the case of perfect CSIT, the proposed heuristic scheme performs very closely to the optimal (dirty-paper coding) strategy while, in the case of non-perfect CSIT, it significantly outperforms previously proposed suboptimal approaches, such as random beamforming and approximated zero-forcing with greedy user selection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Coarsely speaking, we can identify two "applicationmotivated" settings: 1) systems with random arrivals and transmission queues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>; 2) systems with infinite backlog <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In the following we provide an informal discussion of data-oriented downlink schemes in order to motivate the work presented in this paper.</p><p>We assume a wireless downlink channel with K singleantenna receivers (users) and one transmitter (base station) equipped with M ≥ 1 antennas. The complex baseband model is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y k (t) = h H k (t)X(t) + n k (t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where k = 1, . . . , K denotes the user index, time is slotted with a slot duration of T channel uses and the time index t ticks at the slot time, y k (t) ∈ C 1×T is the signal received by user k in slot t, n k (t) ∈ C 1×T is the corresponding Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), with i.i.d. components ∼ CN (0, 1), X(t) ∈ C M×T is the transmitted signal space-time array, subject to the input power constraint 1 T tr(X(t) H X(t)) ≤ P <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and H(t) = [h 1 (t), . . . , h K (t)] ∈ C M×K denotes the matrix of fading channel coefficients. We adopt an ergodic blockfading model where H(t) is constant on each slot and changes from slot to slot according to some stationary and ergodic process. Furthermore, we assume that T is large enough such that very powerful capacity-approaching codes can be assumed.</p><p>At each slot t, some downlink resource allocation policy serves the users with rates {R k (t) ≥ 0 : k = 1, . . . , K} (bit/channel use). We say that a user is scheduled (or "served") at slot t if R k (t) &gt; 0. We also assume that the users are aware of the rate allocation choice (e.g., via some control channel that is not taken into account here). For the time being, assume that these rates are allocated according to some Channel State Information available at the Transmitter (CSIT), and that when rate R k (t) is allocated to user k, then this user successfully receives a packet of T R k (t) information bits.</p><p>In the first setting above (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the main problem consists of achieving the stability of the transmission queues: the main goal of the downlink resource allocation policy is to stabilize the transmit queues such that they all have a finite average buffer size <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Notice that, by Little's theorem, finite average size implies finite average delay, that is clearly a very desirable property in a system with random arrivals. For the second setting above (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the notion of stability is irrelevant since all data are already present at the transmitter (infinite backlog). However, for self-evident reasons, the channel must be fairly shared among the users. Hence, the main goal of the downlink resource allocation policy is to maximize the average throughput subject to some fairness criterion.</p><p>In very general terms, a downlink resource allocation policy is defined by a signaling scheme S and a rate scheduling algorithm A. The signaling scheme defines the type of coding that can be used (this includes, for example, orthogonal signaling, superposition coding, spatial beamforming, other forms of spatial precoding, etc..). The rate scheduling algorithm chooses at each slot t a rate K-tuple R(t) = {R k (t)} as a function of CSIT and some user priority parameters (weights) that will be specified later. Therefore, it determines the users that are scheduled in that slot. Let R S (t) denote the region of rates that can be reliably transmitted over slot t (notice: this depends on S and on the channel conditions at slot t). The scheduled rate vector R(t) must belong to R S (t), otherwise, the condition of vanishing error probability would not be satisfied for some users. A scheduling algorithm A that satisfies R(t) ∈ R S (t) for all t, is said to be feasible for the signaling scheme S. The set of all feasible scheduling algorithms shall be denoted by F S .</p><p>We define the region Ω S of achievable ergodic rates (also referred to as "long-term average throughput region") for a given signaling scheme S as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ω S = A∈FS R ∈ R K + : R k ≤ lim inf τ →∞ 1 τ τ t=1 R k (t), ∀ k (3)</formula><p>Notice that Ω S is convex, since for any two scheduling algorithms A 1 and A 2 in F S and for all β ∈ [0, 1] the time-sharing scheduling A that operates according to A 1 with probability β and according to A 2 with probability 1β is also feasible.</p><p>If queue stability is the goal, it can be shown that for a certain class of problems where the arrival processes and the channel states are jointly stationary and ergodic (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) the set of arrival rates (expressed in bit per channel use) for which the system can be stabilized coincides with Ω S . Furthermore, letting {Q k (t)} denote the users' queue lengths (expressed in bits) and {θ k } denote a set of positive weights, the rate scheduling algorithm A that for each t solves the maximization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">max K k=1 θ k Q k (t)R k (t), subject to R(t) ∈ R S (t) (4)</formula><p>achieves stability for any arrival rate K-tuple λ ∈ Ω S , even without the explicit knowledge of λ (i.e., it achieves stability in an "adaptive" way). The queue lengths evolve according to the stochastic difference equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Q k (t + 1) = max{Q k (t) -T R k (t), 0} + A k (t)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where A k (t) denotes the arrival process (number of bits arrived at the k-th queue at the beginning of slot t).</p><p>If maximum throughput subject to fairness is the goal, solutions differ according to the definition of fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. A popular criterion is proportional fairness, implemented in the 1xEV-DO system, the data-oriented downlink scheme of CDMA2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A Proportional Fair Scheduling (PFS) algorithm maximizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Equivalently, denoting by R and R the ergodic rates achieved by PFS and by any arbitrary A ∈ F S , the inequality</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">K k=1 log R k subject to R ∈ Ω S</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">K k=1 R k R k ≤ K (6)</formula><p>holds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The rate scheduling algorithm that allocates at each t the rate solution of the maximization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">max K k=1 R k (t) R k , subject to R(t) ∈ R S (t)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>is a PFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In practice, since R is generally unknown, a causal version of the above algorithm is obtained by replacing R with the empirical time-averaged rates { R k (t)} defined by the stochastic difference equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R k (t + 1) = (1 -1/t c ) R k (t) + (1/t c )R k (t).<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The parameter t c governs the time interval over which fairness is imposed (see discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>).</p><p>From the above discussion it follows that, for both the stability and the proportional fairness problems, the desired rate scheduling algorithm is the result of a weighted rate maximization problem of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">max K k=1 w k (t)R k (t), subject to R(t) ∈ R S (t) (9)</formula><p>for some non-negative time-varying weights {w k (t)} that are recursively computed.</p><p>Most previous work has been focused on the ideal case of perfect CSIT. In the case of a single antenna at the transmitter, the underlying information theoretic model is the classical degraded Gaussian broadcast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the optimal signaling scheme S is known to be Gaussian superposition coding and R S (t) coincides with the capacity region of the Gaussian broadcast channel with channel coefficients h 1 (t), . . . , h K (t). Downlink schemes are driven by the theoretical results on the ergodic capacity region of the fading broadcast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. When the transmitter is equipped with M &gt; 1 antennas, the underlying information theoretic model is the MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>). In this case the optimal signaling scheme S is given by a combination of beamforming (i.e., linear precoding), Gaussian coding and an interference pre-cancellation strategy at the transmitter known as "Dirty-Paper Coding" (DPC). The maximization of the weighted sum rate under the optimal signaling scheme was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>When CSIT is non-perfect, the problem becomes much more complicated and the exact solution of (9) for a general CSIT model is yet unknown. There are at least two main theoretical hurdles that make the sought solution hard: 1) for a general CSIT model the optimal signaling scheme S is not known; 2) even if we fix the signaling scheme S, the corresponding region R S (t) might be non-convex. Therefore, the maximization in (9) yields a non-convex problem, for which we have no simple algorithmic solution.</p><p>The above difficulties call for some good and computationally simple heuristic solution. Several such solutions have been proposed. For example, the schemes based on random beamforming and SNR feedback, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> may be regarded as heuristics to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Other popular heuristics are based on some form of approximated zero-forcing beamforming computed with respect to the information provided by the CSIT (e.g., using quantized channel feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, or some more general CSIT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>). These heuristics are essentially based on the following approach: first, fix the signaling scheme S in some sensible way and then, solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> in order to determine the corresponding rate scheduling algorithm A. This paper is no exception. We propose a new algorithm that can be applied when the channel second-order statistics (covariance) conditioned on the CSIT is known. Our method, albeit not optimal, has some nice features. In particular, it achieves results close to optimal DPC when CSIT is perfect, and significantly outperforms previously proposed methods when CSIT is non-perfect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SIMPLIFICATIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS</head><p>We denote by α(t) the CSIT available to the transmitter at time t. We assume that the channel state process {H(t)} and the CSIT process {α(t)} are jointly stationary and ergodic. Furthermore, we restrict the transmitter to use instantaneous scheduling policies that allocate the rates R(t) based on α(t), i.e., by disregarding the observation of the past CSIT values α(1), . . . , α(t-1). This restriction is motivated by the current proposals for practical CSIT schemes. These can be roughly grouped into the following families: 1) quantized channel feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, where α(t) is a quantized version of the channel matrix H(td) and d is the feedback loop delay (in slots) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , 2) analog feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, where α(t) is a noisy version of H(t). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>In this work we fix the signaling scheme S to be Gaussian superposition coding. Furthermore, we assume that the receivers do not perform multiuser decoding (e.g., interference cancellation), that is, each user k treats the interference from signals destined to other users j = k as noise. Given the current value of CSIT α (where hereafter we drop the slot index t due to stationarity), the transmitted space-time signal is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">X(α) = K k=1 X k (α)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where the codewords X k (α) ∈ C M×T are conditionally mutually independent given α and, for each k, the columns of X k (α) are i.i.d., ∼ CN (0, S k (α)). For later use, we introduce the matrix-valued function S(α) = {S k (α) : k = 1, . . . , K} that maps the CSIT α into the transmit signal covariance matrices.</p><p>For given α, H and covariance matrices S(α), the rate scheduling algorithm A must choose the user rates R based on α. Notice that H is known to the transmitter only statistically, through its conditional first-order probability distribution p(H|α), assumed to be known. The signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) seen at receiver k is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">SINR k (H, S(α)) = h H k S k (α)h k 1 + j =k h H k S j (α)h k (11)</formula><p>Following the same argument as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), it can be shown that the non-perfect CSIT case can be reduced to an equivalent "virtual" perfect CSIT case where α plays the role of the new channel state and the instantaneous user rates are replaced by the average "outage" rates</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R k = max r≥0 r (1 -Pr (log(1 + SINR k (H, S(α))) ≤ r|α)) (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>This approach is taken, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for a class of simple signaling strategies and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for the Gaussian superposition coding strategy considered here. However, in the latter case the outage rate maximization in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">12</ref>) is complicated and requires heavy numerical computation.</p><p>On the other hand, practical systems such as 1xEV-DO <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> make use of fast incremental redundancy coding, in order to cope with the residual uncertainty of H given α: when a user is scheduled to transmit in a slot with given nominal rate (allocated based on α), the effective coding rate is adapted such that, eventually, it is slightly less than log(1+SINR k (H, S(α))), even though the latter is not known. This can be done by sending parity symbols until the receiver sends an "ACK" back to the transmitter, via an uplink control channel.</p><p>Somehow optimistically, in this work we "postulate" the existence of an ideal rate adaptation scheme of this kind, and assume that the rates log(1+SINR k (H, S(α))) are achievable. This corresponds to considering the new objective function</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">K k=1 w k E [log (1 + SINR k (H, S(α))) |α] (13)</formula><p>for the sake of weighted rate sum maximization. This assumption provides an upperbound to the outage rate case <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, since it is easy to see that for any α</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">max r≥0 r (1 -Pr (log(1 + SINR k (H, S(α))) ≤ r|α)) (14) ≤ E [log(1 + SINR k (H, S(α)))|α]</formula><p>Under the above simplifications, finding the optimal scheduling algorithm A is reduced to the maximization of ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) with respect to S(α), subject to the transmitted power constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, that yields the sum trace constraint</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">K k=1 tr(S k (α)) ≤ P, S k (α) ≥ 0 ∀ k, ∀ α (15)</formula><p>Unfortunately, a simple solution to this problem seems to be unavailable. In order to obtain a tractable problem, we shall introduce further restrictions and approximations. In particular, we replace the average user rates in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> with the approximated rates given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E log 1 + h H k S k (α)h k 1 + j =k h H k S j (α)h k α (16) ≈ log 1 + E[h H k S k (α)h k |α] 1 + j =k E[h H k S j (α)h k |α] = log 1 + tr(Σ k (α)S k (α)) 1 + j =k tr(Σ k (α)S j (α))</formula><p>where we define the channel conditional covariance matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Σ k (α) = E[h k h H k |α].</formula><p>Since we applied Jensen's inequality to both the numerator and the denominator of the SINR, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> yields just an approximation of the conditional expected rates. Furthermore, we shall restrict the signaling scheme to the class of "beamforming" Gaussian superposition coding, that is, the covariance matrices S k (α) are constrained to have rank at most 1. In particular, the transmitted signal is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">X(α) = G(α)U (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where G(α) = [g 1 (α), . . . , g K (α)] ∈ C M×K is the beamforming matrix and U ∈ C K×T is a Gaussian i.i.d. matrix with elements ∼ CN (0, 1) that contains on each k-th row the codeword intended to user k. This corresponds to considering input covariances in the form S k (α) = g k (α)g k (α) H . The transmit power constraint is given by tr G(α) H G(α) ≤ P, ∀ α <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Plugging the beamforming covariances into <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, we obtain the average rate approximation log(1 + SINR k (α)) where</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">SINR k (α) = g k (α) H Σ k (α)g k (α) 1 + j =k g j (α) H Σ k (α)g j (α)<label>(19)</label></formula><p>It is interesting to notice that the definition of SINR given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">19</ref>) is commonly used in the beamforming/signal processing literature (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>). These works address the problem of minimum transmit power subject to qualityof-service constraints. This can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">min P (20) subject to SINR k (α) ≥ γ k , ∀ k, tr G(α) H G(α) ≤ P</formula><p>where γ k ≥ 0 are the users' target SINR requirements (quality-of-service). Although never said explicitly, it should be noticed that the SINR constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> does not correspond to any rigorous notion of information-theoretic achievable rates: the connection between achievable rates and the "signalprocessing" SINR defined in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">19</ref>) is provided by the approximations made in this section. Also, it should be noticed that <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> can be reduced to a convex problem and it can be solved using standard tools such as uplink-downlink duality and semi-definite programing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. On the contrary, the approximated weighted rate sum maximization max</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">G(α) K k=1 w k log 1 + SINR k (α) ,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>subject to tr G(α) H G(α) ≤ P is a non-convex problem. In the next section we provide a heuristic method to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Then, in Section IV we shall apply the proposed heuristic method to the original problems (queue stability and PFS) and compare the resulting performance to other known heuristic solutions. As a final remark, we notice that for the special case of perfect CSIT (α = H) we have Σ k = h k h H k . Therefore the approximation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> holds with equality and the rates log(1+ SINR k (H)) are actually achievable by downlink beamforming. The maximization of the sum rate (equal weights) is still a non-convex problem, and a heuristic algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>

Unfortunately, since f (G) may have several local maxima, the final point of the iterative algorithm depends in general on the initial condition. Several approaches can be followed here. For example, we may repeat the above recursion for several randomly chosen initial points and select the best found local maximum. Another approach consists of initializing G (0) according to the dominant spatial direction of the channels. Suppose that Σ k has dominant eigenvector v k . Then, a sensible choice for the initial point consists of</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">G (0) = [v 1 , . . . , v K ] H ,</formula><p>that is, the spatial filter "matched" to the dominant channel directions. This choice is sensible if the CSIT yields directly the directions v k without need for an eigenvalue decomposition, i.e., without any computational effort. For the analog feedback model illustrated in Appendix I this is indeed the case. In fact, we have used this initialization method in the simulations of Section IV.</p><p>Furthermore, we have also observed that the line search (30) can be avoided, and the value µ = 1 can be safely used.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Greedy user selection</head><p>A system is said to be interference limited if the weighed rate sum is bounded in the limit of large SNR. In the system at hands, SINR k is bounded for P → ∞ if g H j Σ k g j &gt; 0 for some j = k. In particular, if the column space of Σ k coincides with C M then there is no "zero-forcing" direction such that we can have simultaneously SINR j → ∞ and SINR k → ∞ as P → ∞. If all channel covariance matrices have rank M , any rate scheduling algorithm that serves more than one user per slot yields an interference limited system. For channel matrices of rank less than M the situation is more complicated. In particular, for perfect CSIT where all Σ k = h k h H k have rank 1, it is possible to find subsets of 1 ≤ m ≤ M linearly independent users that can be scheduled at the same time while the system is not interference limited.</p><p>This observation is the key to understand the need of greedy user selection in conjunction with the above iterative algorithm: for sufficiently large P the objective function f (G) is maximized by scheduling only a subset of users. Unfortunately, the algorithm might converge to an interference limited local maximum, i.e., it might not be able to select a subset of linearly independent users. In this case, the gap between the absolute maximum and such local maxima can be made arbitrarily large for sufficiently large P . Hence, without some mechanism that prevents "bad" local maxima, the performance loss of the proposed iterative algorithm with respect to the optimum can be unbounded (in contrast with the claims made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> for a similar algorithm that suffers from the very same problem).</p><p>We conclude that in order to operate at high SNR with linear beamforming it is essential to select a good subset K ⊆ {1, . . . , K} of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Brute-force optimal user selection requires searching for all K m subsets of m out of K users, for all m = 1, 2, . . .. The problem of efficient optimal user selection is still open and only heuristic algorithms have been proposed. We shall use the following simple greedy scheme. Let f K denote the objective function value obtained by forcing all users j / ∈ K to have g j = 0 (hence zero rate) and then running the iterative algorithm of Section III-A restricted to the user subset K. Then, the greedy user selection algorithm works as follows: initialize K 0 = ∅ and f ∅ = 0. For m = 1, 2, . . ., do:</p><p>1) Find</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">k m = arg max k / ∈Km-1 f Km-1∪{k} 2) If f Km-1∪{km} &lt; f Km-1 , let K = K m-1 and stop. 3) Otherwise, let K m = K m-1 ∪ {k m },</formula><p>and go to 1. Notice that this greedy selection can be applied to any heuristic weighted rate sum maximization approach that converges to some local maximum of the objective function. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> the greedy search is used with zero-forcing beamforming and waterfilling power allocation (in the case of perfect CSIT), and in the simulations of Section IV we shall consider the same approach with an approximated zeroforcing beamforming based on the non-perfect CSIT.</p><p>As said before, when the channel covariance matrices have rank M and P is sufficiently large the objective function is maximized by letting only one user transmit (TDMA). In this case, the greedy user selection is optimal since it chooses the user with the largest weighted rate, given by k = arg max j=1,...,K</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">w j log 1 + P max gj:||gj||=1 g H j Σ j g j = arg max j=1,...,K w j log (1 + P λ max (Σ j ))<label>(31)</label></formula><p>where λ max (Σ j ) denotes the maximum eigenvalue of Σ j . For the case of no CSIT, we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">Σ k = E[h k h H k ].</formula><p>Hence, the values λ max (Σ k ) are constants that depend only on the a priori "spatial distribution" of the users. If, in addition, the channels are identically and isotropically distributed (e.g., as in a rich scattering Rayleigh fading situation), then Σ k = I and (31) corresponds to scheduling the user with the largest weight. In the case of PFS, this yields round-robin scheduling, and in the case of random arrivals this yields the so-called Serve-the-Largest-Connected-Queue policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulation setting</head><p>The channel and CSIT models are defined in Appendix I. We matched the Gauss-Markov correlation coefficient in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> to Jakes' autocorrelation model, such that r = J 0 (2πvf c T /c) where v is the mobile speed (m/sec) and f c is the carrier frequency (Hz), c is the light speed (m/sec), T denotes the slot length (sec) and J 0 (•) is the Bessel function of the first kind and order 0. Inspired by the HDR/1xEV-DO system, we considered a slot duration of 1.67 msec and a feedback delay of d = 2 slots. For the analog feedback scheme of Appendix I, we let the uplink SNR be equal to the downlink SNR, i.e. P = 1/N up 0 . Under the assumption of perfect CSIT (ideal noiseless and delay-free feedback) we considered: 1) the optimal DPC signaling strategy and rate scheduling implemented using the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, 2) the linear zero-forcing beamforming scheme with waterfilling power allocation, enhanced by greedy user selection as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (referred to as"greedy-ZFWF"), 3) the algorithm proposed in this paper, that for the special case of perfect CSIT is very similar to that presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> enhanced by the greedy user selection (referred to as "greedy-SVH" from the name of the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>), 4) a version of opportunistic beamforming scheme (RB) proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. For the RB scheme, we consider that the number of beams is fixed a priori and, if not specified otherwise, it is equal to the number of antennas B = M as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Under non-perfect CSIT, we compare the proposed algorithm (referred to as "greedy-KC" from the name of the authors of this paper) with a "greedy-ZFWF" that computes the precoding matrix as if α was the true channel (mismatched zero-forcing), as considered for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the RB scheme selecting users based on the SINR predicted by the same CSIT model of the other schemes. For the RB scheme, we make the optimistic assumption that the sequence of random beamforming matrices is known a priori to all the users <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Furthermore, since the RB does not require the transmitter to track the channel, we assume that the feedback link is noiseless so that the only source of nuisance is due to the feedback delay. We feel that this represents a fair comparison with other more complicated signaling schemes and reflects the fact that RB requires in general less feedback: each user sends back M SINR values (one for each random beam) based on the channel prediction α (that can be computed at the transmitter) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Sum rate vs. number of users under PFS</head><p>Here we consider the PFS scheduling. We chose t c = 5K, that imposes fairness over a rather short time interval (e.g., this value would be appropriate for a multimedia streaming application, where users cannot tolerate long time intervals without receiving source bits). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the average sum rate vs. the number of users K for the case of perfect CSIT. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows analogous curves for the case of non-perfect CSIT case with mobile speed v = 10 km/h, that yields the prediction MMSE σ 2 e = 0.05 under an SNR of 20 dB (see Appendix I for the details of the calculation of σ 2 e as a function of r and, therefore, of the mobile speed v). The performance of greedy-ZFWF is omitted since it coincides with the performance achieved by greedy-SVH. We observe that for this choice of t c comparable to the number of users, the RB scheme with a single beam <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> converges to a round-robin by serving one user after another and thus cannot exploit multiuser diversity. On the contrary, the systems based on multiple beams are able to achieve very large spectral efficiency since they can schedule multiple users simultaneously while maintaining    the same degree of fairness. Remarkably, the proposed system performs close to the optimal DPC-based scheme in the case of perfect CSIT (especially if M is not too large), and yields dramatic improvements over RB for the case of non-perfect CSIT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Average delay vs. sum arrival rate</head><p>For a system with queues and random arrivals we consider mutually independent Poisson arrival processes A k (t) with exponentially distributed packet length (in bit).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows the averaged delay (computed by Little's theorem) vs. the sum arrival rate for a system with K = 20 users and M = 2, 4 antennas under perfect CSIT. The average SNR is 10dB and we consider i.i.d. varying channel (r = 0 in the Gauss-Markov model). We remark that both greedy-ZFWF and greedy-SVH achieve near DPC performance especially for M = 2 although the performance gap increases for M = 4. With the RB scheme, the queue buffers overflow at much smaller arrival rate than other schemes. Notice also that for  a 20-user system, the RB scheme with M = 4 antennas is harmful (much worse than M = 2) because it requires a dramatically larger number of users compared to the number of beams to exploit multiuser diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Average delay vs. mobile speed</head><p>We evaluate the average delay performance of greedy-ZFWF, greedy-KC, and RB as a function of the mobile speed v by letting the total arrival rate fixed to λ sum = 6.0 bit/channel use. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> we consider a 20-user system with M = 4 antennas (M = 1 refers to a standard single-antenna TDMA system). The SNR equal to 20dB. Under the given parameters, the mobile speeds v = 0, 10, 15, 22, 33.5, 44.5, 58 km/h yield the channel prediction MMSE σ 2 e = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10,0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80 respectively. A closed form expression for the d-step prediction MMSE that depends on the mobile speed is provided in Appendix I. As said before, for RB the feedback link is considered noise-free which gives the prediction MMSE slightly smaller than the analog feedback for a given mobile speed. These results show that greedy-KC and greedy-ZFWF achieve substantially equivalent performance and much better stability with respect to RB for low speed. However, when the Doppler bandwidth increases, greedy-KC is much more robust to channel prediction error than the greedy-ZFWF, that becomes rapidly mismatched. Interestingly, despite the fact that RB needs only SINR feedback, it is much more fragile to mobility (Doppler) than the other two schemes that require a more accurate CSIT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We studied the weighted sum rate maximization problem in the MIMO-BC with linear beamforming strategies under nonperfect CSIT. We showed that both the adaptive policy that stabilizes all arrival rates in the system stability region and the PFS joint scheduling and beamforming policy for systems with infinite backlog can be compactly stated as a weighted rate sum maximization for suitable time-varying weights. The problem with Gaussian superposition coding and non-perfect CSIT appears to be very difficult to be treated in an exact manner. Therefore, we formulated a simplified problem where we adopted the definition of SINR commonly used in the signal-processing/beamforming literature. Although simpler, the resulting problem is still non-convex. Hence, we provided a simple greedy beamforming algorithm that yields very good results with relatively low complexity. This algorithm requires the knowledge of the channel covariance matrices given the CSIT at each slot time t. This is particularly suited with timedivision duplex (TDD) or frequency-division duplex (FDD) with analog feedback, that we have discussed to some detail extent in Appendix I. However, our approach might also be applied to quantized feedback or other form of CSIT feedback as long as the channel vector conditional covariances can be characterized.</p><p>Numerical results confirm that under perfect CSIT our simple linear beamforming scheme achieves near DPC performance both in terms of sum rate and average delay. On the other hand, in the presence of feedback delay and noise, it is found that previously proposed heuristic schemes (notably, those based on random beamforming or on mismatched zero-forcing beamforming) rapidly degrade, while the new scheme appears to be much more robust to non-perfect CSIT and therefore it is a good candidate for systems that have to handle some mobility, such as IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMax).</p></div>

We hasten to say that the beamforming and rate scheduling algorithm proposed in this paper can be applied as long as the conditional covariances of the channel vectors, Σ k (α(t)) = E[h k (t)h k (t) H |α(t)] are known. In this however, we consider analog feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for FDD systems, where the receivers send back to the transmitter their (ideal) channel measurements as unquantized modulation symbols, over the uplink channel.

The uplink SNR is equal to 1/N up 0 . This may depend on several factors such as the number of uplink pilot symbols used (for TDD) or the repetition/power allocation of the analog feedback symbols for FDD (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for a very thorough discussion and comparison between TDD and FDD).</p><p>We define the CSIT α k (t) of user k in slot t as the MMSE prediction of h k (t) given the observation {z k (t ) : t = 1, . . . , t}, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">α k (t) = E[h k (t)|z k (t -d), . . . , z k (0)] (34) = r d E[h k (t -d)|z k (t -d), . . . , z k (0)]</formula><p>where the last equality follows from the Gauss-Markov model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</p><p>This can be computed recursively using a Kalman filter/predictor approach.
