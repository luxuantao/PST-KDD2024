<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article presents a novel tuning design of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller in the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system by using Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm with a new time domain performance criterion. This performance criterion was chosen to minimize the maximum overshoot, rise time, settling time and steady state error of the terminal voltage. In order to compare CS with other evolutionary algorithms, the proposed objective function was used in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms for PID design of the AVR system. The performance of the proposed CS based PID controller was compared to the PID controllers tuned by the different evolutionary algorithms using various objective functions proposed in the literature. Dynamic response and a frequency response of the proposed CS based PID controller were examined in detail. Moreover, the disturbance rejection and robustness performance of the tuned controller against parametric uncertainties were obtained, separately. Energy consumptions of the proposed PID controller and the PID controllers tuned the PSO and ABC algorithms were analyzed thoroughly. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the CS based PID controller has better control performance in comparison with other PID controllers tuned by the PSO and ABC algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed objective function remarkably improves the PID tuning optimization technique.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 1 Introduction</head><p>In power systems, automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is used for sustaining the terminal voltage of a synchronous generator at an acceptable level. The AVR system controls the consistency of the terminal voltage by varying the exciter voltage of the generator <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Generally, the stability and transient performance of the regulator is difficult to achieve because of load variation and the high inductance of the generator field windings in power systems. At the present time, the AVR system has received much attention in the industries to maintain the constant terminal voltage in the synchronous generator under all the conditions. Nevertheless, to obtain improved transient and dynamic voltage stability, optimal controller parameters in AVR system are highly desirable. Many recent approaches of optimal gain tuning methods for the controller parameters of the AVR system has been studied. During the past decades, several control structures have been developed significantly. Nevertheless, among these controllers, the PID controller is the most widely used controller in industries since it is easy to design and carry out. Stability, design, applications and performance of the PID controllers have been widely studied in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Therefore, the PID controller is still a proper choice for the AVR system.</p><p>It has been a crucial problem to set properly gains of the PID controller, especially in many industrial systems that have higher order, time delay and nonlinearities. Therefore, numerous methods have been used for optimal tuning of the PID controller. Tuning methods for the PID parameters can be classified as traditional, artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation methods. Generally, it is difficult to achieve the best performance of the system by using conventional methods such as Ziegler-Nichols. This method cannot provide optimal PID tuning parameters and also usually produce oscillations and a large overshoot. Moreover, the designer has to depend on his experience such that the best performance is obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. On the other hand, artificial intelligence approaches such as fuzzy logic and neural network have been applied to solve the optimization problem of the PID controller parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. But, the training process and convergence time become cumbersome and long in the artificial neural network. As for a fuzzy logic system, in fuzzy membership function generation, the results usually depend on the analysis of data, tuning of a model and skills of the designer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, many intelligent optimization algorithms based evolutionary computation techniques have been proposed to tune the parameters of the PID controller in the AVR system. Such algorithms include Taguchi Combined Genetic Algorithm (TCGA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Many Optimizing Liaisons (MOL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>,</p></div>

A multi-objective design optimization was introduced to minimize the step response characteristics. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was compared to that of the GA and PSO algorithms. Finally, fast design and an efficient performance prediction were performed. Mouayad and Bestoun <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> addressed a novel time domain objective function based on the multi-objective Pareto front solutions for tuning the PID controller parameters with PSO algorithm in the AVR system. It was shown that the suggested performance criterion improves the PID tuning optimization compared to the objective functions commonly used in the literature. Gaing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> presented an optimal PID controller design using PSO with a time domain performance criterion for the AVR system. Also, the comparison of the results between PSO and GA algorithms has been given. The comparative results showed that the proposed approach has better tuning capability than GA and also, is more efficient and robust in improving the step response of the system. Panda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed a MOL algorithm for the design and performance analysis of the PID controller for the AVR system. The integral time-weighted absolute error (ITAE), integral absolute error (IAE), integral time-square error (ITSE) and integral square error (ISE) were considered. Also, the effect of these objective functions on the performance of the system in terms of step response characteristics were analyzed. The results showed that the proposed controller for the AVR system outperforms the other similar optimization algorithms recently reported in the literature. Gozde and Taplamacioglu <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> examined comparative performance analysis of ABC algorithm for controlling AVR system. The robustness of the proposed method has been compared to different algorithms such as PSO and differential evolution (DE) in terms of the characteristic analyses. The simulation results demonstrated that the ABC tuned PID controller allows to control the AVR system robustly and optimally. Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> presented a novel design method for finding out the PID parameters of the AVR system using the CAS. For the purpose of showing the performance of the proposed method, the results of comparison between the CAS-PID and GA-PID controller were given. The effectiveness and feasibility of the PID controller tuned with CAS algorithm were verified with the simulation results. Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> suggested the hybrid system consisting of GA and BF for optimizing the PID controller of the AVR system using a time domain objective function. Also, the hybrid system was compared to GA, PSO, GA-PSO. Finally, the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed system is highly satisfactory. Mohanty et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed an approach for obtaining the optimal PID controller parameters of the AVR system based on the LUS algorithm. Furthermore, various conventional objective functions and modified objective functions concerning peak overshoot and settling time with some appropriate weighting factors were employed to find the optimum controller parameters. The simulation results showed that the proposed method gives better dynamic performance in comparison with the presented optimization algorithms. Chatterjee and Mukherjee <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> presented TLBO algorithm as an optimization technique to find out the optimum values of the PID controller in the AVR system. The results showed that the proposed algorithm is a considerable optimization tool in determining the optimal PID controller parameters of the AVR system. Blondin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> presented a meta-analysis of the literature on the optimal tuning PID controller parameters solving the AVR problem. As a result, in that paper, the investigation revealed that the proposed tuning method acquires better or equivalent PID solutions in terms of the overall transient response in comparison with other AVR tuning propositions. Also, the simulation results showed that the proposed tuning method exhibits higher computational efficiency compared to previously published methods. Chatterjee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> explored a comparative performance study of two new classes of PSO for the PID and PSS controlled AVR system. Also, GA was considered for the sake of comparison. Finally, it was revealed that the proposed tuning method provides better transient performance compared to GA while applying to PID controlled AVR system and PSS controlled AVR system. Supol and Wudhichai <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> presented an optimal PID controller design for the AVR system using a new method based on hybrid of PSO and Gravitational Search Algorithm (PSOGSA). In that paper, for showing the effectiveness of the proposed technique, the transient response analysis and bode analysis were conducted. As a result, from the analysis, the proposed PSOGSA algorithm obtains better results in comparison with other tuning methods such as the Ziegler-Nichols, PSO and MOL for the AVR system. Kashki et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed an efficient optimization method based on reinforcement learning automata (RLA) for tuning the PID controller parameters of the AVR system. Also, its performance was compared with PSO and GA. Finally, in that paper, the simulation results indicated the superior efficiency and performance of the proposed method in consideration of other algorithms. Bahgaat and Moustafa Hassan <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> discussed the methods to obtain the best possible tuning parameters of the PID controller for the AVR system. In that work, Modified Adaptive Acceleration Coefficients based PSO (MAAPSO) was proposed as a new method. Also, some modern methods were defined as: PSO, Adaptive Weight PSO, Adaptive Acceleration Coefficients based PSO and Adaptive Acceleration Coefficients based PSO. A comparison between the results of all methods given was done. It was inferred from the simulations that the proposed method can provide higher quality solution with better computation efficiency compared to the other methods. Devaraj and Selvabala <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> presented a combined GA and fuzzy logic approach for optimal tuning of PID controller parameters in AVR system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm under various operating conditions was analyzed</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T through computer simulation. As a result, the simulation results demonstrated the suitability of the proposed approach to obtain the optimal parameters of the PID controller during real-time operation of the system.</p><p>Generally, in the suggested method, finding of optimum controller parameters is very important to accomplish the acceptable level of robust performance. Considering the recent researches in optimizing the PID controller parameters of the AVR system, a Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm can be used to design a better PID control of the AVR system. CS is a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm which is inspired by the way of cuckoos' search for nests where they could lay their eggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Yang and Deb <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposed this algorithm taking into account the reproduction behavior of cuckoo based on the three rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In both papers, they demonstrated better efficiency of the CS algorithm in finding a global optimum as well as a higher degree of its success when compared with GA and PSO algorithms.</p><p>In the light of researches in literature, most of the reported works have focused on evolutionary optimization algorithms to find the optimal PID controller parameters for the AVR system. In the existing research works, the simulation results have some deficiencies in obtaining the response behavior that is usually specified in terms of time domain parameters. They are used to assess the unit step response. Such parameters are settling time, rise time, maximum overshoot and steady state error. A PID controller, tuned by the reported algorithms above, may remove this disadvantage of the AVR system and improve the unit step response by minimizing these parameters. To this end, numerous objective functions have been proposed in the literatures as a performance criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. These functions can be classified as numerous weighted time and frequency domain. It is difficult to choose the appropriate objective function and identify the best weight values required for time-domain optimal-tuning PID control or frequency-domain optimal-tuning PID control of the AVR system. The time domain integral error performance criteria are widely used objective functions that are based on calculating the error signal between the reference signal and the system output. These well-known integral performance indices are IAE, ITAE, ISE, ITSE and integral of squared time multiplied by squared error (ISTE). The minimization of IAE and ISE may result in a response with a relatively small overshoot but a long settling time since they weigh all errors uniformly independent of time. On the other hand, the ITAE and ITSE performance criteria can overcome the disadvantage of the IAE and ISE, however these criteria cannot ensure the needed stability boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. In addition to them, a new time domain performance criterion has been defined by Zwe-Lee Gaing in which the unit step timing parameters are used with only one weighting factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. A general objective function in time domain and frequency domain to facilitate the control strategy has been proposed by Zamani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This performance criterion consists of eight terms including two frequency parameters that the significance of each is set by a weight factor. As a result of literature survey, the proposed performance criteria can seek optimal controller design parameters.</p><p>In this work, the optimal design of the PID controller is achieved by minimizing the proposed time performance criterion using PSO, ABC and CS algorithms for the AVR system. For obtaining the better control performance, , , and of the step response can be achieved as the minimum values. Therefore, the proposed criterion includes the time domain specifications that are the overshoot, the settling time and the steady state error as well as mean of time weighted absolute error. By using this performance criterion, the optimal PID controller parameters in the AVR system are determined through PSO, ABC and CS algorithms. This proposed method effectively investigates a high-quality solution and improves the transient response of the AVR system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contribution of this study</head><p>In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p> Propose a new time domain performance criterion based on two or more conflicting objective functions to be minimized simultaneously in the PID controller design for the AVR system using the CS algorithm.  Compare the results obtained by the CS with those obtained by other optimization algorithms recently reported in the literatures.  Examine the robustness of the PID controller tuned with CS under parametric variation of the AVR system.  Investigate the degree of tracking and disturbance rejection of the proposed controller design compared to various PID controllers tuned by modern heuristic optimization algorithms via different objective function proposed in the literature.</p><p>The robustness performance of the proposed PID controller is tested by carrying out the simulations under three operating conditions, and also the results are compared with various PID controllers tuned by the algorithms reported in the literature for the AVR system. In case 1, the performance of the proposed controller is measured by considering that the system uncertainties are variations of time constants of each blocks of the AVR system. The variation of system gains is changed from their nominal values in the range of +50% to -50% in steps of 25%. In case 2, the tracking capability of the proposed controller is compared under presence of parametric uncertainties in the generator, exciter and amplifier model parameters. In case 3, by producing a disturbance and showing results graphically, the disturbance rejection capability and signal outputs of the controllers are demonstrated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">AVR System Modeling</head><p>Excitation control of a synchronous generator is one of the most important factors for improving power system stability and quality of electrical power <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The major task of the AVR system in a power plant is to maintain the terminal voltage magnitude in the synchronous generator automatically at a desired level which affects the security of the system. Generally, for the AVR there are three important duties, namely better regulation of voltage, stability improvement and decreasing overvoltage on loss of load. Consequently, it is required to design a controller for an AVR system to improve its stability and transient performance.</p><p>A simple AVR system comprises four main components including amplifier, exciter, generator and sensor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Analysis of the AVR System with PID Controller</head><p>The dynamic response of the AVR system can be improved by using PID controller. The PID controllers are usually preferable because of its simple structure and easy implementation. The PID controller comprises three main control actions in association with the error signal in proportional, integral and derivative ways. The transfer function of the PID controller is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(2)</formula><p>where , and are the proportional, integral and derivative gains, respectively. The block diagram of the AVR system with the PID controller is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.   (3) By substituting the transfer functions of the AVR system components listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> with their values and the transfer function of the PID controller given by Equation 2 in Equation 3, the final transfer function of the AVR system controlled by the PID in above equation is obtained as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(s V ref ) (s V e s 1 . 0 1 10  s 1 1 1  ) (s V t s 01 . 0 1 1  ) (s V s s 4 . 0 1 1  s K s K K d i p   ) (s U A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">( ) ( ) ( )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The basic characteristic of the transient response of the system shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is closely associated with the location of the closed-loop poles. Consequently, the location of the closed loop poles depends on the values of the loop gains chosen. From this point of view, the gain adjustment of the PID controller may move the closed loop poles to a desired location. For proper design of the PID controller, the design problem then becomes the selection of the appropriate gain values such that the PID controller can compensate the effect of two real poles of the AVR system. As a result, a suitable tuning method of the PID gain parameters must be selected to improve the dynamic response as well as reduce or eliminate the steady state error. In this work, with the new proposed performance criterion, the optimization algorithm employed for designing the PID controller will attempt to tune the controller parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Cuckoo Search Algorithm</head><p>In 2009, Xin-She Yang and Suash Deb developed a new population-based metaheuristic optimization technique known as cuckoo search algorithm. This algorithm is inspired from the brood parasitic breeding strategy of certain species of cuckoos by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This algorithm imitates the cuckoo's behavior of finding the other bird species' nest for development and care of its young ones.</p><p>The Cuckoos never build their own nest and intelligently use other bird species' nest in which the host bird has just laid its eggs. Cuckoo birds imitate the color and pattern of eggs of some of the host species. Thus, they are able to lay eggs which look like the egg(s) of the host bird in their nest. In this way, their chick will be part of and replace one of the eggs of the host bird with their egg within seconds. Once the cuckoo's chick is hatched, his first instinct action is to throw the host eggs out from nest. Hence, it would increase the cuckoo chick's share of food supplied by its host bird, and also gain access to more feeding opportunity by mimicking the call of host chicks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Some host birds identify the cuckoo's egg, and they either throw the foreigner eggs out of their nest or permanently abandon the nest to develop a new one <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>In this optimization algorithm, the main theme is to select the best nest with optimal solutions. Each nest is regarded as a potential candidate. The significant rules that are used for the cuckoo reproduction process in CS algorithm are presented as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>:</p><p>1. Each cuckoo lays an egg and drop it in a randomly chosen nest, 2. The best nests have the optimal solution and carry over to the next generation of cuckoos (the next step), 3. The available host nests are restricted in numbers and a host bird can discover the foreign eggs by a probability ( ) between [ ] range.</p><p>For generating the new nest for cuckoos, the global random walk is performed by using a law named Lévy flights which is given below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(5)</formula><p>where indicates the current iterations in which N denotes the predetermined maximum iteration number.</p><p>is the step size regarding the scales of the problem of interest. An important parameter of the CS algorithm is the use of which is Lévy flight for both local and global searching. Lévy flight process is basically a random walk which is derived from the Lévy distribution with an infinite variance and infinite mean given in Equation 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. This process is one of the most powerful features of cuckoo search to produce a new candidate solution or egg providing by a random walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T (6)</formula><p>where is the iteration number. This equation in the proposed CS algorithm is developed using the exponential law by Mantegna <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Mantegna's algorithm yields random numbers with respect to a symmetric Lévy stable distribution. The algorithm is initialized by taking individually solution from the initial population, and then replacing it by a new vector generated using the steps. Here the steps fundamentally constitute a random walk process with a power law steplength distribution with a heavy tail <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>The basic steps involved in the CS algorithm can be given as the pseudo code shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. In short, initial population is produced using random numbers. The error related to each population is then determined. In each iteration, some quality solutions are stored for further processing and the rest are updated using Lévy flight.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">,..., 3 , 2 , 1 , n i X i    d x x x x X X f ,..., , , ), ( 3 2 1  new X ) ( new X f j X ) ( j X f ) ( ( ) j new X f X f  j X j X new X a P Iter Max CNT _  A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula></div>

In optimizing the gains of the PID, the PSO, ABC and CS algorithms employ the proposed objective function defined in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">13</ref>. The performance of the proposed CS based PID controller is compared with the PID controllers tuned by recently published modern heuristic optimization algorithms using various performance criterion. Moreover, transient response, frequency response and robustness analysis are carried out on the proposed PID controller. The derivative action in the PID controller is the most critical term. It should be defined in a suitable way to obtain the accurate dynamic results. The transfer function of the PID controller (a first order filter is added to the derivative term) is given as the following <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where is the time constant of the first order filter. When the approaches zero, will be equivalent to . For this reason, the time constant is set to 0.001 such that the output signal of PID controller with filtered derivative action is liken to the output signal of .</p><p>The proposed methods have been implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK software and all simulations have been performed on personal computer having Intel Core TM 2 quad processor, 2.50 GHz, and 4 GB RAM. Results of interest are marked in bold in the respective tables.</p><p>The results (best, worst, average and standard deviation results and CPU time) of the comparisons between PSO and ABC and CS algorithms using the proposed objective function are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> for optimal tuning PID parameters in the AVR system. From the table, it can be obviously seen that the proposed CS algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in a statistically significant way over the tuning problem. On the other hand, the PSO algorithm is of better the execution time needed for solving the optimization problem. The CPU usage values for different algorithms are demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> during the tuning. As shown in the figure and the table, while the CPU time taken by the PSO algorithm for the tuning process has smaller, the CPU usage value is higher compared to others algorithms. As for the CS algorithm, it needs much more CPU time; but, requires less CPU usage for each instance. This observation points out that CS is less complex compared with others.  Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> depicts the results of 10 trials when the proposed objective function is used for tuning the controller parameters with PSO, ABC and CS. As observed in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, for all trials, the range of the PID gains tuned by CS has led to a more consistent situation than that of other algorithms. Similarly, from the design viewpoint, the rise time, the settling time and the overshoot obtained from CS has a variation within a smaller range compared to PSO and ABC.</p></div>

In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, it is clear that the unit step response is almost closer to each other for different algorithms based PID controllers. However, the CS based PID controller has better performance for percent overshoots compared to others.

Each PID controller is related to one of the aforementioned optimization techniques and objective functions (OF). From Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, it may be concluded that the PID controller tuned by CS with the proposed objective function has a better step response behavior in comparison with the other optimized PID controllers for the same AVR system. Also, comparative numerical results of the responses yielded by the optimized PID controllers including controller parameters, time domain and steady state performance indices are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>. In comparison to PID-PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, PID-MOL <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, PID-BF-GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and PID-LUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> with various objective functions presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>, it may be found that the proposed CS-PID controller with the considered objective function obtains better results with three performance indices which are , and , and only little worse .

The AVR system with the proposed PID controller exhibits minimum peak gain 0 dB at 0 Hz, maximum phase margin 180°, infinite delay margin (the smallest delay destabilizing the system) and maximum bandwidth (the wider bandwidth, the smaller rise time).

Moreover, the performance of the AVR with the proposed CS based PID controller was compared to the PID controllers tuned by different evolutionary algorithms with some performance evaluation criteria used in the recent literature. The comparative simulation results show that the proposed CS based PID approach was capable of obtaining a superior response performance as compared to the other optimized PID controllers with various objective functions. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed PID controller as well as the other optimized PID controllers was tested under dynamic parameter uncertainties of the AVR system. It is found that more robust stability and better dynamic performance characteristics were obtained by the proposed CS based PID controller compared with other PID controllers under the condition of the parameter uncertainty.</p><p>Concerning future studies, the proposed gain tuning method will be applied to tune the controllers such as fractional order PID (FOPID) controller, fuzzy PID and fuzzy FOPID controllers for more complex control systems.</p></div>
