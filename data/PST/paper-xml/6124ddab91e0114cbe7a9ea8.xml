<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>At present, with the continuous progress and development of the society, the real world needs to generate a variety of data every day, and accurate analysis of data is related to the sound development of the society <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The traditional data analysis method has a small amount of data analysis and cannot meet the needs of large-scale data analysis. In this case, graph calculation emerged as The Times required, and was gradually applied to data analysis in various industries, which now occupies a very critical position in large-scale data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. For example, with the rapid development of information network, social platforms are extremely active. At present, user data of all social platforms show explosive growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, the data between these social platforms lack a unified semantic representation, and the data is extremely complex, so it is difficult to analyze and process the data by other means <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However, graph calculation provides a good way for this kind of complex large-scale data analysis. No matter how complex the data is, the graph structure can be used to represent the connection relation of the data and the bearing data. Data is generally stored on the edges of the graph structure, which are connected by nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. In recent years, the diversity of graph computing models and systems is increasing, and the graph computing system as a whole has made great progress. However, we must also realize that a series of problems have also appeared in the process of the development of graph computing system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>At present, most of the graph calculation adopts SFA algorithm. Although this algorithm can realize the connection between graph structure and data, it is highly dependent on data and difficult to calculate. At the same time, this calculation method restricts the further expansion of the graph scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. These are not conducive to the high-speed operation of the graph calculation system and restrict the operation effect of the system. In order to make the SFA algorithm adapt to the development of the graph computing system, the algorithm must be optimized to break through the limitations of the current SFA algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. At present, scholars at home and abroad have conducted a series of researches on the optimization algorithm of the following calculation system of big data. In particular, they have analyzed the SFA algorithm and proposed the effective parallel computing with the help of SFA. At the same time, they also found that this algorithm has great limitations in the intelligent application of list data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, few studies have proposed the optimization algorithm of SFA, and even fewer studies have optimized the SFA algorithm under the graph computing system. From this point of view, there is still a large theoretical research space.</p><p>In order to deepen relevant research, this paper firstly gives a simple overview of graph calculation and graph calculation model, and on this basis analyzes the specific formula and significance of SFA algorithm, proposes the specific scheme of algorithm optimization, and carries out experimental detection of optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. On the one hand, it promotes the process of the optimization algorithm of the following calculation system of big data, and on the other hand, it provides a certain theoretical basis for the related research in the future. The development of wireless communication has promoted the efficiency of information transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Overview of Diagram Calculation and Diagram Calculation Model</head><p>The graph calculation model Pregel was first proposed by Google in 2010 and has driven the continuous development of graph calculation since then. Since then, many different kinds of graph computing systems have emerged, such as Graph Lab, Graph Chi, and Graph Mat. Graph computing model is a kind of graph computing system which can be extended and fully automatic fault-tolerant. It is a distributed structure. With the help of the API under the graph computing model, the algorithm can be simplified and run in a distributed cluster environment. Nodes and edges are two main components of the graph calculation data model. At present, programming ports and models of most existing graph computing systems are expanded around the core node, and the update of model data is realized by completing the iterative calculation on each node. Among them, the operation of each node is based on the information of itself, its neighbors and its surroundings. There are two main computing modes in graph calculation, namely synchronous computing mode and asynchronous computing mode. There are many kinds of existing graph computing systems, and the classification method recognized by most people is based on the way of data storage. According to this way, the graph computing system can be divided into three types, namely distributed memory, stand-alone memory and stand-alone external memory. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the specific iterative method of the calculation system as follows: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">SFA Algorithm</head><p>As mentioned above, graph computing model is a distributed structure, and the most common algorithm under the distributed structure is SFA algorithm. The full name of SFA algorithm is parallel finite automata algorithm, with the determined finite automata, namely DFA, as the core. This algorithm is built on the basis of local computing architecture. The whole framework environment mainly includes two large parts, namely a host Sc and m auxiliary Si.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig.2. System framework</head><p>From the system framework in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> above, we can find that during the operation of graph computing system, a large graph is often divided into many sub-graphs that will not be superimposed, and these sub-graphs will be evenly distributed to each auxiliary machine between the start of query operation. The whole graph calculation process consists of 4 communication stages and 2 operation stages.</p><p>The specific calculation formula is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) ( ) )( ( 2 2 1 2 1 Q f q f f    (1)</formula><p>If an SFA is preset in advance, the corresponding set of input characters w1 exists fIw1= f1, and its corresponding w2 makes fIw1= f2 true, then the corresponding character column w1w2 also exists fIw1w2=f1• f2. Where the symbol • represents the inverse composite function. This can be explained by dividing a coherent character column into a number of child character columns and processing these character columns with the help of the SFA to achieve the merging of the final calculation results. However, it should be noted that every character column must be calculated from the initial state of SFA, namely fI. The specific processing formula is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">) ( 2 1 2 1 f f w w fI   (2)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">FIGURE CALCULATION SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION</head><p>ALGORITHM SFA algorithm can realize the connection between graph structure and data, but it has strong dependence on data and is difficult to calculate. At the same time, the calculation method restricts the further expansion of the graph scale. In order to improve the performance of the algorithm and reduce the network overhead of the graph computing system, the SFA algorithm must be optimized. After consulting relevant data, it is found that the SFA algorithm can be carried out in the form of sequential calculation or state merging. Based on this, this paper proposes sfa-dfa hybrid algorithm based on SFA algorithm. This algorithm can make the SFA state change to the sequential state in local calculation and continue relevant calculation. The calculation method of its sequential state is as follows: f1(f2(f2(f1(q0)))) = q2. In this state, it can realize fast query of data table, thus realizing timely and accurate analysis of data. Furthermore, the algorithm optimization of the graph computing system can generate the just-in-time state. Any relatively complicated SFA query statement will have a corresponding SFA state transition table, which needs to be generated by human control no matter in any calculation form, which requires a lot of energy to construct the data. However, the mixed algorithm of sfa-dfa solves this problem well. Under this algorithm, timely state can be automatically generated to follow the needs of the operation, so as to realize the rapid analysis of the table and reduce the complexity of the operation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">VERIFY THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM OF THE BIG DATA CALCULATION SYSTEM AS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE BELOW</head><p>In order to ensure the normal operation of the graph calculation system, it is necessary to verify the feasibility and scientificity of the optimization algorithm. In this paper, the experimental verification environment of SFA optimization algorithm is set up on five lenovo servers, and five data sets are used for experimental verification, including four real data sets and one simulation Random data set, whose names are YouTube, DBLP, MEME, Internet and Random. Through this experiment, the feasibility and scientificity of the optimization algorithm of the graph calculation system were verified from the following four aspects: graph scale, query complexity, number of subgraphs and communication consumption. The specific experimental data are shown in table 1 and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, which are the results of the author's experimental arrangement.  According to table 1, we can find that we can change the graph size by finding the subgraph corresponding to the number of vertices. In this experiment, sex pairs are used to fix 4 subgraphs in 8 states of the query phase at the same time. Through data analysis, it can be found that graph calculation with SFA optimization algorithm can greatly improve graph expansibility and form the maximum graph scale.In order to verify the effect of this algorithm on query size, the query size in this experiment is represented by the number of DFA states relative to the query statement, and the data query state under different graph sizes is analyzed in depth. Experiment to set query size to indicate.The number form is increased from 2 to 32, the number of subgraphs is set at 4, and the formula remains unchanged. From the data in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, we can find that the calculation time consumed by the algorithm after optimization is much lower than that of the SFA algorithm before optimization, and the sensitivity to query size is also reduced. Compared with the SFA algorithm, the operational performance of the optimized sfa-dfa algorithm is improved by at least twice as much as that of the SFA algorithm, and the query size increases without any impact on the operation speed. This is mainly because the optimized algorithm only needs to perform a single calculation, getting rid of the complex program of previous calculations. Through the above, we find that the optimized algorithm expands the graph scale and reduces the program of calculation. This means that the optimized sfa-dfa algorithm can realize large-scale data processing with the aid of single operation for graph calculation. The reduction of computing process naturally means that the network cost will also decline correspondingly, which saves the cost of graph calculation to a great extent.</p><p>In a word, the experiment shows that the algorithm optimization promotes the improvement of the performance of the graph calculation system in all aspects, which indicates that the sfa-dfa algorithm optimized based on the SFA algorithm has a promoting effect on the graph calculation system. The optimization algorithm is feasible and scientific, and it is a qualified algorithm. III. CONCLUSION Graph calculation is an inevitable result under the background of social data aggregation and growth. It is of great significance to study graph calculation system. On the basis of a simple overview of graph calculation and graph calculation model, this paper analyzes the specific formula and significance of SFA algorithm, puts forward the specific scheme of algorithm optimization, and finally carries out experimental detection on the optimization algorithm. The optimization of the algorithm promotes the graph computing system, which not only helps graph computing develop towards a more diversified and scientific direction, but also provides convenience for social data processing. It is more conducive to further research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
