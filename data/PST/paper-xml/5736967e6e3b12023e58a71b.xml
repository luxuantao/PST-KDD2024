<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Local binary patterns (LBP) are considered among the most computationally efficient high-performance texture features. However, the LBP method is very sensitive to image noise and is unable to capture macrostructure information. To best address these disadvantages, in this paper, we introduce a novel descriptor for texture classification, the median robust extended LBP (MRELBP). Different from the traditional LBP and many LBP variants, MRELBP compares regional image medians rather than raw image intensities. A multiscale LBP type descriptor is computed by efficiently comparing image medians over a novel sampling scheme, which can capture both microstructure and macrostructure texture information. A comprehensive evaluation on benchmark data sets reveals MRELBP's high performance-robust to gray scale variations, rotation changes and noise-but at a low computational cost. MRELBP produces the best classification scores of 99.82%, 99.38%, and 99.77% on three popular Outex test suites. More importantly, MRELBP is shown to be highly robust to image noise, including Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur, salt-and-pepper noise, and random pixel corruption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>how the texture recognition process works in humans as well as in the important role it plays in the wide variety of applications of computer vision and image analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The many applications of texture classification include medical image analysis and understanding, object recognition, biometrics, content-based image retrieval, remote sensing, industrial inspection, and document classification.</p><p>As a classical pattern recognition problem, texture classification primarily consists of two critical subproblems: feature extraction and classifier designation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. It is generally agreed that the extraction of powerful texture features plays a relatively more important role, since if poor features are used even the best classifier will fail to achieve good recognition results. Consequently, most research in texture classification focuses on the feature extraction part and numerous texture feature extraction methods have been developed, with excellent surveys given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Most existing methods have not, however, been capable of performing sufficiently well for real-world applications, which have demanding requirements including database size, nonideal environmental conditions, and running in real-time.</p><p>The inherent difficulty in extracting powerful texture features lies in balancing two competing goals: high-quality description and low computational complexity. High quality descriptors have to manage the tradeoff between distinctiveness, due to the wide range of texture classes, and robustness, due to large intraclass variations caused by variations in illumination, rotation, scale, blur, noise and occlusion. High speed descriptors and low dimensionality representation enable the entire application task to run in real-time. Many research efforts have been made to achieve either strict quality requirements or low computational speed.</p><p>Local Binary Patterns (LBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have emerged as one of the most prominent texture descriptors, attracting significant attention in the field of computer vision and image analysis due to their outstanding advantages:</p><p>1) ease of implementation, 2) invariance to monotonic illumination changes, and 3) low computational complexity. Although originally proposed for texture analysis, the LBP method has been successfully applied to many diverse problems including dynamic texture recognition, remote sensing, fingerprint matching, visual inspection, image retrieval, biomedical image analysis, face image analysis, motion analysis, edge detection, and environment modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A large number of LBP variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> have been developed to improve its robustness, discriminative power, and applicability.</p><p>With regards to discriminativeness, important examples include the Completed Local Binary Pattern (CLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Extended Local Binary Pattern (ELBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Discriminative Completed Local Binary Pattern (disCLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, Pairwise Rotation Invariant Cooccurrence Local Binary Pattern (PRICoLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and the combination of Dominant Local Binary Pattern (DLBP) and Gabor filtering features <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, despite the increase in discriminativeness, these LBP variants suffer in terms of robustness as they have minimal tolerance to image blur and noise corruption, and their feature dimensionality leads to increased computational complexity.</p><p>Similarly, the sensitivity of LBP to image degradation caused by blurring and noise has led to efforts including the Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Median Binary Pattern (MBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Fuzzy Local Binary Pattern (FLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Noise Tolerant Local Binary Pattern (NTLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Robust Local Binary Pattern (RLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Noise Resistant Local Binary Pattern (NRLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Although being more robust to image noise than traditional LBP, as has been remarked by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and observed in the experiments reports in this paper, the noise tolerance capability of these methods remains unsatisfactory.</p><p>Our recent ELBP approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed four LBPlike descriptors -Center Intensity based LBP (ELBP_CI), Neighborhood Intensity based LBP (ELBP_NI), Radial Difference based LBP (ELBP_RD) and Angular Difference based LBP (ELBP_AD). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> In that work the joint probability distribution of ELBP_CI, ELBP_NI and ELBP_RD (collectively referred as ELBP) produced good texture classification performance, however there remain some significant disadvantages:</p><p>1) Sensitivity to image blur and noise, 2) Failing to capture texture macrostructure, and 3) High feature dimensionality. In order to overcome these shortcomings, in this paper we propose a conceptually simple, high-quality, and computationally efficient approach, the Median Robust Extended Local Binary Pattern (MRELBP), based on combining a median filter with multiresolution support. The key contributions of the proposed method are highlighted as follows:</p><p>• We introduce a novel sampling scheme which can encapsulate both microstructure and macrostructure information, inspired by DAISY <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, BRISK <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and FREAK <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>• We find that combining local medians with our novel sampling scheme proves to be very powerful texture feature.</p><p>• We evaluate the proposed method comprehensively on benchmark texture datasets from several different perspectives, including sampling parameters, encoding strategy, illumination invariance, rotation invariance, speed, discriminative power, and noise robustness. • The proposed method offers gray scale invariance, rotation invariance, no pretraining or parameter tuning, and offers exceptional discriminativeness and noise robustness when compared against eleven recent state-of-the-art LBP variants on ten benchmark texture datasets. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses the related work. The derivation of the proposed approach operators and the classification framework are described in Section III. Experimental results are presented in Section IV. A preliminary version of this work appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK A. Local Binary Pattern (LBP)</head><p>The LBP operator proposed by Ojala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> characterizes the spatial structure of a local image patch by encoding the differences between the pixel value of the central point and those of its neighbors, considering only the signs to form a binary pattern. The resulting decimal value of the generated binary pattern is then used to label the given pixel. Formally, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, given a pixel x c in the image, the LBP response is calculated by comparing its value with those of its p neighboring pixels {x r, p,n } p-1 n=0 , evenly distributed in angle on a circle of radius r centered on x c as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">LBP r, p (x c ) = p-1 n=0 s(x r, p,n -x c )2 n , s(x) = 1 x ≥ 0 0 x &lt; 0 (1)</formula><p>where s() is the sign function. If the coordinates of x c are (0, 0), then the coordinates of x r, p,n are given by (-r sin(2πn/ p), r cos(2πn/ p)). The gray values x r, p,n of neighbors which do not fall exactly in the center of pixels are estimated by interpolation.</p><p>A texture image can thus be characterized by the probability distribution of the 2 p LBP patterns. The LBP operator was extended to multiscale analysis to allow any radius and number of pixels in the neighborhood by varying parameters (r, p).</p><p>To enhance the robustness to image rotation, a rotation invariant version LBP ri r, p was proposed by grouping together all the binary patterns that are actually rotated versions of the same pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">LBP ri r, p = min{RO R(LBP r, p , i )|i = 0, 1, . . . , p -1}<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where RO R(x, i ) performs an i -step circular bit-wise right shift on x. Keeping only those rotationally-unique patterns leads to a significant reduction in feature dimensionality. Ojala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> observed that certain LBP patterns represent the fundamental texture microstructures, and named these Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Illustration for the proposed RELBP descriptor. The key difference between the ELBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and the RELBP is that the only single pixel values are used in the ELBP, as opposed to a windowed or averaged approach in the RELBP. patterns uniform patterns, those which have a U value of at most two:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U (LBP r, p ) = p-1 n=0 |s(x r, p,n -x c ) -s(x r, p,mod(n+1, p) -x c )|,</formula><p>such that U (LBP r, p ) counts the bitwise transitions from 0 to 1 or vice versa. The uniform descriptor, LBP u2 r, p , has p( p -1) + 3 categories consisting of p( p -1) + 2 distinct uniform patterns and one nonuniform group containing all nonuniform patterns. Ojala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed to further group the uniform patterns into p + 1 different rotation invariant categories, leading to the rotation invariant uniform descriptor LBP riu2 r, p with a much lower dimensionality of p + 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">LBP riu2 r, p = p-1 n=0 s(x r, p,n -x c ), if U (LBP r, p ) ≤ 2 p + 1, otherwise<label>(3)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Extended Local Binary Pattern (ELBP)</head><p>Whereas LBP encodes only the relationship between a central point and its neighbors, ELBP is designed to encode distinctive spatial relationships in a local region and therefore contains more spatial information. ELBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> consist of three LBP-like descriptors ELBP_CI, ELBP_NI and ELBP_RD which explore information from the intensity of the center pixel, of its neighboring pixels, and radial differences, respectively.</p><p>The ELBP strategy is similar to the original LBP. The central pixel's intensity is thresholded</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ELBP_CI(x c ) = s(x c -β) (4)</formula><p>against β, the mean of the whole image. Instead of using the gray value of the center pixel as the thresholding value, as used in LBP, ELBP_NI utilizes the average of the neighboring pixels' intensities to generate the binary pattern. As shown in the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, ELBP_NI is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ELBP_NI r, p (x c ) = p-1 n=0 s(x r, p,n -β r, p )2 n (5)</formula><p>thresholded against the local mean β r, p = 1 p p-1 n=0 x r, p,n .</p><p>In parallel to the intensity-based descriptors ELBP_NI and ELBP_CI, the ELBP_RD is derived from pixel differences in radial directions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ELBP_RD r,r-1, p (x c ) = p-1 n=0 s(x r, p,n -x r-1, p,n )2 n . (6)</formula><p>Similar to LBP, the grouping strategies for obtaining LBP ri r, p , LBP u2 r, p and LBP riu2 r, p can apply to ELBP_NI and ELBP_RD. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> found that the ELBP riu2 r, p led to good texture classification performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. LBP Variants</head><p>Many extensions and modifications of LBP have been developed with an aim to increase its robustness and discriminativeness, with surveys given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Changed Neighborhood Topology and Sampling: Orjuela-Vargas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proposed Geometrical Local Textural Patterns (GLTP) which explores intensity changes on oriented neighborhoods. Nanni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> investigated the use of different neighborhood topologies (circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola and Archimedean spiral) and encodings in their research on LBP variants for medical image texture analysis. Hussain and Triggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> proposed Local Quantized Patterns (LQP) where a selection of possible geometries<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> are evaluated. These LBP variants aim to explore anisotropic information, not designed for rotation invariance. Wolf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proposed Three Patch LBP (TPLBP) and Four Patch LBP (FPLBP) using averaged patch difference magnitudes.</p><p>Increasing Discriminative Power: There are three primary strategies to improve discriminative power: reclassifying the original LBP patterns to form more discriminative clusters, exploring cooccurrences, and combining with other texture descriptors. Yang and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed Hamming LBP, which regroups nonuniform patterns based on Hamming distance instead of collecting them into a single bin. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed to learn discriminative rotation invariant patterns. Qi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> introduced Pairwise Rotation Invariant Cooccurrence LBP (PRICoLBP) which makes use of the cooccurrences of pairs of LBPs at certain relative displacements. Later on, Qi et al. proposed MultiScale Joint LBP (MSJLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> which also considers cooccurrences of LBPs, but from different scales. Ojala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed a local contrast descriptor VAR to combine with LBP. Liao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> suggested the combination of Gabor filters and LBP. Ahonen et al. proposed an effective LBP Fourier histogram (LBPHF) to achieve global rotation invariance. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> presented Completed LBP (CLBP) where the local differences are decomposed into signs and magnitudes. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> proposed to combine LBP and a new descriptor called Local Neighboring Intensity Relationship Pattern (LNIRP) based on a sampling structure which combines pixel and patch to mimic the retinal sampling grid. LNIRP is similar to the descriptor AD-LBP presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, but is based on second-order derivatives in the circular direction.</p><p>Enhancing Noise Robustness: Ahonen and Pietikänen introduced Soft LBP (SLBP) histograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, which enhances robustness by incorporating fuzzy membership in the representation of local texture primitives, and Iakovidis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> introduced Fuzzy LBP (FLBP), which allows multiple local binary patterns to be generated at each pixel position, both methods with a significant computational complexity. Ren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a much more efficient variant, the Noise Resistant LBP (NRLBP).</p><p>Tan and Triggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> introduced Local Ternary Patterns (LTP), which is more resistant to noise than LBP, but no longer strictly invariant to gray scale changes, and the selection of additional threshold values is not so simple. Liao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> introduced Dominant LBP (DLBP) to learn the most frequently occurred patterns to capture descriptive textural information, but which requires pretraining. Hafiane et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed Median Binary Pattern (MBP), where local binary patterns are determined by a localized thresholding against the local median. Ojansivu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed Local Phase Quantization (LPQ), claiming robustness to image blur. Fathi and Naghsh-Nilchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed Noise Tolerant LBP (NTLBP) where a circular majority voting filter and a new encoding strategy that regroups the nonuniform LBP patterns are presented, and Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed Robust LBP (RLBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> by changing the coding bit of LBP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ROBUST EXTENDED LOCAL BINARY PATTERN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Proposed RELBP</head><p>One drawback of the ELBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is that it is very vulnerable to image noise, therefore the first strategy is to replace individual pixel intensities at a point with some representation over a region.</p><p>Notable methods along these lines include BRIEF <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, BRISK <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and FREAK <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, where in all cases a binary descriptor vector is obtained by comparing the intensities of a number of pairs of pixels after applying a Gaussian smoothing to reduce the noise sensitivity. However these approaches are based on keypoint detection, followed by a characterization of each keypoint. The rotation and scale invariance property of BRISK and FREAK depends on the detection of local regions of interest and the estimation of the dominant orientations. Thus the methods are used in a sparse approach, like that of Lazebnik et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, where salient regions are described with multiple descriptors such as SIFT, RIFT and SPIN. However, such sparse approaches have been demonstrated to be very complex and have been shown to be outperformed by dense approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, upon which we are building in this paper.</p><p>We wish to consider the effect of replacing individual pixel gray values at sampled points with simple filter responses derived from source image patches centered on the sampling locations. The ELBP descriptor is now modified so that individual pixel intensities are replaced by a filter response φ(), as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. However for comparison purposes the surrounding experimental context is held consistent between RELBP and ELBP: Images are normalized to zero mean and unit variance; the standard ( riu2 ) encoding scheme can be used; and the joint histogramming of RELBP_CI, RELBP_NI riu2 r, p and RELBP_NI riu2 r, p is used to represent a texture image. This new descriptor is referred to as RELBP riu2 r, p . Formally, given a center pixel x c and a patch filter φ, the RELBP_CI, RELBP_NI and RELBP_RD descriptors are defined as follows:</p><p>1) Center pixel representation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">RELBP_CI(x c ) = s(φ(X c,w ) -μ w ) (7)</formula><p>the result of applying filter φ() to X c,w , the local patch of size w × w centered at the center pixel x c , and μ w denoting the mean of φ(X c,w ) over the whole image. 2) Neighbor representation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">RELBP_NI r, p (x c ) = p-1 n=0 s(φ(X r, p,w r ,n ) -μ r, p,w r )2 n μ r, p,w r = 1 p p-1 n=0 φ(X r, p,w r ,n ) (8)</formula><p>where X r, p,w r ,n denotes a patch of size w r ×w r centered on x r, p,n . 3) Radial difference representation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">RELBP_RD r,r-1, p,w r ,w r-1 (x c ) = p-1 n=0 s(φ(X r, p,w r ,n ) -φ(X r-1, p,w r-1 ,n ))2 n (9)</formula><p>where X r, p,w r ,n and X r-1, p,w r-1 ,n denote the patches centered at the neighboring pixels x r, p,n and x r-1, p,n respectively. {x r, p,n } p n=0 represents the circularly and evenly spaced neighbors of the center pixel x c at radius r . Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Overview of the proposed multiscale RELBP descriptor. An example for illustrating RELBP sampling pattern is given with their corresponding support areas. Each solid circle represents a support area over which a corresponding filter response is computed to replace the gray value of a single sampled point.

Clearly both the Gaussian and Averaged perform spatial averaging, and therefore noise reduction, however these methods are both linear, and therefore of only limited robustness, and will exhibit sensitivity to noise, particularly salt-andpepper or corrupted-pixel noise. Our preference is therefore with the robust, nonlinear choice to apply a median filter as φ(), to maximize the robustness of the representation to noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Encoding Scheme</head><p>In many LBP applications the rotation invariant uniform riu2 encoding scheme, defined in (3), has become standard. LBP riu2 r, p classifies all of the uniform LBPs into p + 1 rotation invariant groups and places all remaining nonuniform patterns into one single group. The rationale behind LBP riu2 r, p is that the uniform patterns occur much more frequently than nonuniform patterns in natural images <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Bianconi and Fernández <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> presented a theoretical study on the relative occurrence of LBP patterns and argued that the high probability of occurrence of uniform patterns is likely to be a consequence of the mathematical structure of the LBP method rather than an intrinsic property of real textures.</p><p>However, the widespread use of LBP riu2 r, p has been challenged <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, with the claim that the uniform LBPs do not necessarily represent the most significant pattern features for certain classes of textured images, and that grouping all nonuniform patterns into one group may unnecessarily result in a loss of information. As a result, different encoding methods have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> that attempt to explore additional information present in the nonuniform LBP patterns. To test the information relevance of the encoding schemes for texture classification, we will compare several different encoding schemes, including a new one proposed in this paper:</p><p>1) RELBP riu2 r, p : The traditional rotation invariant uniform encoding scheme defined in (3).</p><p>2) RELBP ri r, p : The traditional rotation invariant encoding method defined in (2).</p><p>3) RELBP ham r, p : The encoding approach proposed by Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, in which some nonuniform patterns are reclassified by minimizing a Hamming distance. 4) RELBP f aith r, p : The encoding scheme proposed by Fathi and Naghsh-Nilchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where all nonuniform patterns with four bitwise transitions (i.e. U = 4 in (3)) are classified based on the number of ones in the pattern, and the nonuniform patterns with U &gt; 4 are grouped by U value. 5) RELBP count r, p : The method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where all the LBP patterns are grouped into p + 1 different groups based on counting the number of ones. Based on our observations we propose a new scheme RELBP num r, p , first dividing all LBPs into uniform and nonuniform according to the uniformity measure. Then as in LBP riu2 r, p the uniform patterns are divided into p + 1 rotation invariant groups. Finally, as opposed to LBP riu2 r, p , we group the nonuniform pattern into p -3 different groups based on the number of ones in the pattern. An example illustrating our approach is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. MultiScale Analysis and Classification</head><p>Like most other LBP variants, by altering r and p we can realize operators for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution. A multiresolution analysis can therefore readily be accomplished by concatenating binary histograms from multiple resolutions into a single histogram.</p><p>We are proposing a multiscale sampling scheme, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The assumption of independence between  texture features from different scales does not hold, however the estimation of large joint probabilities is also not feasible due to the computational complexity of large multidimensional histograms. Therefore we propose to generate the histogram feature as the concatenation over multiple scales.</p><p>While this pattern resembles the DAISY <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, BRISK <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and FREAK <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, it is important to note that its use in MRELBP is entirely different, as they all applied Gaussian smoothing, DAISY <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> was built specifically for dense matching, and BRISK <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and FREAK <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> were designed for image matching. Finally, the parameters controlling the shape of such sampling pattern are different for all three descriptors RELBP, BRISK and FREAK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION</head><p>For the overall framework of the proposed approach, the actual classification is performed via the simple Nearest Neighbor Classifier (NNC), applied to the normalized MRELBP histogram feature vectors, using the χ 2 distance metric as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Furthermore, results obtained with a more sophisticated classifier -support vector machines (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, are also provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Image Data and Experimental Setup</head><p>We demonstrate the performance of our approach with three different problems of robust texture classification by conducting extensive experiments on a number of publicly available datasets, summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, derived from the four most commonly used texture sources: Outex <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, CUReT <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, UMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, KTHTIPS2b <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and ALOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>Experiment #1: Experiment #1 tests robustness to gray scale and rotation variations. Outex <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> contains a large collection of surface textures captured under different conditions, which facilitates construction of a wide range of texture analysis problems. By selecting 24 different homogeneous texture classes from the Outex database, Ojala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> created three test suites Outex_TC10, Outex_TC12_000 and Outex_TC12_001 (summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>) which have been widely used as benchmark datasets for the evaluation of rotation and illumination invariant texture classification approaches. In addition, we selected 108 different texture classes, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>, to create two more challenging test suites Outex_TC36_000 and Outex_TC36_001.</p><p>Experiment #2: Experiment #2 tests robustness to random noise corruption, including Gaussian noise, image blurring, salt-and-pepper noise, and random pixel corruption, the same noise types tested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. We use only the noise-free texture images for training and test on the noisy data, as summarized Experiment # 3: Experiment #3 is carried out to measure robustness to more complex environment changes, including variations in viewpoint, scaling, illumination and rotation, based on the CUReT, UMD, KTHTIPS2b and ALOT databases.</p><p>For the CUReT database we use the same subset of images which has been previously used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>: 61 texture classes each with 92 images under varying illumination direction but at a constant scale. It has been argued <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> that this scale constancy is a major drawback of CUReT, leading to KTHTIPS2b <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, with 3 viewing angles, 4 illuminants, and 9 different scales. The UMD database <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> consists of high resolution images, with arbitrary rotations, significant viewpoint changes and scale differences present. The ALOT dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> consists of 250 classes each of which has 100 samples. We resize images in ALOT to obtain lower resolution (384 × 256). ALOT is challenging as it represents a significantly larger number of classes (250) compared to UMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> and has very strong illumination change (8 levels of illumination). The viewpoint change is however less dramatic compared to UMD. For CUReT, UMD and ALOT, half of the class samples were selected at random for training and the remaining half for testing. For KTHTIPS2b, we follow the training and testing scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>: training on three samples and testing on the remainder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Methods in Comparison and Implementation Details</head><p>We will be performing comprehensive experimental comparisons of our approach with eleven recent state-of-the-art LBP variants. Unless otherwise specified the riu2 encoding and (r, p) parameters (1, 8) + (2, 16) + <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref> are used, which is the setting recommended by nearly all of the comparison methods.</p><p>1) ELBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>: The joint histogram of ELBP_CI, ELBP_NI riu2 r, p and ELBP_RD riu2 r, p .</p><p>2) LBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>: The traditional rotation invariant uniform feature LBP riu2 r, p proposed by Ojala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. 3) CLBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>: The joint histogram of CLBP_C, CLBP_S riu2 r, p and CLBP_M riu2 r, p . 4) LTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>: The recommended LTP riu2 r, p is used. LTP is claimed to be more robust to noise than LBP. 5) disCLBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>: Due to the high dimensionality of the descriptor at larger scales, we use a three-scale descriptor di s(S+M) ri r, p as recommended by the authors. 6) MBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>: We implemented a multiscale MBP riu2 r, p descriptor ((1, 8) + (2, 16) + (3, 24)), although Hafiane et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> only examined the first scale (r, p) = (1, 8) in their original paper. 7) NRLBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>: We implemented a multiresolution NRLBP riu2 r, p descriptor, although Ren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> only evaluated the first scale in their original paper. The number of neighboring points p is held fixed at 8 for each radius r , because the extraction of the NRLBP feature requires a large lookup table of size 3 p . 8) NTLBP faith r, p,k <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>: Implemented in a multiscale form NTLBP faith r, p,k 4 as suggested by the authors. Parameter k acts as the size of kernel in the filter, controlling the number of noisy bits that should be filtered, which is set to 1, 3 and 4 for p = 8, 16 and 24, respectively, as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. 9) PRICoLBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>: The multiscale and multiorientation PRICoLBP g descriptor is used, with parameters as recommended by the authors. 10) MSJLBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>: The multiscale joint encoding of LBP proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, similar to PRICoLBP. Following the authors, (r, p) of (1, 8), <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref> is used. 11) COV-LBPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>: The approach by combining LBP difference and feature correlation. Each texture sample is preprocessed, normalized to zero mean and unit standard deviation. For the CUReT, UMD and KTHTIPS2b databases, all results are reported over 100 random partitionings of training and testing sets. For SVM classification, we use the publicly available LibSVM library <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The parameters C and γ are searched exponentially in the ranges of 2 -5 , 2 18   with a step size of 2 1 to probe the highest classification rate; in our experiments setting C = 10 6 and γ = 0.01 give very good performance. For ELBP, LBP, CLBP, disCLBP, PRICoLBP g and COV-LBPD, we use the code provided by the original authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Experimental Tests</head><p>We wish to test the proposed method from seven different perspectives: gray scale invariance, rotation invariance, multiscale analysis, template setting, discriminative power, noise robustness, and encoding strategy. 1) Regional vs. Pointwise: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref> presents the results for the three test suites Outex_TC10, Outex_TC12_000 and Outex_TC12_001 in detail, comparing the proposed regional/ multiscale MRELBP with pointwise ELBP. The results of LBP are included as a baseline.</p><p>Firstly, the proposed MRELBP_RD riu2 r,8 improves the performance over ELBP_RD riu2 r,8 considerably, with the lone exception at <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, where the drop of performance may be due to too much overlapping of the sampling pattern near the center. The proposed MRELBP_NI riu2 r,8 also improved the performance in general, but not so significantly as MRELBP_RD riu2 r,8 . The joint descriptor MRELBP riu2 r,8 proved to be much more powerful and significantly outperformed ELBP riu2 r,8 . Secondly, the use of multiscale offers significant improvements over single-scale analysis. The striking performance of multiscale MRELBP riu2 r, p for the classification of texture with great illumination and rotation changes clearly demonstrates that the concatenated marginal joint distributions of MRELBP_CI, MRELBP_NI riu2 r, p and MRELBP_RD riu2 r, p turns out to be a very powerful representation of image texture and to be robust to gray scale and rotation variations. These results firmly demonstrate that the approach is making effective use of microstructure and the interactions between more distant pixels. Therefore, in all further experiments we will only report multiscale results.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref> presents the multiscale results for all three proposed descriptors GRELBP, ARELBP and MRELBP, in comparison with ELBP and LBP. For the parameter pair (r, p), we tested the commonly employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref> [6], <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> versus a fixed p = 8 at all scales. Although the higher dimensionality of the former scheme offered improved results for some of the individual descriptors, the joint descriptors all perform similarly under both settings, and all give very high classification scores on the three Outex test suites.</p><p>However because the feature dimensionality of the proposed RELBP riu2 r, p at a single resolution is 2( p + 2)( p + 2), the former, higher-dimensional scheme results in a feature dimensionality of 3552, whereas a fixed p = 8 corresponds to a much lower dimensionality of only 800. Therefore, considering the similar classification performance given by the two schemes, we propose to fix the the number of sampling neighbors to p = 8 at each scale in our remaining experiments.</p><p>2) GRELBP vs. ARELBP vs. MRELBP: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref> shows the noise robustness performance given the four noise types described in Section IV-A. It is very clear that the nonlinear, robust behaviour of the median filter leads MRELBP to be the clear winner in noise robustness, particularly in the cases of Salt-and-Pepper noise and random pixel corruption. The classification results are particularly impressive keeping in mind that the training images were all noise-free.</p><p>Based on the striking noise robustness results, the MRELBP strategy performs by far the best, and therefore it is our proposed choice for further evaluation.</p><p>3) Template Setting: The main parameters involved in the proposed MRELBP descriptor are the sampling radii r , the size of the center patch w c × w c , and the size of the neighboring  patches w r × w r associated with radius r . We refer to a multiscale sampling scheme for MRELBP as a template, and we will examine the performance of MRELBP under different template settings. We present the nine templates settings and the corresponding results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">V</ref>. The nine templates were chosen following the methods of BRISK <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and FREAK <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Template 1 is the default, as was the parameter choice used in previous experiments.</p><p>In order to avoid aliasing effects when sampling the image, the patch size w r × w r associated with the median operator is set to be proportional to radius r . Template 2, with a slight increase in radius over template 1, produces the highest classification score in noise-free situations and gives high classification accuracies in noisy situations. The larger scales have much to offer, since the more local sampling of Template 4 performs the worst; clearly there is a limit to the utility of nonlocal information, since template 5 at 8 scales does not offer any improvement.</p><p>Templates 6 through 9 assess the choice of parameter w r . It is fairly clear from Table V that larger patches lead to improved noise robustness, but at a cost of reduced  performance in noise-free contexts. Furthermore using larger patches increases the algorithm's computational complexity. We would maintain that the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">V</ref> argue in favour of Template 2, which we will use in the remainder of our experiments. 4) Encoding Methods: Six different encoding strategies were discussed in Section III-B; the corresponding experimental results are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">VI</ref>. All six methods show relatively similar performance, with slightly higher performance from MRELBP f aith , our proposed MRELBP num , and MRELBP riu2 . Because of the rather higher dimensionality of faith over num, and the poorer performance of riu2 in noisy settings, we have a preference for the num encoding, but will continue to test the riu2 encoding for consistency with other proposed approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparative Evaluation</head><p>In this section, to avoid tuning parameters and to preserve consistency, all results for the proposed MRELBP riu2 r, p and MRELBP num r, p are obtained with the four-scale Template 2 from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">V</ref>).</p><p>1) Results for Experiment #1: Table VII compares the classification performance of the proposed MRELBP riu2 r, p and MRELBP num r, p descriptor with those of fifteen recent state of the art LBP variants on the three Outex benchmark test suites. We can observe that our MRELBP approach performs significantly and consistently better than all 15 methods in comparison. The striking performance of MRELBP clearly demonstrates that the concatenated joint distributions of the proposed MRELBP_CI, MRELBP_NI and MRELBP_RD codes and the novel sampling scheme turns out to be a very powerful representation of image texture, making effective use     For instance, preprocessing always decreases the performance in the case of Gaussian blur. Therefore, the noise robustness inherent in our proposed MRELBP is clearly an attractive advantage.</p><p>Results in Table XII further confirm the noise robustness of the proposed MRELBP, emphasizing that no pre-smoothing is necessary. The absence of spatial smoothing is a significant advantage for MRELBP, as local spatial information is important for texture recognition, whereas pre-smoothing can suppress important local texture information, a serious drawback for texture recognition in low-noise situations.</p><p>3) Results for Experiment #3: A final experiment tests the generalizability of MRELBP to textures other than those present in the Outex database. The datasets we tested include CUReT, UMD, KTHTIPS2b and ALOT, discussed in Section IV-A, with results shown in Tables XIII (KTHTIPS2b), XV (CUReT), XIV (UMD) and XVI (ALOT).</p><p>The CUReT database has only small rotation variations, whereas our proposed MRELBP has a strong rotation invariance property, nevertheless from Table XV we can see that the proposed MRELBP with SVM produces the highest classification score on CUReT despite the fact that we have no pretraining step, in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.  Table XIV lists the results on the UMD database, which contains significant variations in scale and rotation. We can observe that our MRELBP performs very well, producing the highest score. Similarly the results in Table XIII reveal that MRELBP significantly outperforms many state of the art methods on the difficult KTHTIPS2b database. Finally, the results on the large scale ALOT dataset, listed in XVI, demonstrate that MRELBP performs the best. We would like to mention that a recent LBP based approach named Pattern Fractal Spectrum (PFS) proposed by Quan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> gives 97.5% classification accuracy with RBF kernel SVM classifier on ALOT. Our MRELBP can produce 99.08% on ALOT with SVM classifier.</p><p>Finally, the proposed MRELBP descriptor has a modest computational cost. In comparison with the traditional multiscale LBP riu2 r,p , our MRELBP is somewhat slower. However, the computational complexity of MRELBP is much lower than many existing LBP variants. As a matter of fact, in the feature extraction stage MRELBP has a similar computational cost as traditional multiscale LBP, except for the computation of local medians in MRELBP, which is fast, however in practice we use fewer neighbors for MRELBP than in many other LBP variants. In the classification stage, the feature dimensionality of MRELBP (800) is moderate compared with various LBP variants, so MRELBP is efficient as a texture descriptor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented a novel MRELBP descriptor to enhance the performance of current LBP variants. It outperforms recent state of the art LBP type descriptors in noise free situations and demonstrates striking robustness to image noise including Gaussian white noise, Gaussian blur, Salt-and-Pepper and pixel corruption. The proposed MRELBP has attractive properties of strong discriminativeness, gray scale and rotation invariance, no need for a pretraining, no tuning of parameters, and computational efficiency. As future work, we wish to investigate high-level applications such as image patching and object recognition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_10"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>We conducted extensive experiments to test the noise robustness of our approach, using the test suites we described in Section IV-A. The test results are shown in Tables IX, X, and XI. The results are all consistently strong: the proposed MRELBP descriptors have exceptional noise tolerance that could not be matched by any of the state of the art LBP variants. There are difficult noise levels where the proposed approach still offers strong performance, but where not a single state-of-the-art method delivers acceptable results.Finally, TableXIIillustrates the effect of introducing a median preprocessing filter, contrasting results with and without preprocessing. It is clearly observed that our proposed MRELBP outperforms all other LBP variants consistently and significantly, no matter with or without preprocessing. The results in TableXIIshow that preprocessing (with a median filter here) does not necessarily improve the noise robustness.</figDesc><table><row><cell>TABLE XI</cell></row><row><cell>CLASSIFICATION SCORES (%) FOR VARIOUS METHODS ON Outex_TC11c AND Outex_TC23c</cell></row><row><cell>and Outex_TC36_001, which have 108 texture classes.
