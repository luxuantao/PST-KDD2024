<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While network densification is considered an important solution to cater the ever-increasing capacity demand, its effect on the handover (HO) rate is overlooked. In dense 5G networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the gains offered by network densification. Hence, user mobility imposes a nontrivial challenge to harvest capacity gains via network densification. In this paper, we propose a velocityaware HO management scheme for two-tier downlink cellular network to mitigate the HO effect on the foreseen densification throughput gains. The proposed HO scheme sacrifices the best base station (BS) connectivity, by skipping HO to some BSs along the user trajectory, to maintain longer connection durations and reduce HO rates. Furthermore, the proposed scheme enables cooperative BS service and strongest interference cancellation to compensate for skipping the best connectivity. To this end, we consider different HO skipping scenarios and develop a velocityaware mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the proposed HO schemes in terms of the coverage probability and user throughput. The results highlight the HO rate problem in dense cellular environments and show the importance of the proposed HO schemes. Finally, the value of BS cooperation along with handover skipping is quantified for different user mobility profiles.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION</head><p>N ETWORK densification is a potential solution to cater the increasing traffic demands and is expected to have a major contribution in fulfilling the ambitious 1000-fold capacity improvements required for next generation 5G cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Network densification improves the spatial frequency reuse by shrinking the base stations' (BS) footprints to increase the delivered spatial spectral efficiency. Densifying the network decreases the load served by each BS, and hence, increases the per user throughput. However, such improvement comes at the expense of increased handover (HO) rates for mobile users. Mobile users change their BS associations more frequently in a denser network environment, due to the reduced BSs' footprints, to maintain the best connectivity. The HO procedure involves signaling between the mobile user, serving BS, target BS, and the core network, which consumes physical Rabe Arshad is with the Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Saudi Arabia.

In modern cellular environments, high mobility and dense deployment of BSs are not mutually exclusive (e.g. monorails in downtowns), which may lead to service failures due to small dwell times within each BS footprint. Such problem will become more prominent in the foreseen ultra-dense cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The HO rate is an important key performance indicator (KPI) for cellular operators, thus minimizing HO delay and unnecessary HOs is a focal research point in the context of mobility management <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> present an handover management algorithm based on Ant Colony to reduce unnecessary HOs and radio link failures in femto cellular networks. Another handover management algorithm to avoid unnecessary HOs is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for a typical two tier cellular network and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for cloud-RAN based multitier networks. A HO management technique, based on self organizing maps is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to reduce unnecessary HOs for indoor users in two tier cellular networks. However, none of the aforementioned references study the interplay between HO delay and BS intensity or the effect of HO delay on the user throughput.</p><p>Motivated by the importance of network densification and the significance of the HO problem, several researchers started to exploit stochastic geometry to characterize, understand, and solve the HO problem in dense cellular networks. Stochastic geometry is a powerful mathematical tool that has shown success to characterize the performance of cellular networks with stationary users <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Using stochastic geometry, the handover rate in cellular networks is characterized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for a single tier cellular network with the random waypoint mobility model and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for a multi-tier cellular network with an arbitrary mobility model. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> focus only on the HO rate and do not investigate the effect of HO on the throughput. Stochastic geometry models that incorporate handover effect into throughput analysis can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, none of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> propose a solution to the excessive HO rate problem. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, propose control plane and user plane split architecture with macro BS anchoring to mitigate the handover effect in dense cellular environment and quantified the performance gain via stochastic geometry. However, the solution proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is not compatible with the current cellular networks and requires massive architectural upgrade to the network.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective velocity aware handover management scheme in a two-tier cellular network that is compatible with the current cellular archi-tecture. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The proposed scheme, denoted as HO skipping, bypasses association with some BSs along the user trajectory to maintain a longer service duration with serving BSs and reduce the HO rate and its associated signaling. In other words, the proposed HO skipping scheme sacrifices the best signalto-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) association to alleviate excessive HO rate and mitigate the handover effect. The proposed scheme also employs interference cancellation (IC) and cooperative BS service, via coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, when the user is not associated to the BS offering the best SINR. When the user decides to skip the best SINR association, denoted as blackout phase, the user is simultaneously served by the BSs that offer the second and third best SINR associations via non-coherent transmission. It is worth mentioning that the non-coherent transmission is considered as it may be hard to estimate the channel state information (CSI) in the considered high mobility scenarios.</p><p>The performance gain of the proposed HO skipping scheme is quantified using stochastic geometry, in which the cellular network is assumed to be spatially deployed according to a Poisson point process (PPP). The PPP assumption is widely accepted for modeling cellular networks and has been verified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> by several empirical studies. To this end, we derive mathematical expressions for the coverage probabilities and the average throughput for the proposed HO skipping schemes. The results manifest the HO problem in dense cellular environments when employing the conventional HO scheme (i.e., best SINR association). Compared to the always best SINR connectivity, the proposed HO schemes show some degradation in the overall coverage probability, but tangible gains are achieved in terms of average throughput.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the system model and propose HO skipping strategies. Coverage probabilities, HO rates and average throughput are analyzed in Section III, IV, and V, respectively. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>We consider a two-tier downlink cellular network with CoMP transmission between BSs belonging to the same or different tiers. It is assumed that the BSs belonging to the k th tier have same transmit power P k , bias factor<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> B k , and are spatially distributed via a two-dimensional homogenous PPP Φ k with intensity λ k , k ∈ {1, 2}. The macro and femto cell tiers are denoted by k = 1 and k = 2, respectively. A power-law path-loss model with path loss exponent η &gt; 2 is considered. For simplicity, we consider the same path loss exponents for the two tiers (i.e. η 1 = η 2 = η). Extensions to different path-loss exponents is straightforward, but comes at the expense of more involved expressions. In addition to path loss, the channel introduces multi-path fading, which is assumed to be Rayleigh distributed with unit power i.e. h ∼ exp <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Without loss of generality, we conduct our analysis on a test user and assume that all BSs in Φ 1 and Φ 2 are ascendingly ordered according to their distances from that user. Let R i and r i be the distances from the test user to the i th BS in Φ 1 and Φ 2 , respectively, then the inequalities (R 1 &lt; R 2 &lt; ....) and (r 1 &lt; r 2 &lt; ....) always hold. We consider a universal frequency reuse scheme and study the performance of one frequency channel. Hence, the best received signal strength (RSS) association implies the best SINR association. A list of key mathematical notations used in this paper is given in table I. The probability that the femto BS provides the best SINR</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. User Mobility and Handover Strategies</head><p>In the depicted system model, the association regions for the BSs can be visualized via a weighted voronoi tessellation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which is widely considered in literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). The conventional scheme executes a HO every time the user crosses a voronoi cell boundary to ensure that the best SINR association is always satisfied. We assume that the test user moves with a constant velocity v on an arbitrary long trajectory <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> that passes through all association and SINR states. The average SINR through a randomly selected user trajectory is inferred from the stationary PPP analysis. It is worth noting that a similar assumption was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for tractability. However, we incorporate user mobility in the simulations and verify the accuracy of the stationary SINR analysis for mobile users. This implies that averaging over all users' trajectories in all network realizations is equivalent to averaging over all users' locations in all network realizations.</p><p>We propose multiple HO skipping strategies that show throughput gains over different user mobility profiles. Particularly, we consider four HO strategies, which represent user mobility profiles ranging from nomadic to high velocities. Mobile users maintain a list of nearby BSs based on the RSS  levels and report to the core network through the serving BS. In some cases, HO decisions are made on the radio network level based on the HO type. However, in all cases, the HOs are directed by the network entities, which have the capabilities to track the user location and velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>According to the employed HO strategy, the admission controller can help users skip the recommended HOs based on their velocities. BS skipping sacrifices the best SINR connectivity to reduce the handover rate and delay. In order to compensate for the degraded SINR during blackout phases, we enable BS cooperation and IC. For the IC, the interfering signal from the skipped BS is detected, demodulated, decoded and then subtracted from the received signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we propose the following HO strategies for the mobile users.</p><p>1) Best Connected Strategy (BC): In the best connected strategy, the admission controller ensures that the biased RSS based association is always satisfied for each HO request received from the mobile station. That is, the user is connected to the nearest macro BS if</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P 1 B 1 R -η 1 &gt; P 2 B 2 r -η 1 is satisfied and to the nearest femto BS if P 1 B 1 R -η 1 &lt; P 2 B 2 r -η 1 is satisfied.</formula><p>For the user trajectory shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), the best connected strategy enforces 6 HOs when the user moves from BS A to G through BSs {B, C, D, E, F}.</p><p>2) Femto Skipping Strategy (FS): In the femto skipping strategy, we propose that the user skips some of the femto BSs along its trajectory, when</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P 1 B 1 R -η 1 &lt; P 2 B 2 r -η 1 is</formula><p>satisfied, to reduce the handover rate. In particular, the user can alternate between the best connectivity and skipping of the femto BSs along its trajectory. During the femto blackout phase, BS cooperation is enabled, which can be intra or intertier cooperative BS transmission depending on the relative positions of the BSs along the user trajectory. For the user trajectory shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), the FS strategy involves 5 HOs (i.e., {C, D, E, F, G}) in moving from BS A to G. Also, the user is jointly served by the BSs {A, C} while skipping BS B.</p><p>3) Femto Disregard Strategy (FD): At high mobility profiles, the cell dwell time within the femto BS coverage area may be too small. Hence, we propose the femto disregard strategy where the user skips HOs to the entire femto tier while enabling the cooperative service between the two strongest macros in blackout. This states that the user connects to the nearest macro BS if</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P 1 B 1 R η 1 &gt; P 2 B 2 r -η 1</formula><p>and to the first and the second strongest macros, otherwise.</p><p>For the user trajectory shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), the FD strategy offers 4 HOs (i.e., {D, E, F, G}) and the joint transmission between the BSs {A, D} is enabled while skipping of the BSs {B, C}.</p><p>4) Macro Skipping Strategy (MS) : At extremely high velocities, the cell dwell time within the macro BS area may become too small. In this case, in addition to the femto disregard, the user may skip some macro BSs along its trajectory. Particularly, the user alternates between the macro best connectivity and macro blackout phases, where macro BS cooperation in enabled in the macro blackout phase. That is, the user spends 50% of the time in macro best connected mode and rest 50% in the macro blackout mode. For the user trajectory shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), the MS strategy enforces only 2 HOs (i.e., {E, G}) and cooperation is enabled between the BSs {A, E} and {E, G} while skipping of the macro BSs D and F, respectively.</p><p>It is worth noting that the velocity ranges for each of the aforementioned skipping scheme are selected offline since they are based on the underlying BS intensity and per-BS HO delay. On the contrary, the selection of the skipped/non-skipped BSs is executed in real-time, which is facilitated by the prolonged association time offered by the proposed skipping algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Methodology of Analysis</head><p>We assume that no data is transmitted during HO execution and that the HO duration is dedicated for exchanging control signaling between the serving BS, target BS, and the core network. We consider different backhauling schemes that impose different HO and signaling delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In all cases, the achievable rate is calculated over the time interval over which only data can be transmitted. For each of the aforementioned HO skipping strategies, we show the imposed tradeoff between coverage probability and throughput. For the sake of an organized presentation, we show the analysis for each HO strategy in a separate section. In the analysis of each strategy, we first derive the distance distribution between the user and its serving BS(s) as well as the Laplace transform (LT) of the aggregate interference PDF, which are then used to obtain the coverage probability and achievable rate. As discussed earlier, the coverage probabilities and achievable rates are obtained based on the stationary analysis and are verified via simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DISTANCE ANALYSIS AND COVERAGE PROBABILITY</head><p>In this section, we first calculate the service distance distributions for the aforementioned HO skipping cases, which are subsequently used to obtain the coverage probabilities in each case. Note that the service distance distribution for each HO skipping case is different due to different serving BS(s) in each case. For the sake of an organized presentation, we perform case by case analysis. At the end of this section, we validate the stationary analysis via simulations that account for user mobility for all HO skipping scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Best Connected Strategy (BC)</head><p>In the best connectivity case, the user associates with the BS that provides the highest power. Thus the user changes its association when it crosses the boundary of the neighboring cell. The always best connected case has been considerably analyzed in the literature. Here, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and write the distribution of the distances between the user and its serving macro and femto BSs in a two tier network, which is given by the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 1 (Distance distributions in BC case): In a two tier cellular network, the distance distribution between the user and its serving macro BS is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f (BC) R 1 (R) = 2πλ1R A (BC) m exp -πR 2 λ1 + λ2 β21P2 P1 2/η ;<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 0 ≤ R ≤ ∞.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Femto Skipping Strategy (FS)</head><p>In the femto skipping case, the test user associates with the macro BS based on the highest RSS. However, the user skips some femto BS associations to reduce excessive HO rate, where the user experience blackout during femto skipping. In the blackout phase, the user is simultaneously served by the second and the third strongest BSs via non-coherent CoMP transmission. The cooperating BSs can be both macros, both femtos, or one macro and one femto. We assume that the user alternates between the femto best connected and femto blackout phases. The service distance distributions for the best connectivity associations (i.e., non-blackout) in FS scheme are similar to that of BC scheme given in (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_24">) i.e. f (F S) R1 = f (BC) R1 and f (F S) r1 = f (BC) r1</formula><p>. However, in the blackout case, the distance distributions are different and have to be derived for each pair of cooperating base stations (i.e. macro and macro, femto and femto, macro and femto). Furthermore, the coverage probability in the blackout case is different for each of the cooperating BSs case and the probability of each cooperation event should be calculated to obtain the total coverage probability.

Consequently, the good match between the analysis and simulations validates our model. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) shows the cost of HO skipping from the coverage probability perspective. That is, sacrificing the best SINR connectivity degrades the coverage probabilities even with BS cooperation. Such coverage probability degradation can be mitigated via IC as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b</ref>). For instance, employing BS cooperation and IC, the coverage probability for the FS scheme is almost similar to the BS scheme. Although the proposed HO schemes degrade the coverage probability, they offer tangible improvements to the average throughput due to decrease in the the HO rate as shown in the next sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. HANDOVER COST</head><p>In this section, we encompass user mobility effect and compute handover rates and cost for each HO skipping scheme. We define HO cost D HO as the normalized average time wasted during the execution of HOs. While handover delay is for each handoff, the handover cost averages and normalizes the handover delays over the entire user trajectory. Thus, HO is the fraction of time where no data (i.e., control only) is transmitted to the test user. Note that the HO cost is different for each HO scheme due to different employed skipping strategies. Let d ij be the delay per i to j handover and H ij be the number of HOs from tier i to j per unit time, then D HO can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">DHO = K i K j Hij * dij. (<label>67</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_104">)</formula><p>where K is the number of network tiers, which is 2 in our case. Also, we use d m and d f to denote macro-to-macro HO   delay and all femto related HO delays, respectively 4 .

USER THROUGHPUT In this section, we derive an expression for the user throughput, which is applicable to all HO skipping cases. In order to calculate the throughput, we need to omit the HO execution period. Thus the average throughput (AT) can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_113">AT = W R(1 -DHO). (<label>73</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_114">)</formula><p>where W is the overall bandwidth of the channel and R is the achievable rate per unit bandwidth (i.e., nats/sec/Hz), which can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_115">R = ln(1 + T )P[SIN R &gt; T ].<label>(74)</label></formula><p>By performing the numerical evaluation for achievable rate per unit bandwidth in each case, we get R in nats/sec/Hz as shown in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">II</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Design Insights</head><p>We first study the negative impact of HO on the user's average throughput and highlight the velocity ranges over which the proposed HO schemes outperform the legacy best connected HO strategy. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows a linear decay in the user throughput with velocity, which can be mitigated by the proposed HO skipping schemes. Similar performance behavior can be observed for highest SINR association in Figs. <ref type="figure">4(a</ref>) and 4(b) as well as for biassed SINR association in Figs. <ref type="figure">4(c</ref>) and 4(d). Nevertheless, the gains provided by the proposed HO schemes are higher and occur at lower speeds for the case of biased association. This is because small cell edge users intrinsically experience blackout due to biasing, since the interfering macro BS signal is higher than the intended small BS signal. In all cases, the effective velocity ranges for each HO strategy is determined by the intersection points between the average throughput curves. For instance, once the user velocity exceeds 100 km/h, the femto skipping (FS) strategy provides more than 11% gains in the average throughput without biasing and 20% gains with biasing as compared to the best connected associations. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive HO skipping results show up to 77% gains in the average throughput as compared to the best connected association for the user velocity ranging from 80 km/h to 200 km/h. However, it is worth noting that the cases FS and FD show gains in the average throughput at medium and high velocity ranges, respectively. Also, we can observe that the skipping of macros in a two tier network outperforms the RSS based association at very high user velocities.</p><p>To see the overall gain of network densification, we consider its positive and negative impacts on user throughput. From one side, increasing the BS intensity decreases the number of users associated to each BS, which increases the share each user gets from the BS resources. From the other side, increasing the BS intensity aggravates the handover cost. This tradeoff is highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> by plotting the average throughput versus the BS intensity. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> are obtained by assuming stationary users modeled via a homogeneous PPP of intensity λ u , utilizing the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr">Corollary 2]</ref> to evaluate the average number of users served by each BS, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Equation 12]</ref> to calculate the average throughput per user assuming equal sharing among the users (including the test mobile user) for the resources in each BS. The figure shows that there is a turning point at which the handover cost dominates the performance such that densification degrades the user throughput. The figure also highlights the potential of FS HO strategy to extend the densification gain to higher BS intensities and user velocities. The FS HO scheme is particularly selected for the comparison in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> because it outperforms the other schemes at the considered low user APPENDIX A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposes user velocity aware HO skipping schemes for two tier cellular network to enhance the average rate for mobile users. We develop an analytical paradigm to model the performance of the proposed cooperative HO skipping schemes in order to study the effect of HO delay on the user rate. The developed mathematical model is based on stochastic geometry and is validated via Monte Carlo simulations. The results manifest the negative impact of HO on the users' rate in dense cellular networks and emphasize the potential of the proposed HO schemes to mitigate such negative HO impact. Particularly, the results show up to 77% more rate gains, which can be harvested via the proposed HO schemes when compared to the conventional HO scheme that always maintains the best RSS association. For future work, we will extend our study towards location aware HO skipping. Thus, we will propose HO skipping based on user trajectory, which will maximize the gains while meeting the quality of service requirements.</p></div>			</div>
