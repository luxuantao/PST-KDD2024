<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>O VARIAN follicles are spherical fluid-filled structures, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The internal fluid-containing region, the antrum, is enclosed by the follicle wall. The inner border of the follicle wall is at the granulosa cell-antrum interface, while the outer border is at the junction of the thecal cell layer and the ovarian connective tissue. There are two phases in the ovarian cycle: the follicular phase and the luteal phase. During the follicular phase, a small cohort of follicles (approximately 10-14) begins to develop. One member of this group is physiologically selected to ovulate, exhibiting greatly increased hormonal activity, increasing its growth. The others, lacking hormonal support, undergo atresia. It is now known that follicles which are destined to ovulate display different image characteristics than those follicles destined to atresia and that these characteristics are observable days before physiologic selection occurs. Identification of the follicle wall is useful in the characterization of the follicles of a cohort. For women undergoing assisted reproductive therapy, ovarian ultrasound has become an invaluable tool for monitoring the growth and assessing the physiological status of individual follicles. Consequently, ovarian ultrasound has become an effective tool in infertility management. Repeated measurements of the follicular size over several days are the primary means of evaluation by physicians and accurate folliculometry is essential for safe and effective infertility treatment. Currently, follicle wall segmentation is achieved by manual tracing which is time consuming and susceptible to inter-operator variation.</p><p>Ovarian ultrasound images show planar sections through the follicles, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>. The distinct follicle wall inner border and the faint outer border expert tracings are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b</ref>). The follicle wall signal intensity and echotexture of the fluid within the follicle is indicative of the fate of a particular follicle. The walls of follicles that are destined to ovulate are thinner and have a higher ultrasonographic signal intensity than follicles destined to atresia. Furthermore, the fluid echotexture of follicles destined to ovulate is smooth and even. Follicles destined to atresia display fluid echotexture that is more rough.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of follicle morphology is one of the primary goals of transvaginal ultrasound imaging. Frequently, the follicle measurements include following a follicle cohort or a single follicle over time. Research was first performed on animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> demonstrating a correlation between follicular size and the mean increase in oestradiol concentration during the follicular phase. Initially, the quantitative analyses were performed manually <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Because of the tedious and 0278-0062/98$10.00 Â© 1998 IEEE time-consuming nature of manual follicle segmentation, an automated, computer-based method is desirable.</p><p>Ultrasound images are characterized by specular reflections and edge information which is weak and discontinuous. Therefore, traditional edge detection techniques are susceptible to spurious responses when applied to ultrasound imagery. Consequently, computer-assisted approaches to follicle image analysis are rare. Pierson et al. utilize computer analysis of three-dimensional (3-D) images generated using manual tracing the outer follicle wall border as the first step <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Muzzolini et al. segmented follicular ultrasound images on the basis of texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, visual examination shows that the texture in an ultrasonographic image of the ovary changes very little (if at all) across the outer boundary of the follicle wall. Later, Singh et al. developed a computer-assisted method for quantitative analysis of echo-texture and demonstrated its utility to estimate luteal and plasma progesterone content and histomorphological characteristics of the corpus luteum <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Our earlier follicle segmentation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> showed that detection of the outer follicle wall border is possible when manually traced inner wall border is provided. The need for frequent manual tracing of the inner wall however presented a clear drawback of this approach.</p><p>Therefore, the primary goal of this project was to develop a method for highly automated analysis of follicles in ovarian ultrasound images to facilitate quantitative analysis of follicle status. The automated follicle segmentation method reported here is a multistep process which employs watershed segmentation and graph search to achieve inner and outer border detection. This method utilizes a priori information about follicle wall structure for detection of the strong follicle wall inner border and weaker follicle wall outer border.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHOD</head><p>The design of the image processing steps was motivated by the observation that the follicle interior regions are notably darker than the rest of the ultrasound image area. Therefore, watershed segmentation was selected and applied to smoothed image data. A consequence of working in smoothed images is loss of small-scale detail, in our case resulting in merging of small adjacent follicles. Therefore, binary mathematical morphology was employed to separate such areas using the information about presence of bottle-necks in the region contours. The choice of edge-based graph-search border detection was warranted by our success with this approach in our previously reported semi-automated follicle segmentation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The automated technique of follicle wall inner and outer border detection involves the following four steps: 1) watershed segmentation;</p><p>2) interactive selection of the follicle of interest; 3) inner border detection; 4) outer border detection. Watershed segmentation is used to approximate the inner borders of all the follicles of the cohort. After interactive follicle selection (one mouse click), the approximate inner border determined by watersheds is used to automatically define a region of interest (ROI) for inner border graph search. The resulting inner border is then used to guide the search for the outer border. A detailed explanation of the highly automated method follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Inner Border Approximation by Watersheds</head><p>Identification of the inner border of the follicle leads to the isolation of the antrum from the rest of the ultrasound image. If we think of the gray levels of an image as corresponding to the elevations in a topographical surface, then the problem of inner border detection can be approached in a more intuitive manner. Because the antrum is characteristically dark in intensity, its segmentation can be related to the isolation of the deepest valleys, or catchment basins, of this topographical surface. Watersheds are crestlines which separate the many catchment  basins of a given surface. The watershed transformation is effective in locating these crestlines <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Automatic detection of the approximate inner follicle border is performed in the following steps: 1) Preprocessing of the original image, 2) grayscale image segmentation by the watershed transformation, 3) binary image segmentation by the watershed transformation, and 4) post-processing of the resulting label image.</p><p>In addition to automated inner border detection of the follicle of interest, watershed segmentation is useful in approximating the inner borders for all the follicles of the cohort. This becomes important for locating adjacent follicles which could distract the outer border graph search (Section II-D).</p><p>1) Preprocessing: Because a significant portion of the original image contains no follicle data, a subimage is extracted from the 640 480 input image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The watershed transformation can be sensitive to sporadic changes in image intensity, therefore the cropped image is smoothed using the following adaptive neighborhood smoothing technique. Since the antrum (interior) region of the follicles has intensities which are consistently below a determined gray level , for pixels less than the set threshold a large kernel is used and a small kernel is used for pixels above . Determination of the value of is sufficiently robust, unaffected by image variations from subject to subject. The smoothing step is repeated twice. This ensures that the lowintensity catchment basins are smoothed more thoroughly that the high-intensity dam areas.</p><p>2) Watershed Segmentation of Grayscale Images: Many watershed segmentation approaches exist. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, a watershed transformation was introduced in the context of mathematical morphology. Unfortunately, without special hardware, watershed transformations based on mathematical morphology are computationally demanding and therefore time consuming. The seminal watershed segmentation algorithm of Vincent and Soille that made this segmentation approach practical involves a sorting step followed by an iterative immersion step for identification of individual catchment basins and their corresponding watershed lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In our case, watersheds are located in the area of greatest changes in gray level which correspond to the maxima in the gradient image. Imagine that there is a hole in each local minimum of the gradient image and that the (topographical) edge image surface is immersed in water. As a result, the water starts filling all catchment basins, minima of which are under the water level. If two catchment basins would merge as a result of further immersion, a dam is built all the way to the highest surface altitude and the dam represents the watershed line. We implemented the efficient algorithm for watershed segmentation as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The algorithm is based on sorting the pixels in increasing order of their gray values followed by a flooding step consisting of a fast breadth-first scanning of all pixels in the order of their gray levels.</p><p>The steps for the isolation of the follicle inner border by the watershed transform are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The edge image resulting from application of the 3 3 Sobel operator is used as input to the watershed algorithm. After the pixels are first sorted by the quicksort algorithm, the iterative immersion procedure results in a labeled image of unique catchment basins and watershed lines.</p><p>Because watersheds often result in over-segmentation, additional processing is necessary to achieve the final segmentation. Using the labeled regions resulting from the watershed transformation, a mosaic image is then computed by assigning the average of the pixels (from the smoothed image) to each corresponding region. Because the atrum of the follicle is characteristically dark, it can be segmented by thresholding the resulting mosaic image. A robust threshold applicable to all analyzed images was determined experimentally. The resulting binary image [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(b)</ref>] must undergo further processing for removal of extraneous objects and separation of connected follicles.</p><p>3) Watershed Segmentation of Binary Images: In addition to the tessellation of grayscale images, watersheds can be used for separation of partially overlapping objects in binary images. First, the binary image is subjected to three steps of 5 5 morphological opening to remove small objects, to separate objects with small areas of overlap, and to remove sporadic variations along the object edges. The inverse Euclidean distance map (EDM) of the resulting morphology image is then calculated. The brightness of each pixel in the EDM of a binary image encodes its distance to the nearest boundary. To accomplish binary image segmentation, watershed immersion algorithm is applied to the inverse EDM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). At the location of overlap in the binary image, the inverse EDM has a ridge where the two catchment basins of each overlapping objects meet. Therefore, each of the two catchment basins are labeled uniquely and the ridge separating them is labeled as a watershed.</p><p>4) Post-Processing: The previous step of watershed transformation for separation of overlapping objects can result in false separations [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(c)</ref>]. To distinguish between correct and incorrect region splitting, post-processing of the output label image is conducted. It is necessary to determine identical watershed borders in the two watershed images (morphology image and watershed label image, Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>) that are needed for subsequent object property calculation and region analysis. The morphology image is eroded and used to mask the label image by multiplication of the two images. The resulting masked label image and the eroded morphology image have matching object/background boundaries. As a next step performed in parallel in the morphology and watershed label images, all regions within four pixels of the image border are removed as well as the regions not completely located within the ultrasound fan area.</p><p>Object properties are calculated using the two resulting images. The minor axis of each region of the binary image is calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and each separating border of each binary region into the subregions of the label image is identified. To determine which separating borders are to be removed, the length of the border is calculated. Then, the average edge strength and average gray level along the boundary are calculated in an eight-connected neighborhood.</p><p>The subregions of the label image are then merged based on these object properties. IF the edge strength along the boundary is above edge strength threshold , then use the separating border to perform the split; ELSE IF the length of the boundary between two subregions is greater then a ratio of the minor axis, then remove the separating border to perform the merge; ELSE IF the average gray level along the boundary is below brightness threshold , then merge; ELSE IF the edge strength along the boundary is below edge strength threshold , then merge; ELSE split the two subregions. Thus, if a common boundary defines a strong edge then split. Similarly, subregions are merged if their common boundary is long relative to the minor axis of the whole region, separates along bright pixels, or defines a weak edge.</p><p>After region analysis, regions smaller than a preselected size are removed. Next, each region is dilated in a 3 3 neighborhood to account for the erosion that took place at the beginning of the post-processing step. Finally, the resulting region borders are smoothed using an area-preserving contour smoothing technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. These borders (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(d)</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>) are used for region of interest and refined region of interest definition as well as for adjacent follicle identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Follicle of Interest Identification</head><p>The only user interaction required during the entire image analysis process is the identification of the follicle of interest by pointing the mouse. Using the smoothed inner borders that result from watershed segmentation (Section II-A), the  coordinates of the mouse click are then matched to the appropriate contour. The inner limit of the inner border region of interest (IROI) is defined by scaling the marked follicle contour area to 80% of its original size using a frequency domain approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The outer limit of the IROI is defined 30 pixels outward from the inner limit [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9(a)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Inner Border Detection</head><p>After selection of the IROI, the image inside the IROI is processed using a 5 5 Sobel edge operator. This edge magnitude information is sampled in directions perpendicular to the outer limit of the IROI to yield a straightened edge magnitude image</p><p>. The coordinate transformation used to generate the straightened edge magnitude map is also applied to the original image data. A 3 3 Prewitt compass operator is employed to give one of eight edge directions for each pixel and form the direction image The edge magnitude and orientation images are used to create a straightened graph within which the inner follicle border is determined using optimal graph searching <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>The inner follicle border is expected to closely correspond to the shape of the IROI. Therefore, the path through the graph should be relatively straight. Thus, a directional penalty is assigned to nodes for which corresponding to a three-successor graph search. The edge pattern strength that is used to determine the cost of a graph node is defined by for otherwise <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where represents the node profile coordinate and is the coordinate representing the distance of the node from the inside limit of the IROI.</p><p>The cost for each graph node is defined by the difference between its edge pattern strength and the maximum (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>3</label></formula><p>The inner border is determined as the optimal path through the graph with node costs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(b)</ref>]. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Outer Border Detection</head><p>Using the detected inner border, the region of interest for outer border detection can be defined. Because the follicle wall is approximately 1-2 mm in thickness, the inner limit of the outer border region of interest (OROI) is located 1.4 mm (ten pixels) inward from the detected inner border and the outer OROI limit is located 2.8 mm (20 pixels) outward from the detected inner border. The OROI is extended 10 pixels inwards with respect to the already identified inner border to guarantee that all the ultrasound echo responses from the inside wall are included in the OROI.</p><p>Similar to the IROI, the edge magnitude and orientation images are generated within the OROI. The primary cost function used to detect the outer border is identical with that used in our previously reported semiautomated method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and therefore only a brief description is included here. The outer wall cost function reflects the tripleedge character of the inner/outer follicle-border pattern-the outer wall border is characterized by a bright-to-dark (BD) transition . Additional ultrasound echo edge support is present from the BD trailing edge of the outer wall echo response and the dark-to-bright (DB) inner wall echo response .</p><p>The edge pattern strength can be described as the weighted sum of the local BD edge strength , echo response , and echo response (4)</p><p>Similar to (2), the cost for each node is defined by the difference between its edge pattern strength and the maximum edge pattern strength in the corresponding graph column.</p><p>Because the outer border shape is expected to closely parallel the already detected inner border, a directional model penalty is again used similar to (3). When two follicles are closely adjacent, the triple-edge appearance of the outer follicle border is violated and the outer follicle wall border is defined as the midline between adjacent follicles as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(a)</ref>. By mapping the pixel locations of the inner borders of other follicles of the cohort to the OROI, the cost function can be modified to discourage the strong attraction of the adjacent follicle inner borders. To adjust the cost function in these situations, an adjacency penalty function is designed that modifies the local cost values in the region of follicle adjacency. The additive cost function penalty is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(b)</ref> where the distance between the two borders of adjacent follicles is denoted . The maximum adjustment provides a barrier which ensures that the graph search cannot be attracted to adjacent follicles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>).</p><p>Defining the adjacency penalty as a function allows for control of the degree of cost function adjustment. By increasing the parameter , the search will be more likely to choose a path through the midline in the problematic areas. A smaller value of would allow the search to be driven more by the image data.</p><p>Finally, the inner and outer borders are smoothed using a frequency domain approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. This step also improves the border positioning by correcting for the edge positioning offset that is typical for first derivative edge detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Parameters:</head><p>For prepreprocessing, a 400 400 subimage was extracted from the original image. Adaptive neighborhood smoothing was performed using and the large kernel size of 11 11 and small kernel size of 5 5. Watershed mosaic images were thresholded using . Region merging analysis was done using a minor axis ratio , a gray level threshold of , and edge strength thresholds of and . To remove small regions, objects of size pixels and smaller were removed. A direction penalty of and a model penalty of were used for graph-searching border detection. The weights for the triple-edge appearance were defined as For adjacent follicles, an adjacency slope of was utilized. The final border smoothing step included an experimentally determined area scaling by 2%, enlarging the inner wall area and shrinking the outer wall areas.</p><p>2) Data: The ultrasonographic images used in this study were selected from a database of thousands of images collected during the course of clinical evaluation of women undergoing assisted reproductive technology therapy at the Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon, Canada. Since ovarian follicles grow in the course of their development, the selected images were chosen to uniformly represent follicles throughout their development cycle.</p><p>The ultrasonographic examinations were done by a single operator using an Advanced Technology Laboratories (ATL) Ultramark 9 HDI instrument equipped with a 5-9 MHz broadband curvilinear array intravaginal transducer. Controls for overall gain and time gain compensation (TGC) slope were set to predetermined levels. The scans were recorded on S-VHS tape and later digitized using a frame grabber and a Panasonic AG-7300 series video cassette recorder. The frames were digitized as 640 480 pixel images at a scale of 0.14 mm/pixel.</p><p>3) Data Analysis: The following parameters are considered useful for quantifying the physiological status of the follicle: 1) inner follicle area (mm ; 2) outer follicle area (mm ; and 3) follicle wall area (mm . The inner follicle area was defined as the total area enclosed by the inner follicle wall border. The outer follicle area was defined as the area enclosed by the outer follicle wall border. The follicle wall area was determined as the area between the inner and outer borders. These parameters were computed from both the operator-defined and computerdetermined follicle images.</p><p>Linear regression analyses were used to compare the parameters computed from the computer-determined follicles with the parameters computed from the operator-defined independent standard. Single points at a large distance from the rest of the cohort used for regression analysis are known to bias the regression analysis results. Since one of the 36 follicles was about twice as large compared to all other follicles in the testing set, this large follicle was not included in the regression analysis (but was included in the border positioning error analysis). Regression equations were compared to the line of identity using -statistic for slope and intercept. A value less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>To compare computer-detected and observer-defined borders, we calculated the maximum and root-mean-square (rms) errors of border positioning by measuring the distances between corresponding boundary points. Corresponding points were defined as pairs of points, the first point being from the computer detected border and the second one from the manually identified border that were closest to each other using the Euclidean metric. The positioning errors were calculated separately for the outer and inner follicle walls, expressed in mm, and reported as mean standard deviation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head><p>Our automated approach was applied to 36 ultrasound images. In five of the 36 images, the watershed segmentation step that identifies potential follicles failed to accurately identify the location of the inner border due to poor image quality. Thus, these five cases required manual adjustment of the approximate inner border prior to the automated border detection. The operator performing these adjustments was unaware of the exact shape and position of the manually identified borders. All borders were then detected automatically and were not manually edited. The results reported below therefore represent the full set of 36 images.</p><p>A good correlation was obtained between computer-detected and observer-defined inner, outer, and wall follicular areas</p><p>[mm [mm and [mm respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>). The slopes and intercepts of the inner, outer, and wall area regression lines did not differ significantly from one and zero, respectively . In the single large follicle that was removed from the regression analysis due to its size, the computer area measurements also corresponded well with the manually defined standard.</p><p>Overall, the computer-determined borders were accurate with the maximum and root-mean-square border positioning errors summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. To demonstrate that including the five follicles with manual adjustment of the approximate inner border prior to the automated border detection did not represent any substantial improvement of the reported results, the border positioning errors achieved in the 31 nonedited follicles are also included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. An example of the follicle wall borders automatically detected in an ovarian ultrasound image is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>. The manually defined borders are shown together with the results of the automated computer analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION</head><p>Transvaginal ultrasound has been the cornerstone of in vivo imaging of follicle growth used for infertility diagnosis and  treatment. Currently, manual measurements are typically based on estimation of follicle diameter. Clearly, for nonspherical follicles this approach may easily fail to estimate follicle volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Recently, 3-D transvaginal ultrasound was introduced that offers higher volume measurement accuracy than more conventional two-dimensional imaging in perpendicular planes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Three-dimensional imaging at the same time produces larger image data volumes. Therefore, it is of extreme importance to develop an automated or semiautomated methods for reliable quantitative analysis of follicle dimensions in vivo.</p><p>We have shown very good agreement between follicular area measurements performed automatically and manually and demonstrated high border positioning accuracy of the resulting segmentation. To provide some context to the reported measurement errors, size information about the daily follicle growth rate is provided. Follicles of 3-5 mm in diameter can be reliably detected using transvaginal ultrasound. The dominant follicle is chosen when it is approximately 8-10 mm in diameter. Then, this follicle grows at a rate of approximately 2 mm per day achieving an average diameter of 21.5 mm at ovulation (diameters of follicles at ovulation range from 17.4-27 mm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Therefore, the reported border positioning accuracy seems sufficient to quantitatively follow day-to-day follicle growth.</p><p>Previous studies dealing with measurement reproducibility and interobserver and intraobserver variability demonstrated that ultrasonography allows accurate measurement of follicular diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, facilitates sequential follicle analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and that the agreement within and between operators for presence of corpora lutea and follicles larger than 10 mm is comparable with that achieved in radiograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Pierson and Ginther quantitatively compared ultrasound-based follicle diameter measurements with quantitative measurements on sliced of the excised heifer ovaries and concluded that diagnostic ultrasonography is a reliable method for identifying and measuring follicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Lean et al. demonstrated high agreement between three observers when analyzing ultrasound images of follicles larger than 4 mm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. They called for additional validation of image acquisition reproducibility since cross-sections through the longest axis of the follicle may be difficult to obtain reproducibly possibly causing errors in sequential measurements. Most recently, Singh et al. investigated the utility of ultrasound texture for which identification of antrum and follicle wall is a prerequisite <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. They found correlation between echotexture characteristics of follicle antrum and wall with the functional and endocrine status of a follicle.</p><p>Our method while highly automated, demonstrates good accuracy if compared with our previously reported semiautomated approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Outer follicle area and follicle wall area measurements can be used for the comparison. The agreement between the outer follicle areas determined manually and semiautomatically was specified by the regression equation , the automated method offers comparable performance [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11(b)</ref>]. In case of the follicle wall area measurement, the automated method [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11(c)</ref>] outperformed the previous semi-automated method The presented method is highly automated and requires only very limited human operator interaction. The only interaction required is using the mouse to point to the inside of the follicle of interest. All other operations are automated. When a sequence of corresponding transvaginal images is acquired over a period of several days, this interaction may be limited to identification of the follicle of interest in one of the early images and the identification in the later images may also be automated. Importantly, the presented method can be extended to 3-D analysis when 3-D transvaginal ultrasound becomes more widely available.</p><p>The automated method relies on several parameters that were determined experimentally. While it is possible that these parameters will require tuning to reflect image acquisition specifics of different ultrasound machines as well as diversity in imaging standards used at various imaging centers, the parameter settings were very robust in the analyzed set of 36 ultrasound images. The multistep character of the segmentation process minimizes the influence of the parameter setup. While, for instance, the threshold parameter somewhat influences the result of watershed segmentation, these changes have minimal effect on the final border detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The multistep automated method of follicle analysis utilizes watershed inner border approximation followed by modelbased graph search for refined inner border detection. Accurate outer border detection is successfully accomplished by a graph search algorithm which effectively uses adjacent follicle information.</p><p>Our method facilitates fast, accurate inner and outer border detection with minimal user-interaction. Quantitative comparison of the computer-defined borders and the user-defined borders advocates the accuracy of our automated method of follicle analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
