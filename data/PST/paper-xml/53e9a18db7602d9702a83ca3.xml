<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>such as secure communication, biological systems, information processing (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>). It is shown that neural networks exhibit chaotic behavior provided that parameters and delays are appropriately chosen (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). Therefore, in recent years, synchronization and control of neural networks has been one of the hot research topics (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> etc). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, authors investigated quasi-synchronization of discontinuous neural networks with and without parameter mismatches, i.e., synchronization error can only be controlled to a small region around zero, but cannot approach zero. Results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> demonstrated that, under the classical state feedback controller, complete synchronization cannot be realized even without parameter mismatch between the drive and response systems due to the discontinuity of activation function. It is well known that one of the most important applications of chaos synchronization is in secure communication. When chaos synchronization is applied to secure communication, only if the master and response systems achieve complete synchronization can the transmitted signal be fingered out. Therefore, it is necessary to study complete synchronization of neural networks with discontinuous activations. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, complete synchronization of discontinuous neural networks was investigated via approximation and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. But we find that, through the approximation approach used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the control gain may be very large, which leads to inapplicable in practice. Hence, it is urgent to design new controller to achieve complete synchronization of neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations.</p><p>Being motivated by the above analysis, this paper aims to investigate global exponential synchronization of delayed neural networks with discontinuous activation functions via two control methods: state feedback control and adaptive control. Different from the controllers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, both discontinuous state feedback control and discontinuous adaptive control are designed. Without using Halanay inequality, this paper reveals that the considered model can realize complete drive-response synchronization under the designed controllers. The discontinuous activations are assumed to satisfy a growth condition, which includes continuous activations as a special case, and hence the results of this paper are also applicable to neural networks with continuous activations. Under the framework of Filippov solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, by using Lyapunov function and chain rule of differential inclusion, rigorous proofs are given for the exponential stability of the error systems of the coupled systems. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</p><p>Notations: In the sequel, if not explicitly stated, matrices are assumed to have compatible dimensions.</p><p>denotes the identity matrix of -dimension. is the space of real number.

Some necessary assumptions, definitions and lemmas are also given in this section. Our main results and their rigorous proofs are described in Section III. In Section IV, two examples with their numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of our results. In Section V, conclusions are given.</p></div>

As for differential equation with discontinuous right-hand side, its solution in the conventional sense does not exist. In the following, we fist recall some basic notations concerning set-valued map, which is needed to define Filippov solution.</p><p>The Filippov set-valued map of at is defined as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where is the closure of the convex hull of the set , and is the Lebesgue measure of set .</p><p>Definition 1: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SYNCHRONIZATION UNDER CONTROL</head><p>In this section, state feedback controller and adaptive controller are designed respectively such that the system (8) can globally exponentially synchronize with system (1), corresponding rigorous mathematical proofs are also given. Theorems 1 and 2 are about the state feedback control with different conditions, while the Theorems 3 and 4 are about adaptive control corresponding to Theorems 1 and 2 respectively. Let . It is followed from ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and (6) that: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where . Obviously, is the equilibrium point of the error system (10) when</p><p>. If system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> realizes global exponential stability at the origin for any given initial condition, then the global exponential synchronization between ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> [or (1) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)] is achieved.</p><p>In the literature, state feedback controller is extensively utilized to control chaotic systems such that the coupled chaotic systems can realize synchronization goal. However, only quasisynchronization of discontinuous neural networks can be realized if the usual state feedback controller as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is considered. Therefore, new state feedback controller should be designed to realize synchronization of neural networks with discontinuous activations. The following Theorem 1 solves this problem.</p><p>Theorem 1: Suppose that the Assumptions are satisfied. Then the neural networks ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) can achieve global exponential synchronization under the following discontinuous controller: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where . Moreover, the convergence rate is .</p><p>Proof: Define the following Lyapunov functional candidate: <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Computing the derivative of along trajectories of error system (10), we get from Lemma 2 and the calculus for differential inclusion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> that: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where .

This completes the proof.</p><p>In the literature, some results on stability of equilibrium point and periodic solution of neural networks with discontinuous activations were obtained. A typical assumption is that the discontinuous activation should be nondecreasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>In this case, the condition holds. Since is a special case of , Theorem 1 still is effective for neural networks with discontinuous nondecreasing activations. The next Theorem 2 is less conservative than Theorem 1 for neural networks with discontinuous nondecreasing activations.</p><p>Theorem 2: Suppose that the conditions and are satisfied. Then the neural networks ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) can achieve global exponential synchronization with convergence rate under the following discontinuous controller:</p><p>where , the other parameters are defined as those in Theorem 1.</p><p>Proof: By taking the same Lyapunov functional candidate <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and differentiating it with respect to time along the solution of (10), we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> in which are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. It can be obtained from that <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">15</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>), one gets that <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, one has from that Therefore,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The condition means that</head><p>The rest part is the same as that in the proof of Theorem 1. This completes the proof.</p><p>Theorems 1 and 2 give the synchronization criteria of neural networks with discontinuous activations under discontinuous state feedback control. However, control gains of the state feedback controller obtained by theoretical analysis are usually much larger than needed in practice, which will increase control cost. Therefore adaptive control method was proposed such that the controller can adjust its control gains according to designed adaptive law <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In the following, we shall consider adaptive controllers corresponding to the state feedback controllers in Theorems 1 and 2, and get Theorems 3 and 4 respectively.</p><p>Theorem 3: Suppose that the Assumptions are satisfied. Then the neural networks (8) can globally exponentially synchronize with (1) under the following adaptive controller: <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> where are arbitrary positive constants and . Proof: Define the following Lyapunov functional candidate: <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> where are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and . Computing the derivative of along trajectories of error system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> derives that: <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> where is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. From ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>), one has <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> One can derive from the condition that <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> Hence,</p><p>Considering the definition of , one gets that <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> The rest part is the same as that in the proof of Theorem 1. So the neural networks (8) can globally exponentially synchronize with and (1) under the following adaptive controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. This completes the proof.</p><p>Combining the proofs of Theorems 2 and 3, it is easy to reach the following conclusion, we omit its proof.</p><p>Theorem 4: Suppose that the conditions and are satisfied. Then the neural networks (8) can globally exponentially synchronize with (1) under the adaptive controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>Remark 2: In the above results, exponential synchronization criteria are derived. However, Theorems 1 and 2 can explicitly estimate the convergence rate, but the Theorems 3 and 4 cannot. This is because synchronization velocity increases accelerately under adaptive controller and is dependent on the constants and initial value of . Remark 3: When the activation function is continuous, the constants become zero. In this case, the state feedback controller and adaptive controller are also effective. Hence, the results of this paper are applicable to neural networks with both discontinuous and continuous activations.</p><p>Remark 4: In the proofs of the above results, we do not use the well known Halanay inequality. Moreover, the Lyaponov functionals utilized are simple and the adaptive laws do not include the exponential function , which is needed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 5: Under the designed controllers (both state feedback controller and adaptive controller), exponential synchronization criteria between systems (1) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) are derived in this paper. The synchronization criteria in this paper are simple and can be easily verified in practice. However, under the controller utilized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the authors only got the quasi-synchronization criteria. By using the approximation approach, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> obtained asymptotic synchronization criteria. But the control gains obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> may approach infinity, which leads to inapplicable in practice. Recently, authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> investigated synchronization of linearly coupled dynamical networks with non-Lipschitz right-hand sides. But the discontinuous functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> were weakened to be weak-QUAD and semi-QUAD, which means that the discontinuous function approaches to a continuous function as time goes, and the criteria were expressed in integral inequalities. Such synchronization criteria may be not easily verified in practice, especially in the case that there are countable discontinuities for the discontinuous functions. To sum up, results of this paper improve those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to some extent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXAMPLES AND SIMULATIONS</head><p>In this section, two numerical examples are given to show that our theoretical results obtained above are effective.</p><p>Example 1: Consider the following delayed neural networks:</p><p>where , and the activation function is with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows chaotic-like trajectory of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">32</ref>) with initial condition . Obviously, neural network (32) satisfies -with . Now consider the following controlled response system of system (32) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> By simple computation, we get . Take and . According to Theorem 1, system (33) can be exponentially synchronized with <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> under the state feedback controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, according to Theorems 3 and 4, system (33) can also be exponentially synchronized with <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> under the adaptive controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>In the numerical simulations, we use the forward Euler method, which was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> to obtain numerical solution of differential inclusions. The parameters in the simulations are taken as: step-length is 0.0002, for . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> presents trajectories of the error states between ( <ref type="formula">33</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">32</ref>) under the state feedback controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> with the above parameters. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3, 4,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> show trajectories of the error states, the time response of and , respectively, under the adaptive controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> with , the other parameters are the same as those used for Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Figs. 2-5 specify that both the state feedback controller (11) and adaptive controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> can realize exponential synchronization of coupled neural networks with discontinuous activation functions. Moreover, it can be seen from Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> that the control gains , of the adaptive controller are much smaller than those of the state feedback controller used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The above simulations fit the theoretical results perfectly.   The above discontinuous activation functions are monotone increasing. we provide another example to further verify our theoretical results, in which the discontinuous activation functions are not monotone increasing.  Example 2: Consider the delayed neural network model (1) with the following parameters:</p><p>, and the activation function is with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows chaotic-like trajectory of (1) with initial condition . Obviously, in this example is not monotone increasing and is discontinuous at . So the activation function satisfies condition and with and . It follows from Theorems 1 and 3 that system (8) can exponentially synchronize with the driver system (1) under both state feedback controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and the adaptive controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>We only utilize the adaptive controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> to demonstrate the effectiveness, since the state feedback controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> can surely realize the synchronization if the adaptive controller (25) succeed. In the numerical simulations, we still use the forward Euler method. The parameters in the simulations are taken as: step-length is 0.001,   . we get the simulation results shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> describes the trajectories of the error states, which approaches to zero quickly as time goes. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> represents the time response of , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows the time response of . From Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> one can see the control parameters and turn out to be some constants when synchronization is achieved.</p><p>Remark 6: The discontinuous activation in Example 1 is increasing and that in Example 2 is not increasing. Hence the two examples specify the generality of the obtained results. Moreover, exponential synchronization is realized by adding the state feedback controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> or the adaptive controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> to the response system. However, results and numerical simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> only get quasi-synchronization under the linear state feedback controller (see Remark 6, Corollary 2, and Figs. 8-10 in Example 3 in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). From the proofs of Theorems 1-3 and the numerical simulations one can see that the part in the controller (11) plays a key role in dealing with the state differences between the driver and response systems. Therefore, theoretical results and numerical simulations in this paper improve those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>V. CONCLUSION Both the issues of chaos synchronization and stability of neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations have intrigued increasing interests of researchers from different fields. However, few published papers consider synchronization control of neural networks with discontinuous activations. Hence, this paper study the exponential synchronization of neural networks with discontinuous activations. Both state feedback control and adaptive control techniques are considered. The designed controllers are simple and can be applied to neural networks with discontinuous and continuous activations. Compared with existing results which only quasi-synchronization can be realized, the obtained results of this paper are better. Numerical simulations show that the theoretical results are effective.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
