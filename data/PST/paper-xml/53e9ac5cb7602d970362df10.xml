<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Agile sensor networks can collect information in the sky, on the ground and underwater. Sensor networks with fixed nodes are able to continuously monitor specific locations for long periods of time. Great research progress has been achieved and commercial products are emerging cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>A new direction for sensor network research employs satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ground robots and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) as moving sensor platforms. Such a mobile sensor network can cover a large area with a relatively small number of platforms by performing cooperative motion that ensures the optimal distribution of sensing power across the area. Some of the latest research results demonstrate that control over relative positions among sensor platforms has significant impact on the quality of information collected by the entire network cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</p><p>Influenced by the study of swarming behaviors of animal groups cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, researchers are developing cooperative control methods to achieve the desired relative positions among a group of moving sensor platforms. The problem is often called the swarming or formation problem. The dynamics of each platform in the network is usually complicated. For coordination purposes, however, it is practical to use the simpler model of 0167-6911/$ -see front matter Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.sysconle.2006. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref>.027 an individual platform modeled as a particle in the sense of classical mechanics. One advantage of using this simple model is that the theoretical results are platform independent. Error caused by this simplification is usually reduced by a lower level, platform specific controlling mechanism. This is true, for example, in the case of a recent experimental demonstration of controlling a fleet of underwater gliders <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The particles interact with each other through synthetic forces that are induced by feedback control laws. The goal is to devise suitable control laws so that the particles attain desired motion patterns. In this spirit, methods such as energy shaping <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> are applied with promising results for formations in the plane cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The literature is also rich with results regarding cooperative control where particles are replaced by agents with simple dynamics, for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Operational objectives for UAVs and UUVs often require the platforms to travel at the highest constant speed to survey the largest area in unit time. Therefore, one may also view the platforms as particles moving at (common) constant speed. Particles under gyroscopic forces obey a constant speed constraint. Certain patterns for a system of particles with unit speed can be classified. Using Lie group theoretic methods, Justh and Krishnaprasad have shown that in the plane, particles moving along parallel lines or around the same circle are the only relative equilibria if the particles are subjected to steering laws that depend only on relative positions and headings. Steering control laws are proposed to asymptotically achieve those patterns as relative equilibria cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and an earlier version <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The insight also enabled the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> to design (time varying) steering control for obstacle avoidance and boundary following for a single constant speed particle.</p><p>The steering control laws given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are justified for achieving planar formations of two unit speed particles. Extension to many particles are made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Sepulchre et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> noticed that patterns of many constant speed particles can be achieved in the plane by extending methods previously developed for coupled oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, steering control laws are developed to stabilize formations on circles and parallel lines. It is later shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> that ellipses can be mapped to circles using a nonlinear transform so that some of the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> can be generalized to ellipses.</p><p>In applications such as the Adaptive Sampling and Prediction of the ocean (ASAP) project <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, desired coordinated trajectories for mobile sensor platforms are defined by a collection of closed curves of various shape with prescribed relative spacing of vehicles on the curves. These are computed both to minimize sensing error and to address operational challenges. This has motivated the need for a systematic method to design steering control laws that stabilize patterns on a closed curve with arbitrary shape. In this paper, we first modify methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> to steer one agent so that its trajectory converges to the desired closed curve. Next, to achieve a prescribed collective motion pattern, we address the major challenge of the inhomogeneity of phase angles of particles around the closed curve. Influenced by the ideas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, we propose a method that uses the relative arc-length between particles instead of phase angle differences to measure the relative position between agents on a closed curve. Our steering control laws are proved stable using a Lyapunov function that converges to its critical point along the controlled dynamics.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define an orbit function on the plane. The level sets of this orbit function can be viewed as orbits with energy equal to the function value. In Section 3, we develop the equations describing the motion of a unit speed particle with respect to the orbits. In Section 4, a control law for two particles is developed to stabilize patterns on any given orbit. The coupling between the two particles is a function of the relative curve length. We generalize the control law to a collection of N particles in Section 5. We demonstrate the control laws with simulation results presented in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Orbit function</head><p>Let 0 (â¢) represent a simple, closed, regular curve in the plane parametrized by its arc-length s. The total length L of such a curve is finite. A point q 0 on the curve is selected as the starting point and at this point we assign s =0. The Frenet-Serret frame ( x 0 (s), y 0 (s)) can be constructed with x 0 (s) the unit tangent vector to the curve and y 0 (s) the unit normal vector to the curve at 0 (s). We use the convention such that ( x 0 (s), y 0 (s)) forms a right-handed coordinate frame with x 0 (s) Ã y 0 (s) pointing to the reader. Let (s) be the curvature of the curve at 0 (s). The Frenet-Serret equations describe how the frame formed by ( x 0 (s), y 0 (s)) is translated along the curve:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d x 0 (s) ds = (s) y 0 (s), d y 0 (s) ds = -(s) x 0 (s). (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>Without loss of generality, we assume that the origin of a lab fixed coordinate system is placed at a point in the plane encircled by 0 (â¢). Notice that since the curve is a compact subset of the plane, we can construct a closed ball B centered at the origin such that 0 (â¢) â int(B).</p><p>Lemma 1. Assume that at every point on the curve 0 , the curvature is uniformly bounded. There exists a function z : B â R, satisfying the following properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(A1) 0 is a level curve of z(â¢) i.e., z( 0 (â¢)) is a constant func- tion of s. (A2) There exists a finite interval [c 1 , c 2 ] such that any level curve of z(â¢) with its value belonging to [c 1 , c 2 ] is entirely contained in B. Also, z( 0 (â¢)) â (c 1 , c 2 ). (A3) The function z is smooth on the open set = { r â B|c 1 &lt; z( r) &lt; c 2 }. Furthermore, âz = 0 for all points in .</formula><p>Proof. Near 0 (â¢), a family of curves (â¢), called the Bertrand family cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, can be constructed as (s) = 0 (s) + y 0 (s) where is a real number. The tangent vector to (s) is x (s) = (1 -(s) ) x 0 (s). There is a singularity at = 1/ . Because we assume that (s) is uniformly bounded for all s, we may choose an â (0, 1/ sup{| (s)|}) so that all Bertrand curves with | | are regular and are contained in B. We let the set be defined as the set of all points on the Bertrand curves with | | &lt; . It can be verified that is an open connected subset of B.</p><p>Since every point in belongs to a Bertrand curve, we can construct a function z( r) on by letting z( r) = if r â (â¢). Each Bertrand curve is a level curve for z( r). We now select an arbitrary point r and prove that z( r) is differentiable at r. In fact, within a small neighborhood of r, the directional derivative of z( r) along the tangent vector x (s) is always 0. The directional derivative of z( r) along the normal vector y (s) is always constantly 1 or -1. The sign depends on whether is increasing or decreasing along the y direction. The continuity of these two directional derivatives implies that z( r) is differentiable in the selected neighborhood. It is a property of the Bertrand family of curves that y (s) = y 0 (s). Therefore, since âz = y 0 (s) or âz =y 0 (s), âz is a smooth vector field. Thus z( r) is smooth in the neighborhood. Since these arguments hold for all points in , z( r) is smooth in . Notice also that âz = 1 = 0 for all points in .</p><p>We may let z( r)=0 for r â B/ and let c 1 =and c 2 =+ . This concludes the proof since we have given one method to construct a function z that satisfies all properties in the lemma.</p><p>We emphasize that the method given in the proof is often not the best for constructing the function z(â¢). Simple methods for special curves often result in a much larger . For example, suppose an ellipse is given by r = (x, y) â R 2 and x 2 /a 2 + y 2 /b 2 = 1 for constants a, b â R. We may define a function z( r) = x 2 /a 2 + y 2 /b 2 . The level curves of z(â¢) are families of concentric ellipses. We can choose c 1 to be an arbitrarily small positive number and c 2 &gt; c 1 to be an arbitrarily large positive number. The set = { r â R 2 |c 1 &lt; z( r) &lt; c 2 } is an arbitrarily large bounded set without the origin.</p><p>In the above example, if we let the starting point of each ellipse be the intersection of the ellipse with the horizontal axis, then all starting points are on a smooth curve which is a straight line. In general, we have the following result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 2. A starting point for each level curve of z in the set</head><p>can be selected such that the starting points form a smooth curve.</p><p>Proof. We can write down a differential equation describing the gradient flow of z( r) that generates trajectories with their tangent vectors identical to the gradient vectors</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d q d = âz( q( )). (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>Starting from the point q 0 which is the starting point for 0 (â¢), the solution of this equation q( ) produces a smooth curve.</p><p>Because âz is smooth on , the solution of this differential equation exists and is unique for increasing or decreasing. Furthermore, the solution curve intersects all level curves in . We may choose one intersection point for each curve to be the starting point.</p><p>We call the function z(â¢) that satisfies the properties in Lemma 1 the orbit function. Each level curve of this orbit function is called an orbit. We call the selected curve 0 (â¢) the reference orbit. A point r in the set is uniquely determined by knowing z( r) which we call the orbit value and s( r) which is the arc-length measured from the starting point of the orbit with value z( r). These definitions are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Note that we do not require the orbits to belong to a Bertrand family, even though we can construct a set of orbits that belong to a Bertrand family for a single-looped regular curve with arbitrary shape using the methods in the proof of Lemma 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Orbit of unit speed particle</head><p>Let r be the position of a unit speed particle. Suppose r â at time t, then r belongs to an orbit (â¢) with orbit value z( r). The tangent vector to the curve at (s) is not necessarily aligned with the velocity vector of the particle at r. Let the Frenet-Serret frame along orbit (â¢) be ( x 1 , y 1 ). Let the velocity vector of the particle be x. We can establish another Frenet-Serret frame for the actual trajectory of the particle by selecting a normal vector y perpendicular to x that forms a right-handed coordinate frame with y so that x Ã y points to the reader, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Our goal is to develop the differential equations that describe the change of the two frames and their relative displacement as the particle moves.</p><p>The motion of the frame formed by ( x, y) of the unit speed particle is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ë x = u 1 y, Ë y = -u 1 x, (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where u 1 is the steering control of the vehicle.

In this case, the gradient vector âz( r) and y 1 point in the same direction.</p><p>As the particle moves, the orbit value z of the particle changes as a function of time:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">dz dt = âz â¢ d r dt = âz â¢ x = Â± âz y 1 â¢ x = â âz sin 1 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The sign depends on whether âz is aligned with y 1 or points in the opposite direction of y 1 . The plus sign in the final expression of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">5</ref>) is assumed when y 1 = -âz/ âz and the minus sign is assumed when y 1 = âz/ âz . Notice that once the sign is determined, because the level curves are all closed curves and never intersect one another, the sign is fixed for all points in . In this paper, for simplicity, we adopt the convention that y 1 = âz/ âz so that only the minus sign is assumed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><p>The frame ( x 1 , y 1 ) changes as the particle moves.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">A two particle pattern</head><p>We now consider the case of controlling two unit speed particles to a common orbit with prescribed arc-length separation. Let 1 (â¢) and 2 (â¢) be the instantaneous orbits for particles 1 and 2, respectively. Let s 1 and s 2 be the curve lengths measured from the starting points of 1 (â¢) and 2 (â¢), respectively. Let z 1 and z 2 be the corresponding orbit values of the two instantaneous orbits.

Notice that when p = 1 this describes an ellipse. When p is an odd integer greater than one, the curve looks like a rectangle with rounded corners. We construct the orbit function z(x, y) = (x 2p + y 2p /e 2p ) 1/2p where e = b 0 /a 0 . If p is an odd integer, the curve with orbit value a 0 can be parametrized by x = a 0 (cos ) 1/p and y = b 0 (sin ) 1/p . From these equations, we are able to compute the arc-length, curvature and tangent vectors of any super-ellipse in the family.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Summary and future directions</head><p>In this paper, we have introduced a new method for designing steering control laws for a system of N unit speed particles. The control steers the particles to an invariant pattern corresponding to a constant orbit value and constant separations measured by the relative arc-lengths along the reference orbit. By extending curve tracking methods, we prove convergence to closed simple smooth curves. This class of curves is much more general than what were treated in recent related works (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>). Although the convergence is not global in the plane, the orbit function we introduce often allows convergence from a large set of initial positions.</p><p>In our cooperative control laws, we use relative arc-length to couple particles because of the constant speed constraint. A simple chain structure for coupling allows us to stabilize the invariant patterns. Other more complicated coupling structures may also be applied according to communication or sensing requirements. We have not yet addressed collision avoidance in this setting. The challenge here derives from the constant speed constraint. In practice, extra collision avoidance mechanisms are often introduced that break the constant speed constraint when safety instead of performance is the major concern. The problem of stabilizing an invariant pattern along or near a closed curve or boundary is also interesting if the constant speed constraint is relaxed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a PDE-based algorithm inspired by computer vision algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is developed to distribute agents along a boundary. Convergence is demonstrated but not yet proved. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Kumar and Hsieh have shown some interesting theoretical and simulation results using potential functions. Some experimental works are documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Our results, although based on the assumption that all particles travel at identical constant speed, suggest a systematic approach to solving this pattern generation problem. We have shown some of our results on achieving invariant patterns without the constant speed constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>This paper is concerned with the planar setting. Of course, many important motion control problems evolve in three-dimensional physical space. For underwater gliders, our results are applied by projecting the three-dimensional motion onto the plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. New developments have been made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to use a natural frame setting to model three-dimensional motion. The resulting steering laws are similar to those derived in the planar setting. This suggests that the concepts of orbit function and relative arc-length coupling established in this paper can also be extended to the three-dimensional setting.</p><p>Suppose that lim tââ t t 0 ( ) d exists and is finite.
