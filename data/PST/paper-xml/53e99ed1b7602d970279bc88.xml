<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Social networking sites have thrived since the inception of Web 2.0 technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Examples of networking sites are Facebook, Myspace, and Google+. Boyd and Ellison defined social networking sites as web-based services that allow individuals to "(1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Social networking sites offer a platform for online users to interact with one another and to maintain interpersonal relationships. Millions of internet users are now members of one or more networking sites. Facebook, for example, attracts over 500 million active users who spend over 700 billion minutes per month on the site <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The success of social networking sites has tremendous business implications. In 2007, for example, 48% of brand marketers deployed marketing on social networking sites. Educators nationwide have also tapped into the potential of social networking sites as schools are increasingly using these sites in order to "push learning beyond the borders of the classroom" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Government agencies across federal, state, county and municipal levels have also invested in social networking sites to interact with the public. A recent report by the Human Capital Institute found that 66% of government agencies adopted social networking sites as a preferred channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>Academia has recognized the significance of social networking sites as well. Several research streams of social networking sites exist, yet less is known as to what influences online users to use social networking sites. Findings of prior studies are limited in addressing this research question and new research is warranted <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref>. New knowledge in this regard is imperative to the long-term sustainability of social networking sites. First, site use results in engagement in social interactions such as profile browsing, comment exchange, and the reciprocation of mutual favors, which ultimately leads to the growth and expansion of cross site social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Second, site use boosts the volume of site visits and traffic, allowing service providers to successfully attract advertisers for higher ad revenues. Third, members who engage in site use are likely to create user-generated-contents (UGCs) such as photos, videos, and blogs. UGCs contribute to the wealth of an online community and subsequently attract new members. Increasing network externalities for economies of scale allows social networking sites to propagate their business model for greater success.</p><p>The current study answers the following research questions: "What are the key impetuses of members' use of social networking sites?", "What are the key impediments to members' use of social networking sites?", and "How do the impetuses and impediments interact together in determining members' site use?" Drawing upon Social Exchange Theory (SET), we develop and validate a research model that provides a preliminary answer to these questions. This research makes a threefold contribution. First, it validates the value of SET in explaining member use of social networking sites. Theoretical bases such as Technology Adoption Model do not directly account for the benefit and cost factors experienced by online users that may affect their usage of collective technologies such as social networking. However, the benefit and cost factors in using networking services can be accounted for by SET <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. SET is one of the most influential theories that investigate the dynamics in social interactions and it has been widely used in information systems discipline <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90]</ref>. Despite its potential for explaining user behavior of social platforms, SET has received little attention so far. Recent reviews have emphasized problems facing SET <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. First, SET constructs have not been fully identified and critical theoretical variables were left out in many SET tests; Second, many formulations of SET are ambiguous, lending themselves to multiple interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Unfortunately, these problems are present in early studies that attempted to utilize SET in explaining user behavior within social networking context. Some studies considered SET but failed to employ SET in its entirety: cost and benefit factors were either not explicated or missing from the theoretical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>. Other studies misinterpreted the cost and benefit factors in social exchange. Benefit, for example, was often wrongly operationalized as trust, which pertains to reciprocal benefits in social exchange but is not a direct assessment of the actual benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>. Still there are other papers that incorrectly treated the assumptions (e.g., reciprocity) of SET as focal theoretical variables and tested them along with other SET variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The current study has faithfully applied SET and evidenced its value in predicting site use behavior. Through the lens of SET, we have identified perceived enjoyment and risk as the key benefit and cost that jointly determine individual use of a networking site. By analyzing the empirical data that was collected from 222 social network users, we confirm the importance of cost and benefit factors in explaining site use. Thus, this study makes a noticeable contribution to the SET literature as it answers the general calls to address SET problems by studies such as ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Meanwhile, the current study contributes to social networking literature as it reveals a valuable theoretical framework that helps analyze this emerging phenomenon.</p><p>Second, this study uncovers the interaction effect between cost and benefit in affecting end user behavior. To date, SET literature has mostly ignored the potential interplays between cost and benefit factors, and our study is the first to fill this gap. Within the social networking context, we have theorized the intricate dynamics between these two theoretical constructs. Specifically, we contend a negative moderating effect of cost on the relationship between benefit and site use. Through two statistical approaches, we analyze the empirical data and present strong evidence to support the postulated interaction effect. This has important ramifications for the social networking literature. Studies of hedonic information systems have advocated the dominant role of use experience (e.g., fun and entertainment) in predicting hedonic system use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>. Within the context of networking sites, our results confirm that performance consequences of user interactions with a hedonic system also play an essential role in shaping individual behavior. Due to the ever-growing threats of information assurance, cost (e.g. risk) has become imperative to the prediction of online system use: not only does it directly shape the use extension but it also curtails the impact of benefits on member site use. The paper therefore makes a meaningful contribution to both SET and social networking literature.</p><p>Third, the current study contributes to the literature by identifying key antecedents to the cost and benefit factors. To facilitate the analysis, we explore the precursors through a systematic multi-dimensional framework that considers imperative sources such as website designs, personal traits, and the computing environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. By surveying users of networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Friendster, we confirm that social presence, ease of use, extroversion, internet risk perception, and privacy abuse concern are significant in affecting the cost and benefit associated with site use. This set of antecedents recognizes factors (e.g. extroversion and internet risk perception) that have so far been understudied in social networking research as well as important factors that are consolidated from variables of models that earlier research developed.</p><p>Research findings in social networking sites are still scanty; Decision Support Systems is one example. Beginning in 2008, a total of 3 social networking papers have been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110]</ref>, constituting approximately 1% of the total volume of publications since 2008. Thus, research findings are highly limited and this is disproportionate to the far-reaching and transformational role of social networking sites in modern societies. New findings that are reported in this paper help build the body of knowledge in this important research area.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the subsequent section reviews the literature in social networking sites as well as the theoretical underpinning of the current study. Next we present the research model along with the research hypotheses. This is followed by research methodology and data analysis. We conclude the paper by discussing its theoretical contributions, practical implications, limitations, and venues for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Prior studies in social networking site</head><p>To date, a number of research streams exist in the domain of social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. One stream of research has examined site user self-presentation, impression management, and reputation management. Boyd conducted an ethnographic fieldwork on Friendster to study individuals' presentation of self and the status quo of presentation accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Marwick summarized the typical strategies that individuals adopt in constructing creative profiles, along with the impacts of these strategies on the collection of business intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Others have explored the typology of social networks and their development. Through an examination of 362 million messages by 4.2 million Facebook users, Golder et al. analyzed the network structure of social relationships as well as the temporal rhythm of relationship expansion <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Based on 30,773 user profiles, Lampe et al. investigated the associations between member profile attributes and the development of friendships on Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. In addition, studies have explored social networking sites through a global perspective. Krasnova and Veltri studied the differences between German and American users of social networks and found distinct variability in their cognitive patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Veltri and Elgarah investigated the differences between users from Morocco and the U.S. with respect to their perceptions and adoption of online social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>. Studies have also been conducted to understand self-disclosure behavior at social networking sites. In the application of Facebook news feed controversy, Xu et al. conceptualized the potential impact of information control and trust on information disclosure behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. By focusing on the modes of entry boundary and ingroup/ outgroup boundary, Pike et al. analyzed the impacts of perceived publicness on online self-disclosure. Further researches have explored system use of networking sites. A number of issues have been studied and they include social capitals <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, threat coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>, self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>, big-five personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, critical mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, and utilitarian values <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. While the existing literature generates interesting findings, they are also limited in several ways which gives room for further improvement. First, several of these studies have examined use intention but not the actual use behavior. The extant literature in information systems has evidenced that use intention may not predict use behavior due to reasons such as behavioral control <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>. Second, theoretical underpinnings that are used in the existing studies are limited since many of the studies are based upon the Technology Adoption Model, which is limited in explaining the use of leisure and hedonic information systems such as social networking sites. Third, prior studies have mostly explored either positive or negative impetus of site use but failed to explain use phenomenon by considering both positive and negative stimulus, leading to an incomplete understanding of site use. New research is therefore needed to further the investigation of networking site use through alternative theoretical foundations and through comprehensive research frameworks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Theoretical background</head><p>Social Exchange Theory (SET) is one of the most influential theories that investigate the dynamics in social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. SET assumes that individuals are goal-oriented and that their choice of social interaction is a subjective calculus of the social or material resources being exchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. These resources may be tangible or intangible and they may include time, effort, reputation, enjoyment, honor, and friendship, and they are the currency of social exchanges. According to SET, individuals proactively seek to maximize their benefits and minimize their costs when exchanging resources with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Benefits refer to those resources that one receives as a result of social exchange or positive outcomes of an exchange, whereas cost refers to those resources that one gives away during a social exchange or any adverse outcomes of an exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Individuals engage in interpersonal relationships only when the expected gain is greater than the expected cost. The benefits may not be achieved at the onset of social interactions since individuals tend to engage in exchanges with an expectation of reciprocity from the others <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. SET has been used recently in the field of information systems at both individual and organization levels to investigate phenomenon such as knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>, software development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and system evaluation and use <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90]</ref>.</p><p>The tenets of SET have an important implication for the current study. Use in a networking site implies active participation in social interactions with the online community. Therefore, SET is relevant to the studies of social networking site use. When applied, SET posits that individuals' site use may result in an exchange process in which the members maximize gains while minimizing losses. Among others, the existing literature of social networking sites has highlighted enjoyment as a key benefit for online users who join networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Prior studies have also underlined the major source of cost in site use as risks, which may be due to information security and privacy threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. In this paper, we analyze an individual's voluntary use of social networking sites through the theoretical lens of SET.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>Drawing upon SET, we develop a research model that explains member use of a social networking site. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> suggests that individuals enjoy the use of a networking site at the cost of risks. Moreover, risk in site use may attenuate the relationship between enjoyment and site use. The research model also advocates that website designs such as social presence, ease of use, and personality traits such as extroversion contribute to enjoyment. Further, this model postulates that personal beliefs of the computing environment such as Internet risk perception and privacy abuse concern will impact one's perceived risk in using a social networking site.</p><p>A key benefit in social networking site use is the perceived enjoyment. In this paper, perceived enjoyment is defined as the extent to which the activity of using a social networking site is perceived to be enjoyable in its own right, apart from any associated performance consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The definition of perceived enjoyment specifies the extent to which fun can be derived from using a networking site and it should not be mistaken as the net benefit (e.g. benefit minus cost) in system use <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. It is often referred to as the hedonic component of an information system <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>. When a networking site is concerned, this platform allows individuals to interact with friends and family, exchange messages, pictures, and videos, and to participate in groups and events. The use of these sites is therefore hedonic as users experience fun and entertainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>. Moon and Kim found that individuals who enjoy a web system will view their interactions with the system more positive and form a high behavior intention to use it <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. And thus we expect that members are more inclined to use a networking site when he or she finds it enjoyable.</p><p>H1. Enjoyment will positively relate to site use. Literature suggests that system design such as social presence is instrumental in shaping user experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Social presence is defined as the extent to which a computer medium allows a user to experience the others as being psychologically present <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Prior studies have identified website designs that facilitate the establishment of social presence, including emotive text and pictures <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, personalized greetings <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, human audio <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, and human video <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Lombard and Ditton suggested that one of the most prominent psychological impacts of social presence is enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. Yoo and Alavi also noted that social presence fosters a psychological connection between users and a web system, and renders the latter more fond <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. Prior studies in e-commerce context have presented preliminary evidence on the impact of social presence on enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. We expect the similar to hold in the current context: H2. Social presence will positively relate to enjoyment.</p><p>Meanwhile, user perceived enjoyment in networking site use may be enhanced by the ease of system use <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Ease of use is defined as the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Ease of use is neither a direct benefit nor a cost in site use while its opposite, "effort of use," may be considered as a part of the cost of using information systems from the users' perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Van der Heijden suggested that ease of use enhances user's hedonic experience (e.g. enjoyment in using social networking sites) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. Teo et al. suggested that "systems that are difficult to use are less likely to be perceived as enjoyable" (pp. 27) <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. Following Deci's Motivational Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and motivational model of technology acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, literature has accumulated preliminary evidence on the potential relationship between ease of use and enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>. We therefore posit: H3. Ease of use will positively relate to enjoyment.</p><p>In addition, perceived enjoyment may be cultivated by personal traits such as extroversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. Extroversion is defined as positive emotion, urgency, and tendency to seek out stimulation and the company of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This personality is discerned by manifest engagement with the outside world as extroverts enjoy being with people. Social networking sites offer rich communication features such as texting, video sharing, email, and blog. These designs render a network site an ideal platform for individuals to express themselves, enjoy social events, affirm relationships, and extend personal networks. When presented with these opportunities, an extrovert member will take advantage of them to better meet his or her social needs. Rosen and Kluemper suggested that social networking sites are instrumental and useful for extroverts to assert themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. It is therefore argued that members who are extroverts will be more likely to appreciate the value of a social networking site and enjoy their engagement. And thus we posit:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk</head><p>H4. Extroversion will positively relate to enjoyment.</p><p>Using social networking sites comes with a cost, as members may consider it risky <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Perceived risk is defined as the extent to which there is an uncertainty in significant and disappointing outcomes that may be realized <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Prior studies have pointed out that users of networking sites are subject to malware, spam and phishing, data theft, and content alternation. Consequently, they may experience emotional discomfort, monetary loss, or reputational damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. Numerous accounts of social networking site members being attacked were reported in the past. In 2010, for example, several thousand Facebook users were attacked by a click jacking scam <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. Therefore, risk is high in using these websites and it is deemed as a significant cost that may discourage users from continuous participation. MySpace, for example, was reported to lose members after spam artists started using profiles as bait for illicit websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. We postulate: H5. Perceived risk will negatively relate to site use.</p><p>We expect that risks stemming from the use of a social networking site may moderate the relationship between enjoyment and site use. That is, the relationship between enjoyment and site use is a function of perceived risk. When risk is perceived to be low, online users' use behavior may be largely motivated by fun and enjoyment that is experienced during their interactions. When risk is perceived to be high, however, one may become hesitant to use a social networking site regardless of their own assessment of the enjoyment. Even with high perceived enjoyment, for example, users may decline site participation in case the likelihood of adverse consequences is substantial. That is, the predicting power of enjoyment on site use may weaken when perceived risks grow. Therefore we expect: H6. Perceived risk in site use will negatively moderate the relationship between enjoyment and site use. Perception of risk in using a social networking site may be shaped by individuals' belief of the computing environment. Internet risk perception measures one's uneasiness about using Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. Internet is known for the parlance of cyber threats which significantly jeopardize online users and businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. Internet risk perception may lead decision makers to exaggerate uncertainties in networking sites, exhibit unwarranted confidence in their judgment, and subsequently overestimate the risks in using social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. Members of social networking sites have varying levels of Internet risk perception as a result of their prior Internet use (e.g. online shopping) and outcome history. It is common for one to become reluctant to use a networking site because the sense of Internet risk may be overwhelming. Therefore we expect: H7. Internet risk perception will positively relate to perceived risk in site use.</p><p>Perceived risk may also stem from concern about privacy abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Privacy abuse concern reflects one's uneasiness about the potential opportunistic behavior related to his or her personal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The concern of privacy abuse is conceptually different from perceived risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref> as it does not assess uncertainty as its objective. Users' privacy abuse concern may range from being unconcerned (indifferent) to highly concerned (fretful). It is influenced by a wide range of factors that do not relate to the contextual uncertainties. An example of an influential factor is an individual's value of privacy, ranging from low to high, which refers to the importance that an individual places on personal privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Interactions on networking sites give rise to privacy release as one publicly discloses identity, private interest, and personal opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Unfortunately, privacy protection has been unsatisfactory due to the lack of control features and sound policy design. Facebook, for example, employed a transitive relation Friend of a Friend design that left member information flow to unintended parties without awareness and consensus. Divulged privacy may be subsequently used against one's will for purposes such as stalking, embarrassment, and extortion. Online users who are concerned about their privacy tend to overrate the uncertainty in using networking sites and consider a rather small probability of privacy abuse as significant. Therefore we expect: H8. Privacy abuse concern will positively relate to perceived risk in site use.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Measurement development</head><p>Measurement items for the principal constructs in this study were borrowed directly from existing measures to ensure validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. The detailed measurements and their sources of the principal constructs are shown in Appendix A. The survey instruments were pretested with 60 users of a social networking site to check the psychometric properties of the measurement scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Following these pretests, the measurement instruments were shortened, refined, and validated for their statistical properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Survey administration</head><p>The research model was tested using survey data. We collected survey responses from 222 undergraduate students who took undergraduate courses at a large institution in the Midwestern United States. College students are a significant segment of social networking site users. A recent Pew survey shows that college students represent the largest portion of Facebook users <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Also, 85% of U.S. college students use Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Thus, the student sample is appropriate for the current research. The respondents were recruited from four undergraduate courses that were offered in a business college. The samples consist of business and non-business undergraduate majors, the samples are therefore heterogeneous. Respondents were guaranteed both confidentiality and access to the aggregated survey results. Participation in the survey was voluntary. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides the descriptions on respondent demographic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Analysis and results</head><p>We tested the research model using structural equation modeling analysis. We used partial least squares (PLS), which employ a componentbased approach for estimation. PLS has an advantage as it "involves no assumptions about the population or scale of measurement" <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. And thus it works without distributional assumptions and works with nominal, ordinal, and interval scaled variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Cassel et al. confirmed that PLS is robust against inadequacies (e.g. skewness and multicollinearity) and that latent variable scores conform to true values <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, PLS is best suited for examining complex relationships (e.g. large number of variables and an interaction effect in current research model) by avoiding inadmissible solutions and factor indeterminacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Measurement model</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reports the correlation matrix, the AVEs, and the descriptive statistics of the principal constructs. Measurement reliability is assessed using composite reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> and Cronbach's alpha <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Fornell and Larcker suggested that a composite reliability of .70 or greater is considered acceptable for research <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Nunnally suggested that a Cronbach's alpha of .70 or greater is considered acceptable for research <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. As in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the internal consistencies of all variables are considered acceptable since they exceed .70, signifying satisfactory reliability.</p><p>Convergent and discriminant validity are inferred when (1) the AVE square root of each construct is larger than its correlations with the other constructs (i.e., the AVE shared between the construct and its indicators is larger than the AVE shared between the construct and the other items); (2) all AVEs are greater than .50; and (3) the PLS indicators load much higher on their hypothesized construct than on other constructs (i.e., own loadings are higher than cross loadings) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the square roots of the AVE are all greater than 0.5 and greater than all other cross correlations, indicating that the variance explained by each construct is much larger than the measurement error variance. As in Appendix B, all items load high on their own constructs. These tests validate the measurement properties of principal constructs.</p><p>Because the research data was collected from a single survey, we checked the extent of common method bias. First, the Harman's one-factor test was performed by including all the variables in a principal components factor analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. Common method bias exists when one single factor emerges or when one factor accounts for the majority of the covariance among the variables. The results showed that none of the emergent factors explained the majority of the covariance. Second, the partial correlation method was performed by adding the highest factor that was produced in the principal component factor analysis into the PLS model as a control variable. This factor did not significantly increase the variance explained by the research model, indicating no common method bias. Third, the correlation matrix was examined for highly correlated factors. The common method bias exists when these are extremely high correlations (r &gt; .9). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> does not reveal such evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Structural model</head><p>The PLS path coefficients are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. All these paths are statistically significant. The structural model explains 24% of the variance in enjoyment, 40% of variance in risk, and 18% of variance in site use. The theoretical model thus offers satisfactory explanatory power in capturing the site use of social networking sites.</p><p>The PLS results found that social presence (b =.37, p b .001), ease of use (b= .14, p b .05), and extroversion (b= .16, p b .01) jointly affected enjoyment perceived by members of a social networking site. Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4 are therefore supported. Further, Internet risk perception (b = .56, p b .001) and privacy abuse concern (b = .15, p b .01) were found to positively affect an individual's perception of risk in a social networking site. Hypotheses 7 and 8 are thus supported. Moreover, the results indicated that enjoyment (b = .41, p b .001) and risk (b = -.11, p b .05) impacted site use, supporting hypotheses 1 and 5.</p><p>We followed the PLS product-indicator approach by Chin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to test the moderated relationship (H6). The newly created interaction construct was found to attenuate the relationship between enjoyment and site use (b = -.18, p b .05). We then followed Carte and Russell <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to test whether the variance explained due to the moderated effects was significant beyond the main effects, using the following F-statistics. The F test statistics was 8.93 (p b .01). The tests of moderating effect thus provided support to the postulated moderating effect of risk on the relationship between enjoyment and site use (H6).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F df interaction -df main ; N-df interaction -1 ð Þ ¼ ΔR 2 = df interaction -df main ð Þ 1-R 2 interaction À Á = N-df interaction -1 ð Þ</formula><p>Overall the results provide strong evidence to support the research model that is proposed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>Social networking sites provide an open platform to accommodate online users and enable them to develop interpersonal networks and enjoy friendship <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. Social networking sites continue increasing in popularity. The latest Pew worldwide survey showed that 47% of online adults used social networking sites and 73% of teens and young adults were a member of at least one social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. A 2010 Nielsen report found that the world spent over 110 billion minutes on social networks and the numbers of people visiting these sites increased by 24% over last year <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. To sustain the success of a social networking site, it is important that members continuously and constantly access and use the site to maintain its vitality. Site use leads to members' active engagement in communal activities, growth and expansion of cross-site social relationships, increased volume of site visits and traffic, and an accumulation of user generated digital content. Despite its strategic importance, site use may be limited as the members constantly weigh the potential benefits and costs embedded in their participation. Recent studies confirmed that members had started reducing their use and even abandoned social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Drawing upon SET, the current study explores member voluntary use of a networking site through a cost-benefit framework.</p><p>Thus, the research model developed highlights enjoyment as the key benefit that motivates site use and stresses risk as the major inhibitor. It also suggests that the presence of risk may attenuate the relationship between enjoyment and site use. In addition, the research model posits that website designs (e.g. social presence and ease of use) and personal traits (e.g. extroversion) jointly affect enjoyment whereas personal belief of the environment (e.g. Internet risk perception and privacy abuse concern) determines the degree of perceived risk in site use. We collected survey data from 222 social networking site users to validate this research model and found strong support on all the research hypotheses.</p><p>This study makes a threefold contribution. First, it proves the value of SET in explaining member use of social networking sites. Prior studies on social networks have largely ignored the theoretical value of SET in explaining individual decision making and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Findings that are reported in this study have evidenced the importance of social exchange in shaping members' site use. The research confirms that perceived enjoyment and risk are the two sources that affect one's usage of a networking site. Second, this study uncovers the interaction effect between cost (i.e., risk) and benefit (i.e., enjoyment) in affecting end user behavioral outcome. The existing literature on SET has mostly focused on the direct impacts of cost and benefit, yet seldom investigated their interplay. The current study fills this gap by capturing the intricate dynamics between the two theoretical constructs. Third, this study contributes to the literature on social networking sites by identifying the key antecedents to members' use of a site. We find that website design features, personal traits, and beliefs of the computing environment all influence one's use choice. New knowledge augments the prior literature to provide an improved understanding of why one will choose to access online social networks at the era of Web 2.0.</p><p>The current study also informs practice. Site use adds vital support to the sustainable success of networking sites and social network service providers may stimulate the use extent by cultivating perceived member enjoyment. To increase users' enjoyment, service providers may increase website social presence through the adoption of emotive text, human pictures, personalized greetings, and human audio video <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. Meanwhile, service providers may consider website design choices that boost the ease of use. Facebook, for example, recently altered the top menu and left column on its homepage to offer improved site navigation and ease of information access <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Other designs such as simplified page views, inline filtering, customized services, and one-click actions will allow members to perform their tasks at higher efficiency. Further, networking site providers may encourage member extroversion to foster increased enjoyment. Psychology literature pointed out that personality is malleable and may be reformed given proper motivations from the task environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. To this end, site wide campaigns that promote an open, social, interactive, and responsive culture is likely to inspire members to turn more extroverted and subsequently better appreciate the fun in using networking sites.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is imperative that networking service providers effectively alleviate member perceived risks in using the systems. Our research notes that an individual's Internet risk perception affects his or her site use risk perception. To this end, public awareness and educational campaigns may be exercised. Educational campaigns are suggested to improve end user knowledge and skills in combating Internet threats and consequently reduce the perceived risks of being attacked <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref>. Awareness programs help remove the cognitive bias pertaining to Internet risks and cultivate a healthy and accurate risk assessment. Our findings also suggest that members' perception of site use risk grows out of concerns for privacy abuse. Prior studies suggested that appropriate policy designs may reduce the likelihood of privacy breach and avoid subsequent abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>. Vendors may also protect member privacy through technical solutions by using privacy-aware system architecture and software features that offer users the ability to search and query information, reasoning about intelligent actions with respect to privacy preservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Our study has certain limitations that should be noted. First, the current study utilizes subjective survey data to assess Internet users' self-disclosure behavior at a networking site. In his study of social networks, Whinston noted that self-reports "reveal information that the user is willing to provide which might be biased or even inconsistent with her actual opinion or behavior" <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. Future research may employ objective measurements to assess the actual site use behavior of the research samples. Second, new research may employ samples of a wider diversity. While college students present the largest portion of Facebook users, teenagers and adults over age 22 are all actively engaged in Facebook. It is important to validate the research model among these populations to identify whether the impetus of self-disclosure is uniform across different age groups. Third, future studies may consider recruiting users of other social networking sites. Survey respondents in the current study are predominantly Facebook users and hence the empirical data mostly describes user behavior of Facebook population. Thus, the results must be treated with caution in terms of its generalizability to the entire population of social networking sites. To understand social networking sites as a whole, it is imperative that new studies employ research samples from other social networking sites that are underrepresented in the current study. Fourth, the current sample consists of 60% males and 40% females. A recent Pew report suggested a higher proportion of female users (56%) and a lower proportion of male users (44%) of social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The observed difference in gender distribution may be caused by the unique school environment that was used in data collection. And thus the results must be treated with caution in terms of its generalizability to the entire population of social networking sites. Future studies should consider gender distributions in designing sample collecting schemes. New research may also study how site usage may be correlated with the quality and quantity of whatever joy a user can get from a social network site. New knowledge will help practitioners understand the key resources that are likely to be exchanged at social networking sites and subsequently develop strategies and designs to facilitate these exchanges. While a full examination of this research issue is beyond the scope of the current paper, as we are primarily concerned about the outcomes (i.e., benefits and costs) of the resource exchange process and their contributions to the use behavior, we provide a preliminary data analysis on the relationship between usage and examples of the enjoyable such as relevant information that is retrieved from using a networking site. Foa and Foa's Resource Theory considered information as a major type of resources in an exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. The empirical results reveal that the quality of information retrieved (b= .36, p b .001), measured by ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) "I can obtain information of the others" and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) "I can collect information that I am interested of" using a 7-point Likert scale, is significantly associated with site use. Findings as such provide some initial evidence and directions for future research to systematically validate the relationship between usage and the key enjoyable. Lastly, future studies may consider other benefit factors that members may enjoy during their interaction with social networking sites. Users may use social networking sites for a variety of reasons besides obtaining the hedonic utility. However, a systematic survey of those benefit factors requires the application of alternative theoretical frameworks and is therefore beyond the scope of the current study.</p></div>
