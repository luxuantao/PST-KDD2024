<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Wireless-communication technology can be used to improve road safety and to provide Internet access inside vehicles. This paper proposes a cross-layer protocol called coordinated external peer communication (CEPEC) for Internet-access services and peer communications for vehicular networks. We assume that IEEE 802.16 base stations (BS) are installed along highways and that the same air interface is equipped in vehicles. Certain vehicles locating outside of the limited coverage of their nearest BSs can still get access to the Internet via a multihop route to their BSs. For Internet-access services, the objective of CEPEC is to increase the end-to-end throughput while providing a fairness guarantee in bandwidth usage among road segments. To achieve this goal, the road is logically partitioned into segments of equal length. A relaying head is selected in each segment that performs both local-packet collecting and aggregated packets relaying. The simulation results have shown that the proposed CEPEC protocol provides higher throughput with guaranteed fairness in multihop data delivery in vehicular networks when compared with the purely IEEE 802.16-based protocol.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>V EHICLES are an essential part of people's everyday life.</p><p>Much work has been conducted to provide a common platform facilitating intervehicle communications (IVCs) or intelligent transportation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. IVC is necessary to realize traffic-condition monitoring, dynamic route scheduling, emergency-message dissemination, and, most importantly, safe driving. Safety communication is essential for IVC, and dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) is a key enabling technology for it. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provides an overview of the nature of intervehicle safety communications and draws a roadmap for its communication-protocol design. In-vehicle networks are also researched to support growing number of equipped wireless products in a vehicle <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. As mobile wireless devices and networks become increasingly important, the demand for Internet access and communications to outside vehicular networks from vehicles is also increasing. Providing sufficient quality of service (QoS) for safety applications while concurrently supporting Internet access or other commercial services is one of the major goals of future vehicular networks. Internet access from vehicles requires roadside infrastructure to enable vehicle-roadside communication (VRC). Prototype systems and data-delivery protocols supporting VRC have been proposed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A wireless-communication architecture and protocol are proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to provide both safety and commercial services.</p><p>In terms of the wireless technologies utilized, while the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> adopts Bluetooth to facilitate short-range communication between fast moving vehicles, the vast majority of research works use IEEE 802.11 as their medium-access-control (MAC) layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This is largely due to the fact that IEEE 802.11 is recommended by DSRC systems as the default protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, the contention nature of IEEE 802.11 generally renders itself hard to provide guaranteed QoS. In this paper, we consider a vehicular network that accesses the Internet through fixed roadside IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> base stations (BSs). These BSs are further connected to the Internet via Internet service gateways (ISGs), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Different service providers and content providers are connected to the Internet. Apart from utilizing commercial services, in-vehicle drivers or passengers can also communicate with individual peers at home or offices. We assume that these houses and offices are also connected to the Internet. Each vehicle is equipped with an IEEE 802.16 air-interface card and is a subscriber station (SS). Although IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> has not been considered by standardization bodies as an enabling technology for vehicular networks, which we believe is largely due to its higher level of complexity than IEEE 802.11, and being a relatively new technology, it stands as a very competitive alternative technology for wireless data communication in vehicular networks, owing to its inherent richness in QoS support and other functionalities. We hope that this paper could cast some light on the potential of using IEEE 802.16 in vehicular networks. With high data rate, large network coverage, strong QoS capabilities, and cheap network deployment and maintenance costs, IEEE 802.16 is viewed as a disruptive wireless technology and has many potential applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Depending on the applications and network investment, IEEE 802.16 networks can be configured to work in different modes, point-tomultipoint (PMP) or mesh mode. In the PMP mode, a BS serves multiple SSs if the SSs can be covered by the BS. In the mesh mode, traffic demands are aggregated at a set of SS nodes and eventually delivered to a set of BSs, which can function in the PMP mode. These BSs can be connected by a backhaul and then to ISG nodes, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Mesh networks offer increased reliability, coverage, and reduced network costs. We consider multihop mesh networks in this paper.</p><p>One of the main goals for VRC network design and operation is to maximize delivered traffic or throughput to the Internet. However, maximizing throughput over multiple hops may cause "far-node starvation" problem, where packets originating from nodes far away from a BS are ignored, particularly when data-transmission demands from nodes closer to the BS are high. To avoid this situation, fairness also needs to be considered.</p><p>In this paper, we present a cross-layer protocol designed mainly for VRC. In particular, it is aimed for data delivery between vehicles on highway and the peers that are outside the current highway and are connected to the Internet. We name this protocol as coordinated external peer-communication (CEPEC) protocol for vehicular networks. CEPEC spans physical layer, MAC layer, and network layer. This is determined by the nature of the problem tackled by CEPEC, i.e., multiple accesses to the shared IEEE 802.16 channels in one-hop scope (MAC layer) and data relaying and routing in multihop scope (network layer). Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is a built-in mechanism of IEEE 802.16 that is a concern of physical layer, although the presentation of how AMC works falls out of the scope of this paper. Rather than dealing with each layer separately, we adopt the methodology of cross-layer design as it is widely regarded a promising technique for wireless networks. The major objective of CEPEC is to increase the endto-end throughput in IEEE 802.16-enabled VRC while ensuring fairness guarantee in bandwidth usage among road sections. The simulation results show the benefit of employing crosslayer design method.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. Based on discussion on existing work, Section II further clarifies the problem to be solved in this paper and presents the network model adopted. Section III details the operation of the proposed CEPEC protocol. Section IV discusses transmission scheduling within a segment in terms of how time is allocated to each phase of the CEPEC operation. After the presentation of the results of our intensive simulations in Section V, this paper is concluded in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Definition</head><p>As far as IEEE 802.16 is concerned, works have been conducted on providing Internet services using different QoSsupporting scheduling algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> evaluates the performance of the IEEE 802.16 MAC for QoS support in PMP mode. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> investigate the mesh mode but using distributed and centralized scheduler, respectively. These research works assumed one of the distinctive characteristics of Internet access being the asymmetry of traffic between downlink (from BSs to SSs) and uplink (from SSs to BSs). Downlink load is usually much higher than uplink load, and therefore, downlink usually becomes the performance bottleneck. The majority of the works in the literature is dedicated to solving this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This paper focuses on another equally important issue arising in vehicular networks, i.e., data transmission from moving vehicles on highways to peers connected to the Internet. These peers are typically not commercial service/content providers but are individuals such as the driver/passenger's family members or colleagues. We call this type of communication as external peer communication (EPC). In EPC, for instance, an in-vehicle passenger can instantly send what he or she has camera-recorded along the road to his/her family at home. In this case, uplink is not just for transmitting control and signaling messages. It can be congested and become a throughput bottleneck when many vehicles start uploading bulky data. In this paper, we focus on data transmissions over uplink. Furthermore, this uplink consists of multiple hops to a BS. The goal is to maximize the end-to-end throughput to the Internet subject to bandwidth usage fairness.</p><p>This paper is largely inspired by the Controlled Vehicular Internet Access (CVIA) protocol, which utilizes IEEE 802.11 Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Road segments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. While CVIA presents a neat solution to fair communications between an ISG and mobile nodes within the gateway's service range, it suffers from the following drawbacks. First, data relaying is also needed within segments and this leads to longer delay. Second, it is practically difficult to select two routers in a segment that satisfy the following two conditions: 1) The routers should be as close to the segment borders as possible, and 2) they need to stay inside the segment during the active period of the segment given their high moving speeds. Third, the way fairness is measured is at segment level and ignores the unevenness of traffic requests from different vehicles. A fairer means should also reflect the traffic differences among vehicles within a segment.</p><p>As in CVIA, the section of the highway concerned is divided into segments (or meshes) of equal length in CEPEC, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Different from CVIA, all the segments in our vehicular networks can be active segments since we adopt IEEE 802.16 as the MAC layer as such that there is no hidden terminal problem. Segments serve two purposes in this paper: 1) providing a measurement unit for bandwidth usage fairness and 2) acting as clusters to fulfill cluster-based routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Each segment has a vehicle acting as a segment head (SH). The other vehicles in a segment are called segment SSs (SSSs). In comparison with CVIA, where there are two relay routers, there is only one relaying router (i.e., the SH) in each segment.</p><p>To reduce the cost incurred for installation of roadside BSs while still providing high-data-rate VRC, we allow a vehicle locating outside of the limited coverage of its nearest BS to get access to the Internet via a multihop route to this BS. Therefore, a BS can provide services to an area that goes beyond its physical transmission range by several times. We call this area as service coverage (SvC) of a BS. Formally, we define SvC as the radius of the area of a BS, where it provides Internet access and EPC services. SvC is measured by the number of segments N . BSs periodically send existence announcement packets (EAP) to indicate their availability in their SvCs. A vehicle that picks up this EAP registers itself with the BS. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates an SvC that is composed of seven segments: S 1 -S 7 . The segment next to the BS is denoted as S 1 . These segments are of equal length L. R denotes the physical transmission range of the vehicles and BSs. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> also illustrates an example of the relationship of L and R.</p><p>Given the aforementioned vehicular-network infrastructure, the goal of this paper is to maximize the end-to-end throughput in SvC to its BS while guaranteeing bandwidth usage fairness across segments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Network Model</head><p>The network model employed in this paper is briefed as follows.</p><p>1) Each vehicle is equipped with a global-positioningsystem (GPS) device for time synchronization and providing vehicle positions. When a vehicle enters into the SvC of a BS, it registers itself with the BS.</p><p>2) The physical layer of mesh mode uses time-division multiple access (TDMA) for channel allocation. It also supports AMC, where the link data rate can be changed depending on channel conditions to meet the desired biterror-rate (BER) requirement. AMC is carried out via burst profile of a link that defines modulation schemes and coding rates. 3) Time-division duplex is utilized to share the channel between uplink and downlink. 4) A mesh frame consists of a control and a data subframe, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. The multiple-access scheme at the radio interface is orthogonal frequency-division multiple access, where the channel bandwidth is divided into a number of orthogonal subcarriers. Some carriers are used for control message such as for channel establishment.</p><p>Most are used for data transmissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED PROTOCOL-CEPEC</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Overview</head><p>CEPEC is a multihop cluster-based protocol. Each segment represents a cluster, and data delivery from vehicles to a BS is carried out on a segment-to-segment basis. All packets collected locally from segment S i (denoted as LP i ) are aggregated with the packets received from the neighboring segment S i+1 to generate an aggregated packet AP i . Then, AP i is forwarded to S i-1 . The packets received from S i+1 are actually AP i+1 , so we have AP i = LP 1 + AP i+1 , where "+" means packet aggregation. Note that the numbering notations used here, such as i, i -1, and i + 1, are for uplink. The smaller i is, the closer a segment or a packet is to the BS.</p><p>In each segment S i , a vehicle is selected as the head of this segment-denoted as SH i . SH i (i = 1, . . . , N -1) carries out the following functions: 1) receiving packets AP i+1 from S i+1 ; 2) collecting LP i from the local segment S i ; 3) aggregating LP i with AP i+1 into AP i ; and 4) forwarding AP i to SH i-1 in S i-1 . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> illustrates this procedure. SHs have to be selected in such a manner so that SH i and SH i+1 are within the transmission ranges of each other. If L = 2R/3 and SHs are located at the centers of segments, then the average distance between two SHs is 2R/3. This leaves a maximum of 1R/3 space for two adjacent SHs to be away from the centers (more discussions on the selection of L is presented in Section IV).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Protocol Operation</head><p>In CEPEC, each segment S i normally goes through six phases as a lifecycle, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. The lifecycle of all segments has a fixed duration T dur , which is divided into several portions to accommodate the various functions carried   in different phases of a segment. If we ignore the time used for local-packet processing in phase 5, which is very short and negligible in comparison to other phases, we have the following: T dur = a i + b i + h i + c i . The meaning of each variable is explained as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Inactive phase: A segment becomes inactive for duration</head><p>w i if no time slot is allocated to it. In CEPEC, inactive phase is employed to ensure no interference from S i to the ongoing data transmission in the neighboring segments. The duration of w i depends on the scheduling algorithms. If a mesh frame can be shared by multiple segments, then w i can be very small. Otherwise, w i can be as long as the duration of a segment's lifecycle. 2) Intersegment packet-receiving phase: In CEPEC, each S i (i = N ) needs to relay packets from S i+1 in uplink. S N , as the farthermost segment away from the BS, does not have this phase. After S i becomes active, SH i starts receiving packets from SH i+1 . The collection of the packets received is AP i+1 . In TDMA-based IEEE 802.16, the AP-sending phase of SH i+1 can be synchronized to the AP-receiving phase of SH i . A time interval of a i is reserved for this purpose. The choice of the length of a i depends on a few factors, of which the main ones are as follows: the amount of traffic to be relayed from SH i+1 to SH i , the fairness mechanism, and the number of hops to the BS and the bandwidth capacity of the BS. The calculation of a i is presented in next section. 3) Local-packet-collecting (LPC) phase of duration b i : After receiving AP i+1 from SH i+1 , the vehicles start competing for transmission opportunities in the control subframe (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). The vehicles that are successfully granted a transmission opportunity can send their datatransmission requests to SH i . These requests can include information about service types such as unsolicited grant service, real-time polling service (rtPS), non-rtPS, or best effort (BE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> so that appropriate AMC scheme and time-slot allocation can be scheduled. In this paper, our focus is on bandwidth usage fairness, and therefore, we assume that all traffics are of same type (BE) and, thus, have the same priority. But this assumption can be easily relaxed, provided that a QoS-supporting algorithm, such as the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, is available. Upon receipt of the requests, a scheduling algorithm is activated to allocate time slots to vehicles. In CEPEC, a centralized-scheduling algorithm is used within a segment to control the transmission of data between SHs and SSSs. The scheduler works out a time-slot allocation plan based on TDMA without spectral reuse and then distributes it to the SSSs. This plan also includes burst profiles, as the SH also collects channel-condition information when receiving resource requests from SSSs. One time slot contains multiple orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing (OFDM) symbols (refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for details on a centralized scheduler for IEEE 802.16 mesh networks). Using the time slot allocated, vehicles in S i send their data packets directly to SH i . All these packets received by SH i are aggregated into LP i . 4) AP generating phase: In this phase, AP i+1 and LP i received in phases 2 and 3, respectively, are merged together to create a new AP: AP i . Only some local processing is performed in this phase, so the duration for this phase is neglected. 5) Next head-selection phase: Before AP i is transmitted to S i-1 (or BS if the current segment is S 1 ), SH i-1 needs to be selected. In this phase, vehicles in S i-1 start to compete to become the SH i-1 . Before competition, each vehicle calculates the segment ID it belongs to using</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">i v = |x v -x BS |/L + 1 (1)</formula><p>where x v is the X-coordination of vehicle v obtained from its onboard GPS, and x BS is the BS's X-coordination obtained via the BS's EAP. x is a means to get the ground value of x. A BS periodically broadcasts the following information to all vehicles within its SvC: its capacity C, the number of segments N , and the segment length L if these parameters are tunable dynamically. Otherwise, they can be informed of to vehicles by the BS when vehicles register themselves with the BS. In our simulations, the latter case is employed. It is noted that not all vehicles within a segment compete for being an SH. A competing vehicle v has to satisfy the following two conditions. a) C1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x v + (a i + b i + c i ) × V max &lt; x b-</formula><p>i , where x b- i is the X-coordinate of the segment border that is closer to the BS. Subscript i denotes the segment ID, where vehicle v is located in. V max denotes the maximum velocity of vehicles. b) C2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">|x C i -s v | &lt; d, where d = |x C i -s a | ∧ a ∈ S i ∧ a = v.</formula><p>C1 is applied first to eliminate these vehicles that might move outside of the segment within the segment's lifecycle. Then, C2 is applied on the vehicles left over from C1. C2 is to ensure that the vehicle that is closest to the segment center is selected. The X-coordinate of the segment center point of S i is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x C i = (i -1) × L + L/2. (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>To further reduce the number of competing vehicles, we can define, as a first filtering mechanism before applying C1 and C2, that only these vehicles that fall into the SH zone (SHZ) can get involved in the SH competition. SHZ is a portion of S i centered at x C i and l distance away from x C i . The value of l depends on vehicle density and speed. In our simulations, we used l = 1L/6. This means that, statistically, about one third of the vehicles compete for SH against C1 and C2. 6) Intersegment packet-sending phase: In this phase, AP i is forwarded to SH i-1 . In CEPEC, duration of c i is reserved for this phase. c i should be long enough to forward packets from both local segment and packets collected from other preceding segments.</p><p>Intersegment packet transmission is also used for IVC, where communication takes place between vehicles located in two different segments. Communication between vehicles within the same segment occurs directly without resorting to any intermediate nodes. Intersegment communication involves a simple routing algorithm. This routing algorithm performs data transmission following the procedure given as follows: from a source vehicle to its SH, from SH(s) to SH(s + 1) until arriving at the SH of the destination segment, and, finally, from this SH to the destination vehicle. In terms of EPC, the destination concerned in this paper is the BS, namely, SH 1 needs to transmit AP 1 to the BS as the last hop. This process is similar to the clusterbased routing algorithms in mobile ad hoc networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, but it is much simplified in terms of head selection and intracluster routing given a linear node topology in vehicular networks and the fact that L is set smaller than R. Within a segment, data is directed to SHs in uplink and from SHs in downlink.</p><p>There is no LPC phase in downlink transmissions as all packets originate from one common source: the BS. In each segment, some packets are stripped out of the AP and a shorter AP keeps on moving away from the BS until to the last segment S N , where all the remaining packets are disseminated to the vehicles within S N .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Fairness</head><p>Packets originated from vehicles locating at S i (i = 2, . . . , N) have to go through i segments to reach the BS. Packets that travel shorter distance to the BS take advantages of those that travel longer distance to the BS. Bandwidth-usage fairness across segments needs to be provided. In CEPEC, given a fixed overall bandwidth capacity at the BS (denoted as C), each segment is granted an equal portion of C, namely, C/N . Here, C represents the amount of traffic that this BS is allowed to transmit to the Internet.</p><p>As to the approach to quantify fairness, there are various measures in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We choose Jain et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> fairness index (FI) due to the same reasons explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Denoted as the throughput of S i , FI is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">FI = N i=1 Thr i 2 N N i=1 Thr 2 i (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where we have, obviously, 0 ≤ FI ≤ 1.</p><p>Similar to the SvC level, at the segment level, all vehicles within a segment that have packets to transmit must share the C/N amount of bandwidth. Different from the above absolutebandwidth allocation, SH allocates bandwidth to requesting vehicles in proportion to their packet-transmission requirements.</p><p>Denote the overall requested packet transmission in S i as Req i . An equal proportion p = (C/N )/Req i of each vehicle's requested packet is transmitted to SH i . The untransmitted packets are kept in vehicle buffers for transmission in following time slot(s). This is for saturation status where Req i &gt; C/N. In situations where Req i ≤ C/N , all Req i is transmitted, regardless of their origins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Handoff</head><p>Since an SH is also a normal fast-moving vehicle, it is not wise to let an SH buffer unsent data from in-segment vehicles. Otherwise, when a new SH is selected, handoff has to take place to transfer unsent data to the new SH. To avoid handoffs, all the data to be transmitted from vehicles are kept in vehicles rather than in SHs. SHs control the amount of data to be transmitted in each segment lifecycle through time-slot allocation. The time-slot allocation to a i , b i , and c i is conducted in such a manner that all the data sent from vehicles are guaranteed to be transmitted to the BS. However, vehicles within a segment need to contend for transmission opportunities so as to be granted time slot in the data subframe of a mesh frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Since no packet is left in the queues of an SH at the end of its lifecycle, CEPEC is a handoff-free protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. TRANSMISSION SCHEDULING WITHIN</head><p>AND ACROSS SEGMENTS As 802.16 systems operate in a synchronized manner, the transmission of vehicles has to be scheduled by either a centralized or a distributed method. We use a centralized-scheduling scheme to allocate aggregate transmission time to the SHs, which will be used for the procedures described in Section III, including selection of SH, gathering of packets from a local segment, and transmission of packets to uplink segments (or the BS). Because the number of segments is not large, it is feasible to use centralized method by the BSs to allocate transmission time for segments. The purpose of the centralizedscheduling algorithm is to maximize throughput delivered to the BSs while ensuring bandwidth-usage fairness. Two levels of bandwidth-usage fairness can be considered: segment level and vehicle level.</p><p>Furthermore, the SHs allocate the transmission time for collecting local-segment packets to the vehicles in their segments. As the number of vehicles may be very large and traffic demands from the vehicles are not clear to the SHs, we use the bandwidth request-and-grant mechanism specified in the 802.16 standard. With the mechanism, the SHs assign a number of transmission-request opportunities in an uplink subframe. The vehicles with traffic to send to the SH will contend for the opportunities by a truncated binary exponential algorithm, which will be described later in this section. Once the SHs collect the traffic-request information, they will grant time slots to the vehicles in the uplink map in the next frame for their segments.</p><p>Time-slot allocation to vehicles involves the following two steps: first, the BS allocates time slots to segments, and second, intrasegment time-slot allocation occurs where the SH assigns time slots to individual vehicles within the segment. These two steps are presented by the following two sections, respectively. Note that, for the intrasegment time-slot allocation, we only present a most important part of this process, i.e., how vehicles contend for opportunities by a truncated binary exponential algorithm (a more detailed investigation into this appears in a separate paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Allocation of Time to Segments</head><p>The scheduling is made with a period of n frm frames. The duration of a frame is t frm . In a schedule, each SH will be granted by the BS the transmission time of n i frames for segment i. Among the n i frames, n i,i frames will be used to collect local segment packets and n i,i-1 frames will be used to deliver packets from segment i to segment i -1, for i ∈ [1, n s ], with n 1,0 being the number of frames used for delivering traffic from SH 1 to the BS. Obviously, n i = n i,i + n i,i-1 . To ensure bandwidth-usage fairness for all segments, we require that all the values of n i,i be the same as n l , for i ∈ [1, n s ]. What the BS needs to do is to determine n i and find a collision-free schedule in order to maximize n l under the constraints of wireless-link capacity and interference. Under the saturated-traffic condition, maximizing n l will improve the local segment traffic (denoted by l s ) delivered to the BS in a schedule period.</p><p>The centralized-scheduling problem is formulated by an optimization model. The variables used in the optimization model is shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p><p>For the wireless links, to achieve interference-free transmissions, if a transmission happens within a segment i or from SH i to SH j in one frame, there should be no other transmissions on the interfering links. An interfering link e kl of a link e ij means that either station k or l is in the interference range of station i or j. We denote the set of interfering links of a link e ij by I ij . Combining the constraints on the capacities of wireless links and the interference-free wireless transmissions, we can formulate the optimization problem in (4). Many existing optimization schemes can be applied to solve this problem.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Maximize: n i , subject to:                  n i,j + e kl ∈I ij k,l∈V n k,l ≤ n sch ∀i, j ∈ V, CM ij = 1 n i,i-1 = (n s -i+1)l s , r i,i-1 t frm ∀i ∈ [1, n s ] n s ls n 1,0 t frm ≤ r 1,0 , n i,i , n i,i-1 ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ [1, n s ] l s = n l t frm S s . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where n l × t frm = b i , and t frm is the duration of a frame and b i is the duration for LPC phase. The solution to the above optimization problem also gives the answer to n i,i-1 . Then, we have c i = n i,i-1 × t frm . In the optimization model, S s is the saturated throughput of a segment, which is to be presented in the next section.</p><p>In the simulation of our proposed CEPEC, the scheduling information for each segment is sent from the BS to all the vehicles in the BS's SvC in a broadcasting manner on a periodical basis. The reason why it is broadcasted to every vehicle is because, at the time of broadcasting, it is not clear which nodes will be selected as heads. Since this is a localized broadcasting (i.e., within only a BS's SvC), the overhead is not significantly high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Saturated Segment Throughput</head><p>In this paper, we consider demand-assigned multiple-access (DAMA) services, for which resources are given on a demandassignment basis as the need arises. For simplicity, we assume that the vehicles always have traffic to send and that the vehicle network operates under saturated-traffic condition. When a vehicle needs to ask for bandwidth on a connection with BE scheduling service, it sends a bandwidth-request message to the SH containing the immediate uplink-bandwidth requirements of the DAMA connection.</p><p>The BS controls assignments on the uplink channel through the UL-MAP messages and determines which minislots used as transmission opportunities are subject to collisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The vehicles will make decisions on uplink transmission and contention resolution. The mandatory method of contention resolution is based on a truncated binary exponential backoff, with the initial backoff window W and the maximum backoff window 2 m W controlled by the SH. The values are specified in the uplink-channel-descriptor message.</p><p>When a vehicle has information to send and wants to enter the contention-resolution process, it sets its internal backoff window equal to W . It randomly selects a number within its backoff window. This random value indicates the number of eligible contention-transmission opportunities that the vehicle should defer before transmitting. Once received, the contention resolution is completed. A contention transmission should be considered lost if no data grant has been given within a preconfigured time. The vehicle should now increase its backoff window by a factor of two, as long as it is less than the maximum backoff window. The SS should randomly select a number within its new backoff window and repeat the deferring process described above. This retry process continues until the maximum number of retries has been reached.</p><p>The number of transmission opportunities in a frame is dependent on the total size of the allocation, as well as the size of an individual transmission. In this paper, we consider a REQ Region-Full type of transmission opportunity, with size b to of two OFDM symbols when subchannelization is not active.</p><p>The requested bits in a transmission request can be fixed or dynamically changed. For simplicity, we will consider the case of fixed requested bits. If a request message is received successfully by the SH, the SH allocates either zero or sufficient transmission time t g (in the unit of OFDM symbols) for the requested bits. In an uplink subframe, time for maximal n d data transmission (each requires t g OFDM symbols) is allocated.</p><p>The variables used in the analytical model are summarized in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>.</p><p>As the contention-resolution method used for transmission opportunities is similar to the distributed-coordination-function scheme specified in the IEEE 802.11 for channel access, we can used the Markovian model presented by Bianchi to model the contention-resolution method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In the steady states, the probability τ of transmitting a bandwidth-request message in a general transmission opportunity and the probability p that a transmitted request message collides with other request messages are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">τ = 2(1-p) (1-2p)(W +1)+pW (1-(2p) m ) p = 1 -(1 -τ ) n u -1 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Segment Length L</head><p>For the segment-based multihop infrastructure, an important and complex issue is to determine segment length L. A large segment length will reduce the number of hops for traffic from remote vehicles traveling to the BS, but a large distance between the consecutive SHs may result in lower transmission data rate used for the communications between the SHs. In addition, there is a risk of segment disconnect if SHs are out of the communications ranges due to the random selection of SHs and vehicle mobility. For a small segment length, although the consecutive SHs will be inside the communications ranges, there is also a risk of segment disconnect because no vehicle may be within a segment due to low vehicle density. Optimal design of segment length L should take into accounts the number of hops and transmission data rates within a segment and between segments, together with the probability of segment disconnect. If the selected data rates are independent of the distances between the communicating vehicles, then we can select the maximal segment length L with which the segmentdisconnect probability is less than a preconfigured threshold THR dc . Next, we will calculate the segment-disconnect probability, which is a function of segment length, vehicle density, and number of segments.</p><p>First, we calculate the disconnect probability p dc that two consecutive segments i and j of length L are disconnected, which means that none of the vehicles in a segment is in the communication ranges of the vehicles in the other segment. With the assumption of Poisson distributed vehicle density λ, p dc is obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">p dc = 1 - L 0 λe -λx (1 -e -min(L,R-x) λ)dx<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where min(x, y) is the function that calculates the minimum of variables x and y.</p><p>In CEPEC protocol, only the vehicles within a specified area of a segment will be considered to be an SH, which will communicate with SHs in consecutive segments. Therefore, the disconnect probability p dc is modified as follows for two consecutive segments in the protocol:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">p dc = 1 - L/2+l 0 λe -λx 1 -e -max(0,min(L,R-x-L/2+l)) λ dx. (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>From the disconnect probability p dc for two consecutive segments, we can also calculate the disconnect probability p mdc for n s consecutive segments. Multiple consecutive segments are said to be disconnected if any two of the consecutive segments are disconnected. If more than one vehicle in a segment is allowed to communicate with their uplink and downlink segment vehicles, respectively, as has been done in the CVIA protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we have the disconnect probability p mdc-2h for multiple consecutive segments as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">p mdc-2h (n s ) = 1 -(1 -p dc ) n s . (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>However, as in the proposed protocol, if only one vehicle is to be selected as the SH to communicate with SHs in its uplink and downlink segments, the segment-disconnect probability (denoted by p mdc-1h for the proposed protocol will be larger than or equal to that calculated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. As the derivation of the general disconnect probability p mdc-1h (n s ) is very complex, p mdc-2h (n s ) is used to approximate p mdc-1h (n s ) in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION DESIGN AND RESULTS</head><p>A vehicular-network simulator has been developed by us to simulate the performance of both the CEPEC protocol and the IEEE 802.16 protocol. In this simulator, there is a twolane straight highway of limited length with each lane for each direction of traffic flow. In each lane, there is more than one sublane all carrying traffic to same direction. These sublanes enable vehicles overtaking each other. The highway is divided into a few segments of fixed length L starting from a BS. These segments constitute the SvC of this BS. Simulated vehicles randomly enter the SvC with exponentially distributed interarrival time at a rate of 100 vehicles per minute. Vehicle speed follows a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 85 km/h and a standard deviation of 10 km/h. Uplink data request of each vehicle follows an exponential distribution with the rate of 512 kb/s. The capacity of the BS is 40 Mb/s. Channel data rate varies between 5-40 Mb/s and is a function of distance in our simulation for simplicity. Transmission ranges of all vehicles and the BS are same: R = 2.4 km. Payload of packets varies between 500 and 2200 B. Other physical-layer parameters are taken from the IEEE 802.16 standard document <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The performance of CEPEC is evaluated based on the following metrics: end-to-end performance, end-to-end delay, and fairness. First, we examine the effects of packet length and the number of segments (or hops) on the performance under different vehicle numbers. The number of vehicles represents the total input traffic load. The following three scenarios were simulated for this purpose: Scenario 1: payload = 500 B, N = 4; Scenario 2: payload = 2200 B, N = 4; Scenario 3: payload = 2200 B, N = 8. Here, we deliberately used the same payload sizes and N , as these are used in CVIA aiming to investigate the potential differences between them. Segment length L is set to be 2R/3 based on the estimation from Section IV-C. Second, we examine the effect of segment length L on the performance of the vehicular network. The parameters for this test are given as follows: payload = 2200 B, N = 8 (i.e., Scenario 3). Here, more hops (i.e., N ) are used to better showcase the impact of L.</p><p>For IEEE 802.16 protocol, the curves in this section show the situation where vehicles use their farthest neighbors for nexthop relay to the BS. We also examined the performance when vehicles use their closest neighbors for next-hop relay to the BS. A slight increase in delay was observed in the latter case due to an increased number of hops, but the curve-development trend was similar to these presented in this paper.</p><p>In the simulations, we assume that all vehicles generate the same type of traffic (i.e., BE) until the simulation is completed. Therefore, the number of vehicles represents the input network load. Each point of the curves in this section is obtained by averaging the results from 20 simulation runs. The duration of each simulation is 60 s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Throughput and Fairness</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> shows the overall end-to-end uplink throughput of IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and CEPEC protocols in various scenarios. The throughput of both protocols increases when the number of vehicles is small. When the number of vehicles increases to a certain value (roughly at 100), the CEPEC protocol reaches a saturation point. The saturation throughput of CEPEC is about three quarters of the capacity of a BS (40 Mb/s) on average. It is also observed that the bigger the payload size is, the better is the throughput performance. However, the opposite applies for the number of segments. In Scenario 3, the throughput is as high as about 90% of the BS capacity. In contrast, IEEE 802.11based CVIA can only achieve a saturation throughput of about half of the theoretically optimal throughput value <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This better performance of CEPEC as compared to CVIA is due to the TDMA-based MAC scheme in CEPEC. On the other hand, after CEPEC reaches a saturation point, the overall throughput of IEEE 802.16 keeps on increasing until it gets to the point of 28 Mb/s.</p><p>At nonsaturation stage, the throughput performance of CEPEC can be slightly worse than that of the plain IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>. This is because the bandwidth reserved to each segment in CEPEC cannot be used by other segments. Therefore, if Req i &lt; C/N, then C/N -Req i bandwidth is unutilized. This shortcoming can be overcome by extending the LPC phase of the following segments until this bandwidth residual is absorbed. On the other hand, in IEEE 802.16, a scheme similar to the greedy algorithm is adopted. This means that IEEE 802.16 tries to make most use of the available bandwidth. In the saturation stage, CEPEC consistently outperforms IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>. In scenario 3, CEPEC outperforms the highest throughput of IEEE 802.16 by about 25% (when the number of vehicles is 300). Fairness is a concept that applies only when demands overwhelm supplies, i.e., in the saturation status. To better illustrate the comparison between CEPEC and IEEE 802.16, Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the throughput-variance percentage (TVP) in the three scenarios. TVP represents the amount of throughput gain or loss obtained by using CEPEC over IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>  In order to better understand the reasons behind these observations, we further examine the throughput at the segment level with particular interest on S 1 . It is noted that the vehicles in S 1 are located within the physical-transmission range of the BS. The simulation results are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref> for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Scenario 3 has the similar results.</p><p>Figs. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref> show the throughput of S 1 and the average throughput of all the other segments (S 2 -S N ) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Under saturation status, the outer segments in standard IEEE 802.16 experience starvation, because the available bandwidth is increasingly dominated by packets from S 1 as traffic load increases. In contrast, CEPEC distributes bandwidth (and, thus, throughput) to each segment fairly, and therefore, the segment throughput is almost equal across segments. Furthermore, this fairness is not affected by the number of vehicles or the amount of payload.</p><p>From the above throughput results (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>), it can be observed that, although the total end-to-end uplink throughput of IEEE 802.16 increases with increasing number of vehicles,  it causes starvation for the outer segments. This starvation gets worse as the number of vehicles grows, as can also be evidenced by the fairness measure-FI in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref>, which also illustrates that FI of the CEPEC protocol almost stays at one for various scenario conditions and vehicle number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Delay</head><p>Delay of a packet in the simulations is calculated as the time elapsed between the time point when the packet is generated for transmission in a vehicle to the time point when the packet is received by the BS. Therefore, time for a packet spent in queues waiting for transmission is counted. Similar to throughput, the delay performance of the network is also evaluated according to overall delay, delay variance, and segment delay.</p><p>Looking at the overall delay given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref>, it increases in all cases as the number of vehicles increases. Before the saturation point, the increase is slow. Then, delay starts to increase rapidly thereafter. This is because, after reaching saturation status, the queue lengths in vehicles start to increase, given a fixed amount of available bandwidth. This leads to long  </p><p>where Delay CEPEC and Delay 16 are the packet delays of CEPEC and IEEE 802.16, respectively. It is observed that, in general, the CEPEC protocol experiences smaller end-to-end delay in different scenarios.</p><p>If we consider the pure transmission delay of packets, then we can find that CEPEC packets generally spend more time in channels than IEEE 802.16 does, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref>. The reason behind this is that fairness across segments leads to more packets from outer segments being granted the chance to transmit. These packets must go through multiple hops to reach the BS and, thus, a longer transmission delay.</p><p>Figs. 14 and 15 show the packet delay of S 1 and the average packet delay of all the other segments (S 2 -S N ) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Scenario 3 shows the similar  curve development but is omitted due to space limit. The curves for the average delay of all segments are also drawn for reference. Before the saturation point and, particularly, before the number of vehicles reaches 50, both protocols perform similarly across segments. After the saturation point, it is observed that all three delay curves of the CEPEC protocol stay relatively close to each other. However, the delay curves of IEEE 802.16 behave differently. They depart from each other after the saturation point with packets from the outer segments being severely delayed. For instance, at the point where the number of vehicles is 250, outer segments (S 2 -S 4 ) can be disadvantaged by about 350% in comparison with S 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Packet-Delivery Ratio</head><p>The packet delivery ratio in CEPEC is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">DR CEPEC = N suc N col<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where N suc is the number of packets that are successfully transmitted to the BS, and N col is the total number of packets collected by SHs in all segments. We also have DR 802.16 = N suc N sent <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where N sent is the total number of packets sent out by vehicles.</p><p>The number of retransmissions is four. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">16</ref> shows that the packet-delivery ratios of CEPEC stay at 100% in the simulations irrelevant to the scenarios. The reason behind this is because CEPEC uses the bandwidth quota preallocated to each segment to collect local packets under the centralized control of an SH in each segment. Therefore, the probability of a packet being dropped (i.e., packets being collected by heads but not eventually transmitted to the BS) is almost zero. Even if a packet is dropped, there are still up to four retransmissions to be attempted. In contrast, when the number of vehicles increases in the network, the IEEE 802.16 protocol starts dropping packets for all scenarios. This is because, as the vehicle density increases, so does the number of vehicles in the segments closer to the BS (particularly S 1 ). Most of the BS capacity is used by packets originated from S 1 and S 2 , leaving the packets from the other segments little chance to obtain a transmission opportunity in contention, but due to the TDMA scheme of IEEE 802.16, the worst case for the packet-delivery ratio is still higher than 75%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Length of Segments</head><p>The series of simulations presented in this section investigate the effect of segment lengths on the network performance. We fix the payload to 2200 B and vary the segment length L from 2/3R to 2R/ √ 10 and, then, to 1/2R under different SvC size N = 4 and 8. We denote L 1 = 2R/3, L 2 = 2R √ 10, and L 3 = 1R/2, where there is L 1 &lt; L 2 &lt; L 3 .</p><p>Figs. 17 and 18 show that a bigger segment length gives slightly worse throughput performance but better delay performance. Worse throughput is caused by a decreased data rate as distance increases in IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>. This observation is irrelevant to the number of segments, although the network performance (both in terms of throughput and delay) degrades  as the number of segments increases. This result matches to the analytical conclusion given in Section IV. Since L 1 , L 2 , and L 3 are all smaller than threshold L, beyond which very high probability of SH disconnection occurs, the simulations do not show any disconnection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposes a novel communication protocol for vehicular networks that supports vehicles, on highways, communicating with peers at home or office. For the first time, to the best our knowledge, IEEE 802.16 is introduced to support VRC in multihop vehicular networks. The CEPEC protocol coordinates the functions of physical, MAC, and network layers to provide a fair and handoff-free solution for uplink packet delivery from vehicles to BSs. An analytical model is developed to estimate the throughput of each segment and of each vehicle. Based on this throughput estimation, optimal time duration for LPC within a road segment is calculated. The maximization of this duration while maintaining bandwidth-usage fairness leads to high performance of CEPEC. A preliminary model is proposed to describe the relationship between the disconnect probability and the segment length. The simulation results have showed that the proposed protocol has better performance than the standard IEEE 802.16 protocol in terms of both end-to-end throughput and packet delay.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
