<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper solves consensus problems for networked agents whose interactions with each other are described by signed digraphs. The Laplacian matrix of a signed digraph is studied by introducing rooted cycles, and the relationship between it and the spanning tree condition is addressed. In particular, the Laplacian matrix of a signed digraph with spanning trees is positive stable if and only if there is at least one negative rooted cycle; otherwise, it has exactly one zero eigenvalue if and only if either there exist no rooted cycles or all existing rooted cycles are positive. It is shown that all agents reach interval bipartite consensus if their associated signed digraph has a spanning tree. Further, the consensus values of all agents depend only on the initial states of those agents which are associated with root vertices. The developed consensus results are applicable for multi-agent systems with both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics. Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate interval bipartite consensus performances for multiagent systems associated with different signed digraphs which all contain spanning trees but are not strongly connected.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A. Motivations M ULTI-AGENT systems have been considered one of the hottest topics in the area of network control for the past decade. Their coordination control has many applications, such as explaining natural phenomena and providing guidelines for practical tasks of those complex systems that consist of a group of mobile agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In general, the agents form a network to perform cooperative tasks for the group through interactions which are represented by graphs with all positive edge weights. This feature results in the distributed structure for coordination controllers conducted by the nearest neighbor interaction rules, under which consensus is considered one of the basic problems for multi-agent systems (see also surveys and books <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>).</p><p>Consensus of networked agents means to develop a protocol such that they can agree on a common quantity, which depends on the initial states of all agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It has been shown that the connectivity of the associated undirected graph with networked multi-agent systems provides their consensus with a necessary and sufficient guarantee. When it comes to consensus of multiagent networks under the general directed graphs (digraphs for short), the necessary and sufficient condition is that the related digraphs have a spanning tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or a globally reachable vertex <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, whereas the strong connectivity of the related digraphs just is sufficient but not necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Moreover, the developed consensus results are applicable for both continuous-time and discrete-time multi-agent systems. It is worth noting, however, that the aforementioned (in fact most of the existing) consensus results focus on the networked multi-agent systems which only admit cooperative interactions between agents.</p><p>Recently, the idea of consensus has been extended to general multi-agent systems operating on such networks that can allow the agents to possess not only cooperative but also antagonistic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In other words, the graph that represents communications between agents is signed, in which there exist edges associated with positive and negative adjacency weights. Networks of agents associated with signed graphs are common especially in the area of social networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>), where a positive/negative weight can describe, e.g., like/dislike and trust/distrust interactions between agents. By investigating a class of so-called bipartite consensus problems, not only have promising consensus results been established, but also possible extensions have been investigated for, e.g., modulus consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, bipartite formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and bipartite flocking <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> issues on networked agents associated with signed graphs.</p><p>The aim of bipartite consensus is to develop a protocol such that the agents can reach agreement regarding a quantity which is the same for all agents in modulus but not in sign <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Most existing bipartite consensus results, however, require structural balance of the associated signed graphs (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). In addition, the basic connectivity assumption on communication between vertices, i.e., the connectivity of undirected graphs or strong connectivity of digraphs is needed to develop consensus results on networked multi-agent systems which are associated with signed graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, especially associated with structurally unbalanced signed graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In contrast to this, a weaker connectivity condition that the associated graph with networked multi-agent systems contains a spanning tree is necessary and sufficient to guarantee consensus for the special case where all the edge adjacency weights are positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In particular, it has been simulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that there may be various consensus performances for networked agents if their associated signed digraphs are structurally unbalanced but can only meet the spanning tree condition. However, regarding this observed consensus problem of networked agents under signed digraphs, there have been reported no theoretical investigations until now to the best of our knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contributions</head><p>Motivated by the previous discussions, we aim to answer the following questions for consensus of networked agents that are associated with general signed digraphs, regardless of whether they are structurally balanced or structurally unbalanced.</p><p>1) What is the fundamental consensus result for multi-agent systems associated with general signed digraphs that are not strongly connected but only contain spanning trees? 2) How can the consensus performance be characterized for multi-agent systems when the associated signed digraphs only contain spanning trees? 3) Can the consensus results, which are obtained for agents with interactions described by signed digraphs with only spanning trees, be applicable to multi-agent systems with both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics?</p><p>We introduce a notion of interval bipartite consensus, where those agents associated with roots of signed digraphs (hereafter called root agents) reach bipartite consensus and the remaining agents converge and the converged values of them are not more than those of root agents in modulus. If the associated signed digraph contains a spanning tree, then all agents reach interval bipartite consensus, which is also illustrated through examples. In particular, when the signed digraph is structurally balanced, interval bipartite consensus collapses into bipartite consensus. When the root agents achieve the state stability, the states of all agents are stable. It suggests that the proposed interval bipartite consensus, including as a special case the bipartite consensus, plays a fundamental role when signed digraphs with spanning trees represent interactions between agents.</p><p>To clearly characterize the consensus performance of agents, we exploit the Laplacian matrix of a signed digraph containing spanning trees by introducing a notion of rooted cycles which denote the cycles consisting of roots of the signed digraph. The Laplacian matrix of a signed digraph containing spanning trees is positive stable, i.e., all its eigenvalues have positive real parts if and only if there exists at least one negative rooted cycle, and it has exactly one zero eigenvalue and all the other eigenvalues have positive real parts if and only if there do not exist rooted cycles or the existing rooted cycles are all positive. With these results on Laplacian matrices, the multi-agent system under a signed digraph with spanning trees achieves the state stability if and only if there exists at least one negative rooted cycle, and it achieves the interval bipartite consensus with the converged values of all agents depending only on the initial states of those root agents if and only if there do not exist rooted cycles or the existing rooted cycles are all positive. This extends the typical consensus and bipartite consensus results (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>).</p><p>We consider the consensus analysis for not only continuoustime but also discrete-time multi-agent systems. With the stepsize chosen appropriately, it is shown that the consensus results developed for continuous-time multi-agent systems can be also generalized to discrete-time multi-agent systems when they are associated with signed digraphs that have spanning trees. This benefits from the matrix analysis theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which also is the same as the classical consensus results for multi-agent systems under digraphs with all positive edge weights (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Paper Organizations</head><p>We organize the remaining parts of this paper as follows. We give basic notations and some preliminaries on signed digraphs and bipartite consensus of multi-agent systems in Section II. The observed consensus problems are presented in Section III, together with the corresponding illustrations. In Section IV, we propose properties for the Laplacian matrix of a signed digraph that has a spanning tree. The consensus results for continuoustime multi-agent systems are developed in Section V, and then their extensions to discrete-time multi-agent systems are made in Section VI. We finally conclude this paper in Section VII.</p></div>

NOTATIONS AND PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In this section, we introduce some basic notations and some preliminaries for both signed digraphs and bipartite consensus of networked agents (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>).</p></div>

Signed Digraphs</head><formula xml:id="formula_4">A (weighted) signed digraph (short for "directed graph") is represented by a triple G = (V , E , A ), consisting of a vertex set V = {v 1 , v 2 , • • • , v n }, an edge set E ⊆ V × V = {(v i , v j ) : v i , v j ∈ V } which is defined such that (v j , v i</formula><p>) is a directed edge from v j to v i just in the case when the vertex v j is a neighbor of the vertex v i , and an adjacency weight matrix A = [a i j ] ∈ R n×n which is defined such that (v j , v i ) ∈ E ⇔ a i j ̸ = 0 and otherwise, a i j = 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Bipartite Consensus</head><p>In this paper, we consider multi-agent systems which consist of n agents labeled 1 through n. We assume that every agent is regarded as a vertex in a signed digraph G to conveniently describe the interactions between it and its neighbors. Following, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we say that such a multi-agent system reaches bipartite consensus if its n components converge to values that are the same in modulus but different in sign. More precisely, we consider agents with continuous-time dynamics given by ẋi (t) = u i (t), i ∈ I n <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where x i (t) ∈ R is the state and u i (t) ∈ R is the control input or protocol to be designed. For the multi-agent system (1) under a certain protocol, we say that it reaches bipartite consensus if lim t→∞ |x i (t)| = x f &gt; 0, ∀i ∈ I n (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Definition 1]</ref>).</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, fundamental consensus results have also been established for the multi-agent system (1) associated with both undirected, connected and directed, digon sign-symmetric, strongly connected signed graphs.

In the following discussions, we will omit the time variable t if no confusions can occur and focus on digon sign-symmetric signed digraphs if there are no special indications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. INTERVAL BIPARTITE CONSENSUS PROBLEMS</head><p>As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, gauge transformations can be carried out to transform consensus problems under signed graphs into the corresponding traditional consensus problems under graphs with the pure positive edge adjacency weights when the signed graphs are structurally balanced. It yields a good property such that the bipartite consensus problem of agents described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> has alternative solutions due to the well established traditional consensus results after the implementation of a suitable gauge transformation. However, we do not have such good alternative ways to the consensus problems under structurally unbalanced signed graphs, and most of the existing results can only instead achieve the state stability of agents. But, in fact, there are more other attractive consensus performances than state stability for the agents given by (3) when subject to structurally unbalanced signed digraphs (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for similar discussions).</p><p>In addition, the consensus results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for the system (3) under signed graphs need the connectivity of undirected graphs and strong connectivity of digraphs. However, this may impose restrictions on the application of consensus results of the multiagent systems under signed graphs (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). In contrast, for the multi-agent systems under traditional digraphs whose edge weights are all positive, a necessary and sufficient guarantee to consensus of them is the spanning tree condition, which is weaker than the strong connectivity (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>).</p><p>Summarizing, we can see a more general consensus problem than bipartite consensus for the system (3) as follows: (Q) What will the convergence performance of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> be when it is associated with signed digraphs which only contain spanning trees? If it can still achieve "consensus", how many different values are there in the final stationary states of agents? </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. An Illustrative Example</head><p>Example 1: Consider system (3) associated with four signed digraphs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where all the four digraphs are not strongly connected but contain spanning trees. With x(0) = [1, 2, 3, -2, -1, -6] T , we perform simulations and depict the test results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>. From Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), it is obvious that the bipartite consensus and state stability can be achieved if the multi-agent system is associated with structurally balanced and structurally unbalanced signed digraphs, respectively. They suggest that for consensus of the system (3), strong connectivity could not be necessary, whereas having spanning trees might be sufficient. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(c</ref>) and 2(d) illustrate that the system (3) converges, but not to zero, though it is associated with structurally unbalanced signed digraphs. Moreover, the illustrations of them show more consensus performances of the system (3) when it is associated with structurally unbalanced signed digraphs, in addition to the state stability observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>, it seems however that we have difficulty to exactly determine the converged values of agents if the associated signed digraph is not strongly connected but only has spanning trees. There are 4 and 6 different converged values in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(c</ref>) and 2(d), respectively, especially where Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(d)</ref> shows more a disagreement than bipartite consensus. Despite of these facts, the root agents v i , i = 1, 2 can always reach bipartite consensus, while the other agents v j , j = 3, 4, 5, 6 always converge to the symmetric interval decided by the root agents. In fact, we can compute the converged vector x(∞) lim t→∞ x(t) of Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(c</ref>) and 2(d) as ] T , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(d)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>. This discloses a class of "roots-decided convergence", which we will call interval bipartite consensus.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">x(∞) =      [ -5 4 , 5<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">Clearly, |x 1 (∞)| = |x 2 (∞)| and x j (∞) ≤ |x i (∞)|, i = 1, 2, j = 3,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Interval Bipartite Consensus</head><p>To answer the aforementioned question (Q), we will address the problem formally presented in the following definition.     Definition 1: We say that the system (3) reaches interval bipartite consensus if lim t→∞ |x i (t)| ≤ θ , ∀i ∈ I n , where θ &gt; 0 is the modulus of the converged values of root agents. Moreover, the number of elements in x(∞) whose moduli are equal to θ is called the impact index of root agents.</p><p>In particular, if only equalities occur, i.e., lim t→∞ |x i (t)| = θ , ∀i ∈ I n , interval bipartite consensus of Definition 1 collapses into bipartite consensus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Definition 1]</ref>. Obviously, Definition 1 presents a more general consensus problem, including (bipartite) consensus as a special case, which to our knowledge has not been studied yet. If θ = 0 is also admitted in Definition 1, then state stability can be viewed as a special case of interval bipartite consensus. Based on these observations, we will show that interval bipartite consensus can provide exactly the answer to the question (Q).</p><p>By Definition 1, µ is adopted to represent the impact index of root agents. It actually discloses the number of agents which reach agreement (with root agents) in modulus but not in sign. The larger µ is, the more agents are influenced by root agents to directly achieve bipartite consensus. In addition to this direct influence, indirect influence of root agents is also incorporated in Definition 1. Though each agent may not exactly follow the root agents, it must be influenced to limit its behavior into the symmetric bounds decided by them. In Example 1, µ = 4 and θ = 5/4 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(c)</ref>, where the agents v j , j = 3, 4 follow root agents v i , i = 1, 2 and the remaining agents v k are influenced such that |x k (∞)| &lt; θ , k = 5, 6. Similar analysis can be derived for Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(d)</ref>.</p></div>

LAPLACIAN MATRICES OF SIGNED DIGRAPHS</head><p>With (3), it is easy to see that the Laplacian matrix L decides the consensus performances for multi-agent systems associated with signed digraphs. It follows also from the aforementioned illustrations that more consensus performances arise when the signed digraph G is not strongly connected but has a spanning tree.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Rooted Cycles</head><p>We introduce a notion of "rooted cycle" for digraphs as well as some related properties.</p><p>Definition 2: A cycle in a digraph G is called a rooted cycle if it contains some (not necessarily all) roots of G .</p><p>For rooted cycles, we can directly summarize the following properties based on Definition 2 for any signed digraph G : P1) a cycle that contains m distinct vertices in G is a rooted cycle if and only if these m vertices are all roots of G . P2) G does not have rooted cycles if and only if there exists at most one root in G ; P3) G has rooted cycles if and only if there exist at least two roots in G , where for every root of G , there are some rooted cycles which contain this root. With property P1), we can also say that a cycle in a digraph G is called a rooted cycle if and only if it is formed by edges whose endpoints are roots of G . Moreover, we take advantage of this property to obtain a bipartition of vertices. Let V r ⊆ V be the vertex set which consists of all roots of G . Denote also</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">V nr V \ V r = { v j : v j ∈ V but v j ̸ ∈ V r } .</formula><p>Then with P1)-P3), the following proposition can be proposed.</p><p>Proposition 1: The two vertex sets V r and V nr of any signed digraph G have the following properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">P4) V r =          Ø, m = 0 {v i : v i is the only root} , m = 1 ∪ i∈I n {v i : v i is a vertex of some rooted cycles} , m ≥ 2</formula><p>where m ∈ Z + is the number of roots in G and for m ≥ 2, V r corresponds to the maximum set of the vertices which are contained by the rooted cycles in G ; P5) G has paths between every distinct pair of vertices v i and v j in V r , and all the paths between v i and v j are formed by those edges with the property that two endpoints both belong to V r ; P6) G has paths from ∀v i ∈ V r to ∀v j ∈ V nr , whereas G does not have any paths from ∀v j ∈ V nr to ∀v i ∈ V r .</p><p>Proof: P4): When m = 0, 1, this property is obvious from the definition of V r . If m ≥ 2, then it follows as an immediate consequence of the above properties P1) and P3).</p><p>P5): From the definition of V r , v i and v j in V r are roots of G . Thus, it follows from the definition of root that there are paths between v i and v j in G . For the remaining part of this property P5), if its statement does not hold, then there exists a path from</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">v i/ j to v j/i in G of the form (v k 0 , v k 1 ), (v k 1 , v k 2 ), • • • , (v k p-1 , v k p ), where k 0 = i/ j, k p = j/i and v k 0 , v k 1 , • • • , v k p are some distinct vertices with p ≥ 2, such that there exists a vertex v k l ∈ V nr for some 0 &lt; l &lt; p. Let us consider the edges (v k l , v k l+1 ), • • • , (v k p-1 , v k p ) in G .</formula><p>This implies that these edges can form a path from v k l to v k p . Since k p = j/i and v j/i ∈ V r is a root of G , we can obtain immediately that there exists a path from v k l to every other vertex in G . Hence, v k l is a root of G , which yields v k l ∈ V r by the definition of V r . This naturally contradicts with v k l ∈ V nr . The proof of the property P5) can thus be completed by contradiction.</p><p>P6): For any v i ∈ V r and v j ∈ V nr , it follows that there exist paths from v i to v j since v i is a root from the definition of V r . If there also exist paths from v j to v i , then we can follow the same lines as the proof of the property P5) to develop that v j is a root. This leads to v j ∈ V r , and consequently a contradiction with v j ∈ V nr occurs. With the proof by contradiction, we can deduce that there does not exist any paths from v j to v i .</p><p>In particular, we can obtain a helpful property for a strongly connected signed digraph G as follows: P7) G contains rooted cycles, all its cycles are rooted cycles and all its vertices are roots if and only if G is strongly connected.</p><p>The property P7) follows directly from definitions and properties of rooted cycles and strong connectivity of digraphs. Note also that the properties P1)-P7) hold for digraphs regardless of whether or not they are signed graphs. By utilizing the property P7), we introduce the following proposition which establishes the relationship between the structural balance (or unbalance) and rooted cycles of strongly connected signed digraphs. Proposition 2: A strongly connected signed digraph G has the following two equivalent properties: P8) G is structurally balanced if and only if the rooted cycles of G are all positive; P9) G is structurally unbalanced if and only if G has at least one negative rooted cycle. Proof: This proposition can be proved using the property P7) as well as properties of strongly connected signed digraphs (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for more details).</p><p>Remark 1: Actually, it is said that G is structurally balanced when all of its cycles are positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. From the property P7), it follows that all the cycles of a strongly connected signed digraph are rooted cycles, as adopted in Proposition 2. Besides, the property P7) implies that when the signed digraph G is not strongly connected, its cycles can be not rooted cycles. We can see, however, that Proposition 2 holds if and only if the cycles of a signed digraph are rooted cycles. Clearly, this implies that rooted cycles play a fundamental role in applying Proposition 2 for signed digraphs. With this observation, we are interested in rooted cycles for general consensus analysis to be developed under non-strongly connected signed digraphs in the sequel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Properties of Laplacian Matrices</head><p>We first propose a basic theorem to disclose the relationship between the spanning tree condition of signed digraphs and the eigenvalue distribution of their Laplacian matrices.</p><p>Theorem 1: If a signed digraph G has a spanning tree, then the Laplacian matrix L satisfies either the following result R1) or R2): R1) there exists exactly one zero eigenvalue and all the other eigenvalues of L have positive real parts; R2) all the eigenvalues of L have positive real parts.</p><p>For a particular case of the signed digraph G where its edge weights are all positive, it follows that its Laplacian matrix L satisfies the result R1) if and only if G has a spanning tree (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). This is clearly different from the result proposed in Theorem 1, which is a general property for Laplacian matrices of signed digraphs. It will be shown that if the signed digraph G has additional structural properties which are more relaxed than the requirements of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the result of Theorem 1 becomes necessary and sufficient (see the following Corollary 1). When however, it comes to the general case addressed in Theorem 1, we no longer have the benefits of these additional properties. It is not difficult to see that the necessity of Theorem 1 does not hold. The next example provides this with a counterexample.</p><p>Example 2: Consider a trivial case for the signed digraph G , consisting of</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">N separate components G 1 , G 2 , • • • , G N which are all strongly connected. It is clear that G does not have spanning trees, where L takes a block-diagonal form of L = diag{L 1 , L 2 , • • • , L N } and L i , i = 1, 2, • • • , N denotes the Laplacian matrix of G i .</formula><p>However, it is easy to get with [15, Lemma 2 and Corollary 3] that the result R1) holds when one of the strongly connected signed digraphs G i , i = 1, 2, • • • , N is structurally balanced and all others are structurally unbalanced, and the result R2) holds when all</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">G i , i = 1, 2, • • • , N are structurally unbalanced.</formula><p>By contrast, the proof of Theorem 1 is not easy to establish. Since we no longer have the strong connectivity condition, the analysis method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> does not work, and also those analysis approaches based on the Gershgorin circle theorem (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>) are not applicable. In fact, if we consider the Gershgorin circle theorem for L, then by (4), we can only get that the eigenvalues of L are all in the closed right half plane of the complex plane, and its eigenvalues with zero real parts must be zero. However, we can not determine whether L has zero eigenvalues and how many zero eigenvalues it has. Moreover, the existence and the number of zero eigenvalues play a crucial role in convergence performance of the system (3). It is also important to determine under what conditions L has or does not have zero eigenvalues. To address these issues as well as obtain the proof of Theorem 1, we present some properties for the Laplacian matrix L of a signed digraph G with the help of rooted cycles.</p><p>Theorem 2: Consider a signed digraph G which contains a spanning tree. The Laplacian matrix L satisfies the result R1) if and only if one of the following condition holds: C1) G has no rooted cycles (that is, G has exactly one root); C2) G has rooted cycles which are all positive. In addition, L satisfies the result R2) if and only if C3) G has at least one negative rooted cycle.</p><p>With Theorem 2, we can prove Theorem 1 as follows.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 1: If the signed digraph G contains a spanning tree, then it has at least one root. If there is only one root in G , then the condition C1) is obvious from the property P2). Otherwise, if G has at least two roots, then it has rooted cycles by the property P3), which fulfills one of the conditions C2) and C3). With these facts, Theorem 1 can be immediately proved based on the results of Theorem 2.</p><p>From Theorem 2, it is clear that properties of rooted cycles in a signed digraph G are crucial in determining the existence of and the number of zero eigenvalues for its Laplacian matrix L. Motivated by this fact, we employ the structure analysis of G and L to develop the proof of Theorem 2 by distinguishing roots from the other vertices in G . We define</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">G r = (V r , E r , A r ), where E r = { (v i , v j ) ∈ E : v i , v j ∈ V r } and A r = [ a r i j ] ∈ R m×m satisfies (v j , v i ) ∈ E r ⇔ a r</formula><p>i j ̸ = 0 and otherwise, a r i j = 0. As given in the next lemma, the strong connectivity of G r always holds.</p><p>Lemma 2: For a signed digraph G with a spanning tree, the induced signed digraph G r is a subgraph of G , and furthermore G r is always strongly connected.</p><p>Proof: It is easy to see E r ⊆ E from the definition of E r . Due to V r ⊆ V , G r is a subgraph of G . From the property P5), G has a path P between each distinct pair of vertices v i and v j for v i , v j ∈ V r , where the endpoints of all edges in P belong to V r . It follows that all edges in the path P belong to E r from the definition of E r . That is, there exists a path between each distinct pair of vertices in G r . Based on the definition of strong connectivity, the signed digraph G r is strongly connected.</p><p>Remark 2: From Lemma 2, we know that G has a strongly connected subgraph G r formed by the roots of G when it has a spanning tree. Note that a graph consisting of one vertex is strongly connected. Hence, the result of Lemma 2 can include as a special case where G has exactly one root (that is, G r has just one vertex). In addition, G r = G holds for another special case where G is strongly connected. The property P6) implies also that G r plays the role as a unified root in G for all vertices belonging to V nr .</p><p>Without loss of generality, we assume that in the following discussions, the set V r of roots in G is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">V r = {v 1 , v 2 , • • • , v m } .

Note that if G has no rooted cycles, G has exactly one root. In this case, G r consists of one vertex, which is a trial case of the strongly connected, structurally balanced signed digraphs. From Proposition 1, we can easily get that the rooted cycles of G r are exactly the rooted cycles of G . Based on Lemma 2 and the property P8) of Proposition 2, G r is structurally balanced if and only if one of the conditions C1) and C2) holds. By [15, <ref type="bibr">Lemma 2]</ref>, they are equivalent to that L r has exactly one zero eigenvalue and all the other eigenvalues of L r have positive real parts.

The proof of Theorem 2 is complete.</p><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we know that when G is not a signed digraph but a traditional digraph whose edge weights are all positive, the spanning tree condition is necessary and sufficient to obtain the positive stability of L nr + B. However, the necessity of this necessary and sufficient result may not hold when it comes to a signed digraph G . As illustrated by Example 2, it is possible to make L (and thus, L nr + B) positive stable although the signed digraph G does not have spanning trees. As a matter of fact, it may not guarantee the spanning tree condition to be necessary for the result of Lemma 3 when G nr is structurally unbalanced, whereas it may make the result of Lemma 3 become necessary and sufficient when G nr is structurally balanced. An extension of Lemma 3 is first proposed by noting this fact as follows.</p><p>Lemma 4: Consider a signed digraph G , where its subgraph G nr is structurally balanced.

Then for convenience, we denote such a path in the form of</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">(v k 0 , v k 1 ), (v k 1 , v k 2 ), • • • , (v k s-1 , v k s ), where v k 0 = v i and v k s = v j . Since there exists at least one vertex v k p ∈ V nr for 1 ≤ p ≤ s, let l, 1 ≤ l ≤ s denote the least integer such that v k p ∈ V nr , ∀p ≥ l. Thus, v k l-1 ∈ V r and v k p ∈ V nr for all l ≤ p ≤ s. Obviously, we have k l-1 ≤ m due to v k l-1 ∈ V r , k l ≥ m + 1 owing to v k l ∈ V nr , and a k l k l-1 ̸ = 0 because of (v k l-1 , v k l ) ∈ E . This leads to b k l -m = m ∑ ν=1 a k l ν = a k l k l-1 + m ∑ ν=1,ν̸ =k l-1 a k l ν &gt; 0 which implies that v 0 is a neighbor of v k l in Ĝ . Consequently, we can obtain a path in Ĝ from v 0 to v j , which is described by (v 0 , v k l ), (v k l , v k l+1 ), • • • , (v k s-1 , v j ).</formula><p>Because v j ∈ V nr is any selected vertex, we can conclude that Ĝ contains a spanning tree and v 0 is its root.</p><p>Necessity: If Ĝ has a spanning tree, then v 0 is its root by (8), and for every vertex v j ∈ V nr , there is a path from v 0 to v j .

However, their proofs can not be effectively carried out if the signed digraph G contains a structurally unbalanced subgraph G nr , and therefore Lemma 3 can not be similarly proved. In order to show Lemma 3, we note two facts for the spanning tree condition of G as follows: a) L nr +B is diagonally dominant, where all of the elements on its main diagonal are positive; b) L nr + B has at least one row which is strictly diagonally dominant, i.e., b i &gt; 0 for at least one i, 1 ≤ i ≤ nm. By the fact a) and result of Lemma 1, we are motivated to get det(L nr + B) &gt; 0 to derive Lemma 3. If the order of L nr + B is not more than 2, then by the fact b), we are easy to validate det(L nr + B) &gt; 0. Benefiting from this fact, we can employ the cofactor expansion of det(L nr + B) with higher order than 2 to deduce det(L nr + B) &gt; 0 via gradually reducing the order. By induction, it will be left to determine det(Q) &gt; 0 for a certain matrix Q ∈ R 2×2 satisfying two facts a) and b) to complete the proof of Lemma 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONSENSUS OF AGENTS UNDER SIGNED DIGRAPHS</head><p>We now address the convergence problem for the system (3). Using the property of L in Theorem 1, we give it a fundamental convergence result in the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 3: Consider a signed digraph G . If it has a spanning tree, then the system (3) is convergent (i.e., x(∞) exists).</p><p>Proof: From Theorem 1, it follows that the spanning tree condition of G guarantees the eigenvalues of L to satisfy one of the results R1) and R2). For the case R1), we consider the Jordan canonical form associated with L and can follow the same way as the proof of [2, Theorem 3] to obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">lim t→∞ e -Lt = w r w T l ∈ R n×n<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where w r and w l are eigenvectors of L associated with its zero eigenvalue such that Lw r = 0, w T l L = 0 and w T l w r = 1. Clearly, the fact (15) guarantees x(∞) = ( w T l x(0) ) w r . For the case R2), it follows that lim t→∞ e -Lt = 0. Thus, we can derive x(∞) = 0. The proof is complete.</p><p>Theorem 3 gives a general convergence result of multi-agent systems associated with signed digraphs and employs a relaxed connectivity condition in terms of spanning trees. However, it is not clear what properties of x(∞) are. Do its elements reach agreement or how many different values do they have? Since G is a signed digraph, we can not give answers to the questions as easily as in the case where G has all positive edge weights. Obviously, we no longer have the good property w r = α1 n for some α ̸ = 0. Before proceeding further with this problem, we introduce a concept of "disagreement number" for multi-agent systems associated with signed digraphs having spanning trees.</p><p>Definition 3: µ dis is called the disagreement number of the system (3) if x(∞) ̸ = 0 exists and µ dis is the number of different elements in x(∞).</p><p>Note that if x(∞) = 0, then the system (3) is stable. It can be viewed as a trivial case of consensus, which is not discussed in Definition 3. Otherwise, we have µ dis ≥ 1, where µ dis = 1 for consensus and µ dis = 2 for bipartite consensus. If µ dis &gt; 2, the convergence process of the system (3) includes more dynamic behaviors, in addition to (bipartite) consensus for a portion of agents. Moreover, the smaller µ dis is, the more agents achieve (bipartite) consensus in the network. With this observation, we still employ the concept of consensus for the system (3), which more precisely means to find how many agents and under what conditions more agents can reach (bipartite) consensus. To this end, we present a property of µ dis by the structure of G or L.</p><p>Lemma 6: µ dis is equal to the number of different elements in w r , where w r is the same as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">Proof: With x(∞) = ( w T l x(0)</formula><p>) w r by the proof of Theorem 3, this lemma is a direct consequence of Definition 3.</p><p>In the literature, the selection of w r can be directly observed for digraphs with certain structure assumptions (see, e.g., w r = 1 n for digraphs with all positive edge weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and w r = D1 n for signed digraphs with the structural balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). However, if we do not have these structure assumptions on G , it is difficult to derive a specific form of w r , which thus renders it hard to determine µ dis for the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. By the observation, we exploit further consensus results in addition to Theorem 3.</p><p>For the case when multi-agent systems are under structurally balanced signed digraphs, the following theorem gives them a necessary and sufficient condition to reach bipartite consensus.</p><p>Theorem 4: Consider a structurally balanced signed digraph G . Then the system (3) reaches bipartite consensus if and only if G has a spanning tree.</p><p>Proof: We know that a gauge transformation z = Dx can be performed for the system (3) associated with the structurally balanced signed digraph G to obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> ż = -L D z <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where L D = DLD is a Laplacian matrix of the digraph G which however, is associated with the nonnegative weighed adjacency matrix |A | = [|a i j |] ∈ R n×n . For the system (16), we can obtain from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that its state can reach consensus if and only if G has a spanning tree. This, together with x = Dz, yields immediately that the system (3) achieves the bipartite consensus if and only if G has a spanning tree. Remark 4: Bipartite consensus problems have been studied for multi-agent networks associated with structurally balanced signed graphs in the literature (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). However, the existing consensus results require connectivity of undirected graphs and strong connectivity of digraphs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>) or provide only sufficient conditions under digraphs with spanning trees ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). In contrast, Theorem 4 makes a slight improvement and indicates that with structural balance, the spanning tree condition provides a necessary and sufficient guarantee to bipartite consensus of multi-agent networks under signed digraphs.</p><p>Theorem 4 shows that the bipartite consensus on structurally balanced signed digraphs is essentially the same as traditional consensus on digraphs with the nonnegative weighted adjacency matrices by gauge transformations (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). However, such problem transformation does not work in the presence of structurally unbalanced signed digraphs. With this observation, we develop a general consensus result on multi-agent networks associated with signed digraphs, regardless of whether they are structurally balanced or structurally unbalanced.</p><p>Theorem 5: Consider a signed digraph G , and let it contain a spanning tree.

Actually, this coincides with the observed facts by illustrations of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>. However, the system (3) achieves interval bipartite consensus by Theorem 5.

However, note that ∪ k l=1 Ω l ⊆ {m + 1, m + 2, • • • ,<label>n}</label></formula><p>for any k and the spanning tree condition implies that there exist paths from roots v i , 1 ≤ i ≤ m to vertices v j , m+1 ≤ j ≤ n in V nr . That is, there must exist some k such that we can find j k ∈ Ω k satisfying ∑ m i=1 a m+ j k ,i ̸ = 0. Due to ζ j k = ζ j 0 , we replace j 0 with j k in ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, which leads to ζ j ≤ ζ j k ≤ 1, ∀1 ≤ j ≤ n -m. The proof can be completed.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 5: R3): With Lemma 7, if we compare (17) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, it is not difficult to validate that <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_91">is satisfied if and only if x r (∞) = ( ν T r D r x r<label>(0)</label></formula><p>) D r 1 m . This can be achieved for the subsystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> if and only if the strongly connected signed digraph G r is structurally balanced (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 2]</ref>). As pointed out in the proof of Theorem 2, G r is structurally balanced if and only if one of the conditions C1) and C2) is satisfied. We thus conclude that (17) can be developed if and only if one of the conditions C1) and C2) holds. Furthermore, it follows from Lemma 8 that the elements of ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, and hence the system (3) reaches interval bipartite consensus.</p><p>R4): From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_72">22</ref>), we can easily deduce that x(∞) = 0 if and only if x r (∞) = 0 which holds if and only if -L r is a Hurwitz stable system matrix for <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Because the signed digraph G r is strongly connected, it follows that -L r is Hurwitz stable if and only if G r is structurally unbalanced from [15, <ref type="bibr">Corollary 3]</ref>, which is equivalent to the condition C3) by Theorem 2 and the property P9) of Proposition 2. Therefore, we can conclude that x(∞) = 0 if and only if the condition C3) holds.</p><p>Remark 5: From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_72">22</ref>), we can easily find that to develop the final consensus states for all agents, we only need to determine the final consensus states for the root agents. As given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, this further leads to that the final consensus states for all agents depend only on the initial states for the root agents. Obviously, this observation is applicable for general multi-agent systems, regardless of whether they are associated with signed digraphs or traditional digraphs with all positive edge weights.</p><p>In particular, Theorem 4 states that if there is an additional assumption on the structural balance of signed digraph G , then the spanning tree condition of G becomes not only sufficient but also necessary for the convergence result (22) of the system (3). It is worth noting, however, that this necessity counterpart is difficult to obtain and usually does not work for the general case considered in Theorem 5. As exemplified in Example 2, we may achieve the convergence of the system (3) even though the signed digraph G does not contain spanning trees.</p><p>When the signed digraph G is structurally balanced, let D = diag {D r , D nr } be such that DA D is nonnegative, where D nr is the same as defined in the proof of Lemma 4. We consider its associated Laplacian DLD and can develop from (DLD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>, it is clear that all agents achieve bipartite consensus with the same final consensus state in modulus which depends upon only the initial states of root agents. Motivated by the observation, we improve the bipartite consensus result of Theorem 4 as a consequence of Theorem 5 in the following corollary.</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">1 n = 0 and (D nr L nr D nr ) 1 n-m = 0 that (D nr A rnr D r ) 1 m = B1 n-m . Thus, we can deduce (D nr A rnr D r ) 1 m = (D nr L nr D nr + B) 1 n-m which, together with (17), leads to x(∞) = [ D r 1 m (L nr + B) -1 A rnr D r 1 m ] ( ν T r D r x r (0) ) = [ D r 1 m D nr (D nr L nr D nr + B) -1 D nr A rnr D r 1 m ] ( ν T r D r x r (0) ) = [ D r 1 m D nr 1 n-m ] ( ν T r D r x r (0) ) = ( ν T r D r x r (0) ) D1 n (32) where D -1 nr = D nr is used.

Remark 6: In comparison to Theorem 4, Corollary 2 states that not only can the bipartite consensus be guaranteed for the system (3) under a structurally balanced signed digraph G , but also the final consensus state can be given for it by considering only the strongly connected subgraph G r formed by the roots of G . Similar statement applies to Corollary 3 which considers the consensus issue for the system (3) under a classical digraph with all positive edge weights. Clearly, this shows that our used approach makes the analysis and computation of consensus for multi-agent networks more efficient, especially when there are huge vertices but relatively few roots in G . As a consequence, Corollaries 2 and 3 improve those classical bipartite consensus (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) and consensus (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) results.</p><p>Remark 7: When the signed digraph G associated with the system (3) is structurally unbalanced, Theorem 5 demonstrates also that the agents' consensus performance can be determined by studying only the strongly connected subgraph G r formed by the roots of G . We have x(∞) = 0 if and only if G r (rather than G <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) is structurally unbalanced. In addition, we know that x(∞) can be computed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> if and only if G r (rather than G <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) is structurally balanced.</p></div>

Moreover, two properties of P follow directly from Theorem 2 and Lemma 9. Remark 8: If the signed digraph G is structurally balanced, we can see by Lemma 5 that the spectral radius condition (37) holds if and only if G has a spanning tree. For the matrix P, we know by Corollary 1 that when G is a structurally balanced signed digraph, the condition (38) holds for its eigenvalues if and only if G contains a spanning tree.</p><p>With Lemma 10, we give consensus results for discrete-time multi-agent systems associated with signed digraphs.</p><p>Theorem 6: Consider a signed digraph G , and let it contain a spanning tree.

R6) The discrete-time system (35) achieves the state stability (i.e., x(∞) = 0) if and only if the condition C3) holds. Proof: Since G has a spanning tree, we know by Lemma 10 that ρ(P) &lt; 1 if the condition C3) holds. This guarantees for the system (35) that x(∞) exists with x(∞) = 0. Otherwise, if one of the conditions C1) and C2) holds, then by employing (38), we can develop with [33, Lemma 8.2.7] that P t → w r w T l as t → ∞, where w r , w l ∈ R n satisfy Pw r = w r , w T l P = w T l and w T l w r = 1.

As is the same with the continuous-time case, we need to just consider the strongly connected signed subgraph G r (consisting of all the roots of G ) to investigate the consensus performances for the discrete-time multi-agent systems. In particular, Corollary 4 gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the bipartite consensus of discretetime multi-agent systems associated with structurally balanced signed digraphs. This can include as a special case the classical consensus result (with the spanning tree condition as necessary and sufficient guarantees, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) for the discrete-time multi-agent systems associated with traditional digraphs whose edge weights are all positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, the consensus problem for multi-agent systems associated with signed digraphs has been studied, for which a unified analysis framework applicable in both continuous-time and discrete-time domains has been presented. We have shown that there exist various consensus performances for multi-agent systems associated with signed digraphs which are not strongly connected but only have spanning trees. In spite of this fact, we have proposed a class of interval bipartite consensus problems to derive consensus results in a unified manner by investigating the state convergence of agents. We can enable the multi-agent system with its state converging to a constant vector depending only on the initial states of root agents if and only if there exist no rooted cycles or the existing rooted cycles are all positive. This result includes as special cases the traditional consensus and bipartite consensus results of multi-agent systems (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). In addition, the multi-agent system can achieve the state stability if and only if its associated signed digraph has at least one negative rooted cycle. This improves stability results of multi-agent systems associated with structurally unbalanced signed digraphs that are required to be strongly connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Illustrative examples have been also employed to demonstrate the given consensus results for agents under signed digraphs.</p><p>We have only considered linear protocols of agents with the first-order dynamics. Some possible extensions of the proposed analysis include consensus, as well as finite-time or fixed-time consensus, in the presence of nonlinear dynamics, higher-order dynamics, communication time-delays, external disturbances, and switching topologies.</p></div>			</div>
