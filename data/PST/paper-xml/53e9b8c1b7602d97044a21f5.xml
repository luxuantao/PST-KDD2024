<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper addresses the problem of steering a group of vehicles along given spatial paths while holding a desired time-varying geometrical formation pattern. The solution to this problem, henceforth referred to as the coordinated path-following (CPF) problem, unfolds in two basic steps. First, a path-following (PF) control law is designed to drive each vehicle to its assigned path, with a nominal speed profile that may be path dependent. This is done by making each vehicle approach a virtual target that moves along the path according to a conveniently defined dynamic law. In the second step, the speeds of the virtual targets (also called coordination states) are adjusted about their nominal values so as to synchronize their positions and achieve, indirectly, vehicle coordination. In the problem formulation, it is explicitly considered that each vehicle transmits its coordination state to a subset of the other vehicles only, as determined by the communications topology adopted. It is shown that the system that is obtained by putting together the PF and coordination subsystems can be naturally viewed as either the feedback or the cascade connection of the latter two. Using this fact and recent results from nonlinear systems and graph theory, conditions are derived under which the PF and the coordination errors are driven to a neighborhood of zero in the presence of communication losses and time delays. Two different situations are considered. The first captures the case where the communication graph is alternately connected and disconnected (brief connectivity losses). The second reflects an operational scenario where the union of the communication graphs over uniform intervals of time remains connected (uniformly connected in mean). To better root the paper in a nontrivial design example, a CPF algorithm is derived for multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Simulation results are presented and discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>expand previous results on systems with brief instabilities, namely, by deriving a new small-gain theorem that applies to the feedback interconnection of these systems. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> and the references therein for an introduction to systems with brief instabilities and their application to control systems analysis and design. The second framework, uniformly connected in mean (UCM), applies to the case where the communication graph may even fail to be connected at any instant of time; however, we assume there is a finite time T &gt; 0 such that over any interval of length T the union of the different graphs is connected. This framework is motivated by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the impact of intermittent failures on coordinated PF is analyzed from a quantitative point of view and estimates on the rate of decay of all closed-loop error signals are obtained. The impact of communication delays on the overall system performance is also analyzed for the case of homogeneous delays and PF systems of Type II. Conditions are derived under which the PF errors become arbitrarily small and the cooperation errors approach zero exponentially. For related results on the consensus problems for systems with nonhomogeneous delays, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the PF and vehicle coordination problems and describes general stability-related properties that are met by the PF closed-loop subsystem of each vehicle. Section 3 introduces some basic notation, summarizes important results on graph theory, and develops the tools that will be used to study the different types of communication topologies considered in the paper. Section 4 derives a useful small-gain theorem for the feedback interconnection of systems with brief instabilities. Section 5 studies the CPF problem in the case where the communications network is subjected to communication losses with no time delays. Section 6 extends some of the results of section 5 to deal with switching communication networks and time delays. An illustrative example is presented in section <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref>, where a CPF control algorithm for a general class of underactuated AUVs is derived. The results of simulations are also described. Finally, section 8 contains the main conclusions and describes problems that warrant further research. The proofs of several statements are included in the appendix.</p><p>2. Problem statement. This section provides a rigorous formulation of the PF and coordination problems that are the main subjects of the paper. Consider a group of n vehicles numbered 1, . . . , n. We let the dynamics of vehicle i be modeled by a general system of the form ẋi = f i (x i , u i , w i ), y i = h i (x i , v i ), <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref> where x i ∈ R n is the state, u i ∈ R m is the control signal, and y i ∈ R q is the output that we require to reach and follow a path y di (γ i ) : R → R q parameterized by γ i ∈ R. Signals w i and v i denote the disturbance inputs and measurement noises, respectively. Later in section 7, an example will be given where the dynamics of (2.1) are those of a very general class of AUVs. In that case, the output y i corresponds to the position of the vehicle with respect to an inertial coordinate frame.</p><p>For any continuous, differentiable timing law γ i (t), define the PF and speed tracking error variables <ref type="bibr">(2.2)</ref> e i (t) := y i (t)y di (γ i (t)) and</p><p>(2.3) η i (t) := γi (t)v ri (t), Downloaded 01/02/13 to 132.206. <ref type="bibr">27.25</ref>. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php respectively, where v ri (t) ∈ R denotes a desired temporal speed profile to be defined.</p><p>Inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57]</ref>, we start by defining the problem of PF for each vehicle. In what follows, . denotes both the Euclidean norm of a vector and the spectral norm of a matrix.</p><p>Definition 2.1 (PF problem). Consider a vehicle with dynamics (2.1), together with a spatial path y di (γ i ); γ i ∈ R, to be followed and a desired, predetermined temporal speed profile v ri (t) to be tracked. Let the PF error and the speed tracking error be as in <ref type="bibr">(2.2</ref>) and (2.3), respectively. Given &gt; 0, design a feedback control law for u i such that all closed-loop signals are bounded and both e i and |η i | converge to a neighborhood of the origin of radius .</p><p>Stated in simple terms, the problem above amounts to requiring that the output y i of a vehicle converge to and remain inside a tube centered around the desired path y di , while ensuring that its rate of progression γi also converge to and remain inside a tube centered around the desired speed profile v ri (t).</p><p>We assume that the PF controllers adopted meet a number of technical conditions described next. In section 7, as an example, we introduce a PF controller for a general underactuated vehicle that meets these conditions. The interested reader will find in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>, and the references therein related material on PF control of nonlinear systems. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for an interesting discussion on the possible advantages of PF versus trajectory tracking control. Namely, the fact that PF control for nonminimum phase systems removes the performance limitations that are inherent to trajectory tracking schemes.</p><p>In preparation for the development that follows, we set v ri (t) = v L (γ i (t), t) + ṽri (t), where v L (γ i , t) is a nominal predetermined speed profile and ṽri can be seen as a perturbation component of v ri about v L . Later, it will be shown that v L (., .) is common to all the vehicles and known in advance and that <ref type="bibr">(2.4)</ref> ṽri (t) := v ri (t)v L (γ i (t), t)</p><p>(the remaining component of v ri (t)) is not known beforehand. We assume that y di (.) is sufficiently smooth with respect to its argument. We further assume that v L (., .) is bounded and globally Lipschitz with respect to the first argument, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∃ v M , l &gt; 0, such that |v L (γ i , t)| ≤ v M and |v L (γ i , t) -v L (γ j , t)| ≤ l|γ i -γ j |.</formula><p>Consider vehicle i and assume a feedback control law u i = u i (x i , y di , v L ) exists that solves the PF problem of Definition 2.1. Let the corresponding closed-loop PF system be described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(2.5) ζi = f ci (t, ζ i , ṽri , d i ),</formula><p>where d i subsumes all the exogenous inputs (including disturbances and measurement noises), ṽri is defined as in (2.4), and state vector ζ i includes necessarily e i but may or may not include η i . Two types of PF strategies will be considered: 1. Type I. In this strategy, variable η i plays the role of an auxiliary state for the PF algorithm and specifies the evolution of γ i . In this case η i is a state of the closed-loop PF system, that is, ζ i includes η i . 2. Type II. This strategy is equivalent to making η i = 0. The dynamics of γi are simply γi = v ri . Clearly, in this case ζ i does not include η i . We now recall the definitions of input-to-state stable (ISS) and input-to-state practical stable (ISpS) for a dynamical system.

Assuming a PF controller has been implemented for each vehicle, it now remains to coordinate (that is, synchronize) the entire group of vehicles so as to achieve a desired formation pattern compatible with the paths adopted. As will become clear, this will be achieved by adjusting the desired speeds of the vehicles as functions of the "along-path" distances among them. To better grasp the key ideas involved in the computation of these distances, consider as a simple example the case of a fleet of vehicles that are required to move along parallel straight lines and keep themselves aligned along a direction perpendicular to the lines. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1</ref> for the case of two vehicles.</p><p>Let Γ i denote the desired path to be followed by vehicle i and assume Γ i is simply parameterized by s i , the path length. In other words, γ i = s i . Because each vehicle approaches the path as close as required, that is, because y i (t) becomes arbitrarily close to to y di (γ i ), it follows that the vehicles are (asymptotically) synchronized if γ ij (t) := γ i (t)γ j (t) → 0 ∀i, j ∈ N := {1, . . . , n}. This shows that in the case of translated straight lines γ i,j = s is j is a good measure of the along-path distances among the vehicles. Similarly, in the case of vehicles that must be aligned along the radii of nested circumferences as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, an appropriate measure of the distances among the vehicles is angle γ i = s i /R i where s i denotes path length and R.

Along-path distances: circumferences.</formula><p>R i is the radius of circumference i. Clearly, this corresponds to adopting different parameterizations for the paths that correspond to normalizing their lengths. In both cases, we say that the vehicles are coordinated if the corresponding along-path distance is zero, that is, γ iγ j = 0. Coordination is achieved by adjusting the desired speed of each vehicle i as a function of the along-path distances γ ij ; j ∈ N i , where N i denotes the set of vehicles with which vehicle i communicates. For arbitrary types of paths and coordination patterns, an adequate choice of path parameterizations will allow for the conclusion that the vehicles are coordinated or, in equivalent terms, are synchronized /have reached agreement, iff γ i,j = 0 ∀j, i ∈ N ; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Since the objective of the coordination is to coordinate variables γ i , we will refer to them as coordination states.</p><p>We will require that the formation as a whole (group of multiple vehicles) travel at an assigned speed profile v L (γ i , t) when coordinated, that is, γi = v L ∀i ∈ N, where v L is allowed to be a function of path parameter γ and time t. This follows from the fact that v L (γ i , t) = v L (γ j , t) when γ i = γ j . This issue requires clarification. Note that the desired speed assignment is given in terms of the time derivatives of the coordination states γ i , not in terms of the inertial speeds (actual time derivative of the positions) of the vehicles undergoing synchronization. In the limit, as shown later, the combined PF and coordination algorithms will ensure that the coordination states will be equal and the vehicle speeds will naturally approach dsi dt : i ∈ N , so that dγi dt = dγi dsi dsi dt = v L . Thus, dsi dt = v L / dγi dsi which shows clearly how coordination states speed and inertial speeds depend on the path parameterizations adopted. In the case of the circumferences above, the latter relationship yields simply dsi dt = R i v L . Notice how the speed assignment in terms of the coordination states avoids the need to specify the actual inertial speeds of the vehicles in an inertial reference frame, which would be quite cumbersome. Instead, all that is required is to specify the speeds of the coordination states which are equal and degenerate simply into v L .</p><p>From (2.3), the evolution of the coordination state γ i , i ∈ N , is governed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(2.8) γi (t) = v ri (t) + η i (t),</formula><p>where the speed tracking errors η i are viewed as disturbance-like input signals and the speed profiles v ri are taken as control signals that must be assigned to yield coordination of the states γ i . To achieve this objective, information is exchanged through an intervehicle communication network. Typically, all-to-all communications are impossible to achieve. In general, γi will be a function of γ i and of the coordi-Downloaded 01/02/13 to 132.206.27.25.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Graph theory.</head><p>Let G(V, E) (abbreviated G) be the undirected graph induced by the intervehicle communication network, with V denoting the set of n nodes (each corresponding to a vehicle) and E the set of edges (each representing a data link). Nodes i and j are said to be adjacent if there is an edge between them. A path of length r between node i and node j consists of r + 1 consecutive adjacent nodes. We say that G is connected when there exists a path connecting every two nodes in the graph. The adjacency matrix of a graph, denoted A, is a square matrix with rows and columns indexed by the nodes such that the i, j-entry of A is 1 if j ∈ N i and zero otherwise. The degree matrix D of a graph G is a diagonal matrix where the i, i-entry equals |N i |, the cardinality of N i . The Laplacian of a graph is defined as L := D -A. It is well known that L is symmetric and L1 = 0, where 1 := <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> n×1 and 0 := [0] n×1 . If G is connected, then L has a simple eigenvalue at zero with an associated eigenvector 1, and the remaining eigenvalues are all positive.</p><p>We will be dealing with situations where the communication links are time-varying in the sense that links can appear and disappear (switch) due to intermittent failures and/or communication links scheduling. The mathematical setup required is described next.</p><p>A complete graph is a graph with an edge between each pair of nodes. A complete graph with n nodes has n = n(n -1)/2 edges. Let G be a complete graph with edges numbered 1, . . . , n. Consider a communication network among n agents. To model the underlying switching communication graph, let p = [p i ] n×1 , where each p i (t) : [0, ∞) → {0, 1} is a piecewise-continuous time-varying binary function which indicates the existence of edge i in the graph G at time t. Therefore, given a switching signal p(t), the dynamic communication graph G p(t) is the pair (V, E p(t) ), where p i (t) = 1 if i ∈ E p(t) and p i (t) = 0 otherwise. For example, p(t) = [1, 0, . . . , 0] T means that at time t only link number 1 is active. Denote by L p the explicit dependence of the graph Laplacian on p and likewise for the degree matrix D p and the adjacency matrix A p . Further let N i,p(t) denote the set of the neighbors of agent i at time t.</p><p>We discard infinitely fast switchings. Formally, we let S dwell denote the class of piecewise constant switching signals such that any consecutive discontinuities are separated by no less than some fixed positive constant time τ D , the dwell time.

In this case, the control gains become piecewise constant functions of p. In view of the above discussion we consider only condition C2.

This is followed by the analysis of the combined PF and coordination systems in Theorem 6.3. Lemma 6.1. Consider the coordination system dynamics (2.8) with the control law (6.1).

However, this is not necessarily the case when τ = 0. To see this, assume, for example, that the agreement dynamics (6.8) are at rest, that is, γi = 0 ∀i ∈ N . Then, if |N i,p(t) | = 0 for some i and t in a given interval of time, the dynamics of the ith row of (6.8) become γi = v Lv * L .

The problem of temporary communication failures was addressed under two scenarios: "brief connectivity losses" and "connected in mean" communication graphs.

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php partially decoupled. As a consequence, the dynamics of each autonomous underwater vehicle can be dealt with by each vehicle controller locally, at the path-following control level. Coordination can then be achieved by resorting to a decentralized control law whereby the exchange of data among the vehicles is kept at a minimum. The system obtained by putting together the path-following and the vehicle coordination strategies proposed was shown to be either a feedback interconnection or a cascade of two input-to-state stable systems. Stability and convergence properties of the resulting interconnected system were studied formally by introducing a new small-gain theorem for systems with brief instabilities. Simulations illustrated the efficacy of the solution proposed.</p><p>Further work is required to extend the methodology proposed to tackle more complex coordination control problems, namely, coordinated control in the presence of stringent communication constraints that arise in the underwater world such as nonhomogeneous time variable delays, tight energy budgets, and reduced channel capacity. In particular, the study of coordinated path-following control systems yielding quantifiable measures of performance in the case of unidirectional, event driven communications, is warranted.</p></div>

Again, λ 0 exists if ρ 1 ρ 2 &lt; α 1 α 2 λ 1 λ 2 . Rewrite V ≤ -λ 0 V + a(λ 2 -λ 2 (t))V 2 + g d and use aV 2 = V -V 1 to derive V ≤ -(λ 0 -λ 3 χ(p))V + g d 2 ,</formula><p>where λ 3 := λ 2 + λ2 .

For simplicity of presentation, we will for the most part drop the index i in this section. Recall the definition of speed tracking error η = γiv r , where v r is a reference speed profile. Recall also how the reference speed v r is decomposed as v r = v L + ṽr , where the derivatives of v L are known but those of ṽr are not. The derivative of e yields where we used the fact that e T S(ω)e = 0 ∀e, ω ∈ R 3 . We regard ν as a virtual control signal and introduce the virtual control tracking error variable</p><formula xml:id="formula_95">z 1 := ν -v L R T p γ d + k e M -1 e.</formula><p>Then, Ẇ1 can be rewritten as Ẇ1 = -k e e T M -1 e + e T z 1 + α 1 η, where α 1 := -e T R T p γ d . Ideally, in the absence of η one would like to drive z 1 to zero so as to render Ẇ1 negative. This motivates the next step.</p><p>Step 2. The time derivative of z 1 yields M ż1 = v L Γω + S(M z 1 )ω + B 1 u 1 + ηh 1 + h 2 , where Γ := M S(R T p γ d ) -S(M R T p γ d ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_96">h 1 := -v L M R T p γ 2 d -v γ L M R T p γ d -k e R T p γ d , h 2 := f ν + k e ν + v L h 1 .</formula><p>It turns out that due to lack of actuation, it is not always possible to drive z 1 to zero. Instead, we drive z 1 to a constant design vector δ ∈ R 3 . To this effect, we define a new error vector φ := z 1δ and the augmented Lyapunov function</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">W 2 := W 1 + 1 2 φ T M 2 ,</formula><p>whose derivative is where we used the fact that φ T M S(M z 1 )ω = φ T M S(M δ)ω. Matrix B can always be made full rank; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for details. Let β 1 := B T (BB T ) -1 (-h 2 -M -1 ek φ φ).</p><p>To complete this step, we set u 1 to be the first entry of β 1 , that is, u 1 = 1 0 1×3 β 1 , and introduce the error variable Step 3. Let β1 := h 3 + h 4 η, where h 3 collects the terms in β1 not containing η. For simplicity we do not expand h 3 and h 4 .
