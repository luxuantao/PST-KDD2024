<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Finding optima in many real-world optimization problems requires expensive evaluations in terms of computation. Because of some limitations in studies like project time requirements and computation resource constraints, the optimization process should be conducted quickly and it should not be too complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Many standard optimization algorithms require a large number of function evaluations. These algorithms usually give satisfactory results by use of their special information transfer mechanisms with a number of first candidate solutions in a number of fitness evaluations. Due to the evaluation of each candidate resolution, these processes often require computer-intensive computer resources and runtime. For this reason, the study and development of successful optimization algorithms for evaluating a limited number of functions is still an open research area. In recent years, many new approaches have been introduced and published. Some satisfactory results have been obtained from these methods with limited function evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Nature-inspired algorithm is a computational technique inspired by observation in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Swarm intelligence is a set of social behaviors pre-determined by some rules. Some of the single individuals do not act wisely enough. However, behavior of all individuals in together can be wise enough with the help of the swarm cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. One of the most well-known and researched nature-inspired and swarm intelligence methods is particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO inspired by living or hunting behaviors of birds and fish. It is widely used in difficult and complex optimization problems. Since the first introduction of PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, various PSO algorithm variants have been developed by researchers to find better algorithm in some specific problems. These developments in PSO variants can be categorized roughly into four categories: The first category algorithms are based on parameter settings focusing on the optimization of inertia weight and acceleration coefficients parameters. The second variant algorithm category is based on the neighborhood topology, which describes the connection of particles to each other. The algorithms of the third variant category are based on learning strategies consisting of teaching and peer learning of the particle bests and global best positions and the last fourth category is hybrid variants using the mixture of PSO with other suitable optimization algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Primary objectives of hybrid PSO variants are to establish a balance between exploration and exploitation and to avoid premature convergence. Moreover, hybridization can contribute to the use of the PSO's powerful capabilities and to remove the weakness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Known strong PSO abilities are easy implementation, less computing resource requirements, and fast convergence. On the other hand, it also has some weaknesses such as premature convergence or trapping in local optima and slow convergence rate in the exploitation where particles are close to each other or global optimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Firefly Algorithm (FA) is another nature-inspired and swarm intelligence optimization algorithm that mimics fireflies in the nature. FA has some advantages over PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> algorithm. These advantages are: FA does not have an individual best or a certain global best and this prevents trapping in local minima or premature convergence disadvantages. Also, the fireflies of FA algorithm do not have velocity characteristic. Thus, other problems that are based on fast or slow velocity, can be prevented <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Although FA has good characteristic in local search, sometimes it is unable to get rid of local search completely and traps in local minima <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Hybrid optimization technique is a successful combination of metaheuristic algorithm with another optimization algorithm that can display a more robust behavior and exhibit greater flexibility against complex and difficult problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Local search algorithms iteratively try to find a better solution than existing solution using appropriately defined neighborhood mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Metaheuristic is an iterative generation process that efficiently combines different sub-heuristics to discover a search space. Some learning strategies are used to find global optimum areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Population-based metaheuristics are natural approaches that explore the search field by manipulating the population and final results highly depend on their unique manipulating methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Population-based metaheuristics methods are better at describing local optima than other trajectory methods which can be easily influenced by local optima. Therefore, metaheuristic hybrids, which can combine the strengths of both population-based and trajectory methods in a proper way, are usually very efficient and successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. For example, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed an approach that combines, global search ability of genetic algorithm (GA) and the fast convergence mechanism of PSO to find global optimum more precisely. A multitude of publications propose different kinds of hybrid optimization techniques that combine their powerful mechanisms. For this reason, they are often more productive in terms of running time and/or solution results quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Memetic algorithms are based on exploitation systematic and the combination of population-based and trajectory metaheuristics synergistic. A very common way to achieve this combination is to include local search add-ons in an evolutionary algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, CEC 2015 and CEC 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, realistic engineering design optimization benchmark problems are used in a limited number of function evaluations. Therefore, fast convergence ability of PSO and good local search ability of FA are used in a hybrid way and obtained results are compared with other</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>recent hybrid PSO and FA approaches. Rest of the paper is organized as follows: Literature review is given in section 2. PSO and FA algorithms are briefly explained in section 3 and 4, respectively. Other recent hybridrelated works are analyzed and explained in section 5. Proposed hybrid algorithm is explained in section 6. Detailed flowchart and pseudo codes of the proposed algorithm are shown and given. Computationally expensive CEC 2015 and CEC 2017, engineering and mechanical design problem sets are explained and presented in section 7. Experimental setup, results and discussions are also given by using of figures and tables. Finally, conclusions of the whole paper are detailed in section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>Petalas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> propose a new efficient and robust memetic particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm that improves local search ability of the standard particle swarm algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested with various unconstrained, constrained, minimax and integer programming problems. The obtained results show, memetic approach of PSO outperforms the local and global versions of the standard PSO.</p><p>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> propose a new firefly algorithm (NFA) with local search for numerical optimization. Their algorithm addresses an issue of firefly algorithm. If the current firefly is brighter than the compared firefly, then current firefly does not begin any search process. In their proposed algorithm, brighter firefly can move based on local search principles. Experiments are done with common benchmark functions. Results of new algorithm outperforms the standard and memetic firefly algorithm versions.</p><p>Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> propose a space search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with improved convergence method against to the problems that are caused from purely random search mechanism. An opposition-based space search ability of their algorithm provides new solutions to the problem of trapped in local optima and it prevents premature convergences. In experiments CEC 2008 benchmark problems are used. Results show that proposed space search mechanism can effectively reduce an important difficulty encountered in evolutionary algorithms.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> implement a heuristic space search mechanism that is used in particle swarm optimization. Genetic algorithm (GA) slices search space into smaller subspaces. Therefore, the number of local minima are reduced. Improved PSO algorithm can convergence to the global optima and find global optima more precisely. Eleven common benchmark test functions are used to assess the proposed approach. The obtained results show that this new algorithm can optimize all functions with high success.</p><p>A variance of PSO algorithm called LHNPSO has been proposed by Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In this new method, the initial particles are produced by Halton sequence to get the least inconsistency and to scan the search field efficiently. Nonlinear functions are employed to calculate the time-varying inertia weight, cognitive and social parameters and constant acceleration coefficients are used as well. LHNPSO algorithm is tested with a group of functions consisting of well-known evaluation test functions. The results indicate that this updated PSO method rapidly converges and gives more accurate results compared to other three PSO, LPSO and LPSO-TVAC methods. D'Andreagiovanni <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> has presented a genetic algorithm to solve large examples of the Power, Frequency and Modulation Assignment Problem involved in the design of wireless networks. He shows how a genetic algorithm can be used effectively in order to better explore the field of solutions of precise algorithm solutions for wireless network design problems. D'Andreagiovanni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have suggested an advanced ant-colony algorithm which exploits appropriate linear relaxations to guide a probabilistic valorization of variables, with the aid of an extensive variable neighborhood search to design wireless body sensor networks. Obtained results on realistic examples show that improved ant-colony algorithm performs better than an efficient solver, providing quick solutions associated with improved optimization gaps. In another study, D'Andreagiovanni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> have proposed hybrid primal heuristic method which combines a randomized fixing strategy inspired by ant colony optimization algorithm and an extensive neighborhood search. They show how an approximation algorithm and linear relaxations can be integrated with an ant colony-like algorithm to get a</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>very effective and fast algorithm for multi-period network design. D'Andreagiovanni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have also proposed to solve a Connected Facility Location Problem arising in the design of telecommunication access networks by a bio-inspired approach in which they integrate the ant colony-like variable fixing, which is guided by linear relaxations, with MILP heuristic based on an exact neighborhood search. Computational results and experiments show that proposed heuristic can provide better solutions than a state-of-the-art solver.</p><p>Gambardella et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> have demonstrated how an integration of ant colony algorithms with solution improvement phases following some general simple yet effective rules can lead to very high improvements in the quality of final solutions for solving a telecommunication network design problem. Two operations are suggested to increase the performance of ant colony algorithms: the first one, considers the constructive phase and the second, the combining the constructive phase and the local search mechanism. These operations cause remarkable speedup in standard algorithm.</p><p>Tanweer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have introduced self-regulating particle swarm optimization (SRPSO). In their paper, the best particle uses its own direction to update next position. Rest particles use historical personal best position and self-perception of global direction to update next positions. Thus, the best particle is used for better exploration and rest particles are used for intelligently exploitation of the solution space. The SRPSO algorithm has been tested with CEC 2005 problems. The results are compared with other successful PSO variants and provide better solutions. Disadvantage of the SRPSO is that only the best particle is used for better exploration. The method proposed in our paper can employ all particles that have better fitness values than previous global best particle.</p><p>Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> have developed Bayesian PSO method. They used a probability intensity function based on Bayes principles for parameter setting. In this way, it is demonstrated that proposed method achieved success against regular PSO algorithm. Disadvantage of this study is that Bayesian approach frequently faces local optima problem. Especially, it is difficult to get successful results in complex multiple minima problems. Ngo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have proposed the Extraordinariness Particle Swarm Optimizer (EPSO). They state that in the standard PSO, the velocity of a particle is calculated based on global best and particle best position values. Therefore, trapping in local minima and fast premature convergences can occur. To avoid this, a new particle motion is introduced that is different from the standard PSO. In EPSO, particles can walk towards the best or the worst particles. Disadvantage of this study is that determining velocity precisely can already be a problem in convergence success.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Firefly Optimization Algorithm</head><p>Firefly algorithm was inspired by fireflies, a kind of insect in nature. Most fireflies generate rhythmic and short flashes. Type of flashes is often unique for a specific kind. Flashing light is generated by a bioluminescence process, and its real function is still a matter of debate among researchers. Fireflies use their chemical light attractiveness for communication, hunting, and warning their enemies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, Firefly algorithm flowchart is given.</p><p>Light intensity (I) at a specific distance (r) from a light source is determined by inverse square law. Therefore, light intensity decreases opposed of distance increases. Additionally, the air absorbs light and its intensity decreases and becomes weaker as distance increases. For these reasons, most fireflies can be seen from a limited distance of a few hundred meters and it is usually satisfactory distance for fireflies to communicate. Thus, flashing light can be formulated as the objective function to be optimized, so it provides a new population-based nature-inspired Firefly optimization algorithm (FA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>According to inverse square law, a light intensity (𝐼(𝑟)) at r distance from a light source (𝑙 𝑠 ) is can be calculated by Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Proposed Hybrid Firefly and Particle Swarm Optimization (HFPSO) Algorithm</head><p>Achieving a reliable success in evaluating a limited number of functions is the main goal of the proposed HFPSO algorithm. Therefore, speed of convergence is important in the early stage of iterations. Particle swarm optimization algorithm has faster convergence ability rather than some other algorithms in some problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. In local search stage of PSO, this fast convergence ability decreases and slows down especially when searching in the solution space close to a global optimal solution. Balance between exploration and exploitation in PSO can be efficiently controlled by using control parameters of PSO: inertia weight (w), acceleration coefficients (c1, c2). Velocity of a particle (V) can be calculated by the use of these control parameters according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>). Thus, velocities are used for calculation of the next particles' new positions</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T [33]</formula><p>. Amount of particle velocity value is significant in local search, but calculating the proper velocity can be a challenging task during local search, as improper values can cause particles to oscillate around optimal solution like a pendulum. These oscillation or swing movements cause some delays in the whole optimization task. Due to this problem, velocity can be ignored in exploitation stages. In the other hand, firefly algorithm does not have a velocity (V) characteristic. Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> points out the superiority of firefly algorithm over PSO and genetic algorithms, and generally, global optimum is easily achieved in experimental problems in firefly algorithm paper. Also, there are no parameters in firefly algorithm to use previous best position of each firefly. Therefore, fireflies move regardless of their previous best positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, an optimization algorithm that combines search ability of firefly and particle swarm optimization algorithms has been proposed. By using this combination, a balance between exploration and exploitation is aimed to establish and it benefits strengths of both algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Fireflies have no velocity (V) and personal best position (pbest) memories in comparison to particles. In the proposed hybrid combination of two algorithms, PSO is generally used in the global search, because it provides fast convergence in exploration. Additionally, FA is generally used in local search, because it provides fine-tuning in exploitation. Dynamically adjusted inertia weight studies that consider improvements on previous personal best, have succeed <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, flowchart of proposed hybrid of firefly and particle swarm optimization (HFPSO) algorithm is shown. First of all, input parameters that are used by both algorithms in the following steps are inserted.

CEC 2015 benchmark functions is the collection of 15 challenging expensive budget optimization problems, including highly complex composite and hybrid problems, too <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. CEC 2017 benchmark problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> are the recent collection of 30 functions. Both sets of benchmark problems consist of unimodal, simple multimodal, hybrid, and composition type of functions shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. 'Fi *' is the global optimum value and the search range of variable bounds ∈ [-100, 100].</p><p>A unimodal function has a non-separable and sensitive direction or smooth but narrow ridge. A multi-modal function can be continuous everywhere yet differentiable nowhere, or its local optima's number is pretty high and the next better local optimum is far away from the global optimum, or this type function can be continuous but differentiable only on a set of points. In real-world optimization problems, various subsets of variables may have diverse properties. In a hybrid function, variables are randomly split into some subsets and then some dissimilar basic functions (Modified Schwefel's, Rastrigin's, High Conditioned Elliptic etc.) are used for various subsets. Composition function combines properties of some sub-functions (Rosenbrock's, Bent Cigar, Discus etc.) better and provides durability around global or local optima <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, 10 dimensional (10D) and 30 dimensional (30D) CEC 2015 problems' final mean optimized output values are shown. According to the table, the proposed HFPSO has better final mean values and outperforms other algorithms in all 30D problems which are unimodal, simple multimodal, hybrid, and composition function types. However, in F8, F9, F11, F13, F15 hybrid and composition 10D problems, HPSOFF algorithm slightly surpasses the proposed HFPSO which has lower chance to concrete for convergence with reduced and randomly divided variables into subsets on local search. In HPSOFF algorithm, as we know, firefly algorithm obtains its first initial population from PSO algorithm outputs. Additionally, FA is the best only in F2, and PSO is the best only in F10. When Table <ref type="table">3</ref> analyzed, it can be seen that HFPSO can find the lowest mean minimization values in 8 and 15 out of 15 problems for 10D and 30D, respectively. The best results are highlighted with red color and shown in the tables. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> orders the algorithms according to their final mean optimized output values. According to Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, the proposed HFPSO is best on all 30D problems and it has the first ranks, thus average rank value of HFPSO in 30D problems is 1,00. Thus, the final rank of proposed HFPSO is the first. According to their ranks, following second, third, fourth, and fifth algorithms are HPSOFF, PSO, FA, FFPSO, respectively. HPSOFF has second rank in 10D problems, but in 30D problems, PSO surpasses it and replaces with HPSOFF because of less success in hybrid and composition functions. HFPSO is also compared with recent PSO variants and other optimization approaches. EPSO is a recent improved PSO variant paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. EPSO is compared with standard PSO, other successful PSO variants and optimizers. It is showed in EPSO paper that EPSO outperforms the rest in CEC 2015 problems. ISRPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is an improved variant of SRPSO algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. ISRPSO is also a participant of CEC 2015 competition. It is improved version of standard PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> algorithm.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, optimization results of Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Strategy (ES), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES-S, CMAES-G), EPSO, ISRPSO are shown and all results are directly extracted from related papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. In Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, it is seen that HFPSO is better than other PSO variants and optimizers especially in hybrid and composition function categories. HFPSO can find the lowest mean minimization values in 8 out of 15 problems for 30D problems compared to other papers' different algorithm results.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, CEC 2017 benchmarks set and 10 dimensional (10D) problems' final mean optimized output values are shown. According to the table, HFPSO can find the lowest mean minimization values in 14 out of 30 problems for 10D. Firefly algorithm (FA) slightly surpasses the proposed HFPSO in 11 problems out of 30 problems. Rotated and shifted CEC 2017 problems are more suitable for firefly than particle swarm. Firefly does not have velocity and some other parameters thus can escape local optima rather than PSO in CEC 2017 10D problems. CEC 2017 problem set contains 15 more problems than CEC 2015 problem set. Average rank of proposed HFPSO is 1,90 in CEC 2017 10D and this result is 1,87 in CEC 2015. Especially, the average rank is increased because of the hybrid function category results. Additionally, PSO has the best mean minimization output values in F9 and F28. HPSOFF is better in F1, F12, F15, F22, F25 functions than other algorithms. FFPSO has no success in these functions with limited allocated budgets. The best results are highlighted with red color and shown in the tables.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, some CEC 2017 10D results of HFPSO are shown in box plots. Each box contains a central median value, outliers, and the 25 th and 75 th percentiles of the 20 independent run results. Box plots indicate that HFPSO results are stable and generally have low standard deviation values. Except some outliers, it can be inferred from F1, F12, F15, F18, F19 function box plot graphs that proposed HFPSO converges generally around the same points. F22, F23, F25 have short boxes indicating that the obtained results have low volatilities. Rest of the functions show some unbalanced results. For example, F9 has a long box, still its central line median value is low. On the other hand, F20 has also long result distributions, but its median is a bit higher.</p><p>CEC 2017 problems with 30D results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. According to the table, HFPSO can find the lowest mean minimization values in 28 out of 30 problems for 30D. Average rank of HFPSO, which is 1,00 in CEC 2015 30D, is 1,07 here. Only standard PSO and HPSOFF results are better than HFPSO in simple multimodal F9 and composition F22 functions, respectively. Number of particles is 10 and 30 on 10D and 30D problems respectively. Therefore, using proper particle size in the proposed HFPSO algorithm can affect CEC problem results.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, mean runtime of algorithms versus the function numbers are shown in milliseconds. In all 10D, 30D CEC 2015 and CEC 2017 problems, HFPSO has the short runtimes as competitive with PSO. 30D problems' runtimes are about 3 times higher than 10D problem runtimes. Runtimes are comparatively increased against hybrid and composition functions, which are more complex than other functions. It is clear</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>that, HPSOFF has about half of PSO and FA algorithm values. Thus, HPSOFF has third minimum mean runtime values in milliseconds, FFPSO is fourth, and the last rank of runtime belongs to FA. By examining the graph, it can be said that proposed HFPSO combination uses particle swarm algorithm mechanisms more and if it is necessary, a local search or particle fine tuning process starts, then firefly algorithm is used in that way.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows the results of 10D, 30D, CEC 2015 and CEC 2017 the grand total mean fitness values for unimodal, simple multimodal, hybrid, and composition functions based on algorithms. The lower values indicate better minimization output values. According to the figure, in unimodal functions, HFPSO has a much better comparative ratio than the others. Besides, in summary, in simple multimodal, hybrid, and composition function categories, HFPSO outperforms PSO and FA algorithms and other hybrid approaches. In the graph, it can be seen that FFPSO algorithm is not suitable for unimodal functions.</p><p>Our proposed HFPSO algorithm combines ability and capability of particle swarm and firefly optimization algorithms. A balanced combination between local and global search ability is achieved. Therefore, the advantages of both algorithms are utilized in a proper hybridization.</p><p>The updated fast convergence ability and increased particle diversity in the hybrid FF and PSO (FFPSO) algorithm are obtained through a FA inserted into PSO to avoiding to get trapped in local minima. Difference between FA and FFPSO is: the light attraction of each particle is mutated by a PSO operator. During the calculation of position vector, distance to personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) are considered. Hence, local search is occurred via the modified attractiveness step and particles are randomly attracted global best <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The main objective of FFPSO is feature selection which reduces the features of the problem before supervised neural network classification.</p><p>Hybrid PSO-FFA (HPSOFF) algorithm combines the fast calculation advantage of PSO with robustness advantage of FA in order to get an increased global search ability. PSO starts with a set of random initial population. Until a termination criterion is reached, the population is promoted and moves towards the best personal and global particles. At the end of iterations, the optimal solution is given as outputs. Afterwards, FA uses these outputs as input initial population and in every iteration, FA improves and promotes the population obtained from PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Hence, optimal solution obtained from HPSOFF algorithm depends on both standard PSO and FA algorithms and the quality of initial solution. Main objective of HPSOFF is to provide a new and better solution approach for Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) problem, which is formulated as multi-objective optimization problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, a hybrid algorithm combining PSO and FA is proposed. Advantages and strengths of PSO and FA are combined and disadvantages of these algorithms i.e. premature convergence and local optima are tried to be mitigated. Hybrid use of these algorithms helps to provide a balance between exploration and exploitation processes. The general results show that this hybridization provides good results over standard PSO and FA in the limited function evaluations of computationally expensive numerical problems. In experiments, CEC 2015 and CEC 2017 benchmark optimization problem sets and some well-known engineering design realistic problems are used. In experiments, 10 dimensional (10D), 30 dimensional (30D) and also 100 dimensional (100D) variables are employed in benchmark optimization problem sets. Proposed hybrid firefly and particle swarm optimization (HFPSO) algorithm is compared with FFPSO and HPSOFF that are other recent hybrid FA and PSO optimization algorithm approaches. Some recently published robust PSO variants: EPSO and ISRPSO, and other optimizers DE, (µ+λ)-ES, CMAES-S, CMAES-G results are extracted from related papers and compared with HFPSO as well. HFPSO has achieved sufficient success over the other approaches. Additionally, in order to see how proposed algorithm performs in realistic optimization problems, three engineering and mechanical design benchmark problems: pressure vessel, welded beam, and tension and compression spring are used, respectively. HFPSO obtains acceptable good engineering and mechanical cost results in comparison with the other algorithms' results that are extracted from previous published papers. In order to indicate whether differences between the algorithms in performance are statistically significant or not, the Holm-Bonferroni procedure is employed. For this purpose, 5 related algorithms and 2 problem sets containing 15 and 30 dimensional problems are used and the statistical tests are performed. Gathered statistical results prove that the proposed HFPSO algorithm is significantly</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>different in performance against the other algorithms in 30D problems. At last, a memetic metaheuristic called the shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) is compared with other related algorithms in CEC 2017 100D high dimensional problems. The general results show that the proposed HFPSO has much better performances than other benchmark algorithms. Especially, it is observed that the proposed method's results of unimodal and simple multimodal problems are clearly better than the others. Also, runtimes are measured and graphs of runtime comparison are given. According to runtime graphs, mean runtime results show that the proposed method has acceptable runtime statistics. It exhibits a competitive and good performance over standard PSO, FA, and other hybrid approaches.  </p></div>

Graphs are drawn by corresponding mean values of 20 independent run results. Mostly, HFPSO converges towards the better optima point with a faster rate of convergence than other algorithms. When graph of Fig.5is analyzed, it is seen that HFPSO generally tracks PSO convergence line and uses FA abilities. Therefore, exploration and exploitation are done in a combination and better diversity of particles are provided with this combination.</figDesc></figure>
