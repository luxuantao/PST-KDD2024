<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article introduces the theme issue on social interaction and reflection for behaviour change. A large body of research exists on systems designed to help users in changing their behaviours, for instance, to exercise more regularly or to reduce energy consumption. Increasingly, these systems focus on multiple users, often to encourage open-ended reflection rather than prescribing a particular course of action. As background for this theme issue, this article presents a literature review on behaviour change support systems that focus on social interaction and reflection. The review highlights five key approaches amongst these systems: social traces, social support, collective use, reflection-in-action, and reflection-on-action. Each approach offers unique benefits, but also challenges for the design of behaviour change support systems. We highlight how the articles in this theme issue contribute to our current understanding of these five approaches, and beyond that, set out some broad directions for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Personal and ubiquitous computing systems of many types, from smartphone apps and wearable devices to sensors and displays embedded in our environment, are focussed on helping users to achieve their goals in changing their behaviours. Many systems focus on health, e.g. to help people engage in regular physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, follow a healthy diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> or a therapy reducing depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, or give up unhealthy habits like smoking cigarettes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. In the area of sustainability, systems have focussed on helping households and workplaces reduce their consumption of electricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> and water <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, encourage reduction of waste and recycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and use alternative modes of transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. More recently, systems have turned to more mundane activities like household chores <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and prolonged TV consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, as well as digital behaviours like managing digital distractions and interruptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>Much of the work in this area has been inspired by BJ Fogg's book on persuasive technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Drawing from theories in social psychology, Fogg lays out different techniques with which computers can change human attitudes and behaviours. More than one hundred papers on behaviour change in the CHI conference proceedings over a period of 10 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and a yearly conference dedicated to persuasive technology, highlight the impact of this area of inquiry for human-computer interaction (HCI).</p><p>More recently, Oinas-Kukkonen has proposed the concept of behaviour change support systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The concept of behaviour change support systems builds on the traditional notion of persuasive technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, but it places more emphasis on people's needs and goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In particular, the concept acknowledges that people's goals vary from forming a new behaviour to maintaining habits and that therefore behaviour change support systems need to be designed accordingly to assist users in pursuing their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This subtle shift in focus from what the technology can offer towards supporting people's needs and goals has helped to address some of the critiques of persuasive technology as traditionally conceived, such as their top-down design <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, their prescriptive approach in what behaviours are desirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and their lack of sensitivity for the varying needs of individual users <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>This theme issue extends this line of research with a focus on systems that incorporate (1) social interaction and (2) reflection as means to support behaviour change. Firstly, research on persuasive technology and behaviour change support systems has traditionally focussed on individual users. However, the widespread use of smartphones and social media has created new opportunities to connect people and to exchange support. For instance, peer groups can be an important source of social support throughout the change process <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and personal and ubiquitous computing technologies can help them collaborate through tracking and sharing of behavioural data <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Secondly, while many technologies for behaviour change prescribe goals and nudge people towards particular choices, personal and ubiquitous computing technologies offer opportunities for more open-ended reflection on personal behaviour. For example, the Quantified Self movement highlights the popularity of self-tracking through smartphone apps and sensor technologies to better understand and reflect on one's actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Beyond that, ambient displays such as the Power-Aware Cord <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which glows in response to energy consumption, facilitate reflection by bringing unconscious aspects of our lifestyles such as our electricity consumption to our awareness, thereby making them available for conscious deliberation.</p><p>Rather than merely summarizing the articles in this theme issue, we wish to introduce this theme issue by discussing five broad themes in designing for social interaction and reflection: social traces, social support, collective use, reflection-in-action, and reflection-on-action. These themes emerged in our analysis of the articles assembled in this theme issue and related research. They provide a deeper grounding to these articles and highlight connections between them. Furthermore, they offer an indication of our own research on behaviour change support systems and where we see potential for further research. These themes are not meant to be mutually exclusive, nor are they meant to be comprehensive or complete reviews of related work. Instead, we hope to show why the area covered in this theme issue is important, where research on behaviour change support systems has come from, and where it may be headed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Social interaction</head><p>There is ample evidence of the strong influence exerted by social interaction on people's behaviours. From classic experiments of conformity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to more recent studies of large-scale social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> to the social and humanized web <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, we see how our interactions with the people around us influence our activities, both online and offline. The following section presents an overview of how behaviour change support systems mediate social interaction, ranging from minimal social traces of other people's activities to rich interactions via social media to systems that focus on the collective rather than the individual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Social traces</head><p>A first approach for behaviour change support systems is to provide social traces, where users encounter traces or patterns of other users. These may be anonymous, such as usage statistics or averages of previous users' data entries, or the traces may be created by known others, like knowledgeable hobbyists or celebrities. They open the possibility for users to be supported through the presence of others, without necessarily requiring expressions of identity, explicit relationships, or rich interactions.</p><p>Social traces are in widespread use and bring a range of recognized benefits. Firstly, social traces can provide an awareness of the issues concerned with behaviour change as well as the impact of collective behaviour change. For example, Kim and Paulos <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> sought to raise awareness about poor indoor air quality, which is difficult to detect for humans through sight and smell alone. They deployed a system that measured indoor air quality and shared the information between households of friends, which promoted awareness and discussion amongst the household members. Reitberger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, on the other hand, explored how visualizing the impact of collective behaviour may motivate an individual to change their habits. Their aim was to encourage the use of public transport and bicycles rather than cars, in order to reduce pollution and road congestion. While an individual may have little impact on the levels of pollution and traffic congestion in a city, they showed that detecting and visualizing the impact of collective behaviour through anonymized traces would motivate an individual.</p><p>Secondly, in addition to anonymous traces, there is need for trailblazers in the social web <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> who for various reasons seek to be thought as leaders and who have followers in their endeavour. Such an activity fulfils people's need especially because even though people can be interested in many diverse topics, they most often just want to follow what others recommend them rather than wanting to personally spend time to do research about them. Typically, any user may create these trails and share them with others, but the difference to anonymous traces is that trailblazers purposefully polish their ideas to match with the interests of tracers. This social behaviour can be seen especially with social networking systems such as Twitter.</p><p>Thirdly, social traces are in widespread use to indicate norms. Social and cultural norms are expectations for appropriate behaviour within a social setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Sometimes norms are made explicit through signs (like 'no smoking' signs), and at other times, we implicitly adjust our behaviour based on our observations of what those around us are already doing. Behaviour change support systems can use social traces to convey norms about information that is not easily observable. For example, the lambent shopping trolley handle <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> helps shoppers choose sustainable products in the supermarket. The handle provides factual information about food miles (the distance the product has travelled from the time of its production until it reaches the consumer). Furthermore, it shows social traces of other shoppers, where shoppers can compare their chosen product to the average shopper's food miles. A similar approach has been used in various studies of domestic energy monitoring systems, where users received information about the energy consumption of their own household as well as the households of their friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and neighbours <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, social traces can be used to encourage comparison and competition. For example, the Houston system designed by Consolvo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> encouraged people to incorporate more walking into their daily routine. The system quantified the user's walking time to encourage personal goal setting, and this information was also shared with other users of the application to facilitate comparison and competition between users. Admittedly, studies of behaviour change support systems using goal setting and competition have found mixed results. Some users find motivation through competition, which helps them to start changing behaviours and to stay committed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, whereas some users find that overly competitive interaction goes against the spirit of positively encouraging behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. More clarification on this is warranted.</p><p>In summary, social traces can provide useful support for behaviour change through enhanced awareness of the issues concerned with behaviour change, trailblazing effect, information about norms, and motivation through competition. However, offering traces that are meaningful and support change, without encouraging competitiveness that adversely affects change, remains an ongoing challenge for the design of behaviour change support systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Social support</head><p>The second approach is concerned with rich interactions that offer social support. Social support refers to various forms of exchange between people to enhance their wellbeing. It can involve esteem support, intimacy, companionship, and validation. Furthermore, social support can involve tangible support and material aid as well as informational support like advice and help in problemsolving <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Research on online support has typically focused on exchanges within anonymous online communities. For example, a longitudinal study of such a community by Maloney-Krichmar and Preece <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> reported a positive influence of online support on participants' health and well-being. Burke and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> found that rhetoric matters in online communities, and particularly that explicit requests increase the likelihood of getting a supportive reply. Wang and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> showed that exposure to emotional support (but not informational support) increased the member's commitment to the online community.</p><p>Social network sites like Facebook hold further potential for the exchange of social support because most users log on daily to interact with other users <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Hence, they offer a useful infrastructure to connect individuals with peers with similar behaviour change concerns. For example, a recent study of a Facebook page for smoking cessation shows how users at different stages of change offer advice and seek emotional support in this online setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. A similar study of Twitter users shows how people exchange support online during their quit attempt and even when they relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, social network sites facilitate interactions with their offline social networks, like family members, friends and colleagues. Some of these contacts have a good knowledge of a person's needs and emotional state and so provide tailored support <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. Several studies have deployed applications building on Facebook to utilize the support available from personal contacts. For example, the BinCam system developed by Comber and Thieme <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> used Facebook to facilitate discussion and support between friends in shared households to reduce waste and encourage recycling. Munson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> built a wellness application for Facebook that encouraged users to share personal experiences with good things that happened to them.</p><p>A residual challenge in designing for social support is to find a balance between encouraging expressions of support and allowing a user to remain private. The research discussed thus far has shown that individuals benefit from the social support available through social network site and online communities. However, there are several reasons why individuals are typically reluctant to ask for support or share their personal experiences online. In general, acknowledging the differences between problem domains, people who are trying to change are often ambivalent about seeking support due to concerns about obstructive responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, potential pressure from peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, as well as concerns about failure to change and embarrassment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. It is not surprizing, then, that expressions of support in anonymous online communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> as well as social network sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> typically come from people who have successfully changed rather than those who are trying to change. Furthermore, the presence of existing social networks on Facebook can also adversely complicate social support. In everyday life, people disclose personal matters selectively to obtain support, keeping them private from other people. Therefore, the social network site Google ? facilitates selective sharing of personal information. Google? users typically segment their online personal networks according to life facets, relationship strength, or shared interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Despite the availability of similar features to segment personal networks on Facebook, information is typically broadcast to all of these social contexts from close friends to distant acquaintances, which creates tensions in the way people would like to present themselves to others. Hence, while some people desire support from close ties on Facebook, they typically prefer to disclose challenges about their behaviour change and well-being to anonymous online communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Designing for collective use</head><p>A third approach towards behaviour change is concerned with designing for the collective. So far, this article has largely focussed on systems that facilitate social interaction between individuals. Social traces rely on input from a larger group, but they primarily benefit the individual who can compare themself with others. Similarly, social support is generated by a group of users, but persuasive applications, discussion forums, and social network sites alike typically offer accounts for individual users, who benefit from the resources provided by peers and personal networks. Having said that, some of the work discussed so far has shown a partially collective orientation. Several systems focussed on behaviour change in a household <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, yet each of these systems was delivered to individuals, either through personal smartphone apps or Facebook accounts. The persuasive game ''Smoke?'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> was based on collectivist values like harmony and group opinion, but likewise it was designed for individual play.</p><p>In contrast to this, a growing body of research has started to design systems for collectives of users, like local communities and groups of co-workers. Katzeff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, for example, sought to encourage reflection and discussion on electricity amongst co-workers in factory and office settings. Rather than focussing on single workers, they designed ambient light installations and deployed them in spaces where workers met and socialized. Hence, the displays provided the workers with an opportunity to collectively reflect on activities that consume electricity. The design of Twinkly Lights <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> also focussed on workplaces. Instead of encouraging reflection, however, the Twinkly Lights installation used a series of ambient lights embedded into the floor to entice employees and visitors into taking the stairs rather than the elevator. In a similar way, the Piano Staircase system used a playful approach to encourage commuters at an underground railway station to take the stairs instead of the escalator. As the name suggests, the stairs looked like piano keys, and it sounded like piano keys being played when walked on <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>The work by Valkanova and colleagues focused on behaviour change within a local community <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. They designed the Reveal-it! system, which visualized individual, average neighbourhood, and average city-wide energy consumption on a semi-public space to encourage discussion about electricity consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. In a similar way, the Tidy Street project used large-scale visualizations to engage an entire street into discussions about electricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. In contrast to the Reveal-it! system, however, the Tidy Street project focussed on the average consumption of households in the street, rather than a particular individual's household. This was to foster collaboration rather than competitiveness between different households.</p><p>All these systems embedded technologies into the social settings that groups of people inhabited, like people's homes, shared workspaces, and open public spaces. As with any ubiquitous technology, they raise questions about the appropriate level of engagement for a setting, e.g. whether people notice the system, but also whether they want to be exposed to persuasive information or even share their own data in a public display. Unlike with personal systems, people inhabiting a space embedded with technology may have less choice to avoid the space and thereby opt out of becoming a user. On the other hand, the examples discussed here have shown the potential of welldesigned systems to engage groups in discussion and actual behaviour change. Some of the examples, like the Tidy Street project <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> and the ambient light installations by Katzeff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> focussed on encouraging reflection in groups. The following section will further expand on behaviour change support systems designed for reflection, both individually as well as collectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Reflection</head><p>Ideally, reflecting about certain aspects of one's life provides valuable insights, which in turn lead individuals to reconsider and possibly change particular attitudes or behaviours. This idea of reflection can be traced back to ancient Greece, where ''gno ¯thi seauton'' (know thyself) was one of the Delphic maxims. In HCI, the notion of reflection has been emphasized by the slow technology agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, which underlines the creation of technology for reflection over a mere focus on speed and efficiency. More recently, a slowness lens has been used by Siegel and Beck to conceptualize ''slow change'' interaction design focusing on behavioural change in the long term with a holistic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Similarly, in this theme issue on behaviour change support systems, we are interested in going beyond quick persuasion following prescribed goals, towards technologies that enable people to engage with particular facets of their lives, which potentially also result in a change in behaviour.</p><p>Many systems for reflection use ambiguous, abstract, and ambient visualizations to involve people in an openended sense-making process. For example, Long and Vines <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> present an interactive artwork for ambiguous reflection, which senses contextual and user data and presents it in a way that leaves room for the interpretation on behalf of the users. The role of their interactive artwork is confined to aggregation and artful representation of the data rather than definite sense-making and display of decisive output. Similarly, the design of Twinkly Lights <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, which nudged people towards taking the stairs instead of the elevator, used ambient interfaces that were unobtrusive and provided ambiguous feedback on the amount of elevator and stair use in the building. Despite their unobtrusive nature, these examples show that ambiguous approaches still influence behaviour.</p><p>To unpack this complex notion of reflection and its different forms, Fleck and Fitzpatrick <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> frame a design landscape for reflection and propose five different levels of reflection: revisiting, revisiting with explanation, exploring relationships, fundamental change and wider implications. Their fourth level, fundamental change, which they also denote as transformative reflection, is the most relevant to the notion of reflection for behaviour change, which is highlighted in this theme issue. This kind of reflection might foster a change in understanding or practice based on the acquisition of a different point of view and the opening of new perspectives.</p><p>Another way to distinguish different forms of reflection is based on their temporal relation to the activity at hand and was proposed by Scho ¨n <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. In his work about reflective practice, Scho ¨n differentiates between reflectionin-action and reflection-on-action, where the first denotes contemplation at the time of doing (''thinking on our feet''), whereas the latter is about deliberately pausing to think about previous activities. In the following sections, we will use these two types of reflection as a lens to understand behaviour change support systems and the opportunities for ubiquitous computing to support these two modes of reflection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Reflection-in-action</head><p>Due to their situated, distributed, and connected nature, ubiquitous computing systems have the potential to foster reflection-in-action. Sensors worn on the body and embedded into the environment can be used to track relevant information about the context of a user <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, which then can be processed and presented to the user via and mobile and ambient displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> to provide feedback while a person goes through an activity. For example, commercially available devices such as Fitbit One <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> and the Nike? Fuelband <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> track physical movement and provide real-time feedback through a wearable device while a person is walking, running, or cycling, etc.</p><p>Using personal and ubiquitous computing systems technologies for self-tracking has become increasingly popular with the rise of the Quantified Self movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, which aims to facilitate self-knowledge through obtaining quantifiable measurements about people. Recent statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> show that in stark contrast to its beginning in an ITaffine subculture, self-tracking has become a mainstream phenomenon: 69 % of U.S. adults track a health indicator for themselves or a loved one, and 60 % track their weight, diet or exercise routing. Those who track, often do this informally, either on paper (34 % of self-trackers) or in their heads (49 %). Nevertheless, 21 % of them use technology, i.e. a spreadsheet, website, app, or device to log their data <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Recent qualitative studies have started to explore how people incorporate tracking into their everyday lives, i.e. how it helps them to reflect on their current situation and in the pursuit of their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, as well as how it enables them to maintain changes in the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Studies of self-tracking technologies such as Ubifit Garden <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> show the capacity of such technology to affect and change people's behaviour. Ubifit Garden enabled reflection-in-action by employing a glance able garden metaphor implemented on user's mobile phones that enabled them to easily assess the state of their tracked physical activity levels with a quick look on their phones. In a similar vein, the perCues application for sustainable mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> was designed to use a mobile device to provide cues to influence users decisions towards abstaining from using their cars and taking public transportation instead. These cues were to be presented in the right moment in order to utilize the principle of Kairos <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which states that a persuasive intervention has a higher possibility of success if the timing is right. The findings of an exploratory study with a mobile perCues paratype <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> supported the idea of finding opportune moments, but it also raised other challenges for supporting reflection-inaction, i.e. how to provide feedback that builds on the users' knowledge-in-action and supports their actions without interrupting them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Reflection-on-action</head><p>Reflection-on-action facilitated by personal and ubiquitous computing systems does not take place immediately during a particular activity, but rather after the activity has ended. Similarly to reflection-in-action, sensors can be utilized to capture action related to user and contextual information in an unobtrusive manner, but the feedback is given to the users at a different point in time, typically in situations where they have more time and resources available to engage with this information. Therefore, systems that support reflection-on-action can allow for more extensive interaction and even experimentation with one's data. These systems can go beyond the mere representation of sensor information by e.g. showing connections, correlations and (long-term) patterns in the collected data.</p><p>Fish'n'steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> is an example for a system that is built to support reflection-on-action. It utilizes pedometers for step tracking and visualizes a user's progress with a fish bowl metaphor on a PC screen in a post hoc manner. Similarly, commercial systems such as Fitbit provide a web-based dashboard that gives a multifaceted view on one's data on activities, calories burned, sleep, etc. in addition to the step data that is available on the wearable Fitbit device. Furthermore, the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes, that already require logging of certain parameters can be augmented with technology. Smith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> used self-tracking for young people with diabetes to encourage reflection-on-action to improve understanding and communication regarding the self-management of the disease. Other systems in that area like the mySugr Companion app <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> allow for playful reflection about one's success with the management of diabetes via the use of persuasive strategies such as goal setting and rewards.</p><p>An ongoing challenge for reflection-on-action is how to best represent data for a particular activity. One aspect of this challenge is the degree of ambiguity in the data. Ambiguous information as in the interactive artwork discussed by Long and Vines can encourage deep engagement to make sense of the feedback. Concrete numerical information as in the Fitbit system, on the other hand, leaves less room for interpretation, but still allows for reflection about a particular activity. Dourish and Mazmanian <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> highlight that different ways of representing numerical data allow for different degrees of knowing and reflection, e.g. lists support ordering of information, trees show hierarchies, and tables show relations between different data points. Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> explored alternatives to highly ambiguous and numerical information, creating visualizations that increase enjoyment in addition to numerical and graph-based visualizations. Correspondingly, Froehlich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> studied a range of visualizations for feedback about water consumption to promote sustainable behaviour. The results showed that the same designs were perceived in very different ways by users, evoking positive feelings like accountability and playfulness as well negative reactions such as perceptions of intrusiveness and guilt. An explanation for this difference is that these visualizations did not merely show consumption patterns, but rather revealed household activities and routines. Understanding these social dynamics is important for the acceptance of such systems in the home. Specifically, users preferred information with a high level of data granularity, but they also wanted to be able to choose between different data representations, i.e. different periods of time and different units of measurement (amounts, costs). These findings indicate that designers need to carefully consider their choices in what data gets collected and how it gets represented, also taking into account the social practices surrounding these data, as they impact how users make sense of the world and their activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Contributions in this theme issue</head><p>This theme issue assembles five papers. One of the papers offers conceptual-theoretical contributions to current understanding of social interaction and reflection in behaviour change. Wiafe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> build on Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> and the Persuasive Systems Design model <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> to propose a method of characterizing users in the context of their behaviour change. The article introduces the 3D-RAB model, which highlights eight different states of cognitive dissonance. These states clarify which type(s) of change in the cognitive state of users the system is attempting to support. It also provides guidance for researchers and designers of behaviour change support systems in selecting suitable techniques to achieve positive change.</p><p>Oduor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> offer a more technical contribution through persuasive software design patterns for social influence, which developers of behaviour change support systems can use to guide their implementations. Bringing together software design pattern thinking and theory on social influence, the article offers four patterns: social learning and facilitation, competition, cooperation and recognition. The patterns for social learning and competition are based on sharing traces, whereas cooperation and recognition rely on rich exchanges of support between users. These persuasive software design patterns aid reflection on persuasive software design and development, and they may also aid in designing for collectives.</p><p>The remaining three papers offer contributions based on research-through-design. Zuckerman and Gal-Oz <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> developed a mobile phone application ''StepByStep'' to explore the effectiveness of different (social) traces to promote physical activity. They found that a basic selftracking approach significantly increased the participants' daily walking time over a 2-week period. They further added personal rewards to gamify self-tracking as well as social traces to compare and compete with other users. However, when compared with the basic self-tracking system, all systems yielded similar amounts of walking time. These findings show that the main benefit of the StepByStep system was not through the social traces it offered, but through the self-tracking data that provided real-time feedback of performance towards a goal and opportunities for reflection-in-action.</p><p>Reitberger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> designed Nutriflect to raise awareness and enable reflection on nutrition. Nutriflect consisted of a shared display situated in people's homes as well as mobile application that provided in situ information on products and personal nutrition while shopping for groceries. A field study showed that the two systems complemented each other: the home display served as an ambient display that heightened awareness and encouraged interaction and reflection-on-action amongst the household members. The mobile system, on the other hand, was used for focussed interaction with personalized and productspecific information on nutrition to support reflection-inaction while shopping for groceries.</p><p>The final article by Parker <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> focused on designing behaviour change support systems for collectives, i.e. a local neighbourhood. Parker developed Community Mosaic, a system that encourages local residents to share the steps they are taking to eat healthfully. The system asked users to share photos and stories about their behaviour not for personal benefit but for the benefit of others in their community. A field study showed that the system encouraged community members to reflect upon and analyse their personal habits as well as to take active steps to eat more healthfully. Creating photos and stories for the benefit of other community members also led to benefits for the individual users. The participants reflected more deeply on their eating habits, because they were not only concerned about their own health, but also about how their stories would be perceived by other members of their local community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In this article, we have presented a review of the current state of research on systems that use social interaction and reflection as means to support behaviour change. We have highlighted five key approaches in this area: social traces, social support, collective use, reflection-in-action, and reflection-on-action. Each approach offers unique benefits, but also challenges to designers and researchers of behaviour change support systems:</p><p>1. Social traces support awareness-building, trailblazing, normative influence, and motivation through collaboration and competition. However, a key challenge is how to present traces that are minimal yet provide meaningful support. A second key challenge is how to support interaction through numerical traces without encouraging competiveness that may undermine people's desire to change. 2. Social support refers to various forms of exchange between people to help them change their behaviours, like esteem support, companionship, tangible support, advice and help. Online communities and social network sites facilitate the exchange of support online, but encouraging contributions from users as well as how to best support users in managing their privacy throughout the behaviour change process remain ongoing challenges. 3. Systems designed for collectives are typically embedded into the settings that they inhabit, like people's homes, shared workspaces and open public spaces. These systems can encourage change on a large scale, but designing situated technologies is challenging in terms of finding an appropriate level of engagement for a given setting as well as in supporting the privacy of individuals who access and inhabit them. 4. Reflection-in-action is supported by systems that provide feedback at the time of action. These systems can be effective as they offer resources for reflection at the right time. However, providing feedback that builds on and supports knowledge-in-action for a given activity without interrupting it remains a challenge. 5. Reflection-on-action is encouraged by systems where resources for reflection are offered after the activity has ended. A key challenge in this area is how to best represent data for a particular activity, i.e. what data to get chosen, the extent of concreteness (or ambiguity) in its representation, and how different sources of data are structured and related to one another.</p><p>We have highlighted how the articles that follow in this theme issue contribute to our current understanding of designing for social interaction and reflection to support behaviour change. These articles address the challenges described above, but clearly challenges like encouraging engagement, mutual support and meaning-making as well as protecting people's privacy require larger efforts. More work is also needed to understand the usefulness and effectiveness of the various approaches in different contexts of behaviour change, how to incorporate knowledge on behaviour change from other disciplines like public health and psychology, how to best utilize emerging personal and ubiquitous computing systems, and how to work with people to create new systems that support them in their behaviour change processes. It is our hope that by looking back and taking stock of more than ten years of research, we have also set out some broad trajectories for future work on designing technologies that assist and empower people in reaching their chosen goals.</p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><p>Pers Ubiquit Comput (2014) 18:1667-1676</p></note>
