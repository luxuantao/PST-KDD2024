<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Anomaly detection has been known to be a challenging problem due to the uncertainty of anomaly and the interference of noise. In this paper, we focus on anomaly detection in hyperspectral images (HSIs) and propose a novel detection algorithm based on spectral unmixing and dictionary-based lowrank decomposition. The innovation is threefold. First, due to the highly mixed nature of pixels in HSI data, instead of using the raw pixel directly for anomaly detection, the proposed algorithm applies spectral unmixing to obtain the abundance vectors and uses these vectors for anomaly detection. We show that the abundance vectors possess more distinctive features to identify anomaly from background. Second, to better represent the highly correlated background and the sparse anomaly, we construct a dictionary based on the mean shift clustering of the abundance vectors to improve both the discriminative and representative powers of the algorithm. Finally, a low-rank matrix decomposition method based on the constructed dictionary is proposed to encourage the coefficients of the dictionary, instead of the background itself, to be low rank, and the residual matrix to be sparse. Anomalies can then be extracted by summing up the columns of the residual matrix. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach constantly achieves high detection rate, while maintaining low false alarm rate regardless of the type of images tested.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>reconnaissance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and national security <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, among others. Since hyperspectral images (HSIs) can provide rich spectral characteristics of different materials, which potentially increase the probability of separating anomaly components from background <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, HSI-based anomaly detection has been intensively studied recently.</p><p>We can model anomaly detection as an unsupervised binary classification problem between the background class and the anomaly class. The challenge of this problem is that there is no prior knowledge of the anomalies or the background. The background could have complex textures that will increase the difficulty of detection. Also due to the limitations of HSI acquisition devices, the HSI data are usually corrupted by noise. Fortunately, there are two important characteristics that could be used to distinguish anomalies from their background, i.e., compared to other objects, the anomalies are: 1) sparse and 2) possess distinctive features as compared with their surrounding background.</p><p>Among all the anomaly detection algorithms, the global Reed-Xiaoli (RX) (GRX) detector proposed by Reed and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is one of the most popular statistical approaches. RX assumes that the probability density function of the background can be modeled as a Gaussian distribution, and the mean and covariance of which can be estimated by the entire data set, since anomaly components are sparse, thus would not affect the parameter estimation. With the estimated parameter, the anomalies can be identified by measuring the Mahalanobis distance of a pixel vector to its background. One potential issue of RX is that normally the background components contained in real HSI is nonuniform, which cannot be simply modeled using the Gaussian distribution. To overcome these limitations, several algorithms have been proposed based on the basic GRX, including the regularized RX <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, subspace RX (SSRX) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and local RX (LRX) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The regularized RX <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> regularizes the covariance matrix estimated by HSI pixels, which restricts the possible matched filters to a subset. In SSRX, the GRX is applied on a few numbers of principal component analysis (PCA) bands. However, similar to the GRX, both the regularized RX and SSRX detectors calculate the background statistics using the entire image cube, which may attenuate the difference between anomalies and their background. LRX performs the GRX locally, which is able to improve the detection rate. But the drawback is that it may struggle with isolated noisy pixels, which would increase the false alarm rate drastically. Also the size of the local window needs to be defined according to the size of anomaly, which is usually unknown.</p><p>In addition to the statistical approaches, another branch of anomaly detection is the representation-based method which assumes that HSI pixels can be represented by a dictionary <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A joint sparsity model was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> where the pixels within a small neighborhood can be simultaneously represented by a linear combination of pretrained dictionary of both target and background classes. Then, the sparse coefficient vectors are used to detect anomalies and the background. Similarly, Li and Du <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a collaborative representation detection (CRD) method, which states that if a pixel belongs to the background, it can be approximately represented by a linear combination of its spatial neighborhood. A distance-weighted regularization matrix is introduced in the optimization process to adjust the weight of each pixel.</p><p>Recently, low-rank-based methods have also drawn much attention. The basic idea is that, since the anomaly is sparse, the background matrix should have low-rank property after removing the anomalies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed a method based on robust PCA (RPCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and Tucker decomposition and unmixing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. RPCA was introduced as the first step to extract a dense low-rank tensor. However, RPCA is based on the assumption that data have a single subspace. Due to the existence of mixed pixels in the HSI data, HSI pixels are usually a linear combination of multiple endmembers. Therefore, RPCA may not be appropriate for this scenario. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a method based on unmixing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and RPCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which has been performing well in detecting anomalies, but often with high false alarm rate. This is because, RPCA performs effectively only for isolated pixels. And if the noise is isolated, it would have a similar property as anomaly, thus it is easy to be detected as anomaly. To reduce the influence of noise, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed a method based on Go Decomposition (GoDec) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This algorithm decomposes the HSI data into three structures, i.e., background, anomaly, and noise, instead of just background and anomaly. The noise in HSI is estimated first during the GoDec <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Then, the anomaly is detected by applying the GRX on the sparse matrix. Unfortunately, anomalies are prone to be identified as noise and thus the detection rate is reduced in practice. Low-rank representation (LRR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is another way to decompose the data. It uses the input data as the dictionary to separate the background and the anomaly. During the procedure, the l 21 constraint is applied on the anomaly matrix to solve the problem when data lie in multiple subspaces.</p><p>To overcome the drawbacks of the aforementioned approaches, we propose an anomaly detection algorithm based on spectral unmixing and low-rank decomposition. The uniqueness of the proposed approach can be summarized from two perspectives. First, since HSI images are normally highly mixed, for better anomaly detection performance, we project the HSI pixels into a single subspace, where anomalies should be distinct from the background. There are many options that can be adopted for this purpose, e.g., PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, sparse representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and so on. However, in order to preserve the physical meaning of the data, we choose to adopt unmixing algorithm, which is a part-based representation allowing only additive combinations. Compared to other representations, the nonnegativity constraint in the unmixing approaches aligns well with intuition: the whole is equal to the sum of parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Therefore, instead of using the raw pixels to detect anomalies, we apply the spectral unmixing algorithm to obtain the abundance vectors. On the one hand, unmixing serves the purpose of removing noise. But more importantly, the abundance vectors possess more distinctive patterns in discriminating anomalies from the background. Second, since the background is highly correlated, we construct a dictionary to better describe the background and sparse anomalies where the dictionary atoms are determined using results from the nonparametric mean shift clustering algorithm. In this way, instead of directly applying the existing low-rank decomposition approaches, a dictionary-based low-rank decomposition algorithm is proposed according to the properties of the background and anomaly. The proposed approach is able to extract the sparse anomalies where the low-rank constraint is applied on the background coefficients, instead of the background itself, such that the noisy pixels in the anomaly matrix can be removed to a large extent. We refer to the proposed anomaly detection algorithm as abundance-and dictionary-based lowrank decomposition (ADLR).</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the test data sets used. Section III elaborates on the proposed ADLR algorithm. Section IV performs comprehensive evaluations of the algorithm using both synthetic and real data sets. The conclusion is drawn in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. DATA SET</head><p>In this paper, we use three HSI data sets with different characteristics to explain the proposed algorithm as well as the conduct performance evaluation. These include one synthetic and two real data. Since we use one of the test images early on to better visualize the effect of the proposed ADLR algorithm, we describe all three data sets here before elaborating on the proposed algorithm.</p><p>The first test image is an HSI embedded with synthetic targets. The original image contains 79 bands of dimension 150×103. Forty-nine anomalous dots are implanted based on the linear mixing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The targets are distributed in seven rows and seven columns, and t is fractionally implanted with background spectrum b by varying f from 0.05 to 1 for different rows</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">z = f • t + (1 -f ) • b.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The test image used in this section is provided by Air Force <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, which contains nonuniform background and anomaly targets with different reflections. It contains 124 bands of dimension 267×342. The anomalies in the image are four aluminum panels with different colors (black, green, tan, and silver). Note that in this image, the anomaly is bigger than that of the first test image.  The third test image is provided by NASA <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, acquired from the two Mast Cameras (Mastcams) installed on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover. The two Mastcams can create multispectral images of 12 bands in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The dimension of the image is 598 × 670. The anomalies (or objects of interest) in this image are hydrated minerals.</p><p>The first two test images have ground truth, but the third one does not. The three test images are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, respectively. In Section III, we mainly use the second test image provided from Air Force to visualize the effect of different components in the proposed algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ABUNDANCE-AND DICTIONARY-BASED LOW-RANK DECOMPOSITION</head><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, there are three featured components in the proposed ADLR algorithm that contribute to the performance gain, namely: 1) using the abundance vectors derived from spectral unmixing instead of the raw data for anomaly detection; 2) using mean shift clustering on abundance vectors to construct a dictionary describing both the background and the anomaly; and 3) using a dictionary-based low-rank decomposition to extract the anomaly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Abundance Extraction Through Spectral Unmixing</head><p>In the HSI data, the measured spectrum at one pixel is usually a mixture of spectra of several constituent materials (known as endmembers). Most mixing processes can be well approximated using a linear mixing model shown as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X = AS + N (2)</formula><p>where X ∈ R l×n is the observation matrix with each column being the measured spectrum of one pixel, A ∈ R l×c is the endmember source matrix consisting of c endmembers, S ∈ R c×n is the abundance matrix, and N ∈ R l×n represents the noise. The unmixing process would, on the one hand, try to remove noise N; but more importantly, the abundance matrix extracted serves as a better input to anomaly detection. Each column of the abundance matrix, i.e., the abundance vector, shows how the materials are mixed to form the spectrum of a single pixel. Each row of the abundance matrix, i.e., the abundance map, corresponds to the mixing coefficients of each of the endmembers at the corresponding pixel location of the HSI. The abundance vectors lie in a single subspace, and in this space, the mixing coefficients for the anomalies present more distinctive patterns as compared to the coefficients of the background. We illustrate this effect in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, where 20 abundance maps (corresponding to the 20 endmembers) of one of the testing images [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (middle)] are displayed. The anomalies in this test image are the four aluminum panels made with different colors, as described in Section II. The abundance maps of these anomaly endmembers are highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we observe that the abundance maps corresponding to the anomaly endmembers show distinctive patterns that can be elaborated with three unique characteristics. First, the foreground pixels (i.e., from the anomaly endmembers) often cluster around a small region. Second, the clustered foreground pixels display high contrast to the background pixels. Third, the foreground pixels usually have a sparse presentation as compared to the noise pixels that usually distribute across the entire abundance map. We will show that recognizing these patterns in the space of abundance vectors is more effective than doing it on the raw HSI images.</p><p>Since there is no prior knowledge about the data, unsupervised unmixing is needed in the proposed algorithm. Among the many efficient unsupervised unmixing techniques, such as the ones reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, in this paper, we employ the classic method of minimum volumeconstrained nonnegative matrix factorization (MVC-NMF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> due to its effectiveness in handling highly mixed HSI data. Note that we also evaluated other more recent unmixing methods, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>; but on real data, the anomalies are more distinctive in the abundance map estimated by the MVC-NMF. Thus, it presents better anomaly detection results than the approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. See more discussions in Section IV-C. MVC-NMF belongs to the family of convex geometry-based unmixing, where the optimal solution is either defined as the one that circumscribes the data cloud and, at the same time, has the minimum volume, or defined as the one that inscribes the data cloud with the maximum volume. Combining the goal of minimum approximation error with the volume constraint, MVC-NMF is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">min f (A, S) = 1 2 X -AS +ρ J (A) s.t. A ≥ 0 S ≥ 0 1 T c S = 1 T N (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where 1 c (1 N ) is a c(N)-dimensional column vector of all 1s, and J (A) is the penalty function, calculating the simplex volume determined by the estimated endmembers. In the objective function, the first term serves as an external force to increase the volume of the simplex so that it is large enough to comprise all the data point, and the second term serves as the internal force to decrease the volume of the simplex so that we could obtain the simplex with the minimum volume. The parameter ρ is the tradeoff between both forces which balance the reconstruction accuracy and the volume constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Dictionary-Based Low-Rank Decomposition</head><p>In the abundance map acquired from the unmixing procedure, we already observed the different behaviors of anomalies, with a highly contrast, clustered, and sparse presence, as compared to the background, including noise. The most challenging issue in anomaly detection in HSI is the existence of noise in the anomaly map. To tackle this problem, we propose a dictionary-based low-rank approach to take advantage of the strong representative and discriminative power of the dictionary, and we also impose the low-rank constraint on the coefficient of the dictionary, but a sparse constraint on the residue matrix that only contains the anomaly. In the following, we elaborate on how the dictionary is constructed and how the dictionary-based low-rank decomposition problem is solved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Dictionary Construction Through Mean Shift Clustering:</head><p>There are many ways to construct a dictionary. The most common one is through dictionary learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. However, in the case of the studied problem, we do not have prior knowledge of either the anomaly or the background, and there is no training data provided, thus the method of dictionary learning is not applicable here. Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> proposed to construct the dictionary based on k-means clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> on the original HSI data. In that algorithm, Hartigan and Wong <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> defined the cluster number k to be larger than the true number of ground materials (i.e., the endmembers). Then, the RX detector is applied to determine the prepredictive value of each pixel, where a small prepredictive value indicates a background pixel. However, making the assumption of known k is often unrealistic, especially for some HSI data with complex background structures.</p><p>In the proposed ADLR, the so-called mean shift clustering method <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> is used on the abundance vectors to automatically derive a set of clusters. The mean shift algorithm was originally proposed for mode detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. It considers the set of input points as samples drawn from an empirical probability Unlike the k-means algorithm, mean shift does not assume prior knowledge of the number of clusters, due to the nonparametric nature of the algorithm. The number of modes automatically indicates the number of clusters. In addition, since mean shift clustering is based on the density estimation, it can work on arbitrarily shaped clusters, e.g., the data do not need to follow a fixed distribution, such as Gaussian. The key parameter in the mean shift algorithm is the so-called window size or bandwidth that specifies the radius or size of the window/kernel function, where the mean value is calculated within each window. The window size determines, indirectly, the distance between clusters. Hence, instead of having to predefine the number of clusters as in the k-means algorithm, the mean shift algorithm automatically yields the clustering results based on the specified bandwidth <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>Taking the columns of the abundance matrix S ∈ R c×n as samples, we apply the mean shift clustering to derive a set of clusters, say k. Normally, we would use the centroid of each cluster as the representative to form one dictionary atom. However, the centroid alone does not reflect the size or shape of the cluster, which serves as an important information to distinguish between background (including noise) and the anomaly. Intuitively, anomaly clusters are dense with the radii of the clusters being much smaller than those of the background. To incorporate this intuition into the construction of dictionary, we choose to include both the centroid and the edge member (i.e., the sample with the longest distance to the centroid) of the cluster as the dictionary atoms in D. This is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The inclusion of the edge member might not reflect all the unique characteristics of anomaly clusters (e.g., the shape), however, it well conveys the size of the cluster. See Section IV-D for more evaluation results.</p><p>2) Low-Rank Decomposition: Upon having a better representation scheme of the anomaly through abundance extraction and dictionary construction, we are now ready to apply the low-rank decomposition technique to separate anomalies from the background. There are many ways to address this problem, including, for example, RPCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, GoDec <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and LRR <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> shows the different formulations of these three models. The model of RPCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is to decompose a matrix into a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix via the singular value decomposition (SVD) operation. But the drawback of this model is that isolated pixels are easily identified as anomalies E. Compared to RPCA, the GoDec algorithm also considers the additive noise of the HSI data. But in real HSI data, anomaly E and noise N many times are mixed with each other. Even with the unmixing algorithm, the noise can only be removed to some extent. LRR <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is an abbreviation of LRR, which is able to extract sparse outliers in the data with low rank and l 21 regularizer. It uses the observed data as the dictionary and works well on data lying in multiple subspaces.</p><p>Our model is inspired by LRR <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, where the abundance matrix S can be further decomposed into two parts</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S = DZ + E<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D = {d 1 , d 2 , . . . d 2k } ∈ R c×2k</formula><p>is the dictionary and Z = {z 1 , z 2 , . . . z n } ∈ R 2k×n is the coefficient for S with respect to D. DZ together represents the background. And E is the anomaly component.</p><p>To solve the problem in (4), we need to introduce some prior knowledge for regularization purpose. Based on the aforementioned analysis, anomalies only occupy a small fraction of HSI, which means E should be sparse. Since in HSI data, background is highly correlated and can be represented by a dictionary, the coefficient Z should have low-rank.</p><p>Although LRR <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> can be used to address the problem in (4), it is based on the assumption that the data are drawn from multiple subspaces, so it uses the l 21 norm to force most of the columns of Z to be zero. In the proposed method, S is the abundance vector obtained from the unmixing step which lies in a single subspace. In addition, anomalies in the same image can present different characteristics. Thus, it is reasonable that the columns of matrix E have a few nonzero values. Based on the above-mentioned analysis, we use the l 1 norm to encourage matrix E to be sparse. Compared with the l 21 norm, the l 1 norm allows nonzero values to exist in columns.</p><p>It has been proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> that minimizing the nuclear norm of a matrix is a good surrogate for minimizing the rank of a matrix, as long as the matrix E is sufficiently sparse. Therefore, the proposed objective function can be written as min</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Z,E Z * +λ E 1 s.t.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Experimental Design and Performance Metrics</head><p>We evaluate the proposed ADLR from two perspectives. First, we compare ADLR with six representative anomaly detection methods, including GRX <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, LRX <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and SSRX <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which are statistical based; CRD <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which is representation based; and the low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition-based Mahalanobis distance method (LSMAD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and the low-rank tensor-based method proposed by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which are low rank based. Note that, since we do not have the codes of LSMAD, we implement it with GoDec <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and GRX based on the description in LSMAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, we also perform the comprehensive evaluation of the contribution of different components of ADLR. First, we compare ADLR with RPCA that applies low-rank decomposition on the raw image data directly. This comparison would show the benefit of anomaly detection based on the abundance rather than the raw data. Second, we compare ADLR with Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which does apply low-rank decomposition on the abundance, but does not use dictionary to better represent the background. This comparison would show the benefit of dictionary construction and the application of the low-rank constraint on the background coefficient rather than the background directly. Third, we apply LRR with l 21 constraint on the abundance vectors, whose dictionary is defined by the proposed ADLR. With this experiment, we show that because we have projected the data onto a single subspace through spectral unmixing, the proposed l 1 constraint works better than the l 21 constraint in the LRR.</p><p>Besides qualitative comparison through visual examination of the detection results, for quantitative comparison, detection results are converted to binary images according to different thresholds. Based on these binary images, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with confidence intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> (only for the test images with ground truth provided) are generated by calculating the detection rate versus the false alarm rate. Then, the area under the curve (AUC) is calculated according to the ROC curve of each graph.</p><p>We also specifically compare the detection rate and the false alarm rate given a very small threshold (e.g., 0.01). At this small threshold, all approaches are expected to present high detection rate as all the pixels with values higher than 0.01 will be identified as anomalies. On the other hand, the usage of a low threshold would also potentially increase the false alarm rates since many background pixels will be misclassified as anomalies due to the low contrast between the background and anomaly pixels. Therefore, this comparison, in a sense, evaluates the robustness of the anomaly detection approach.</p><p>Furthermore, the effects of different unmixing algorithms are discussed in Section IV-C, the effects of including the edge members of each cluster in the dictionary construction process are discussed in Section IV-D, and the parameters and efficiency analysis are given in Sections IV-E and IV-F, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Anomaly Detection Performance</head><p>1) Synthetic Targets on Real Data: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows the comparison of different algorithms on the synthetic data set, which is the first test image. Note that for low-contrast images, we show them using logarithmic scale for better visualization. We observe that the first row of the simulated targets is always difficult to detect, since the target is fractionally implanted by only 5%. The results from GRX and LSMAD have low contrast between anomalies and background. By visual comparison, the LRX algorithm keeps better contrast between anomalies and background than the GRX method. This is because LRX applies GRX in a local area, so it performs well on uniformly distributed targets. SSRX effectively removes some noise in the background, but not all anomalies are detected. Li's method can identify all the targets, but the noise in the background is also mistakenly selected as anomalies, leading to a high false alarm rate. CRD works effectively on the synthetic data set which detects most of the anomalies with less noise compared to Li's method. Because CRD assumes that background pixels can be represented by the surrounding background, which is suitable for small anomaly with a uniform background.</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of different components in the proposed ADLR, we perform various combinations of the possible components in the proposed algorithm and show the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(h)-(k)</ref>. Without spectral unmixing, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(h)</ref> shows the result of applying the RPCA method directly on image pixels of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(a)</ref>. Most of the anomalous points can be detected by the RPCA method. However, the background is also selected as anomalies. With spectral unmixing and RPCA low-rank decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(i)</ref>. This method can detect the anomalies with little background. But some noisy and isolated pixels are sparse and are confused as anomalies. For example, in the middle of this image, a large area of background is also selected as anomalies. If we apply LRR with l 21 constraint on the abundance matrix generated from spectral unmxing, the result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(j)</ref>. Some noise is removed, but not all the anomalies are detected because of the fact that l 21 constraint forces the columns of the anomaly matrix to be zeros. However, in the abundance matrix, not all the elements in the column that represents the anomaly are zeros. Thus, not all the anomalies are extracted during the optimization procedure. As demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>(k), most of the noise pixels have been removed by the proposed ADLR with spectral unmixing, dictionary construction and low-rank decomposition with l 1 norm, as compared to the result of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>(i). The reason is that we only force the coefficients of the background to be low rank. Since the isolated pixels can be grouped with similar coefficients with respect to the dictionary, they lose the property of sparsity in the image. Therefore, most of the isolated noisy background have been removed from the sparse matrix E. This illustrates that both the dictionary and the l 1 regularizer play an important role in noise removal in the proposed algorithm.</p><p>For quantitative comparison, the results of each algorithm are converted to different binary images using thresholds ranging from 0 to 1. The false alarm rate and detection rate are calculated based on the given ground truth target and each binary image. Then, the ROC curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> is generated by  plotting the detection rate against the false alarm rate. Note that for ROC curve, the best possible method should yield a point in the upper left corner (0, 1), which indicates that the method can achieve 100% detection accuracy with false alarm rate of 0. In addition, when the threshold is set to 0, all the pixels in the image are considered as anomalies, thus the false alarm rate and the detection rate are always one for any algorithm. Therefore, for comparison, the point (1, 1) is not shown in the ROC curve. However, most algorithms still reach the points that are close to (1, 1), because they confuse the background as anomalies give small thresholds. As illustrated in the ROC curve given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, Wang's method yields low false alarm rate, but it is not able to detect all the targets. Li's method is capable of detecting all the targets, but it also yields high false alarm rate. Compared with the other algorithms, the proposed ADLR identifies all the targets while maintaining a low false alarm rate. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the detection rate with the false alarm rate of each of the evaluated approaches given a small threshold 0.01. We can observe that, most approaches are able to detect all the targets since all the pixels with values higher than 0.01 are identified as anomalies. On the other hand, a very low threshold could also potentially increase the false alarm rate  as many background pixels can be misclassified as anomaly. However, the proposed ADLR is able to achieve high detection rate and low false alarm rate with such a small threshold. This experiment shows that although the proposed method cannot achieve the best performance (0, 1) in the top-left corner, the benefit of ADLR is that there is no need to adjust the threshold to achieve high detection rate and low false alarm rate, because the detected anomalies have high contrast against the background. The AUC is also estimated and given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> based on the ROC. The AUC derived from the proposed ADLR has the highest value among all the algorithms. Note that the higher the AUC value, the better the detection algorithm is.</p><p>2) Real Data With Nonuniform Background: For the second test data, there are four targets/anomalies made with different colors, and the reflection of the targets is similar to that of the background in several bands. Also, the background of the data is nonuniform which increases the difficulty of detection. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows the detection results of different algorithms. GRX, LRX, SSRX, and LSMAD fail to detect all the anomalies. This is because, RX-based approaches assume that the probability density function of the background can be modeled ROC curves of anomaly detection performance using different algorithms on images from Air Force. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">10</ref>.</p><p>Detection rates and false alarm rates obtained from different algorithms given threshold 0.01 on the second test data. as the Gaussian distribution, which is not applicable when the background is complex and has different textures. CRD fail in this case as well, because the size of the anomaly is big and the background is nonuniform. Both Li's method and Wang's method can successfully detect all the four targets, but they also identify some textures from background as anomalies.</p><p>We further evaluate the performance of various combinations of the possible components in the proposed algorithm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8(h)</ref> shows the result by applying RPCA low-rank decomposition directly on the images. It illustrates that without spectral unmixing, the anomalies and their background have low contrast. As shown later in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, the detection rate is very low. With spectral unmixing and RPCA low-rank decomposition, four targets are detected successfully, but the third one has low contrast, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8(i)</ref>. The anomalies identified by LRR given the dictionary defined by the proposed ADLR misses one anomaly because of the l 21 constraint, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8(j)</ref>. Compared with other methods, the proposed ADLR including spectral unmixing, dictionary construction, and low-rank decomposition detects all the targets with lowest noise level as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8(k)</ref>.</p><p>Both the ROC curve given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> and the bar chart in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">10</ref> demonstrate that the proposed approach has a higher detection rate over the other methods. Meanwhile, it keeps the false alarm rate below 0.01 when a small threshold 0.01 is used. The AUC of different algorithms is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, which also indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves the best result among all the algorithms.</p><p>We also generate the 95% confidence intervals according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, assuming that each point of the ROC curve follows a binomial distribution. The confidence intervals of the detection rate (vertical dashed lines) and the confidence intervals of the false alarm rate (horizontal dashed lines) are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. Note that due to the space limit, only the ROC curves of Li's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and ADLR are compared which perform the best on the first and second test images. We can observe that, for both images, the proposed ADLR clearly outperforms the approach of Li, especially for the second test image.</p><p>3) Real Data Without Ground Truth: The results of the last HSI data are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref>. The proposed algorithm successfully detects the hydrated "anomaly" which mostly appears in the drilled hole and cracks of the soil surface. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref>, the detected target from the proposed  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. (c) LRX <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. (d) SSRX <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. (e) Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. (f) CRD <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.

(j) LRR <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. (k) ADLR.</p><p>ADLR has less background portion as compared to that of Li's method or Wang's method. When we apply the LRR on the abundance vector, with the dictionary defined using ADLR, the detection result has less background portion than that of Wang's method. But the anomaly is not as clear as that of the proposed ADLR. All these four approaches are superior to that of the GRX, LRX, SSRX, CRD, and LSMAD methods. Note that since we do not have ground truth anomaly for this test image, the ROC curve and AUC are not provided in this experiment.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that although LRX can identify anomaly with high contrast on synthetic data, it fails on real data because of its deficiency in handling background that is highly nonuniform and anomalies of arbitrary size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Effects of Different Unmixing Algorithms</head><p>We have addressed the importance of introducing spectral unmixing in anomaly detection and have chosen MVC-NMF to conduct the unmixing procedure. In this experiment, we evaluate the effect of choosing different unmixing algorithms on the detection performance. We compare ADRL using MVC-NMF as well as two other state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> on the first two test images.   We observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref> that all the unmixing approaches achieve relatively clear results with little background. The ROC curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> and AUC in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref> both demonstrate that all the approaches are able to yield high detection rate with low false alarm rate. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>, we further observe that the false alarm rates are below 0.5 given a small threshold 0.01, which is much lower as compared with the traditional   algorithms without the unmixing step, e.g., LRX, SSRX, Li's, CRD, LSMAD, and RPCA.</p><p>Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>-18 demonstrate the corresponding results on the second test image. We again observe that the false alarm rate achieved by these unmixing-based detectors is lower than the traditional algorithms that operate on the raw data directly, e.g., RX, Li's, CRD, and RPCA.</p><p>From experiments conducted on both test images, we see that MVC-NMF constantly presents higher detection rate, lower false alarm rate, and higher AUC values. This is due to the fact that both multilayer NMF (MLNMF) and R-CoNMF use sparsity as one of the constraints. While in a synthetic data set, this might be common; for real hyperspectral data, especially for highly mixed data, the abundance vector is, in general, not sparse. This is the main reason that MVC-NMF-based detectors can outperform the other two unmixing approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Effects of the Dictionary</head><p>In the following, we provide a toy example and an example with real data to further discuss the effects of including both the center and edge members of the clusters in the dictionary construction process. In the first example, due to the noise and different proportions of the anomalies, the anomalies of the same type are clustered into different clusters. In the second example, different anomalies are clustered into their own clusters. In both cases, with both the centers and edges of clusters as dictionary atoms, the proposed method can detect all the anomalies and only a few background pixels are misidentified as anomalies.</p><p>For the toy example, we use the linear mixing of five endmembers, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19</ref>(a), to generate the synthetic background. And the background is disrupted by adding high level of Gaussian white noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB. Nine anomalous dots are implanted based on the linear mixing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, where f equals to 0.2 (bottom row), 0.5, and 1 (top row). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19</ref>(b) illustrates one band of the synthetic data. The ground truth anomalies are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19(c)</ref>.</p><p>We first unmix the raw data with the number of endmembers being c = 7 and estimate the abundance of the data. Then, the dictionary is built with the clustering results of the abundance and the anomalies are detected based on the dictionaries. If only the centers of the clusters are selected as the dictionary atoms, the detection result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19(d)</ref>. With both the clustering centers and edges as dictionary atoms, the detection result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19(e)</ref>. We can observe that, we could detect all the anomalies with less background pixels when the edges of the clusters are included in the dictionary.</p><p>To better observe the behavior of the clustering step, we use the SVD method to project the clustered abundance onto a 3-D space, and the clustering result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19(f</ref>). Note that, to better illustrate the results, we need the number of clusters to be small, thus a relatively larger bandwidth is used in the mean shift clustering method. Seven clusters denoted with different colors are generated given a bandwidth of 0.55. The filled triangle with different colors represents the centers and edges of the clusters, and the anomalies are marked with red rectangles. Since the proportions f of the anomalies are different and the noise level of the image is high, the anomalies are classified into different clusters. But most anomalies are located at the edge of clusters. In the proposed dictionarybased low-rank decomposition method, the coefficients of the dictionary are encouraged to be of low rank when the sparse anomalies are separated from the background. If only the centers of clusters are used as dictionaries, the pixels that are far away from the clustering centers tend to be separated as anomalies in order to encourage the coefficients of the dictionary to be of low rank. Therefore, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19(d)</ref>, the detected anomalies also include the background pixels. With both the center and edge of each cluster being included in the dictionaries, only the pixels that are near the edge of the clusters tend to be detected as anomalies. Thus, we can detect all the anomalies with less background pixels as shown in 19(e).</p><p>To further demonstrate the effects of the dictionary, we provide an example using real data (i.e., the second test image). The mean shift clustering method is applied on the abundance map of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8(a)</ref>. With the bandwidth selected as 0.2, 41 clusters are generated. The four clusters corresponding to the four anomalies in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> belong to different clusters as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">20(a)</ref>, where different colors represent the different anomaly clusters. The other clusters belong to the background or noisy pixels. It is clear that the isolated pixels in the upper-left corner of the abundance image are grouped into the same cluster. For visualization purpose, we again project the clustered data onto a 3-D space using the SVD method and the result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">20(b</ref>). We observe that, since the anomaly clusters are small, they have been correctly detected as anomalies. In general, the radii of the background and noise clusters are much larger than those of the anomaly clusters. Thus, when the dictionary atoms consist of only the center of each cluster, some background proportions are detected as anomalies as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">20(c</ref>). However, when the dictionary atoms consist of both the center and edge of each cluster, most of the background proportions are separated from the anomalies as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">20(d)</ref>. We can observe the same behavior in the ROC and detection rate graphs shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">20</ref>(e) and (f).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Parameter Analysis</head><p>The proposed ADLR has three free parameters, i.e., c is the number of endmembers in the unmixing procedure [note that ρ in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) is fixed to a default value in this step], bw is  the bandwidth in the clustering step, and λ is the tradeoff parameter in low-rank decomposition. In addition, in LRX, we set the window size according to the size of the anomalies as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>. For CRD, we use the default parameters offered by the authors. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">V</ref> shows all the parameters used in the experiments.</p><p>In all the experiments, we first estimated the parameter c with the HySime algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. For better unmixing, we set c to be higher than the number of endmembers estimated by HySim <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Although increasing the number of endmembers may introduce noise to the data, the noise will be removed in the subsequent dictionary construction and low-rank decomposition steps.</p><p>To evaluate how the number of the endmembers affect the results, we fix bw = 0.2, λ = 0.1, and adjust the parameter c. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">21</ref> shows the AUC of the first two test images, according to different numbers of endmembers. Based on the experiments, increasing the numbers of endmembers does not always decrease the AUC value. When the anomalies are separated from the background well, we can achieve high AUC values. For example, for the first synthetic test image, the AUC reaches the highest value when c = 25, where the abundance vectors of the anomalies are distinctive from those of the background. But for the second test image, the anomalies are separated well when c = 20, therefore, the AUC at c = 20 is the highest among all the experiments. For both data, the AUC stays above 0.88 even with different numbers of endmembers. Therefore, the unmixing step effectively increases the anomaly detection rate. But to achieve the best result, it is important to distinguish anomalies in the abundance space. In general, we set c to be around 1.5-2 times of c given by HySime.</p><p>We then fix the number of endmembers and adjusted the parameters bw and λ. Based on the experimental study, the parameter bw is evaluated in the range of [0.05, 1], and the parameter λ in the range of [0.01, 0.1]. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">22</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">23</ref> show the change of AUC when we adjusted the free parameters bw and λ for the first two test images, respectively. When bw is small, we obtain more clusters in the dictionary construction step. Then, there will be more dictionary atoms for the lowrank decomposition that makes AUC more sensitive to the parameter λ. When bw ∈ {0.8, 0.9, 1}, there exists only one   cluster of the abundance. So, the dictionary atoms are defined by the center and the edge of this cluster. From the AUC curve, we observe that even with a single cluster, we can still yield an AUC of above 0.98 for both data sets no matter how we adjust the parameter λ. But consider the false alarm rate, we should choose a relative small bandwidth bw with a lower λ. Note that the number of clusters varies according to the given data even with the same bandwidth. Therefore, we usually choose the bandwidth that generates less than 100 clusters; in this way, the anomaly detection procedure would be faster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Efficiency Analysis</head><p>In this section, the average processing time of all the approaches is evaluated. The specification of the test computer is Intel Core i7 CPU at 3.1 GHz with RAM 8 GB. All the codes are implemented with MATLAB. Note that the processing time of ADLR also depends on the size of the built dictionary. Here, we show the average processing time on the first test image in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">VI</ref>. Although the proposed ADLR could not perform as efficiently as that of GRX, SSRX, and RPCA, it achieves much better detection results as shown in Section IV-B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a novel anomaly detection algorithm based on performing low-rank decomposition on the abundance vectors from spectral unmixing and background coefficients from dictionary construction. In order to better separate the anomaly from background (especially isolated noisy pixels), we first performed spectral unmixing where the abundance matrix is estimated for further study instead of the raw data. To further remove noise and better represent the background as well as the anomaly, we constructed a dictionary based on the results from the mean shift clustering algorithm. Therefore, the scattered noisy pixels can be clustered into the same group so as to lose the sparse property. Finally, we proposed a low-rank decomposition method to detect the anomaly. Instead of directly encouraging the background to be low rank, we applied the low-rank constraint on the coefficient of the background which is highly mixed.

He joined Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA, as a NASA Post-Doctoral Fellow and a Staff Scientist in 2010. He studies the interiors of icy bodies such as Jupiter's moon, Europa, drawing primarily on expertise in the chemistry of fluids at high pressures. He was involved in ocean composition, dynamics, and habitability through simulations of icy world ocean chemistry in the laboratory, coupled with the theoretical models of fluid circulation in deep oceans. He and the Icy Worlds Team hope to determine chemical signatures of habitability that may make their way to their host body's surface. He was involved in fielddeployable instruments for detecting signs of life, or biomarkers, which may reveal clues to life's origin on the earth and elsewhere, and provides insight about possible analogs on Mars. He is currently an Early Career Scientist and lead for the Habitability Team, Icy Worlds Astrobiology Group, JPL, Astrobiology Institute, NASA, Mountain View, CA, USA. </p></div>
