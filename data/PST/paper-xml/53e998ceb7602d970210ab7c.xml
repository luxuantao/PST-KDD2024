An expression for the influence function of the minimal-weight function is given which characterizes the asymptotic sensitivity of the graph weight to perturbations in the underlying distribution. The influence function takes a form which indicates that the k-point minimal graph in d &gt; 1 dimensions has robustness properties in IR d which are analogous to those of rank-order statistics in one dimension. A direct result of our theory is that the log-weight of the k- point minimal graph is a consistent nonparametric estimate of the Rényi entropy of the distribution P . Possible applications of this work include: analysis of random communication network topologies, estimation of the mixing coefficient in -contaminated mixture models, outlier discrimination and rejection, clustering, and pattern recognition, robust nonparametric regression, twosample matching, and image registration.</p></div>

The elements of the subset are distinct and there are possible -point subsets of . The minimal -point Euclidean graph problem is to find the subset of points and the set of edges connecting these points such that the resultant graph has minimum total weight . This problem arises in competitive bidding for network routing contracts when some nodes may be left out of the connected network, the prize-collecting traveling salesman and Steiner tree problems for visiting at least out of cities, the minimum latency problem, and other combinatorial optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>For example, the Euclidean minimal -point spanning tree ( -MST) is the minimum-weight tree spanning any of the points. The planar -MST problem was shown to be NP-complete by Zelikovsky and Lozevanu <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> and Ravi, Sundaram, Marathe, Rosenkrantz, and Ravi <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Ravi et al. proposed a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the planar -MST with approximation ratio which has been successively improved to by Garg and Hochbaum <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>,</p><p>by Eppstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, by Blum, Chalasani, and Vempala <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>,</p><p>by Mitchell <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, by Garg <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and by Arora <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. While it is difficult to establish general and useful properties of optimal graphs for a fixed set of points , interesting properties of many classes of optimal graphs can be obtained by assuming that the points are random samples from a distribution . In particular, the asymptotic behavior of the TSP, MST, and Steiner trees as tends to is now well understood in this stochastic setting. The recent books by Steele <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and Yukich <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> provide excellent introductions to this subject. The main result of this paper is the derivation of almost sure (a.s.) limits for a class of greedy approximations to Euclidean minimal -point graphs over a random set of points. This class of greedy approximations is the set of minimal -point graphs constructed by the generalized method of Ravi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and where the edge weight function satisfies the quasi-additive property of Redmond and Yukich <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>It directly follows from the asymptotic analysis that the log of the minimum graph weight is a strongly consistent and robust estimator of the order-Rényi entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> of the multivariate distribution , where is a function of the sample space dimension and the edge weight power exponent. Alternatively, although we do not develop this extension here due to space limitations, by performing an appropriate measure transformation on the data space one obtains a robust nonparametric estimate of the Rényi divergence (a.k.a. relative entropy or Chernoff distance) between and a prespecified reference measure . It is remarkable that the weight function of the minimal -point graph provides a direct estimate of entropy which completely bypasses the difficult intermediate step of multivariate density estimation required by previous estimators.</p><p>The problem of entropy estimation has long been of interest to the engineering, physics, and statistics communities, e.g., see the recent paper by Beirlant et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for a thorough overview of the topic of Shannon entropy estimation. The general entropy estimation problem is relevant to pattern analysis, process complexity assessment, model identification, tests of distributions, and other applications where invariance to scale, translation, and other invertible transformations is desired in the discriminant <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The Rényi entropy estimation problem arises in adaptive vector quantizer design, where the entropy is more commonly called the Panter-Dite factor and is related to the asymptotically optimal quantization cell density <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Estimates of Rényi entropy have also been proposed for characterizing complexity of time-frequency distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Other relevant entropy estimation applications are: estimation of Lyapounov exponents in nonlinear dynamical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>; multimodality image registration using mutual information-matching criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>; stopping criteria for regression and classification trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>; and testing for normality of a random data sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned entropy estimation applications, the greedy algorithm, and associated theory, presented here can be applied to robustification of existing minimal graph approaches to pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>; clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>; nonparametric regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; testing for randomness of a data sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>; and testing particle distributions in electron photomicrographs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Finally, in addition to the combinatorial optimization problems mentioned in the first paragraph, our results may be useful for asymptotic analysis of -point minimal graph techniques proposed for optimizing communications subnetwork topologies and network provisioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>; minimum-area routing in VLSI circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; minimum-cost pipeline interconnections for subnetworks of oil wells <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>; and minimum-cost interconnections for cable TV subnetworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The following are principal theoretical results presented here.</p><p>1) A polynomial time greedy algorithm for constructing an approximation to the minimal -point graph and its edge weight function is presented which is a direct generalization of the algorithm of Ravi, Sundaram, Marathe, Rosenkrantz, and Ravi <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> developed therein for minimal -point minimum spanning tree approximation on the plane. 2) A tight a.s. asymptotic bound on the entropy estimation error is given which can be used to determine the required partition resolution to obtain a prescribed estimator error when a bound on the total variation (roughness) of the density function is known. 3) Zero asymptotic error is achieved when the density function is piecewise-constant over the resolution partition cells of the greedy algorithm. 4) We give a condition, called a tightly coverable graph property, which holds when of the vertices of the -point graph can be covered by a resolution partition set (a.s.) as . This condition is satisfied for the greedy approximation by construction. If the exact minimal -point graph satisfies this condition then the weight of the minimal -point graph converges to the same asymptotic limit as the greedy approximation, i.e., the greedy approximation is asymptotically optimal. 5) A robust Rényi entropy estimator is proposed based on the log of the weight of the minimal -point graph with edge weight exponent . This estimator is shown to converge a.s. to a conditional Rényi entropy of order , where is the sample space dimension. Inspired by the convergence rates established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, for we predict that the rate of convergence of the nonparametric Rényi entropy estimator is . 6) Influence function studies are presented which quantitatively establish that the greedy minimal -point graph construction generates a robust estimator of distribution entropy. 7) The asymptotic results presented hold for a very general class of graphs constructed by minimizing a total edge weight function which is a quasi-additive functional. This class includes the optimal Euclidean traveling salesman tour, the minimal spanning tree, the Steiner tree, and the two-population minimal matching graph. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section II-A we review Euclidean minimal spanning graphs. In Section II-B we review the theory of quasi-additive functionals which were used by Redmond and Yukich to prove a general asymptotic theorem on the edge weight function of minimal spanning graphs. A minimal -point graph is defined in Section III and in Section III-A we give a lemma which specifies a partition approximation under when the graph satisfies a tightly coverable assumption. Then in Section IV we treat the asymptotic theory of greedy approximations with a series of lemmas and convergence results. This is followed in Section VII by a study of quantitative robustness of the greedy approximation via the Huber-Hampel influence function.</p></div>

If there exists a sequence of distinct edges which provide a path from any vertex back to itself the graph is said to contain a cycle. A graph which contains no cycles is an acyclic graph called a tree. By the span of a graph we mean the set of vertices which are connected by edges. The degree of a graph is the maximum number of edges which can be incident on any single vertex. The complete graph over is a graph for which each pair of vertices are connected by an edge; such a graph has edges, is connected, has cycles, and is of degree .</p><p>Different graphs can be compared based on their weights which are defined as follows.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. LIMIT THEOREM FOR -POINT GREEDY APPROXIMATION</head><p>Since the computation of the exact minimal -point graph has complexity which is exponential in the number of points , the asymptotics of polynomial-time approximations are also of interest. Here we obtain asymptotic results for a greedy algorithm originally introduced by Ravi, Sundaram, Marathe, Rosenkrantz, and Ravi <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> for constructing approximations to the -MST on the plane. Their algorithm produces graphs which by construction satisfy the tightly coverable property introduced in the last section. Here we define a generalized version of their algorithm which constructs graphs in dimensions, , using arbitrary quasi-additive edge weight functions.</p><p>The algorithm is implemented in three steps: 1) the user specifies a uniform partition of having cells of resolution ; 2) the algorithm finds the smallest subset of partition elements containing at least points; 3) out of this smallest subset the algorithm selects the points which minimize . Stage 3 requires finding apoint minimal graph on a much reduced set of points, that is, typically only slightly larger than if is suitably chosen, which can be performed in polynomial time.</p><p>The smallest subset mentioned in Stage 2 of the algorithm is not unique. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> show an example with , for which there are two possible smallest subsets, in this case both contain 18 points.</p><p>Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, we specify a small subset by the following greedy algorithm: i) find a re-indexing of the cells in ranked in decreasing order of the number of points contained, (if there are equalities arrange these in lexicographical order) and ii) select the subset specified in step 2 by the recursion. Before developing the main result of this section we define some additional notation.</p><p>We will be interested in two special subsets generated by . The interior defined as the intersection of all sets in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and the associated residual set <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> is the "core" of the set and is the "crust" of the set.</p><p>The total variation over a rectangle of a function on is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> (</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">)<label>8</label></formula><p>where the is taken over all countable subsets of points in . The function is said to have bounded variation over if . By convention, for the empty set. To simplify the presentation we assume throughout that the distribution of each of the i.i.d. points in is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure and has a density . The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> assert that the addition of singular components, e.g., delta functions, to the density does not change the asymptotics of . Here it does change the asymptotics since the points of support of singular components entail zero edge weights and are, therefore, more attractive to include in the minimum -point graph. However, the effect of singular components will only be to change the value of a threshold on (see remark below). The main result of this section is the following asymptotic theorem.</p><p>Theorem 2: Let be an i.i.d. sample from a distribution having Lebesgue density . Fix , . Let be of bounded variation over and denote by its total variation over a subset . Let be a quasi-additive functional with power exponent as in Theorem 1. Then, the total edge weight of a -point graph constructed by the resolution-greedy algorithm satisfies a.s.</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)<label>9</label></formula><p>where is any minimal resolution-set of probability at least <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and is the coverage probability of sets in . Furthermore, the bound (9) holds pointwise when is replaced by . We prove Theorem 2 in Section V. It is of interest here to relate the integral in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> to the Rényi entropy of the density . The key to this relation is the following lemma which relates the integral over a set in in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">9</ref>) to a constrained minimum over . We can now show how Theorem 2 can be related to estimation of Rényi entropy. Using Lemma 2 and the fact that converges to the class of Borel subsets of , it is an easy exercise to show that <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> Now for any Borel set in having define the conditional density where is the indicator function of . For a continuous density , the (differential) Rényi entropy of order is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> This is also called the conditional Rényi entropy given . The Rényi entropy shares a number of properties with the Shannon entropy such as: it is concave as a function of the density (for ), it is maximized (over all densities with bounded support) for a uniform density.</p><p>As minimization of over is equivalent to minimization of the integral in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Let be the probability-at-least-Borel subset of which minimizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> For define the following function of : <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> An immediate consequence of Theorem 2 is the following.</p><p>Theorem 3: Under the assumptions of Theorem 2 is a strongly consistent estimator of the minimum conditional Rényi entropy of order as .</p><p>Before developing the proof of Theorem 2 in the next section, we make the following remarks.</p><p>1) The bound in Theorem 2 is tight since it reduces to zero for the case , yielding the classical a.s. BHH limit theorem, Theorem 1, for minimal graphs spanning all points . Indeed, in this case, for arbitrary the class of resolution-probability-atleast-sets contains the support set of and therefore satisfies , , the empty set, and as required.</p><p>2) Theorems 2 and 3 are easily extended to the case where the density of contains singular components, e.g., delta functions. Specifically, let have the mixed density where is Lebesgue measure, is the absolutely continuous component, and is the singular component of relative to Lebesgue measure. Let the support of the singular measure be and let . Then, we know from Lemma 6 that and hence points falling in the singular part of contribute negligible weight. Thus by the strong law of large numbers, of the points can be included in the graph at negligible cost leaving only points in whose edge weights are asymptotically significant. Therefore, in the case of a singular component with , Theorem 2 holds with the class replaced by the class of resolution subsets with coverage probability at least . If then is replaced by the empty set and converges to zero a.s. as . Likewise, it can be shown that when there is a singular component Lemma 2 holds with the minimization over the class replaced by a minimization over the smaller class 3) As can be seen from Lemma 7, Theorem 2 holds for any method of selection of points from the minimal subset of covering at least points. It does not depend on the precise way that a few points are eliminated from the set to form . This implies that for large all methods of elimination are equivalent, including simply randomly rejecting points from until exactly points remain. 4) In smooth estimation problems the normalization factor required to ensure convergence of a parameter estima-tor to a finite nonzero constant is typically . In contrast, Theorem 2 says that the stabilization factor for is the larger quantity , i.e., is less explosive as a function of . On the other hand, inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 2.5]</ref> which gives the tight convergence rate for the MST under the uniform distribution, we conjecture that the rate of convergence in the of Theorem 2 is at best and this rate can be attained only when . This leads us to believe that the entropy estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> will have fastest convergence when the Rényi order parameter is in the range . 5) The bound of Theorem 2 decays to zero as a function of resolution at overall rate . The first term decays as and is due to nonuniqueness of the resolution-subsets all of which have identical coverage probability but over which may have different amounts of variation. When is, in the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, a "blocked distribution" over the resolution-cells this term is equal to zero. The second additive term is due to the overshoot of coverage probability by the subsets . This term is zero when it so happens that the chosen in the greedy algorithm is exactly attainable by a resolution subset. However, this term decays to zero only as and dominates the resolution convergence rate. Note that this implies that the rate of convergence in of the bound in Theorem 2 is fastest for small . 6) Since and we can weaken the a.s. bound in Theorem 2 by using the result <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, which was shown in the proof of Theorem 2. This results in the following: <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> This a.s. bound holds uniformly over the class of all density functions such that has total variation less than or equal to . Thus if an upper bound on the total variation of an unknown density is available and a consistent estimate of conditional Rényi entropy is desired such that the weakened bound ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) can be used to give a selection rule for the required partition resolution 7) The Borel set of probability-at-least-defined in (15) which minimizes Rényi entropy of order is independent of and can be constructed by a simple water-filling procedure. To see this, define the Lagrangian for</p><p>. Consider an arbitrary Borel subset outside of ,</p><p>. By Kuhn-Tucker, must satisfy for to minimize and hence minimize entropy. Here which is negative when is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> where, if possible, is selected to satisfy . Hence, in this case, the conditional density in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is obtained by truncating wherever it falls below and renormalizing to obtain a valid probability density integrating to over . See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> for illustration.</p><p>When for any the set has (Lebesgue) measure zero has no flat spots and it is always possible to select in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> to satisfy . Otherwise, we need to slightly modify the definition (18) of . Let be such that the set has probability , the set has probability , and assume that . Then defining <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where is an arbitrary Borel subset of having , is an entropy-minimizing subset of probability . 8) The minimum entropy set in ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) is not unique. For example, any arbitrary probability zero set can be added to without affecting the entropy. A more interesting example occurs when is a uniform density for which case any set of area minimizes entropy. In this case, the assertion of Theorem 2 may come as a surprise since the largest distance between points in should be smallest for connected sets of small diameter, e.g., a sphere. However, let be a countable union of disjoint sets having . Note that only a single edge is needed between and to form a connected graph over these two sets. Thus in the limit of large the total edge weight of the graph is dominated by connections between points within each and not is A o = fx: f(x) g where A o ; are selected such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A f(x) dx = :</formula><p>connections between different . This is because the total edge weight depends more on the average edge weight than on the maximum edge weight. 9) In the Rényi entropy estimator ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) the constant is a bias offset which can in principle be computed offline as it does not depend on . However, while upper and lower bounds are available, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for MST bounds, analytic expressions for are not available. Alternatively, for some estimation or classification problems only relative entropy may be needed, e.g., testing for different entropy rates between two populations via the ratio of -point graph weight functionals, for which the bias offset need not be known. 10) Consider the case that is a mixture of a nominal density of interest and a uniform contaminating density . In order that be identifiable we assume that ; this simply ensures that have no uniform component. Then, since increasingly dominates as decreases, for small a suitable threshold exists for which: . Thus ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) can be viewed as a robust estimator of the Rényi entropy of the nominal density .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. INFLUENCE FUNCTIONS</head><p>Influence functions have been used to study quantitative robustness of estimators to outliers and other contaminating densities for over thirty years <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. These functions provide a quantitative measure of outlier sensitivity of an estimator. An unbounded influence function implies that the effect of an outlier on the estimator can be very severe. Robust estimators, such as the trimmed mean estimator which rejects observations that exceed a given sample quantile, have bounded influence functions (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>).</p><p>Here we give the influence function for the normalized greedy minimal -point graph weight described in Section IV. The form of this influence function motivates the use of the Rényi estimator ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) as a robust estimator of the entropy of a nominal density in the mixture model . It also establishes a kind of outlier robustness which is similar to that of rank-order statistics for one-dimensional observations. Finally, it gives an asymptotic approximation to the variance of which can be used to construct confidence intervals on finite sample accuracy.</p><p>Let be the empirical distribution function of the samples for arbitrary Borel set . For any statistic converging a.s. to the influence function (IF) (called an influence curve for one-dimensional samples ) is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> IF <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> where is a concentrated distribution centered at and . For small , is interpreted as a perturbed distribution resulting from exchanging of the samples from distribution with samples from the concentrated distribution . Thus IF can be used to probe the asymptotic sensitivity of the estimator to localized perturbations of .</p><p>If the distribution of the estimator satisfies certain asymptotic conditions, not explored here, then the influence function can also be used to approximate asymptotic estimator variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>   of necessarily increases the overall weight of the graph. On the other hand, the value of IF on the interior of corresponds to the effect on the weight due to perturbing the locations of a small number of vertices. Thus depending on the direction of these perturbations, the weight of the graph can either increase or decrease.</p><p>We illustrate these phenomena in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> where MST applied to samples from the IF is plotted as a function of for the case of the bivariate Gaussian distribution considered in the previous subsection. Two cases are shown, the figure on the left is the influence function for , i.e., for the minimal graph spanning all points (labeled MST), and the figure on the right is for , i.e., for the minimal -point graph (labeled -MST) spanning only 80% of the points. Note that, as expected, the influence function is bounded for the -point graph but unbounded for the graph spanning all points. This suggests that the greedy -point minimal graph is a natural multidimensional extension of rank-order statistical methods such as the trimmed mean. This complements the comments of Friedman and Rafsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> in which they proposed the MST as a natural generalization of the one-dimensional rank-order Smirnov test statistic for testing equality of two multivariate distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have given strong asymptotic convergence results for greedy approximations to minimal -point graphs. These convergence results indicate that the weight function of minimal -point graphs provide natural extensions of one-dimensional rank-order statistics to multiple dimensions. Our results also provide an interesting alternative to kernel or histogram methods of entropy estimation. An open problem is whether or not the exact -point minimal graph satisfies the tight cover property stated in Definition 2 of Section III. Another open problem is the determination of the asymptotic distribution of the greedy -point minimal graph weight and its rate of convergence. While percolation theory methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Martingale convergence methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> can be used to establish central limit results for the MST, their application to -point minimal graphs, in particular the -MST, appears more difficult. Resolution of this issue will be especially important for statistically significant utilization of -point minimal graphs for estimation, detection, and discrimination applications.</p></div>
