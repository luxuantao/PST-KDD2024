<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A new method for the optimal design of Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) is proposed in this paper. Instead of using the widely used explicit functional models, a feature tree based procedural model is proposed to represent generic material heterogeneities. A procedural model of this sort allows more than one explicit function to be incorporated to describe versatile material gradations and the material composition at a given location is no longer computed by simple evaluation of an analytic function, but obtained by execution of customizable procedures. This enables generic and diverse types of material variations to be represented, and most importantly, by a reasonably small number of design variables. The descriptive flexibility in the material heterogeneity formulation as well as the low dimensionality of the design vectors help facilitate the optimal design of functionally graded materials. Using the nature-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method, functionally graded materials with generic distributions can be efficiently optimized. We demonstrate, for the first time, that a PSO based optimizer outperforms classical mathematical programming based methods, such as active set and trust region algorithms, in the optimal design of functionally graded materials. The underlying reason for this performance boost is also elucidated with the help of benchmarked examples.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Designing objects with Functionally Graded Material (FGM) distributions has been the subject of substantial research interest in recent years. This popularity is largely due to the many excellent and unique properties that FGM objects possess: for instance, the combined advantages of different materials, improved material compatibilities and good adaptability to versatile working conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In the past few decades, considerable attention has been devoted to FGM representations (Computer-Aided Design), design validation (Computer-Aided Engineering), fabrication (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) and material heterogeneity optimization. These efforts were primarily targeted at answering the following questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>:</p><p>(1) How best to represent a FGM object's geometries and material distributions? (2) Does the designed FGM object fulfil the user's functional requirements? How to validate its functional property or performance?</p><p>(3) Is it physically realizable? How to make it? (4) Subject to the given constraints and external stimuli, how to identify the optimal design among different representable, validated and manufacturable models?</p><p>In the literature, problems (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) have been extensively investigated, and many well-established approaches to tackle the CAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, CAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and CAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> problems have been found. In contrast, fewer investigations have been conducted into the optimal design of functionally graded materials.</p><p>Many existing FGM models were originally proposed for the purpose of computer visualization, rapid prototyping or design evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and a large number of parameters or design variables are required to model heterogeneous FGM distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Such representations can seldom be migrated unchanged to optimal design problems because the high dimensionality of the representations may impose significant computational overheads, making them prohibitively expensive or impractical for use in design optimization. For instance, it is feasible to represent the material heterogeneity with a 1024 × 1024 pixel bitmap where the intensity of a pixel denotes the volume fraction of materials. However, it is likely to be problematic to attempt design optimization with over one million design variables, as the computational cost entailed is hardly affordable even for modern computers. Other straightforward (e.g. explicit function based) models are better suited for FGM optimizations: when the material variations are represented with explicit, analytic functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, the optimization search space can be confined within reasonably limited domains (e.g. pre-set functional formalism), and optimal solutions can be obtained much more efficiently and economically. However, only in rare cases can a material distribution be represented in such explicit and analytic forms. This becomes especially difficult when the objects under design have complex material distributions, where a single analytic function fails to characterize the material heterogeneity throughout the entire domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>This paper is motivated by a desire to tackle the aforementioned challenges and to investigate effective approaches to tackle FGM design optimization problems. We propose the use of a procedural model to represent generic heterogeneous objects and employ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as the mathematical optimizer. In contrast to most explicit functional models, the proposed procedural model allows more than one explicit function to be used to describe complex material variations. With such a model, the material composition at a given location is not calculated by simple evaluation of an analytic function, but obtained by execution of series of customizable procedures. The model therefore enables generic and diverse types of material variations to be represented, and most importantly, by a reasonably small number of design variables. The PSO method is inspired by the natural process that intimates the social sharing of information among conspeciates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. PSO has proved to be especially suited to finding the global optimum for problems of multimodality and nondifferentiability <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. By leveraging the benefits of the procedural model and PSO optimizer, we show that optimal FGM design can be flexibly and efficiently conducted.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews related work and current challenges, and the motivations of this work are identified. Section 3 focuses on the proposed methodology: the details of Heterogeneous Feature Tree (HFT) based procedural model and the PSO approach are presented. Implementation details, benchmarking examples and case studies are provided in Section 4. Concluding remarks and discussions are finally offered in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work and motivations</head><p>Two of the most important issues in the optimal design of FGM objects are the representation of the FGM object and the optimization method used. The FGM representation determines how a functionally graded material distribution is encoded or abstracted into a parametric model, where the design variables are identified and the material heterogeneity is formulated with functions of these variables. The optimization method, either sensitivity based or sensitivity-free, influences the global optimality of solutions as well as the computational efficiency of the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">FGM representation and design parameterization</head><p>In terms of the design parameterization scheme, existing approaches can be classified into two mainstream types. Discrete models partition the geometric domain of interest into a collection of lumps, and each lump is assumed to have a homogeneous or an interpolated material composition. Cho and Ha <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, Cho and Shin <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Na and Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> discretized the object under design into a number of homogeneous 1D layers in the optimal design of unidirectional FGM objects. The design variables of the optimization problem are the material compositions of each homogeneous lump, and the objective might be minimizing the peak thermal stress or the mass/weight of a component. For bidirectional FGM optimization problems, Cho and Ha <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed a two-dimensional volume fraction optimization procedure for relaxing the effective thermal stress, and the 2D geometric domain is discretized into a collection of uniform rectangles. Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> further extended the discrete model in tri-variate FGM design in which a three-dimensional I-beam is discretized into tetrahedral elements. The material compositions defined at the tetrahedron vertices are regarded as design variables, and the material of any point inside a tetrahedron is defined with linear interpolation between the compositions of the nodes (i.e. the tetrahedron vertices).</p><p>Using discrete models, a large number of design variables are usually needed, which may significantly degrade computational efficiency. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists the number of design variables used in typical discrete-model based FGM optimizations. It can be clearly seen that as the dimension of the object changes from 1D to 3D, the optimization search space is enlarged enormously. Note that the growth in the computational resource consumption (including CPU time and memory) is seldom linear but often involves steep nonlinear increases: this is understandable due to the intensive calculations required in finite difference based sensitivity analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, as will be further elaborated in Section 2.2.</p><p>Instead of modeling FGM distributions with spatial discretization, functional models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> avoid direct specification of material compositions at discrete sites, but rather use a function defined over a geometric domain to describe the material heterogeneity. In representing unidirectional functionally graded materials, Elishakoff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Na and Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, Ootao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> represented the material heterogeneity with power-law based distributions; while Eraslan and Akis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed exponential and parabolic functions. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> described the FGM distribution with a parametric Bezier curve based representation. Biswas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proposed using a generalized Taylor expansion to formulate material heterogeneities. Similar functional representations were also extended to model bidirectional and tri-variate FGM objects: Vel and Pelletier <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> formulated the FGM distributions with piecewise cubic Hermite polynomials and the materials defined on a 2D domain are interpolated from a collection of control points; Nemat-Alla <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and Hedia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> employed multivariate polynomial functions to model 2D material heterogeneities; Schmitt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, Martin and Cohen <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Hua et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> further extended such methods in the design of tri-variate FGMs, where FGM objects are modeled with B-spline/NURBS volumes using tensor product representations.</p><p>Using a functional model to represent FGM distributions, the design variables are in most cases the coefficients of analytical functions, for instance the power index for power-law based formulae or polynomial coefficients for Taylor expansions. This explicit and concise representation makes functional models well suited for material formulation in the optimal design of FGM: they are intuitive, easy to implement and computationally efficient, as only a few design variables are required to fully characterize the material distributions, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Despite the apparent advantages of functional models, it should be noted that explicit functional models also have certain limitations. It is not always trivial, even if possible, to model complex material gradations with a single, analytic function throughout the entire geometric domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Furthermore, the optimality of a design is directly dependent on the designer's knowledge, since the selection of an appropriate function form determines the types or genera of the material gradation to be optimized. In this sense, the functional model manifests a rather subjective, personal choice of material variation patterns, into which the designer's experience is embedded. Compared with functional models, discrete models offer a more objective, unbiased representation of material heterogeneity, where no specific constraints or preferences are exerted on the allowable material distributions, but the penalty associated with a discrete model, as discussed above, lies in the large number of design variables and the computational overheads. One of the direct impetuses of this paper is to propose an appropriate FGM model to combine the advantages of both discrete and functional models: a small number of design variables and versatility in material heterogeneity formulations. The key idea is to employ a procedural model where the material composition is interrogated by execution of customizable procedures. Similar ideas have been previously proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and recently used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> to represent material properties as well as internal spatial geometric structures by a vector-function with procedural evaluation of its components. Their focus in using a procedural model is on the preciseness, arbitrary parameterization and geometric manipulations, whereas the focus of this work is on the compactness (low dimensionality of design vectors), versatility in heterogeneity representation and its suitability to the optimal design of FGM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Optimization methods</head><p>In addition to the choice of representation of functionally graded materials, the choice of optimization method also contributes significantly to the success of FGM design optimization procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</p><p>Given a FGM object model, the optimization method seeks to find the optimal model parameters in the parameter space such that specific objective or cost functions can be minimized or maximized. Many existing studies are based on classical approaches such as the conjugate gradient method or sensitivity analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The essence of these approaches is to use gradient information in seeking the optimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. To minimize the objective function F (X), one can calculate the gradient ∇F (X) and then search in the steepest descent direction -∇F (X). By exploiting the gradient of F (X), the search for the optimum can be limited to specific directions rather than randomly searching in the entire design domain. Cho and Ha <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, Chen and Tong <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and Chen and Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> applied sensitivity analysis to find the best search directions of the design variables. Subsequent iterations are then carried out until the solution converges.</p><p>It should be noted that it is usually non-trivial to compute the sensitivity derivatives with respect to the design variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Chen and Tong <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> demonstrated the use of direct sensitivity analysis and semi-analytical methods for the evaluation of 1D graded FGM object in the heat conduction problem. They noted that semi-analytical approaches could cause significant inaccuracy problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is also computationally expensive to compute, because the objective function of a FGM optimization problem is seldom in the form of analytical functions of the design variables. In such scenarios, finite difference turns out to be the most effective approach to approximate the gradient F ′ (X) ≈ (F (X + X ) -F (X)) / X . In the case where N design variables are employed, the objective function needs to be evaluated whenever a minute perturbation X i is applied to each design variable X i . This imposes serious computational overheads when N is very large.</p><p>It should also be noted that even when sensitivity analysis can be computed at trivial computational cost, the approximated derivatives are only local sensitivities which are ''valid only in sufficiently small neighborhoods of the nominal value of the respective parameters'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. This indicates that: (I) the objective function is assumed to be a continuous function of the design variables, and the function gradient does exist; and (II) the accuracy and robustness of such searches are strongly dependent on the initial value as well as the accuracy of the computed derivatives.</p><p>Unfortunately, theoretical proof of (I) and the selection of a 'good' initial solution required by (II) are extremely difficult for practical FGM optimization problems. If such assumptions are violated, the correctness of any gradient based optimizers is not guaranteed. Without a reasonably good initial solution, the obtained optimal solution may well be only a local optimum as opposed to the global one.</p><p>In this paper, we apply a nature inspired optimization method to the optimal FGM design task; the proposed particle swarm optimization approach does not rely on cumbersome sensitivity analysis nor on accurate initial solutions. The adopted methodology is presented in what follows.</p></div>

At the same time the use of a small number of design variables should not jeopardize the expressiveness or descriptive power of a material heterogeneity representation.</p><p>In this paper, we propose the use of a procedural model to represent FGM distributions.

The key idea is to encode the material variation dependency into a tree structure, where the parent feature's material distribution is defined to be dependent on its child features (more specifically on the children's spatial locations as well as their material definitions). For instance, the material distribution of the object shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>) can be described with the HFT structure shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>. By definition, the object O has an overall linear material gradation from the top to the bottom plane, i.e. its material composition depends on two sub-features PL 1 and PL 2 . Therefore PL 1 and PL 2 are saved as the child features of O. Similarly, the material distributions of the top and bottom planes (PL 1 and PL 2 ) are also defined with linear material gradations, with the bounding contours C i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) as material variation With this Heterogeneous Feature Tree (HFT) model, the material variation dependency in a single parent-child hierarchy can be quantitatively interrogated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M(P) = n  i=1 W i M i = n  i=1 W i (d i )M i d i = dist(P, S i ), n  i=1 W i (d i ) = 1 (1)</formula><p>where M(P) is the material composition for an arbitrary point P, n is the number of child features, M i is a material associated with i-th child feature S i , W i is the material blending weight or the contribution of S i , and d i is the Euclidean distance from P to S i .</p><p>For a multi-level hierarchical HFT, the above process can be recursively executed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M(P) = n  i=1 W i M i = n  i=1 f (i) (P) • M i M i = m  j=1 W ′ j M ′ j = m  j=1 g (j) (P) • M ′ j M ′ j = p  k=1 W ′′ k M ′′ k = p  k=1 h (k) (P) • M ′′ k , . . . n  i=1 W i = 1, m  j=1 W ′ j = 1, p  k=1 W ′′ k = 1, . . .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where M i , M ′ j and M ′′ k are the material definitions of the heterogeneous features evaluated at different hierarchies, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">W i , W ′ j and W ′′</formula><p>k are the material blending weights defined at each hierarchy, which, in general, are functions of point locations such as f (i) (P), g (j) (P) and h (k) (P) in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p><p>By simple substitution, it is easy to find that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M(P) = n  i=1 f (i) (P) •  m  j=1 g (j) (P) •  p  k=1 h (k) (P) • M ′′ k  • • • = f • g • h • • • • (P, M L )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where M L are the material compositions of the leaf features, f , g, h are customizable functions/procedures, and the symbol ''•'' denotes sequential execution of such procedures. Note that a leaf node feature's material does not depend on any other features. Therefore M L are homogeneous by definition, and the weighting function for the leaf node is ''null''.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Particle Swarm Optimization</head><p>Rather than a classical sensitivity analysis based optimization method, in this work we propose to use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a nature inspired optimizer, to avoid the limitations discussed in Section 2.2. The PSO approach, initially proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> in 1995 is inspired by the natural process that intimates the social sharing of information between the swarm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The individuals communicate their best solution, and the members of the group follow a combination of the ''group's previous best and their own previous best'', with an additional stochastic element to assist exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p><p>The simplified principle of PSO can be described as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v t+1 = αv t + ϕ 1 β 1 (p i -x i ) + ϕ 2 β 2 (p g -x i ) x t+1 = x t + v t+1 (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where α is the inertia weight, ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 are constants known as acceleration coefficients, and β 1 , β 2 are two separately generated uniformly distributed random numbers in the range of [0, 1].</p><p>In terms of the given fitness/objective function, p i and p g are the best/fittest particles (i.e. design vectors) found by a single individual and all the individuals respectively.</p><p>v t represents the previous velocity, which ''provides the necessary momentum for particles to roam across the search space'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>; ϕ 1 β 1 (p i -x i ), known as the cognitive part, represents the personal thinking or preference of each particle; and ϕ 2 β 2 (p gx i ) known as the social part represents the collaborative effect of the particles in seeking the global optimal solution. One of the attractive properties of PSO is that it does not require the time-consuming evaluation of the gradient of an objective function, and instead, the evaluation of the functional suffices. This naturally makes PSO well suited for the optimal heterogeneity design problem in which the evaluation of sensitivity is computationally expensive. Given a random material distribution (i.e. an individual particle), the response of a FGM object can be evaluated by numerical methods such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. By sharing the evaluated functional from a population of individuals as shown in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>), the PSO scheme can provide optimal or quasi-optimal solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> with intuitive implementations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">A benchmarking example: unidirectional FGM optimization</head><p>To validate the proposed approach, an example optimal design of unidirectional FGM is benchmarked. The problem was originally studied by Cho and Ha in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to minimize thermal stresses in a tenlayer FGM made of Ni and Al 2 O 3 . The FGM object was initially kept at a uniform temperature T 0 = 300 K in a stress-free state, and the temperature was then uniformly decreased to 100 K. Because of the different thermal expansion coefficients, thermal stress is introduced when such thermal loads are applied. The objective function is to minimize the axial stress σ xx . Unless otherwise stated, the same geometry, boundary conditions and material properties of Ni and Al 2 O 3 etc. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> are used in this paper and the results are directly compared below.</p><p>To compare the FEA results, we evaluated the peak axial stress σ max xx when all the layers have the same volume fractions [0.5, 0.5] of Ni and Al 2 O 3 , a uniform mixture of the primary materials.</p><p>The value reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> was 1.28247 × 10 8 Pa, and the result calculated by us was 1.3229 × 10 8 Pa. Our result is in good agreement with Cho and Ha's <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, with the evaluated peak axial stress being slightly higher than theirs. The small difference can be attributed to the fact that the simplest linear rule-of-mixture model is used to evaluate the material properties (e.g. Young's modulus), while Cho and Ha used a more complex nonlinear model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>To compare the proposed PSO optimizer with the sensitivity analysis based approach of Cho and Ha <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, two PSO based optimization experiments were conducted, using 5 and 10 particles respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 4</head><p>Optimization results derived from a Genetic Algorithm (GA).  <ref type="table">3</ref>. This comparison demonstrates that the PSO approach outperforms these classical approaches in this FGM optimal design problem, finding much higher quality solutions for the same computational effort. The underlying reason for the better performance of PSO is because it neither assumes continuity, nor the existence of the derivative of the objective function, whereas classical optimizers rely heavily on such assumptions. Classical gradient or sensitivity based approaches only actually search along specific directions, which are, however, not guaranteed to be feasible search directions. The PSO approach, in contrast, naturally overcomes such problems by means of random search (exploration) and information sharing (exploitation) and thereby outperforms the classical optimizers.</p><p>The efficacy of the PSO based optimizer in this FGM optimization is further compared against a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the optimization results are listed in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows the detailed optimization settings used in this GA, and the parameters such as migration fraction, crossover fraction etc. are the same as the default values used by Matlab's GA implementation. For comparative reasons, the population size N is selected as 5 and 10 respectively (as 5 and 10 particles are used in our PSO experiments, see also Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The same problem is optimized with different population sizes, and a total of 1000 FEA simulations are performed. Due to the random nature of the GA, each experiment is repeated twice, as shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, for the population with 5 individuals, the GA optimization results (0.8287 × 10 8 and 0.9383 × 10 8 Pa) are better than those from classical gradient based approaches (1.034 × 10 8 and 1.039 × 10 8 Pa), but not as good as that of the PSO approach (0.539 × 10 8 Pa). When 10 individuals are used in the population, the GA still offers better results (0.7549 × 10 8 Pa and 0.4372 × 10 8 Pa) than the gradient approaches, with one of the optimized results (0.4372 × 10 8 Pa) being better than, and the other (0.7549 × 10 8 Pa) inferior to, that of PSO. Note that the above comparison of PSO and GA in this optimization problem is for reference purposes only. One cannot use such case studies to judge the better or poorer suitability of PSO and GA in FGM optimizations. The primary reasons are manifold: the optimization settings such as the number of particles/individuals, the acceleration coefficients, and migration/crossover fraction etc. all contribute significantly to the performance of the optimizations, and quantitative comparisons are only meaningful when these parameters are predetermined and invariant; furthermore, both PSO and GA are stochastic optimizers which are essentially dependent on random particles/individuals, therefore it is difficult to draw a deterministic conclusion as to which is better unless one is willing to undertake comparative studies.</p><p>From Tables <ref type="table">3</ref> and<ref type="table">4</ref>, it is clearly seen that both PSO and GA optimizers outperform gradient based approaches in all the presented numerical experiments, which can be attributed to PSO and GA's global search capabilities.</p></div>

Also note that compared with a homogeneous solid with averaged mixtures of zirconia and titanium alloy (i.e. the volume fraction is [0.5, 0.5]), both the peak thermal stress and the mass of the FGM object are decreased. Specifically, the mass of the FGM object is reduced from 42.953 kg/m to the optimized 41.381 kg/m, and the peak von Mises stress is decreased from 684.99 MPa to 516.22 MPa, a 24.6% improvement in terms of peak stress suppression.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Concluding remarks and discussions</head><p>A novel method to perform optimal design of functionally graded materials is proposed in this paper. The generic material variation pattern is characterized with a heterogeneous feature tree structure, which allows more than one explicit function to be used for the description of versatile material variations. With such a model, the material composition at a given location is not calculated by simple evaluation of an explicit analytic function, but obtained by execution of customizable procedures. This procedural model enables generic and diverse types of material variations to be represented, and most importantly, by a reasonably small number of design variables. The merits of low dimensionality of design vectors and the versatility/flexibility in material heterogeneity formulation naturally lend the procedural model to the optimal design of FGM materials. Combining the procedural model with the nature inspired particle swarm optimization method, functionally graded materials with generic gradation patterns can be flexibly and efficiently optimized.</p><p>The most important contributions of this paper include: (1) we demonstrate, for the first time, that a PSO based optimizer outperforms classical mathematical programming based optimizers, such as the active set and trust region algorithms, in the optimal design of functionally graded materials; (2) the underlying reasons for the better performance and suitability of PSO over classical optimizers are elucidated with the support of benchmarked examples; and (3) in combination with the PSO optimizer, a heterogeneous feature tree based procedural model is proposed in the optimal design of FGMs. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach is an effective, flexible and computationally efficient approach for FGM optimization problems.</p><p>Although the optimization case studies presented in this paper are focused on 2D FGM objects, the proposed approach is nevertheless also generally applicable to FGM objects with 3D geometries and any HFT based heterogeneities. As shown in the pseudo code in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, there are no specific constraints imposed on the geometric dimension of the FGM object, and the sole concern might be the associated computational costs.</p><p>In the proposed methodology, it is assumed that the topology of the heterogeneous tree structure is fixed and it is up to the end user's to propose appropriate structures in specific downstream applications. The topology (inclusive of the number of tree hierarchies, the number of HFT nodes, node connectivity etc.) of the tree structure is crucial to the optimal design of FGMs, and the material heterogeneity can be said to be optimal only in scenarios where the material distribution obeys this generic type of variation. The procedural CAD model is interactively created with the CAD4D toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> in this paper, and such modeling is analogous to selecting appropriate function forms in data fitting, where the function types/forms to fit given data are predetermined and manually chosen by end users. Although it is highly desirable to have a scheme which can offer an optimal layout/topology for the HFT structure, with little human intervention and a fixed/preset configuration imposed, it is challenging and computationally expensive to implement such a system at the current stage. Schmidt and Lipson <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, in their recent investigation, proposed a novel approach to automatically distill free-form natural laws from experimental data, and their approach provides an inspiring method to discover analytic forms of natural laws without any prior knowledge of the governing physics. Such recent advances are likely to be migrated to the development of next generation FGM optimal design methods, where the preset layout of the heterogeneous feature tree structure can be obtained with little human intervention.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
