<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M</head><p>ANY physical components in control systems contain nonsmooth nonlinearities, such as saturation, relays. hysteresis, and deadzones. Such nonlinearities are especially common in actuators used in practice, such as hydraulic servo valves. Furthermore, the nonlinearities in such systems are often unknown and vary with time. For example, a common source of nonlinearities arise from friction, which vary with temperature and wear, and may ditler significantly between components which are mass produced. Therefore the study of methods to deal with nonsmooth nonlinearities has been of interest to control practitioners for some time. In this paper, we consider only deadzone nonlinearities. Deadzones are of interest in their own right, and provide good models for many nonsmooth nonlinearities found in practice.</p><p>Several possible classical methods exist for controlling systems with nonsmooth nonlinearities, including sliding mode control [I], and dithering L2]. Motivated by limitations in these methods, such as chattering in sliding mode control, Recker et al. L3] proposed an adaptive control scheme for controlling systems with deadzones. In [3], full state measurements were assume to be available. More recently, Tao and Kokotovic [4] considered the more realistic situation where only a single output measurement is available. In practice, however, the transient performance of the adaptive control schemes above is limited_ Fuzzy logic-based controllers have received considerable interest in recent years (see for example L5j, [6], [7], [8], [9]).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fuzzy-based methods are useful when precise mathematical formulations are infeasible. Moreover, fuzzy logic controllers often yield superior results to conventional control approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, direct application of usual "fuzzy PD" con trollers to a system with deadzones results in poor transient and steady-state behavior, as we shall see in the next section (the use of the term "fuzzy PD" will also be explained there). In particular, a steady-state error occurs when using a fuzzy PD controller to a system with deadzones-the size of the steady state error increases with the deadzone width. The steady-state error arises because fuzzy PD controllers use only the output error and the change in output error as inputs to the controller. To eliminate the steady-state error, we may attempt to use a fuzzy controller that also incorporates the "integral" of the output error as an input to the controller. Such a controller was considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. However, even though the steady-state error is eliminated when applied to a system with deadzones, the transient performance is not satisfactory.</p><p>In this paper we propose a fuzzy logic-based scheme which does not suffer from the deficiencies mentioned above of fuzzy PD controllers applied to systems with deadzones_ The idea underlying our approach is based on analyzing the source of the steady-state error resulting in using a fuzzy PD controller. Our control scheme consists of two "layers": a fuzzy precompensator, and a usual fuzzy PD controller. We demonstrate that our controller has good transient as well as steady-state performance, and is robust to variations in deadzone nonlinearities.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In</p><p>Section II we describe a system with a deadzone, and study the characteristics of a particular standard fuzzy logic controller applied to the system. We show that the fuzzy controller results in poor performance, and give an analysis of the source of steady-state errors. In Section III we propose our two-layered fuzzy logic controller. We describe the idea underlying our approach. and give a precise description of the controller. We also provide simulation plots to illustrate the behavior of our scheme. Finally we conclude in Section IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CHARACTERISTICS OF A USUAL FLC</head><p>In this section we describe a fuzzy logic PD controller (FLC), and study the behavior of the FLC applied to a system with a deadzone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Basic Control Structure</head><p>We consider the (discrete-time) system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">L</ref> The transfer function P( z) represents the plant, D represents </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Fuzzy Logic Controller</head><p>We describe the FLC control law F(e(k), �e(k)] as follows.</p><p>The approach is based on standard fuzzy logic rules-for details on fuzzy logic controllers we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>We think of e(k) and �e(k)  an actuator with deadzone, F(e(k),�e(k)l represents a FLC control law, Kl is the feed forward gain, v(k) is the output of the controller, u(k) is the output of the actuator, Ym(k) is the reference input (command signal to be followed), and Yp(k)</p><p>is the output of the plant. The characteristics of the actuator with deadzone D is described by the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{mev-d), D( v ] = 0, m(v + d), if v 2: d if -d::; 'II ::; d if v &lt; -d</formula><p>where d, m 2: O. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the characteristics of the actuator with deadzone. The parameter 2d specifies the width of the deadzone, while m represents the slope of the response outside the deadzone. The control scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> represents a typical FLC control system (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). Kwok et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> studied a class of linguistic PID controllers-the controller of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is the "Type I" system considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Following the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we refer to the controller as a "fuzzy PD" FLC. The rationale for the term "fuzzy PD" is that the controller uses the error and change of error (proportional-derivative) as inputs, much like a conventional PD controller. The feed forward term Kl is needed in order to eliminate the steady state error (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>).</p><p>Nominally, the value of Kl is set to the reciprocal of the static gain of the plant-this results in a zero steady-state error if the deadzone is absent (see Section 11.3). Each membership function is a map from the real line to the interval [0, 1]; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> shows a plot of the membership functions. The "meaning" of each linguistic value should be clear from its mnemonic; for example, NB stands for "negative-big", NM for "negative-medium", NS for "negative small", ZO for "zero", and likewise for the "positive" (P) linguistic value. For this FLC, the rules are given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. This set of rules is similar to standard rules (see for example <ref type="bibr">[9, p. 320]</ref>). In this case, r = 21, but in general we may have more or fewer number of rules. As is usual in fuzzy logic approaches, the   <ref type="figure">-;</ref>. i-q --, ----1-1 q(e(k), b.e(k), w)dw where CF is a scale factor. This method of defuzzification is called the Center of Area (COA) or Centroid method, since the ratio in the right hand side of the above equation is simply the center of area (or centroid) of the function q(e(k), t.e(k), wJ (as a function of w).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Analysis of Steady-State System Behavior</head><p>We now study the steady-state behavior of the system controlled by the FLC described in the previous section. We will show that in the presense of a deadzone, a steady-state error occurs.</p><p>The dynamics of overall system is described by the equa tions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">e(k) == Ym(k) -Yp(k) b.e(k) == e(k) -e(k -1) v(k) = KIYm(k) + F [e (k), t. e (k)] u(k) == D[v(k)] Yp(k) == P(Z) [1l(k)]</formula><p>Note that the equation Yp(k) == P(z)[u(k)] involves a slight abuse of notation; however, its meaning should be obvious. It turns out that F[O, 0] == 0, and therefore if we fi x the reference input Ym(k) == Ym, the steady-state actuator input is K1Ym. Consider the case where there is no deadzone, i.e., d == 0, and m = 1. In this case the plant output can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Yp(k) == P(Z)[KIYm(k) + F[e(k), b.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>e(k l ] ]</head><p>We assume that the plant is of Type 0 (i.e., P( z ) does not have a pole at z == 1). Since e(k) == Ym(k) -Yp(k), then the plant output can also be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Yp(k) = Ym(k) -e(k)</formula><p>We now fi x Ym (k) == Ym, and study the behavior of the system in steady-state. In this case, we set b.e(k) = ° to get</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Yp(k) == Ks[K1Ym + F[e(k),O]] == Ym -e(k) (1)</formula><p>where Ks is the static gain of F(z) (assumed stable), given by Ks == limz_ l P(z) (fi nite for a Type 0 plant). The steady-state error e •• is then the solution to (1), that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">K.[K1Yrn + F[egs&gt; 0]] == Ym -e ss<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We assume that the controller is "well-tuned", so that K l == K; l . Equation (2) then becomes We can solve (3) graphically-we simply plot the left and right hand sides of (1) on the same graph, and find the point where they intersect. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the solution is egg == O. Therefore, the steady-state error for a system without a deadzone is exactly zero. We now consider the case where a deadzone is present. i.e., d # 0, and m 2': 0 is arbitrary. In this case, the steady-state output of the plant can be written as Therefore, the steady-state error is the solution to the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Yp(k) == KsD[K1y", + F[ e(k) ,O] ] == Ym -e(k)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">KsD[KIYm + F[e(k), OJ]-Yrn = -eBB<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The first tenn in the left hand side of (4) is illustrated in Fig.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5(a)</head><p>. Once again we use a graphical approach to solve (4); We apply the FLC described before to the above plant, using the standard sample-and-hold approach, with a sampling period of 0.025 seconds. The scale factors used for the FLC are Ce = l/Ym, C6.e = 9/Ym, and CF = 5Ym. These values for the scale factors were chosen by experience. In this example, we set Yrn = 1, and Kl = 0.1. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> output responses of the plant for three values of d: 0.0, 0.5, 1.0. In all cases we used m = 1. It is clear from Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> that there is a relatively large steady-state error and overshoot when a deadzone is present. The steady-state error and overshoot increases with the deadzone width.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. TWo•LAYERED FuZZY LOGIC CON1ROLLER</head><p>In this section we describe a novel two-layered fuzzy logic controller. Our aim is to eliminate the steady-state error and improve the perfonnance of the output response for FLC systems with deadzones. As we shall see, our proposed scheme is indeed insensiti ve to deadzones, and exhibits good transient and steady-state behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Basic Control Structure</head><p>We use a graphical approach to describe the idea underlying our proposed controller. Consider Fig. assuming that the controller is well-tuned to the static gain K., i.e., Kl need not be equal to K; l , so long as the graph of K.D[K1ym. + F[e+T/, 0]]-Yrn is shifted by the appropriate amount. We can treat Kl as an additional design parameter.</p><p>We now proceed to describe our proposed controller. First, we defi ne the variables y;"(k) and e'(k) as follows:</p><p>y:.r,(k) = Ym(k) + J.l(k) e'(k) = e(k) + ft(k:)</p><p>where J.l(k) is a compensating tenn which is generated using a fuzzy logic scheme, which we will describe below. The proposed control scheme is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">7</ref>. As we can see, the controller consists of two "layers": a fuzzy precompensator, and a usual fuzzy PD controller. Hence we refer to our scheme as a two-layeredfuzzy logic controller. The error e(k), change of error Ae(k), and ft(k -1) (previous compensating term) are inputs to the precompensator. The output of the precompensator is J.l(k). The dynamics of overall system is then described by the following equations: <ref type="figure">----r----,----.----.----.----.----.----.----.----</ref> y'",(k As before, the fuzzy preeompensator consists of three steps: fuzzifi cation, decision making fuzzy logic, and defuzzification.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">e(k) = Ym(k) -Yp(k) �e(k) = e(k) -e(k -1) L4 ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">) = Ym(k) + J.L(k) e'(k) = Y;n(k) -yp(k) 6.e'(k) = e'(k) -/(k -1) v(k) = Kly'm(k) + F[e'(k), 6.f;'(k)] n(k) = D[v(kl] yp(k) = P ( z)[n (k)]</formula><p>For each I' E L', the fuzzifi cation process for the precompen sator assigns to each of the inputs elk), 6.e(k), and II(k -1), the numbers me(l'), m�e (l') and m Jl.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. In this case, each rule Ri is a quadruplet (l�,l�e&gt;I�,IJl.)' where l�,l�c,l� E L', and lJl. E L (where L is the set of linguistic values used in the FLC as described previously). As mentioned before, we usually express the rule as "if e( k) is l� and 6.e( k) is l�e and II(k -1) is l�, then J.L is I,l". In this case, we think of J.L as the output of the rule. We emphasize that the "output linguistic value" II' is in L (not L'). For each rule R; = (l�, l�e' l�, I,J, i = 1, . . . ,27, we compute the function  N�in = rnin(me(l�),mL'&gt;.e(Z::.e),ml"(l;J) p;(e(k), D.e(k), M(k -1), /1) = mi n (N.'nin' M,J/1)) where Ml" is the membership function of ZI" E L, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. We combine the functions P:, i = 1, ... ,27, to get Finally, the defuzzification process for the precompensator gives us the real output G [ e(k),.6.e(k),/1(k -1)] (using the COA method as before):</p><p>G[ e(k), .6.e (k ), /1(k -1)] J�l M ' (e(k), .6.e( k), M( k -1), /1) d/1 = C c 1 + /1(k -1) .L q' (e(k), .6.e(k), fI•( k -1), /1), d/1</p><p>where Cc is a scale factor. Note that we add /1(k -1) to the computed and scaled center-of-error term. The second layer of our controller structure consists of a usual fuzzy PD controller, which is essentially identical to that described in Section lL2, and is self-explanatory as shown in   Finally, we point out that additional simulation examples using different values for Kl indicate that the controller is also robust to choice of K1, and exact knowledge of the static gain K8 is not needed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for plots of the output response with various values of Kj). This is an additional desirable property of our control scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a two-layered fuzzy logic con troller for systems with deadzones. Our controller consists of a fuzzy precompensator and a usual fuzzy PD controller.</p><p>The proposed scheme has superior steady-state and transicnt performance, compared to a usual fuzzy PD controller. An advantage of our present approach is that an existing FLC can be easily modified into our control structure by adding a fuzzy precompensator, witl10ut having to retune the internal variables of the existing FLC. In addition, the two-layered control structure is robust to variations in the deadzone nonlin earities (width and slope). We demonstrated the performance of our controller via several computer simulation examples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.

The process of fuzzification transforms the inputs e( k) and �e( k) into the setting of linguistic values. Specifically, for each linguistic value l E L, we assign a pair of membership values ne(l) and n�e(l) to the inputs e(k) and �e(k) via the associated membership function Ml, by ne(l) = MI(Cee(k» n�e(l) = MI(C�e�e(k» where Ce and C�e are scale factors. The numbers ne(l) and n�e(l), I E L, are used in the fuzzy logic decision process, which we describe next. Associated with the fuzzy logic decision process is a set of fuzzy rules R = {R1,R2, . .. , Rr }. Eaeh Ri, i = 1, ... , T, is a triplet (le,lile,lw), where le,lileo1w E L. An example of a rule is the triplet (NS, PS, ZO). Rules are often written in the form: "if error is Ie and change of error is lile, then output is lw" (by output we mean the output of the fuzzy logic rule).</figDesc></figure>

Shifting the graph of KsD[KIYrn+F[e, O]]-Ym to the left by an amount T/ is equivalent to adding T/ to e.

In particular, as indicated by the dynamics equations previously, the output of the FLC is given by v(k) = K dm(k) + F[e'(k), 6.e'(kl]. D. Example We consider again the plant of Section IIA. We now apply the proposed two-layered fuzzy logic controller to the plant; as before we use a sampling time of 0.025 seconds. The scale factors used in the second layer (fuzzy PD controller) are as before, except with Yrn replaced by y;", i.e., Ce = l/y,=, C6.e = 9/y'm, and CF = 5y;". The scale factors used in the first layer (precompensator) are as follows: C� = 4.5/Ym, C�e = 49.5/Ym, C � = 3/Ym, Cc = 0.2Ym' Thesc values were chosen by experience and trial and error. In this example, we once again set Yrn = 1, and Kl = 0.1.</figDesc></figure>

The output responses in Fig. 9(a) show considerable improvement over those of Fig. 6. Not only is the steady-state error reduced to virtually zero, but the transient response is also improved. In Fig. 9(a), the "internal variables" (e.g., scale factors, membership functions) used were "tuned" for a deadzone width of d = 0 and a slope of Tn = 1. This tuning entails adjusting the values of the inlernal variables, by trial and error, to achieve a good output response with d = 0 and Tn = 1. Nevertheless, as</figDesc></figure>

In all three plots, the same values for the internal variables were used as before, except Cc = 3.5 in this case. As we can see, the controller performs well in all three cases. Hence we again conclude that the controller is robust to variations in slope. Naturally, the performance deteriorates as m increases, and the performance at a particular slope Tn will be better if the internal variables are specially tuned for that specific m.</figDesc></figure>
