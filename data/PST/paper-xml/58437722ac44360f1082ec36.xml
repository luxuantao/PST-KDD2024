<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We develop a broadband channel estimation algorithm for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with few-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Our methodology exploits the joint sparsity of the mmWave MIMO channel in the angle and delay domains. We formulate the estimation problem as a noisy quantized compressedsensing problem and solve it using efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms. In particular, we model the angle-delay coefficients using a Bernoulli-Gaussian-mixture distribution with unknown parameters and use the expectation-maximization forms of the generalized AMP and vector AMP algorithms to simultaneously learn the distributional parameters and compute approximately minimum mean-squared error (MSE) estimates of the channel coefficients. We design a training sequence that allows fast, fast Fourier transform based implementation of these algorithms while minimizing peak-to-average power ratio at the transmitter, making our methods scale efficiently to large numbers of antenna elements and delays. We present the results of a detailed simulation study that compares our algorithms to several benchmarks. Our study investigates the effect of SNR, training length, training type, ADC resolution, and runtime on channel estimation MSE, mutual information, and achievable rate. It shows that, in a mmWave MIMO system, the methods we propose to exploit joint angle-delay sparsity allow 1-bit ADCs to perform comparably to infinite-bit ADCs at low SNR, and 4-bit ADCs to perform comparably to infinite-bit ADCs at medium SNR.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>M ILLIMETER wave (mmWave) communication is a promising technology for future outdoor cellular systems due to its potential to use very high bandwidth channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. But larger bandwidths place difficult demands on the re-ceiver's analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). For example, at rates above 100 Msamples per second, ADC power consumption increases quadratically with sampling frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Highprecision ADCs (e.g., ≥ 6 bits) with bandwidths sufficient for mmWave systems (e.g., ≥ 1 Gsamples/s) are either unavailable or may be too costly and power-hungry for portable devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. One possible solution is to employ low-resolution ADCs, which enjoy low power consumption and simple hardware implementations. Low resolution ADCs have further benefits in MIMO systems, where a large number of ADCs are needed when digital baseband processing of all antenna outputs is desired. For example, in massive MIMO systems, it has been suggested to equip the base station with dozens of antennas and the same number of 1-bit ADCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we consider a receiver architecture based on few-bit (i.e., 1-4 bit) ADCs, which act to quantize the inphase and quadrature baseband received signals. The achievable rate of the quantized MIMO channel was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> assuming channel-state information at the receiver (CSIR) was perfect but channel-state information at the transmitter (CSIT) was absent. In the latter case, and assuming equal transmission power at each antenna, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> showed that QPSK is the optimum signaling strategy at low SNR. The perfect-CSIT case was studied in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, where constellation design methods were proposed to maximize the achievable rate. These methods achieve much higher rates than QPSK signaling, especially at high SNR, but require CSIT.</p><p>Due to the nonlinear nature of quantization, channel estimation with few-bit ADCs is challenging. To estimate broadband SISO channel coefficients, the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed to transmit periodic bursty training sequences, dither the ADCs, and estimate each tap separately. MIMO channel estimation is even more challenging because the linear combination of transmitted signals from different antennas is quantized. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the MIMO channel was estimated using least squares (LS) methods. In particular, the quantization error was treated as additive white Gaussian noise. As a result, a large estimation error was introduced.</p><p>To take into account quantization effects, iterative channel estimation methods using Expectation Maximization (EM) were proposed and analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The proposed methods have high complexity, however, since each EM iteration computes a matrix inverse and many iterations are needed for convergence. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> considered the MIMO channel with small antenna arrays in the lower frequency UHF (ultra high frequency) band, and thus did not take into account the sparsity of mmWave channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms were used for channel estimation and (or) symbol detection in the massive MIMO channel with few-bit ADCs. These works assumed that the channel coefficients follow an IID Gaussian distribution and did not exploit the sparsity inherent in mmWave channels. (Delay-domain sparsity was exploited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> but not angle-domain sparsity.) Also, since they were based on the massive-MIMO channel, these works did not exploit structures present in the broadband mmWave model that can be exploited for significant complexity reduction.</p><p>In this paper, we propose high-performance AMP-based channel estimation schemes for broadband mmWave MIMO channels with few-bit ADCs. The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows.</p><p>r We formulate the problem of estimating broadband mmWave channels under few-bit ADCs as a noisy, quantized, compressed-sensing problem. By leveraging sparsity in both the angle and delay domains, the massive MIMO channel can be accurately estimated by efficient algorithms and with relatively short training sequences. To our knowledge, our work is the first to take this approach.</p><p>r For channel estimation, we consider two AMP algorithms: the Generalized AMP (GAMP) algorithm from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and the Vector AMP (VAMP) algorithm from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. For both, we use EM extensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> to avoid the need to specify a detailed prior on the channel distribution. The GAMP and VAMP algorithms provide nearly minimum-MSE estimates with relatively low complexity in largescale estimation problems and are therefore suitable for estimating broadband massive MIMO channels.</p><p>r We propose a novel training sequence design that results in low channel-estimation error, low complexity, and low peak-to-average power ratio. Low complexity is achieved through a novel FFT-based implementation that will be described in the sequel.</p><p>r We undertake a detailed experimental study of impor- tant design choices, such as ADC precision, the type and length of training sequence, and the type of estimation algorithm. When evaluating algorithms, we consider both performance and complexity. For performance, we consider several metrics: mean-square error (MSE), mutual information, and achievable rate. From our experimental study, our main findings are as follows.</p><p>r Compared to other algorithms of which we are aware, the EM-VAMP algorithm has a superior performancecomplexity tradeoff.</p><p>r Our FFT-based implementation facilitates low-complexity estimation of channels with large antenna numbers (e.g., 64 × 64) and delay spreads (e.g., 16 symbol intervals).</p><p>r Relative to infinite-bit ADCs, 1-bit ADCs incur only small performance losses at low SNR, and 3-4-bit ADCs incur only small losses up to medium SNRs.</p><p>r The MSEs of the EM-GAMP and EM-VAMP algorithms decay exponentially with training length, and the achievable rate is usually maximized by sending a relatively short training sequence. A simple version of our proposed methodology was first published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Relative to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, our current work expands from one-bit to few-bit ADCs, expands from narrowband to broadband channels, considers leakage effects in sparse-channel modeling, considers four training sequence designs instead of one, considers the VAMP algorithm as well as the GAMP al-Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

Also, relative to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the experimental study in our current work is much more elaborate.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the broadband MIMO system model with few-bit ADCs. The channel characteristics of mmWave communications are then summarized in Section III.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BROADBAND MIMO WITH FEW-BIT ADC</head><p>We consider a MIMO system with few-bit ADCs, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The transmitter is equipped with N t antennas and the receiver is equipped with N r antennas. A total of 2N r few-bit ADCs separately quantize the real and imaginary parts of the received signal of each antenna. Assuming that the delay spread of the channel is limited to L symbol intervals and that carrier and symbol synchronization have already been performed, the quantizer output y[i] ∈ C N r ×1 at time i can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y[i] = Q L -1 =0 H[ ]t[i -] + w[i] ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where In this paper, we assume that uniform mid-rise quantization is used. In particular, if x is a complex-valued scalar x, then </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H[ ] ∈ C N r ×N t is the baseband channel impulse re- sponse at lag , t[i] ∈ C N t ×1</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">y = Q(x) means y = sign (Re(x)) min |Re(x)| Δ Re , 2 b-1 - 1 2 Δ Re + j sign (Im(x)) min |Im(x)| Δ Im , 2 b-1 - 1 2 Δ Im ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Δ Re E |Re(x)| 2 1 2 Δ b and Δ Im (E[|Im(x)| 2 ]) 1 2</formula><p>Δ b , and where Δ b is a stepsize that will be discussed in the sequel. In the special case of one-bit quantization, (2) becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = sign (Re(x)) 2 π E |Re(x)| 2 1 2 + j sign (Im(x)) 2 π E |Im(x)| 2 1 2 . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>The average powers E |Re(x)| 2 and E |Im(x)| 2 can be easily measured by analog circuits before the ADC, as in automatic gain control (AGC). In this paper, x is circularly symmetric, and so</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E |Re(x)| 2 = E |Im(x)| 2 = 1 2 E |x| 2 , implying that Δ Re = Δ Im .</formula><p>The quantization stepsize Δ b is usually chosen to minimize the quantization MSE assuming a Gaussian input signal (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>). These values of Δ b are given in Table I assuming a unit-power input. The normalized MSE (NMSE), defined as η b E |Q(x) -x| 2 /E |x| 2 , and the signal to quantization noise ratio (SQNR), defined as 10 log 10 1 η b , are also listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>. From the table it can be seen that Δ b ∼ 2 -b , η b ∼ 2 -2b and SQNR ≈ 5b dB. Notice that 4-bit ADCs yield quantization noise power around 20 dB below the signal power, which suggests that increasing ADC resolution beyond 4 bits should yield negligible performance improvement in the low and medium SNR regimes. This intuition will be verified by our simulations in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SPARSITY OF THE MMWAVE CHANNEL MODEL</head><p>In this section, we present the mmWave channel model assumed in our paper. The characteristics of the mmWave channel, especially the sparsity in the angle-delay domain, will be exploited by our proposed channel estimation algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Clustered MIMO Channel Model</head><p>The mmWave channel can be modeled using N cl multipath clusters, where the nth cluster comprises N n path paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For the mth path of the nth cluster, we use α n,m , τ n,m , ϕ r n,m (or θ r n,m ), ϕ t n,m (or θ t n,m ) to denote the complex gain, delay, azimuth (or zenith) angle of arrival, and azimuth (or zenith) angle of departure, respectively. Using these quantities, the channel impulse response from (1) can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">H[ ] = N c l n =1 N n p a t h m =1 α n,m a r (ϕ r n,m , θ r n,m )a * t (ϕ t n,m , θ t n,m ) × p( T -τ n,m ), 0 ≤ &lt; L, (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where p(t) includes the effects of pulse shaping and analog/ digital filtering, and where a r and a t are the array response vectors of the receive and transmit antenna arrays, respectively. We assume that the receive and transmit arrays are each configured as a uniform planar array (UPA). This assumption is quite common. For example, in the massive MIMO systems described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, UPAs with more than 100 antennas were tested. In the mmWave 5G cellular system prototype described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, there is a 256-element <ref type="bibr">(16 × 16)</ref> UPA array panel at the base station, and two sets of 1 × 16 UPA arrays in the top and bottom portions of the mobile phone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Angle-Delay Representation</head><p>The MIMO channel coefficients H[ ] ∈ C N r ×N t are expressed in what is known as the "antenna aperture domain." We find it convenient to instead work with "angle domain" coefficients X[ ] ∈ C N r ×N t , as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The two representations are connected through</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">H[ ] = B N r X[ ]B * N t , 0 ≤ &lt; L, (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">B N r ∈ C N r ×N</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">H[ ] = F N a r ⊗ F N e r X[ ] F N a t ⊗ F N e t * ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">F N a r ∈ C N a r ×N a r , F N e r ∈ C N e r ×N e r , F N a t ∈ C N a t ×N a t ,</formula></div>

The (i, j)th entry of the matrix X[ ] can be interpreted as the channel gain between the jth discrete transmit angle and the ith discrete receive angle <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>According to the measurement results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the number of clusters N cl tends to be relatively few in the mmWave band as compared to lower-frequency bands. Also, the number of antenna elements used tends to be large in order to counteract the effects of path loss, which is much more severe in the mmWave band as compared to low-frequency bands. Hence, in mmWave applications, the number of channel clusters is usually much fewer than the number of scalar coefficients in To show precisely how channel sparsity manifests in the angle domain, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> provides an example of a simulated broadband mmWave channel with delay spread L = 16 and N cl = 2 multipath clusters, each consisting of 10 paths and 7.5 degrees of azimuth and elevation angular spread, as seen through 8 × 8 UPAs at both ends of the link (i.e., N t = N r = 64) and raisedcosine pulse-shape filtering with roll-off factor = 0. These parameters follow the urban macro (UMa) NLOS channel measurements at 28 GHz reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) plots the mean-squared coefficient magnitude in the antenna aperture domain, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">{H[ ]} L -1 l=0 or {X[ ]} L -1 l=0 , i.e., N cl N r N t L.</formula></div>

Fig. 2(b)</formula><p>shows that, in the angle domain, the channel energy is concentrated in two locations, each corresponding to one multipath cluster.</p><p>We emphasize that the angle-delay channel {X[ ]} L -1 =0 is jointly sparse in the angle and delay domains. This joint sparsity is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a) for a 4 × 16 MIMO channel with delay spread L = 16 (see the details in Section V). However,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">{X[ ]} L -1</formula><p>=0 is not exactly sparse, exhibiting what is known as leakage, in that none of its coefficients are expected to be exactly zero valued. The approximate nature of the sparsity is also visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>. Our approach based on GAMP will be robust to leakage effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PROPOSED CHANNEL ESTIMATION ALGORITHM</head><p>Motivated by the channel model given in the last section, we now develop an efficient algorithm to estimate the approximately sparse angle-delay domain channel from few-bit measurements and a known training sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Formulation</head><p>We assume that the training consists of a block transmission of length N p , denoted as T ∈ C N t ×N p , with a cyclic prefix of length L.

(<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>The channel-estimation problem reduces to the following: estimate the angle-delay channel coefficients x ∈ C N t N r L from the noisy quantized received signal y ∈ C N r N p ×1 under the known linear transform A ∈ C N r N p ×N t N r L . For use in the sequel, we define N y N r N p and N x N t N r L.</p><p>Because the angle-delay channel is sparse (approximately due to leakage), this channel estimation problem can be viewed as an instance of noisy quantized compressed sensing. Several methods have been proposed for noisy quantized compressed sensing, including quantized iterative hard thresholding (QIHT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, convex relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and GAMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. It has also been proposed to treat the quantization error as if it were additive white Gaussian noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. All of these methods are strongly dependent on the sparsity rate assumed for the channel, either explicitly or through the specification of a regularization term or prior distribution. In practice, though, the the channel sparsity rate, 1λ 0 in ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, is a priori unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. EM-AMP Algorithms</head><p>For channel estimation, we propose to modify two approaches that combine expectation maximization (EM) with AMP as a means of avoiding the need to specify a prior. The first is based on a combination of generalized AMP (GAMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and EM, which was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> but, to our knowledge, has never been applied to noisy few-bit quantized compressive sensing. The second is based on a combination of the recently proposed vector AMP (VAMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and EM <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. To our knowledge, neither VAMP nor EM-VAMP have been applied to noisy fewbit quantized compressive sensing. We focus on these AMP approaches because they offer nearly minimum MSE (MMSE) performance while being computationally efficient. We provide background on these methods here to make our paper selfcontained.</p><p>1) EM-GAMP: Suppose that a random vector x with IID components x i ∼ p X is linearly transformed to produce z = Ax, which then propagates through a probabilistic measurement channel p(y|z) = i p Y |Z (y i |z i ). Given knowledge of y, A, p X , and p Y |Z , we would like to compute the MMSE estimate of x. The GAMP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> approaches this computationally difficult problem through a sequence of simple scalar estimation problems and matrix multiplies.

EM-AMP Algorithms for mmWave Channel Estimation with Few-bit ADCs</head><p>To apply EM-GAMP and EM-VAMP to mmWave channelestimation with few-bit ADCs, we choose the (approximating) prior family as either a Bernoulli Gaussian-mixture (GM) or Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG), with unknown parameters θ. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> That is, the coefficients x i of x are assumed to be drawn from one of the following: <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> where λ 0 = Prob{x = 0} and {λ i }, {μ i }, {φ i } are the weights, means, and variances of the Gaussian mixture, respectively (which are all included in θ), and δ(•) is the Dirac delta distribution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Computational Issues and Training Sequence Design</head><p>In practical mmWave applications, the dimensions N y = N r N p and N x = N t N r L of the matrix A are expected to be very large. For example, in our simulations, we consider N t = N r = 64, N p = 1024, and L = 16, which yield N y = N x = 65536. Storing such an A as an explicit matrix using 4-bytes each for the real and imaginary components would require 32 GB of memory, which is inconvenient in many applications. Even when A fits in memory, the computational complexity of EM-GAMP and EM-VAMP (or any known algorithm, for that matter) will be impractical if A is treated as an explicit matrix, due to, e.g., per-iteration matrix-vector multiplies with A and A * .</p><p>For EM-GAMP, these problems are avoided if A and A * can be represented as implicit fast operators. Likewise, for EM-VAMP, U A , U * A , V * A , and V A should be fast operators. Recalling from (13) that A = C T ⊗ B N r with Fourier B N r and T-dependent C T , we see that the training sequence T will determine whether A is a fast operator. Thus, the design of the training signal plays a vital role in the practical implementability of mmWave channel estimation.</p><p>There are, in fact, three considerations for the design of the training signal T:</p><p>1) For GAMP to be computationally efficient, A and A * should be fast operators, and for VAMP to be computationally efficient, U A , U * A , V * A , V A should be. 2) For GAMP to converge to a good solution, A should be sufficiently dense and have sufficiently low peak-toaverage squared-singular-value ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. 3) To improve the efficiency of the power amplifier at the transmitter, the elements of T should have low peak-toaverage power ratio (PAPR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Training Structure:</head><p>To satisfy these three considerations, we propose to structure T ∈ C N t ×N p as follows. Denote the first row of T, i.e., the signal sent by the first transmit antenna, as t T [t [0] , . . . , t [N p -1]]. We fix N p at an integer multiple of N t L and construct T such that its nth row (for n ≥ 0) is the nL-place circular shift of t T . That is, each antenna sends a circularly shifted version of the signal transmitted by the first antenna. The elements of T (for m ≥ 0) are then</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">[T] n,m = t[ m -nL N p ],<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where • N p is the modulo-N p remainder. With the construction in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, TJ 0 from (10) contains the {0, L, 2L, ..., (N t -1)L} shifts of t. Likewise, TJ 1 contains the {1, L + 1, 2L + 1, ..., (N t -1)L + 1} shifts of t, and TJ L -1 contains the {L -1, 2L -1, 3L -1, ..., N t L -1} right shifts of t. Altogether, the rows of T in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> will consist of the first N t L circular shifts of the sequence t. We can thus re-order the rows in T to make it a Toeplitz matrix, which we will denote by T in the sequel.</p><p>2) Fast Implementation of A x and A * s: Using the structure above, A x and A * s can be efficiently computed.

Therefore, each of the N r columns of the multiplication B * N t ⊗ I L X in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">26</ref>) can be accomplished by N e t -point and N a t -point FFTs. 3 The result of that multiplication is then leftmultiplied by T T , which can be performed via fast convolution using an N p -point FFT (since T T contains the first N t L columns of an N p × N p circulant matrix). Finally, the left-multiplication by B N r can be performed, as in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">28</ref>), using N a r -point and N e rpoint FFTs. In summary, there are a total of N r L FFTs of length N p , one inverse-FFT of length N p , N a t N r FFTs of length N e t , N e t N r FFTs of length N a t , N a r N p FFTs of length N e r , and N e r N p FFTs of length N a r .

Since V A and U A have fast implementations, they are good for VAMP.</p><p>An additional benefit of choosing the ZC sequence for t is its constant-modulus property, which ensures that T has a low peak-to-average power ratio PAPR.

However, it is possible in practice to estimate the channel norm from the average signal power received by the antenna circuit before quantization, for example, the AGC circuit.</p><p>Let us use z (C T ⊗ B N r )x + w to denote the noisy unquantized signal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>We first provide an illustrative example to visualize the behavior of the proposed channel estimation procedure. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we show the result of estimating a broadband N r × N t = 4 × 16 MIMO channel. The transmitter was equipped with a 4 × 4 UPA and the receiver with a 2 × 2 UPA. The channel had N cl = 2 clusters and delay spread of at most L = 16 samples. 4-bit ADCs and raised-cosine pulse-shaping with roll-off factor zero was used. The training length was shifted-ZC of length N p = 512. The true magnitudes of the angle-delay channel are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a) while the estimated magnitudes are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref>. As seen in the figure, the EM-GM-VAMP algorithm can estimate the channel X quite accurately: the two clusters can be easily identified in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b</ref>) and the estimation error in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>) is small. The joint angle-delay sparsity of the mmWave channel is visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>, as is the approximate nature of the sparsity.</p><p>In the following subsections, we consider a more practical scenario, where the transmitter and receiver are both equipped with 8 × 8 UPAs. We consider a channel with 4 clusters, each of 10 paths, with azimuth and elevation angular spread of 7.5 degrees. The delay spread was at most 16 samples. These numbers were chosen according to the urban macro (UMa) NLOS channel measurement results at 28 GHz, as given in the white paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The results we report are the average of 100 different channel realizations. The channel was normalized so  </p><formula xml:id="formula_81">E H[ ] 2 F = E x 2 = N t N r .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Choice of Training Matrix</head><p>We first investigate the performance of various choices of training matrix T. In addition to the circularly-shifted-ZC design proposed in Section IV-D, we try T constructed from Golay complementary sequences, IID random Gaussian entries, and IID random QPSK entries. The channel estimation NMSEs of EM-GM-VAMP with these T are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_82">NMSE( x) E x -x 2 x 2 , (<label>47</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_83">)</formula><p>for x normalized according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. As seen in the figure, the NMSEs of the four training designs are very close. However, the Golay sequence, random QPSK, and ZC sequences are preferred because of their constant modulus property, which leads to low PAPR. Furthermore, the ZC-based design allows efficient implementation of the matrix-vector multiplications in VAMP, as discussed in Section IV-D.</p><p>The runtime of the matrix-vector multiplications A x and A * s and their fast implementations (using MATLAB R2016a on a standard desktop computer) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. In the baseline implementation, A x was computed via vec(B N r XC) to avoid generating and storing the high-dimensional matrix A, and the computation of A * s was done similarly. The fast implementation was described in Section IV-D. As seen in the figure, the fast implementation consumes much less time than the baseline implementation. Much faster runtimes would be possible if the FFTs were implemented in hardware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Algorithm Complexity</head><p>We now investigate the computational complexity of the various algorithms under test. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows NMSE versus iteration for EM-GAMP, EM-VAMP, and QIHT. The figure shows the VAMP algorithms converging in ≈ 3 iterations, the GAMP  To further investigate algorithm complexity, we plot NMSE versus runtime in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. We controlled the runtime of the QIHT, EM-GAMP and EM-VAMP algorithms by varying the number of iterations. The other three (non-iterative) algorithms are each represented by a single point on the plot. The figure shows that EM-GM-VAMP gives the best NMSE-complexity tradeoff for runtimes &gt; 0.4 s, while EM-BG-VAMP gives the best trade-off for runtimes between 0.17 s and 0.4 s. The relatively long time required to complete the first iteration of EM-VAMP is likely due to the object-oriented MATLAB implementation <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref>and would likely not be an issue in a dedicated implementation. Although QIHT can complete a few of its iterations before the first EM-BG-VAMP iteration, the corresponding estimates are probably not useful because their NMSE is so poor. The figure also shows that the NMSE-complexity frontier of EM-BG-GAMP is not too far away from that of EM-GM-VAMP, and Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.

Finally, the figure shows that the LS and ALMMSE algorithms are far from optimal.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> summarizes the complexity scalings of the algorithms under test. The complexities of the LS and ALMMSE approaches are dominated by the inversion of an N p × N p matrix, where N p is an integer multiple of N t L, and so their complexities scale as O(N t 3 L 3 ). The complexities of the EM-AMP, SPGL1, and QIHT algorithms are dominated by the matrix-vector multiplications with A and A * . Matrix A is of size N x × N y , where N x = N t N r L and N y = N r N p . Since N p is an integer multiple of N t L, both N x and N y are O(N t N r L). And since we use an FFT-like algorithm to implement the matrix-vector multiplies with A and A * , the complexity order of EM-AMP, SPGL1, and QIHT scales as O N t N r L log(N t N r L) . In our simulations, N t and N r are of a similar size, and so we conclude that the complexity scaling of EM-AMP, SPGL1, and QIHT is much lower than that of LS and ALMMSE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Effect of SNR, ADC Resolution, and Training Length</head><p>We now investigate estimation performance versus SNR, ADC resolution, and training length. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the NMSE of the VAMP algorithms versus SNR. The figure shows that, at low SNR (&lt; 0 dB), the performance gap between 1-bit ADC and infinite-bit ADC is only 2 dB. But as the SNR increases, the gap between 1-bit and infinite-bit performance grows. Thus, higher resolution ADCs provide significant benefits only at higher SNRs. To reduce power consumption and cost, few-bit ADCs should be deployed when the SNR is low.  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows NMSE versus ADC resolution for all algorithms under test when SNR = 10 dB. The figure shows that NMSE decreases with ADC resolution for all algorithms, but not in a uniform way. For example, SPGL1 and QIHT perform similarly with 1 and 2 bits of resolution, but SPGL1 benefits from higher ADC resolution while QIHT does not. In fact, SPGL1 performs as good as EM-BG-GAMP/VAMP for &gt; 7 bits, but significantly worse with few bits, because it does not leverage the structure of the quantization error. The figure also shows that, when the EM-GAMP/VAMP are used, there is little benefit in increasing the ADC resolution above 4 bits at this SNR. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> shows the NMSE of the VAMP algorithms versus training length N p . We note that, as the training length varies from 1024 to 5120, the sampling rate relative to Nyquist, i.e., </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Mutual Information and Achievable Rate Bounds</head><p>In this section, we investigate the effect of channel-estimation accuracy on mutual information and achievable rate, which are important metrics for communication systems. Our methodology is inspired by that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>We consider OFDM transmission with N b subcarriers. For the kth subcarrier, denote the true frequency-domain MIMO channel by G k ∈ C N r ×N t , the transmitted signal by s k , and the variance-σ 2 w f additive Gaussian noise by w k .

The expectation in (51) is taken over {G k } N b k =1 and the effective noise { w k } N b k =1 . (Because the channel estimates depend on G k and w k , so do u km and v km .)

The figure shows that using EM-GAMP/VAMP channel estimates results in a relatively small loss in mutual information compared to perfect CSI. It also shows that, at low SNR, the mutual information loss of few-bit ADC relative to infinite-bit ADC is small. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> plots the mutual information lower bound (51) versus ADC resolution for all the channel-estimation algorithms under test at SNR = 10 dB. The figure shows that the EM-GM-GAMP/VAMP algorithms achieve the highest mutual information, with EM-BG-GAMP/VAMP close behind at low ADC resolutions. The figure also shows that the mutual information saturates when the ADC resolution is &gt; 5 bits at this SNR.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref> shows the achievable rate lower bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref> versus training length N p for the EM-VAMP algorithms. For this experiment, the channel coherence time was assumed to be N co = 10240 symbols. The figure shows that, under these conditions,  the optimal training length is N p = 1536 when the ADC has 1 or 2 bits of resolution. When the ADC resolution increases to 3 or 4 bits, a shorter training length (e.g., N p = 1024) is preferred because the cost of each training symbol (in bps/Hz) is larger.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref> shows the achievable rate lower bound (52) versus the training length N p for all the channel estimation algorithms under test. For this experiment, the ADC has 2-bit resolution. The EM-GM-GAMP and EM-GM-VAMP algorithms provide highest achievable rate and their optimal training length is 1536. Note that, for the LS and ALMMSE algorithms, the optimal training length is 2048, which is longer than the other algorithms.</p><p>According to Figs. 13 and 14, the training overhead is around 10%-20% when the channel coherence length is 10240. The overhead percentage is thus comparable to that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> for sub-6 GHz massive MIMO channel estimation with a flat fading channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Our channel, however, is frequency-selective fading and thus more difficult to estimate. In addition, a training duration of 1024-2048 symbols seems appropriate for mmWave broadband communication. Comparing to the 802.11ad standard, for example, if 8 × 8 UPA arrays are used with the standard DFT-based codebook, then 128 pilot frames, each consisting of 26 bytes, would be transmitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The total training length in 802.11ad is thus much longer than what we propose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we propose a methodology for estimation of broadband mmWave MIMO channels at receivers with few-bit ADCs. The broadband mmWave MIMO channel is sparse in both angle and delay domains, making it natural to apply compressed sensing techniques. We propose to use computationally efficient AMP algorithms (i.e., EM-GAMP and EM-VAMP) that accurately estimate the channel in the absence of prior information about its distribution (e.g., sparsity), and we enhance those methods with separate channel-norm estimation. We also design a training scheme, based on shifted ZC sequences, that leads to accurate and computationally efficient estimation with minimal transmitter PAPR. Finally, we report the results of an extensive simulation study that tests various algorithms, ADC precisions, training sequences, training lengths, SNRs, and runtime limits. Our simulations investigated channel-estimation MSE as well as mutual information and achievable rate bounds.</p><p>From the results of our study, we draw several conclusions. First, it is important to exploit the available joint angle-delay domain sparsity in channel estimation. Second, the ADC precision should be chosen based on the SNR; at low SNR, the use of few-bit ADCs results in very small loss (in MSE or achievable rate) compared to infinite-bit ADCs. Third, the training length should be chosen based on the ADC precision; at lower ADC precision, the achievable rate is maximized by a longer training sequence.</p><p>In this paper, the correlation among angle-delay channel coefficients was neglected. A possible direction to improve the channel estimation accuracy is to exploit this correlation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>tr(A), A T , A * and ||A|| F represent the trace, transpose, conjugate transpose and Frobenius norm of a matrix A.
