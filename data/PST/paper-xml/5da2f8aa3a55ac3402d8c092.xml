<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Single image super-resolution (SISR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> has recently received much attention. In general, the purpose of SISR is to produce a visually high-resolution (HR) output from its low-resolution (LR) input. However, this inverse problem is ill-posed since multiple HR solutions can map to any LR input. Therefore, a great number of SR methods have been proposed, ranging from early interpolation-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> and model-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, to recent learning-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>.</p><p>The early developed interpolated-based methods (e.g., bilinear and bicubic methods) are simple and efficient but limited in applications. For more flexible SR methods, more advanced model-based methods are proposed by exploiting powerful image priors, such as non-local similarity prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> and sparsity prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Although such model-based methods are flexible to produce relative high-quality HR images, they still suffer from some drawbacks: (1) such methods often involve a time-consuming optimization process; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(2)</ref> the performance may degrade quickly when image statistics are biased from the image prior.</p><p>Deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved unprecedented success in various problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>. The powerful feature representation and end-to-end training paradigm of CNN makes it a promising approach to SISR. In the last several years, a flurry of CNN-based SISR methods have been proposed to learn a mapping function from an interpolated or LR input to its corresponding HR output. By fully exploiting the image statics inherent in training datasets, CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art results in SISR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>. Although considerable progress has been achieved in image SR, existing CNNbased SR models are still faced with some limitations: (1) most of CNN-based SR methods do not make full use of the information from the original LR images, thereby resulting in relatively-low performance; (2) most existing CNNbased SR models focus mainly on designing a deeper or wider network to learn more discriminative high-level features, while rarely exploiting the inherent feature correlations in intermediate layers, thus hindering the representational ability of CNNs.</p><p>To address these problems, we propose a deep secondorder attention network (SAN) for more powerful feature expression and feature correlation learning.

Our method obtains better visual quality and recovers more image details compared with other state-of-the-art SR methods propose a second-order channel attention (SOCA) mechanism for better feature correlation learning. Our SOCA adaptively learns feature inter-dependencies by exploiting second-order feature statistics instead of first-order ones. Such SOCA mechnism makes our network focus on more informative feature and improve discriminative learning ability. Moreover, a non-locally enhanced residual group (NLRG) structure is presented to further incorporates nonlocal operations to capture long-distance spatial contextual information. By stacking the local-source residual attention groups (LSRAG) structure, we can exploit the information from the LR images and allow the abundant low-frequency information to be bypassed. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, our method obtains better visual quality and recovers more image details compared with other state-of-the-art SR methods. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are listed as follows:</p><p>• We propose a deep second-order attention network (SAN) for accurate image SR. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitive and visual quality.</p><p>• We propose second-order channel attention (SOCA) mechanism to adaptively rescale features by considering feature statistics higher than first-order. Such SOCA mechanism allows our network to focus on more informative features and enhance discriminative learning ability. Besides, we also utilize an iterative method for covariance normalization to speed up the training of our network.</p><p>• We propose non-locally enhanced residual group (NLRG) structure to build a deep network, which further incorporates non-local operations to capture spatial contextual information, and share-source residual group structure to learn deep features. Besides, the share-source residual group structure through sharesource skip connections could allow more abundant information from the LR input to be bypassed and ease the training of the deep network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>During the past decade, a plenty of image SISR methods have been proposed in the computer vision community, including interpolation-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, model-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, and CNN-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>. Due to space limitation, we here briefly review works related to CNN-based SR methods and attention mechanism, which is close to our method. CNN-based SR models. Recently, CNN-based methods have been extensively studied in image SR, due to their strong nonlinear representational power. Generally, such methods cast SR as an image-to-image regression problem, and learn an end-to-end mapping from LR to HR directly. Most existing CNN-based methods mainly focus on designing a deeper or wider network structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>. For example, Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[ 2]</ref> first introduced a shallow three-layer convolutional network (SRCNN) for image SR, which achieves impressive performance. Later, Kim et al. designed deeper VDSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and DRCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> with more than 16 layers based on residual learning. To further improve the performance, Lim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> proposed a very deep and wide network EDSR by stacking modified residual blocks. The significant performance gain indicates the depth of representation plays a key role in image SR. Other recent works like MemNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> and RDN <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, are based on dense blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> to form deep networks and focus on utilizing all the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. In addition to focusing on increasing the depth of the network, some other networks, such as NLRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and RCAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, improve the performance by considering feature correlations in spatial or channel dimension. Attention mechanism. Attention in human perception generally means that human visual systems adaptively process visual information and focus on salient areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. In recent years, several trials have embeded attention processing to improve the performance of CNNs for various tasks, such as image and video classification tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[ 33]</ref> proposed non-local neural network to incorporate non-local operations for spatial attention in video classification. On the contrary, Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[ 9]</ref> proposed SENet to exploit channel-wise relationships to achieve significant performance gain for image classification.</p><p>Recently, SENet was introduced to deep CNNs to further improve SR performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. However, SENet only explores first-order statistics (e.g., global average pooling), while ignoring the statistics higher than first-order, thus hindering the discriminative ability of the network. In im-age SR, features with more high-frequency information are more informative for HR reconstruction. To this end, we propose a deep second-order attention network (SAN) by exploring second-order statistics of features.</p><p>3. Second-order Attention Network (SAN)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Network Framework</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, our SAN mainly consists of four parts: shallow feature extraction, non-locally enhanced residual group (NLRG) based deep feature extraction, upscale module, and reconstruction part. Given I LR and I SR as the input and output of SAN. As explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>, we apply only one convolutional layer to extract the shallow feature F 0 from the LR input</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F 0 = H SF (I LR ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where H SF (•) stands for convolution operation. Then the extracted shallow feature F 0 is used for NLRG based deep feature extraction, which thus produces the deep feature as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F DF = H NLRG (F 0 ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where H NLRG represents the NLRG based deep feature extraction module, which consists of several non-local modules to enlarge receptive field and G local-source residual attention group (LSRAG) modules (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). So our proposed NLRG obtains very deep depth and thus provides very large receptive field size. Then the extracted deep feature F DF is upscaled via the upscale module via</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F ↑ = H ↑ (F DF ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where H ↑ (•) and F ↑ are a upscale module and upscaled feature respectively. There are some choices to act as upscale part, such as transposed convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, ESPCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>The way of embedding upscaling feature in the last few layers obtains a good trade off between computational burden and performance, and thus is preferable to be used in recent CNN-based SR models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. The upscaled feature is then mapped into SR image via one convolution layer</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I SR = H R (F ↑ )=H SAN (I LR ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where H R (•), H ↑ (•) and H SAN are the reconstruction layer, upscale layer and the function of SAN, respectively. Then SAN will be optimized with a certain loss function. Some loss functions have been widely used, such as L 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>, L 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>, perceptual losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>. To verify the effectiveness of our SAN, we adopt the same loss functions as previous works (e.g., L 1 loss function). Given a training set with N LR images and their HR counterparts denoted by {I i LR , I i HR } N i=1 , the goal of training SAN is to optimize the L 1 loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L(Θ) = 1 N N i=1 ||H SAN (I i LR ) − I i HR || 1 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where Θ denotes the parameter set of SAN. The loss function is optimized by stochastic gradient descent algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Non-locally Enhanced Residual Group (NLRG)</head><p>We now show our non-locally enhanced residual group (NLRG) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), which consists of several region-level non-local (RL-NL) modules and one share-source residual group (SSRG) structure. The RL-NL exploits the abundant structure cues in LR features and the self-similarities in HR nature scenes. The SSRG is composed of G local-source residual attention groups (LSRAG) with share-source skip connections (SSC). Each LSRAG further contains M simplified residual blocks with local-source skip connection, followed by a second-order channel attention (SOCA) module to exploit feature interdependencies.</p><p>It has been verified that stacking residual blocks is helpful to form a deep CNN in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. However, very deep network built in such way would suffer from training difficulty and performance bottleneck due to the problem of gradient vanishing and exploding in deep network. Inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, we propose local-source residual attention group (LSRAG) as the fundamental unit. It is known that simply stacking repeated LSRAGs would fail to obtain better performance. To address this issue, the share-source skip connection (SSC) is introduced in NLRG to not only facilitate the training of our deep network, but also to bypass abundant low-frequency information from LR images. Then a LSRAG in the g-th group is represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F g = W SSC F 0 + H g (F g−1 ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where W SSC denotes the weight to the convolution layer, and is initialized as 0, and then gradually learns to assign more weight to the shallow feature. The bias term is omitted for simplicity. H g (•) is the function of the g-th LSRAG. F g , F g−1 denote the input and output of the g-th LSRAG. The deep feature is then obtained as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">F DF = W SSC F 0 + F G .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Such SSRG structure can not only ease the flow of information across LSRAGs, but also make it possible to train very deep CNN for image SR with high performance.</p><p>Region-level non-local module (RL-NL). The proposed NLRG also exploits the abundant structure cues in LR features and the self-similarities in HR nature scenes by RL-NL modules plugged before and after the SSRG. The nonlocal neural network <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> is proposed to capture the computation of long-range dependencies throughout the entire image for high-level tasks. However, traditional globallevel non-local operations may be limited for some reasons: 1) global-level non-local operations require unacceptable computational burden, especially when the size of feature is large; 2) it is empirically shown that non-local operations at a proper neighborhood size are preferable for low-level tasks (e.g., image super-resolution) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Thus for feature with higher spatial resolution or degradation, it is natural to perform region-level non-local operations. For such reasons, we divide the feature map into a grid of regions (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, the k × k RL-NL indicates the input feature is first divided into a grid of k 2 blocks with the same size.), each of which is then processed by the subsequent layers.</p><p>After non-local operations, the feature representation is non-locally enhanced before fedding into the subsequent layers via exploiting the spatial correlations of features.</p><p>Local-source residual attention group (LSRAG). Due to our share-source skip connections, the abundant lowfrequency information can be bypassed. To go a further step to residual learning, we stack M simplified residual blocks to form a basic LSRAG. The m-th residual block (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>)intheg-th LSRAG can be represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F g,m = H g,m (F g,m−1 ),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where H g,m (•) denotes the function of m-th residual block in g-th LSRAG, and F g,m−1 , F g,m are the corresponding input and output. To make our network focus on more informative features, a local-source skip connection is used to produce the block output via</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F g = W g F g−1 + F g,M ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where W g is the corresponding weight. Such local-source and share-source skip connections allow more abundant low-frequency information to be bypassed during training.</p><p>For more discriminative representations, we propose SOCA mechnism embedded at the tail of each LSRAG. Our SOCA mechnism learns to adaptively rescale channel-wise features by considering second-order statistics of features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Second-order Channel Attention (SOCA)</head><p>Most previous CNN-based SR models do not consider the feature interdependencies. To utilize such information, SENet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> was introduced in CNNs to rescale the channelwise features for image SR. However, SENet only exploits first-order statistics of features by global average pooling, while ignoring statistics higher than first-order, thus hindering the discriminative ability of the network. On the other hand, recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref> have shown that second-order statistics in deep CNNs are more helpful for more discriminative representations than first-order ones.</p><p>Inspired by the above observations, we propose a second-order channel attention (SOCA) module to learn feature interdependencies by considiering second-order statistics of features. Now we will describe how to exploit such second-order information next.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Covariance normalization. Given a H × W × C feature map F =[ f 1 , ••• , f C ]</formula><p>with C feature maps with size of H × W . We reshape the feature map to a feature matrix X with s = WH features of C-dimension. Then the sample covariance matrix can be computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Σ = X ĪX T ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where Ī = 1 s (I − 1 s 1), I and 1 are the s × s identity matrix and matrix of all ones, respectively.</p><p>It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref> that covariance normalization plays a critical role for more discriminative representations. For this reason, we first perform covariance normalization for the obtained covariance matrix Σ, which is symmetric positive semi-definite and thus has eigenvalue decomposition (EIG) as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Σ = UΛU T , (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where U is an orthogonal matrix and Λ = diag(λ 1 , ••• ,λ C ) is diagonal matrix with eigenvalues in non-increasing order. Then convariance normalization can be converted to the power of eigenvalues:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Ŷ = Σ α = UΛ α U T , (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>where α is a positive real number, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Λ α = diag(λ α 1 , ••• ,λ α C ). When α =1</formula><p>, there is no normalization; when α&lt;1, it nonlinearly shrinks the eigenvalues larger than 1.0 and streches those less than 1.0. As explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, α =1/2 works well for more discriminative representations. Thus, we set α =1/2 in the following. Channel attention. The normalized covariance matrix characterizes the correlations of channel-wise features. We then take such normalized covariance matrix as a channel descriptor by global covariance pooling. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, let Ŷ =[ y 1 , ••• , y C ], the channel-wise statistics z ∈ R C×1 can be obtained by shrinking Ŷ. Then the c-th dimension of z is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">z c = H GCP (y c )= 1 C C i y c (i),<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where H GCP (•) denotes the global covariance pooling function. Compared with the commonly used first-order pooling (e.g., global average pooling), our global covariance pooling explores the feature distribution and captures the feature statistics higher than first-order for more discriminative representations.</p><p>To fully exploit feature interdependencies from the aggregated information by global covariance pooling, we apply a gating mechanism. As explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, the simple sigmoid function can serve as a proper gating function</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">w = f (W U δ(W D z)),<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where W D and W U are the weight set of convolution layer, which set channel dimension of features to C/r and C, respectively. f (•) and δ(•) are the function of sigmoid and RELU. Finally, we obtain the channel attention map w to rescale the input</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">fc = w c • f c ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where w c and f c denote the scaling factor and feature map in the c-th channel. With such channel attention, the residual component in the LSRAG is rescaled adaptively. As is shown above, covariance normalization plays a vital role in our SOCA. However, such covariance normalization relies heavily on eigenvalue decoomposition, which is not well supported on GPU platform, thus leading to inefficient training. To solve this issue, as explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, we also apply a fast matrix normalization method based on Newton-Schulz iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. In the next section, we briefly describe the covariance normalization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Covariance Normalization Acceleration</head><p>To date, fast implementation of EIG on GPU is still an open problem. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, we utilize Newton-Schulz iteration to speed up the computation of covariance normalization.

Such iterative operation is suitable for parallel implementation on GPU. In practice, one can achieve approximate solution with few iterations, e.g., no more than 5 iterations in our method. Since Newton-Schulz iteration only converges locally, to guarantee the convergence, we pre-normalize Σ first via</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Σ = 1 tr(Σ) Σ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where tr(Σ)= C i λ i denotes the trace of Σ. In such case, it can be inferred that the ||Σ − I|| 2 equals to the largest singular value of (Σ − I), i.e., 1 − λi i λi) less than 1, which thus satisfies the convergence condition.</p><p>After Newton-Schulz iteration, we apply a postcompensation procedure to compensate the data magnitude caused by pre-normalization, thus producing the final normalized covariance matrix Ŷ = tr(Σ)Y N .</p><p>(18)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Implementations</head><p>We set LSRAG number as G =2 0in the SSRG structure, and embed RL-NL modules (k =2 ) at the head and tail of SSRG. In each LSRAG, we use m =1 0residual blocks plus single SOCA module at the tail. In SOCA module, we use 1 × 1 convolution filter with reduction ratio r =1 6 . For other convolution filter outside SOCA, the size and number of filter are set as 3 × 3 and C =6 4 , respectively. For upscale part H ↑ (•), we follow the works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref> and apply ESPCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> to upscale the deep features, followed by one final convolution layer with three filters to produce color images (RGB channels).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Discussions</head><p>Difference to Non-local RNN (NLRN). NLRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> introduces non-local operations to capture long-distance spatial contextual information in image restoration. There are some differences between NLRN and our SAN. First, NLRN embeds non-local operations in a recurrent neural network (RNN) for image restoration, while our SAN incorporates non-local operations in deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for image SR. Second, NLRN only considers spatial feature correlations between each location and its neighborhood, but ignores the channelwise feature correlations. While our SAN mainly focuses on learning such channel-wise feature correlations with second-order statistics of features for more powerful representational ability. Difference to Residual Dense Network (RDN). We summarize the main differences between RDN <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> and our SAN. The first one is the design of basic block. RDN mainly combines dense blocks with local feature fusion by using local residual learning, while our SAN is built on the basis of residual blocks. The second one is the way of enhancing discriminative ability of the network. Channel attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref> has been shown to be effective for better discriminative representations. However, RDN does not consider such information, but pays attention to exploiting the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. On the contrary, our SAN heavily relies on channel attention for better discriminative representations. Thus, we propose second-order channel attention (SOCA) mechanism to effectively learn channel-wise feature interdependencies. Difference to Residual Channel Attention Network (RCAN). Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> proposed a residual in residual structure to form a very deep network. RCAN is close to our SAN, and the main differences lie in the following aspects. First, RCAN consists of several residual groups with long skip connections. While, SAN stacks repeated residual groups through share-source skip connections, which allows more abundant low-frequency information to be bypassed. Second, RCAN can only exploit the contextual information in a local receptive field, but is unable to exploit the information outside of the local region. While SAN can alleviate this problem by incorporating non-local operations to not only capture long-distance spatial contextual information, but enlarge the receptive field. Third, to enhance the discriminative ability of the network, RCAN only considers channel attention based first-order feature statistics by global average pooling. While our SAN learns channel attention based on second-order feature statistics.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to investigate the effect of such attention based on second-order feature statistics for image SR. More analysis about the effect of such attention mechanism are shown next.</p></div>

For testing, we adopt 5 standard benchmark datasets: Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100 and Manga109, each of which has different characteristics. We carry out experiments with Bicubic (BI) and Blur-downscale (BD) degradation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. All the SR results are evaluated by PSNR and SSIM metrics on Y channel of transformed YCbCr space.</p><p>During training, we augment the training images by randomly rotating 90 • , 180 • , 270 • and horizontally flipping. In each min-batch, 8 LR color patches with size 48 × 48 are provided as inputs. Our model is trained by ADAM optimizor with β 1 =0 .9,β 2 =0 .99, and ε =1 0 −8 . The learning rate is initialized as 10 −4 and then reduced to half every 200 epochs. Our proposed SAN has been implemented on the Pytorch framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> on an Nvidia 1080Ti GPU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Ablation Study</head><p>As discussed in Section 3, our SAN contains two main components including non-locally enhanced residual group (NLRG) and second-order channel attention (SOCA). Non-locally Enhanced Residual Group (NLRG). To verify the effectiveness of different modules, we compare NLRG with its variants trained and tested on Set5 dataset. The specific performance is listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Base refers to a very basic baseline which only contains the convolution layers with 20 LSRAGs and 10 residual blocks in each LSRAG, thus resulting in deep network with over 400 convolution layers. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, we also add long and short skip connections in Base model. From Table 1 we can see that Base reaches PSNR=32.00 dB on Set5 (×4). Results from R a to R e verify the effectiveness of individual module, since the module used alone improves the performance over Base model. Specifically, R a and R b that add a single RL-NL in shallow (before SSRG) or deep layers (after SSRG) obtain similar SR results and outperform Base, which verifies the effectiveness of RL-NL. When share-source skip connection (SSC) is added alone (R c ), the performance can be improved from 32.00 dB to 32.07 dB. The main reason lies in that share-source skip connections allows more abundant low-frequency information from the LR images to be bypassed. When both of R a and R b are used (leading to R f ), the performance can be further improved. It is found more RL-NL modules cannot obtain much better performance than R f in our method, and thus we apply R f in our method to balance the performance and efficiency. Second-order channel attention (SOCA). We also show the effect of our SOCA from the results of R d ,R e ,R h and R i . Specifically, R d means that channel attention is based on first-order feature statistics by global average pooling, thus leading to first-order channel attention (FOCA). R e means that channel attention is based on second-order feature statistics, thus leading to our second-order channel attention (SOCA). It can be found that both of R d and R e obtain better performance than methods of R a to R c with-  </p></div>

Compared with other methods, our SAN+ performs the best results on all the datasets on various scaling factors.

It is known that textures are highorder patterns and have more complex statistic characteristics, while edges are first-order patterns that can be extracted by first-order gradient operators. Thus our SOCA based on second-order feature statistics works better on images with more high-order information (e.g., textures).</p><p>Visual quality.

Take "img 076" for example, most compared methods output heavy blurring artifacts. The early developed bicubic, SRCNN, FSRCNN and LapSRN even lose the main structure.
