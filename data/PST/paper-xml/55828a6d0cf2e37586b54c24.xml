<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Wireless networks composed of thousands of highly integrated sensor nodes hold the promise of sensing that is far superior, in terms of quality, robustness, cost and autonomous operation, to that offered by using a few, ultra high precision macro-sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Such sensor networks are expected to find widespread use in a variety of applications including remote climate monitoring and seismic, acoustic, medical and intelligence data-gathering. Due to their compact form factors, wireless sensor nodes are severely energy constrained. Furthermore, replacing batteries on up to thousands of nodes in possibly harsh terrain is infeasible. Hence, it is well accepted that the key challenge in unlocking the potential of such networks is maximizing their post-deployment active lifetime.</p><p>Effort aimed at increasing the lifetime of sensor networks is two pronged. First, the node and the physical link must be made as energy efficient as possible. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for some representative work. Second, the collaborative strategy i.e. the strategy that governs how nodes cooperate to perform the sensing operation, must be energy efficient as well. Work in this area has dealt with different aspects of the problem. Work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> highlighted the need for metrics other than those used in traditional networks when energy is an issue. Various energyaware routing heuristics were also proposed in this paper. The first demonstration of near-optimal maximum lifetime routing in ad-hoc networks was <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Minimum-energy, but infinite lifetime ad-hoc networks were the subject of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> energy-aware heuristics were used to guide protocol design in networks that support certain types of collaboration.</p><p>In this paper, our main objective is not to propose a new collaborative protocol that leads to greater network lifetime. Rather, it is to bound the network lifetime that any collaborative protocol can ever hope to achieve. In previous work we computed such bounds for basic data gathering scenarios using</p><p>The authors are with the Department of EECS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA 02139.

While this approach results in easy-to-use, closed form expressions for lifetime bounds, it does not factor in network topology and does not accommodate aggregation of data streams. In this paper, we propose a new approach which, in principle, permits derivation of bounds for networks with arbitrarily complex capabilities, although the computational costs of such derivations may be prohibitive. We then show that for several practically useful scenarios, including sensor networks with a specified topology that allow aggregation, this approach in fact leads to polynomial time bound derivation.</p><p>In the next section we discuss the operation of sensor networks in greater detail, define lifetime and discuss node energy models. We introduce the role assignment framework in section 3 and use it to derive bounds for a variety of data gathering scenarios. This is followed by some illustrations of the new technique. We end with a summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Basic operation</head><p>The goal of a sensor network is to gather information from a specified region of observation (R) and relay it to an energyunconstrained basestation (B) (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This information originates due to one or more sources located in R. At any given instant, nodes in a sensor network can be classified as live or dead depending on whether they have any energy left or not. By assuming different roles, live nodes collaborate to ensure that whenever a source resides in R, it is sensed using a minimum specified number of sensors (k) and the resultant data relayed to B. In the collaborative model we assume, a role is composed of one or more of the following sub-roles:</p><p>• Sensor: The node observes the source via a sensor, digitizes this information, post-processes it and produces data which must now be relayed to the basestation. Hence the sensor sub-role is really a "sense and transmit" sub-role and is qualified by a single attribute -the node that receives the raw sensor data or simply the destination node. • Relay: The node simply forwards the received data onward without any processing. A relay sub-role is qualified by two attributes -the source and destination nodes of the data being relayed. • Aggregator: The node receives two or more raw data streams and then aggregates them into a single stream. While the actual mechanism is application dependent, the underlying motivation is the same -the total volume of data to be routed to the basestation is reduced and the quality of the aggregated stream is higher than that of the raw In this example we require that at-least two nodes sense the source. When the source is at S 0 , nodes 1 and 7 assume the role of sensors and nodes 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 form the relay path for data from node 1 while nodes 7 → 8 → 9 → 5 → 6 form the relay path for data from node 7. Data might be aggregated into one stream at node 5. This is not the only feasible role assignment that allows the source to be sensed. For instance, node 10 could act as the second sensor instead of node 7 and 10 → 7 → 8 → 4 → 5 → 6 could form the corresponding relay path. Also, node 6 might aggregate the data instead of node 5 etc. Finally, note how the sensor, aggregator and relay roles must change as the source moves from S 0 to S 1 . At every instant, the following decisions must be made: which sensor(s) to use, whether to aggregate or not, where to aggregate, what fraction to aggregate, how to route data to the aggregator, how to route aggregated data and how to account for changes in source location. This paper demonstrates a computationally feasible methodology to upper bound the lifetime that any collaborative protocol that makes these decisions can ever hope to achieve.</p><p>streams from which it is derived <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Consider a sensor network that detects tank intrusion in a specified region. Several nodes might declare a tank present with varying levels of confidence. All these "tank detected" messages may be routed to a node that aggregates them into a single message with a revised confidence measure. Aggregation here corresponds to data-fusion. As another example, consider a sensor network collecting acoustic data. When an acoustic event occurs, sensors record it with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this case aggregation might entail beamforming these different streams to obtain a single aggregated stream with enhanced SNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We classify aggregation into non-hierarchical and hierarchical varieties. In the former, all raw streams are aggregated at a single node, while the latter version allows aggregation of partially aggregated streams. The aggregation sub-role is qualified by two attributes -the set of nodes transmitting raw data to be aggregated and the destination node receiving the aggregated stream. Note that while nodes change their roles with time, we assume that their locations are fixed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Defining Lifetime</head><p>A data gathering network can be in one of the following states:</p><p>1) Source present in region but network not sensing. This is termed "loss of coverage". 2) Source present and network sensing while satisfying user dictated constraints. This state is termed "active". 3) Source present and network sensing but not satisfying user dictated constraints. This state is termed "quality failure". 4) No source present in the region. In non-mission-critical applications, a reasonable definition of lifetime is the cumulative active time of the network (i.e. whenever the network is active its lifetime clock is ticking, otherwise not). In mission-critical applications, lifetime is defined as the cumulative active time of the network until the first loss of coverage or quality failure. In this paper, we adopt this latter definition of lifetime. Note that active lifetime is different from physical lifetime. For instance, a sensor network deployed to detect tank intrusion can "live on" forever (ignoring battery degradation, leakage etc.) in the absence of activity. But it can only detect, say, 1000 hours of tank intrusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Node Composition and Energy Models</head><p>Despite the many implementations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, integrated wireless sensor nodes have the same overall composition illustrated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>.  1) Sensor Core: We assume that the energy needed to sense a bit is a constant (α 3 ). Thus, for a sensing rate given by r bits/sec, the sensing power is simply p sense = α 3 r. A typical value of α 3 is 50 nJ/bit <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rx</head><p>2) Computation Core: We assume the following model for the power dissipation when n agg raw streams are aggregated into a single stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p comp = n agg α 4 r = n agg p agg (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where r is the rate (in bits/sec) of each of the n agg streams (and also that of the output stream) and α 4 is a constant. Note that p comp just represents the energy dissipated in the computational core. The energy costs of receiving the streams and transmitting the aggregated stream are accounted for separately. The parameter α 4 can be anywhere from a pJ/bit to 10s of nJ/bit depending on the type of aggregation and the architecture used.</p><p>3) Communication Core: We use the following models for the communication core <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p tx (n 1 , n 2 ) = (α 11 + α 2 d(n 1 , n 2 ) n )r (2) p rx = α 12 r<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where p tx (n 1 , n 2 ) is the power dissipated in node n 1 when it is transmitting to node n 2 , d(n 1 , n 2 ) is the distance between the two nodes, n is the path loss index, and the αs are positive constants. Typical values of these parameters are α 11 =45 nJ/bit, α 12 =135 nJ/bit, α 2 =10 pJ/bit/m 2 (n=2) or 0.001 pJ/bit/m 4 (n=4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we tackled the following problem: Given the region of observation (R), the source radius of observability (d S ), the node energy parameters (α 11 , α 12 , α 2 , α 3 and n), the number of nodes deployed (N ), the initial energy in each node (E), what is the upper bound on the active lifetime (t) of any network established using these nodes which gathers data from a source residing in R according to a specified spatial p.d.f. l source (x, y) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. BOUNDS USING OPTIMAL ROLE ASSIGNMENTS In previous work</head><p>The key steps we used to derive tight or near-tight bounds were:</p><p>1) Computing the minimum cumulative energy needed to relay a bit over a certain distance, where the minimum is calculated over all possible multi-hop topologies. If p tx is a convex function of distance, this minimum turns out to be easy to compute. 2) Deriving a lower bound on the expected power dissipation in an ad-hoc network. 3) Using energy conservation to derive an upper bound on lifetime using the lower bound on average power. Using this technique, the bound on the lifetime of a network gathering data from a source residing in a certain region is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t ≤ N.E (α 11 + α 12 ) n n-1 dgeom-dS d char -α 12 + α 3 r (4)</formula><p>where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d char = n α 1 α 2 (n -1)</formula><p>and d geom is a function of the geometry of R and the p.d.f. l source (x, y). Note that these bounds hold in a limit-theorem sense i.e. the probability the bound holds can be made arbitrarily close to 1.</p><p>The bounds derived using this technique allow quick estimates of the maximum possible lifetime. However, they do not factor in the topology of the network and are derived for nonaggregating networks. We now introduce a new framework that eliminates these deficiencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Role Assignment Framework</head><p>We introduce the simple and intuitive concepts of roles and role-assignments in sensor networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Role).</head><p>A role is composed of one or more instances of the three sub-roles introduced earlier -sensing, relaying and aggregating. At most one sensor sub-role can be assumed. Several relay sub-roles can be assumed only when data streams being relayed originated from distinct sensor nodes. Similarly, a role can have several aggregation sub-roles only if those sub-roles aggregate data from distinct originating sensors. The unique role that has no sub-roles is called the dormant role.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2 (Role Assignment). An assignment of roles to nodes in a network constitutes a role assignment.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 3 (Feasible Role Assignment (FRA)). A role assignment is termed feasible if it:</head><p>1) Results in data being relayed from the minimum specified number of sensors to the basestation, and, 2) Has no redundancy i.e. no sub-role in any node can be deleted while still obeying the first property,</p><p>We denote FRAs by f and the set of all feasible role assignments by F. The power dissipated in node i when FRA f is being sustained by the network is denoted by p(i, f ). The energy models discussed earlier lead to simple, closed form expressions for p(i, f ).</p><p>Consider the example network in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. If we constrain node 1 to be the sensor, there are 4 FRAs given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F ={f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 }, where, f 1 : 1 → B f 2 : 1 → 2 → B f 3 : 1 → 3 → B f 4 : 1 → 2 → 3 → B</formula><p>There are in fact 8 FRAs, but we have ignored the "selfcrossing" ones like 1 → 3 → 2 → B because they are clearly sub-optimal in collinear networks. Note that there can be no aggregation since only one, pre-assigned node senses. Consider, the same network, but with the constraint that both 1 and 2 must sense and aggregation is allowed. This leads to,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">F = {f i |1 ≤ i ≤ 12}, where, f 1 : 1 → B; 2 → B f 2 : 1 → 2 → B; 2 → B f 3 : 1 → 3 → B; 2 → B f 4 : 1 → 2 → 3 → B; 2 → B f 5 : 1 → B; 2 → 3 → B f 6 : 1 → 2 → B; 2 → 3 → B f 7 : 1 → 3 → B; 2 → 3 → B f 8 : 1 → 2 → 3 → B; 2 → 3 → B                        Non-aggregating f 9 : 1 → 2 → B; 2 → B f 10 : 1 → 2 → 3 → B; 2 → 3 → B f 11 : 1 → 3 → B; 2 → 3 → B f 12 : 1 → 2 → 3 → B; 2 → 3 → B        Aggregating</formula><p>The reader may wish to verify that this is an exhaustive list of all non-self-crossing FRAs that allow aggregation.

In the first FRA (f 1 ) for instance, the data from node 1 (which is sensing) is routed straight to the basestation and the same is true for node 2 (also sensing).</p><p>Consider now an aggregating FRA, say f 12 . Here, node 3 is the aggregator <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> . Node 1 is sending its raw sensor data to 3 via 2 while 2 is sending its data straight to 3. 3 is aggregating these two streams into one and sending the aggregated stream straight to the basestation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 4 (Feasible Collaborative Strategy</head><formula xml:id="formula_7">t ≤ max c ∈ C t(c) (5)</formula><p>Proof: At any instant, an active network must sense the source using the specified minimum number of sensors and deliver bits to the basestation. Every bit is delivered via some assignment of roles to nodes. In practical networks, there are energy overheads incurred for, say, protocol operations (like media access control etc.). Hence, the lifetime computed in the absence of such overheads is a valid upper bound on lifetime. Finally, note that, by construction, using role assignments that are non-feasible cannot improve the bound. Hence we take the maximum only over strategies that use FRAs.</p><p>Finding the quantity on the RHS of (5) turns out to be a straightforward linear programming problem as shown in table I. The first set of constraints is obvious -it makes no physical sense to sustain a FRA for negative time. The second set of constraints are energy conservation constraints, one for each node, with the LHS denoting the energy consumed and the RHS the initial energy the node started out with. The solution of this linear program yields the optimal collaborative strategy and as a result a bound on the lifetime of the network.</p><p>For the example network in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> with no aggregation, the optimal collaborative strategy turns out to be (0,0.375,0.375,0.625) sec i.e. the first FRA is not used at all, the second is used for 0.375 sec and so on. This yields a lifetime bound of 1.375 sec <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> . For the aggregating case with two sensors, the optimal turns out to be t 6 = 0.3192, t 8 = 0.8938 and t 10 = 0.3192 sec, with other FRAs sustained for zero time, yielding a bound of 1.532 sec.</p><p>Objective :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">max t = |F | i=1 t i</formula><p>where t i corresponds to the time for which FRA f i is sustained. Constraints : In the next four sections, we will use this role assignment framework to include network topology, sets of potential sensors, aggregation and source movement.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">t j ≥ 0 : 1 ≤ j ≤ |F | (6) |F | j=1 p(i, f j )t j ≤ e i : 1≤ i ≤ N (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Topology Sensitive Bounds</head><p>While the framework in table I is conceptually straightforward to use to tackle topology, it suffers from a computational drawback since the number of FRAs grows exponentially with the number of nodes. Interestingly however, we will show that for a broad class of role assignment problems, we can derive our bounds in a time that is polynomial in the number of nodes. Specifically, we reason that if the role assignment problem can be transformed to resemble a network-flow problem, a computationally tractable solution might follow. This reasoning is motivated by prior work in the area of energy efficient multi-hop routing in ad-hoc networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>To illustrate this idea, consider once again the network in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. One way to view the optimal strategy is that f 2 is sustained for 0.375 sec, f 3 for 0.375 sec and f 4 for 0.625 sec. In other words, f 2 and f 3 are each responsible for shipping 3   11   of the data while f 4 ships the remaining 5  11 . It follows that link 1 → 2 carries 8  11 of the data. Similarly link 1 → 3 is responsible for shipping 3  11 , all of which is due to f 3 . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, demonstrates this transformation. We have transformed the role assignment view to the network flow view:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">       t 1 = 0 sec t 2 = 0.375 sec t 3 = 0.375 sec t 4 = 0.625 sec        ⇒                f 12 = 8 11 f 13 = 3 11 f 1B = 0 f 23 = 3 11 f 2B = 5 11 f 3B = 8 11               </formula><p>where f ij is the flow from node i to node j. Note that we are justified in calling the above view a flow because it satisfies the following properties expected of any valid flow: 1) Non-negativity of flow.</p><p>2) Conservation of flows at all nodes but the sensor. In other words the total flow out of a node is the same as the total flow into a node.  It is fairly straightforward to see that for the class of networks with an assigned sensor (as in the flow construction example above), every flow view that is constructed from a collaborative strategy will have these properties. We now ask the reverse question -can one always derive a feasible collaborative strategy given a flow and the total lifetime? <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">4</ref> It turns out that we can, since every flow can be expressed as a sum of cycles and paths from the source to sink with non-negative weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. These paths correspond to FRAs for the simple case of a fixed point source with an assigned sensor. This case turns out to be the maximum lifetime multi-hop routing which was first reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We can now replace the program in table I with that in table II. We have labelled the pre-assigned sensor node 1 and the basestation is node N +1. The first two constraints simply state that this is a valid flow. The third constraint normalizes the flow out of the sensor. This ensures that if the flows above can be sustained for time t, then t is simply the lifetime of the network. The last condition states that the total energy drain of any node be no greater than the initial energy present in that node. Replacing each unknown flow f ij with a new unknown r ij = f ij t ensures that the program is linear in the new unknowns. Also, the number of constraints and variables are now polynomial in the number of nodes and we can compute the upper bound in polynomial time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Set of Potential Sensors</head><p>In practical networks, we must deal with a set of potential sensors (S) of which a specified number (k, 1 ≤ k ≤ m = |S|) must be active. For instance, in the example shown in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we required k = 2. Also, S = {1, 7, 10} when the source is at location S 0 . The case of a pre-assigned sensor considered in the last section is simply corresponds to k = m = 1. While our original linear program (table <ref type="table">I</ref>), can handle this new problem, the problem is again computational complexity. Rather, we will resort to the flow view again. Two modifications to the program in table II allow us to capture this "k of m" sensors problem:</p><p>Objective : max t</p></div>

To see why the latter situation is a problem, consider, a scenario where m is 5 and k is 2. Solving the program might yield a solution where one of the nodes in S accounts for the entire flow of 2. Clearly, such a flow cannot be translated to a collaborative strategy where at least two nodes sense when the network is active. Constraint ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) precludes sensors from consuming data while <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> prevents sensors from producing too much data. It turns out that these constraints are not just necessary but also sufficient to guarantee the existence of an equivalent strategy. In other words, given a set of m flows (one for each sensor in S), all of which are no greater than 1 and add up to k, we can always guarantee that there exists a schedule where exactly k of m sensors are active at any time. We omit the simple constructive proof. Once again using a change of variables identical to that used in the previous section, we end up with a linear program which can be solved in polynomial time. Hence, lifetime bounds for the k of m problem can also be derived in polynomial time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Bounds for Aggregating Networks</head><p>Aggregation can significantly increase the lifetime of a network by reducing the volume of data that needs to be relayed to the basestation. We now generalize the k of m scenario to include non-hierarchical aggregation. Instead of simply deciding which sensors to use from the potential sensor-set and how to route data, we must now decide what fraction of the data to aggregate, how many and which nodes to use as aggregators, how to route data to the aggregator(s) and from the aggregators to the basestation. Of course, we must also find out how to change these decisions with time (which corresponds to how long we should sustain these FRAs) so as to maximize lifetime.</p><p>This represents an important conceptual leap since we are exploring the fundamental tradeoff between computation and communication (as captured by the cost of aggregating versus the cost of relaying data, respectively), a theme which has not seen rigorous analysis in previous work. We want to repeat that the general role assignment framework in table I is capable of producing a bound, but will get computationally burdensome for large N . Hence, we focus on a transformation to a flowcentric view instead.</p><p>While bits can originate from several sensors in a nonaggregating network, they undergo no change till they reach their common, final destination -the basestation. Hence, at any instant, there is a single commodity flowing through the network. Consider an aggregating network with, say, three, potential aggregators -nodes 4, 6 and 7 6 . Now, bits have four potential destinations -the basestation and these aggregators. Bits that go unaggregated or that are produced as a result of aggregation comprise the first commodity (which we abbreviate as unagg). Bits destined for aggregation at one of these aggregating nodes comprise the other three commodities (which we term agg commodities). This leads to 1 + |P | commodities in general. This is reminiscent of a multi-commodity flow problem except that the commodities are not distinguished based on their source but their destination and flows are not conserved when raw streams are aggregated.</p><p>In the program that follows, flow f ij,z indicates flow on the link i → j carrying commodity z i.e. destined for aggregation at node z. We use z = 0 for the case when the flow will not be aggregated i.e. for the unagg commodity. Hence z ∈ {0} ∪ P denotes z running over all commodities. Given a node, any flow originating from or terminating in it is said to be related to the node if the commodity it carries is destined for the node. Hence, only flows of type f ij,i or f ji,i are related to node i. It follows that nodes not in P have no related flows.</p><p>Objective :</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">max t (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>General Constraints : Non-negativity of flow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">f ij,z ≥ 0 : i, j ∈ [1, N + 1], z ∈ {0} ∪ P (20)</formula><p>Absence of related aggregated flow in output:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">f id,i = 0 : i ∈ P, d ∈ [1, N + 1], d = i (21)</formula><p>Overall flow from the sensor set S: 6 We denote the set of potential aggregators by P .</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">z∈{0}∪P z =i i∈S     d∈[1,N +1] d =i f id,z - s∈[1,N +1] s =i f si,z     = k (22)</formula><p>0-7803-7476-2/02/$17.00 (c) 2002 IEEE.</p></div>

Constraint (21) states that if a flow originates from an aggregator, it must not carry any commodity that is destined for that aggregator. ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) is essentially the same as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> with the only difference that since we have multiple commodities here, we must sum over all of them.

In nodes that neither sense nor aggregate i.e. which only route, conservation constraints are the same as beforeevery commodity is conserved as expected (25). In the case of an aggregating node that does not sense, unrelated flows must be conserved (26) while the the net unagg flow is augmented by the volume of the aggregated stream (27). Note that this volume is simply 1/k th the volume of the total inflow destined for aggregation.</p><p>The single non-consumption constraint ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) stated earlier now leads to three constraints. Related agg commodities are already taken care of by <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Constraint (28) handles unrelated agg commodities and is conceptually identical to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Next, consider the unagg commodity. For sensors that are not aggregators, the constraint on the unagg commodity is straightforward (29). For sensors that are also aggregators, the unagg output must not only be greater than the unagg input, but greater by the volume of the aggregated stream produced at the node (30). Note that we use 1/(k -1) and not 1/k since one stream destined for aggregation must come from the node itself.</p><p>The final constraints are the limits on sensor flows, which were motivated in the last section. The first of these (31) is the same as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and prevents any sensor from monopolizing the output from the sensor group. We also need to prevent a sensor from monopolizing the sensor flow to a particular aggregator which is achieved by (32).</p><p>We have omitted the more complex case of hierarchical aggregation due to lack of space. The interested reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where we show that bounds can be obtained in a computationally feasible fashion for a constrained form of hierarchical aggregation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Extensions to Arbitrary Regions</head><p>In the previous sections, we showed how bounds can be refined to include topology, potential sensor sets and aggregation. Throughout, we implicitly assumed a fixed point source. We now extend our framework to allow sources that reside in regions.</p><p>Two insights lead to a solution of this problem. First, we transform the problem of a single source residing in a region to a problem of multiple sources at fixed points. Next, we use a simple trick to extend our single-source framework to accommodate multiple sources.</p><p>We use the network in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> to illustration the first idea. We divide the region of observation (R) into sub-regions char- acterized by the set of potential sensors. In our example, there are twelve sub-regions. Consider sub-region e, which is characterized by S = {1, 2, 3}. Also, we expect the source to reside in e for a fraction of time (say, η) equal to the integral of the location p.d.f. evaluated over e. We can similarly characterize every sub-region. We now have a problem which is identical to sensing 12 sources -one in every sub-region 8 . We want to determine the maximum possible lifetime t such that the source residing in sub-region j can be sensed for a certain fraction η j of the lifetime.</p><p>We extend our single source framework to attack the multiple source problem as follows. We deal with L sources by splitting each node into L virtual nodes, one corresponding to each source. We then setup constraints for the l th source (1 ≤ l ≤ L) as we did for the single source case, with the following modifications: 8 Fixed at any point in that sub-region.</p><p>1) Flows f ij,z are now labelled f ij,z,l where the new subscript indicates that the flows correspond to source l.</p><p>2) The overall flow from the sensor-set is set to η l k instead of k (cf. ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>)). Similarly, the RHS in (31) is changed from 1 to η l . 3) We do not impose the energy constraint (23). After setting up these constraints for the L sources, we setup a single energy constraint for each node by constraining the sum of the energy consumptions of its L virtual copies to be less than the initial energy in that node. The objective is the same as before -maximizing t. We claim that this new program solves our optimization problem.</p><p>To see why, first observe that any solution produced by this program is in fact feasible. We can start with the first source, map the flows corresponding to this source to the actual nodes (we can do this since the flows obey single source constraints) and allow them to run for η 1 t time. We then do this, in sequence, for all the L sources. Our unified energy constraint guarantees that we cannot run out of energy in the interim.</p><p>Next, we claim that any solution to the multiple sources problem can always be expressed in the form above i.e. using the language of virtual nodes. Consider any such solution. It must correspond to a feasible collaborative strategy for sensing these multiple sources. We can group all FRAs which are used for sensing the first source, all FRAs used for the second source and so on <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">9</ref> . Since each of these groups of FRAs can be translated into flows that obey single source constraints, we end up with a virtual node view.</p><p>Note that this virtual-node based approach leads to a solution that runs in time that is polynomial in the number of nodes and locations, L. In practical sensors networks, the region of observation (R) is much larger than the source's region of observability. Furthermore, the node density and source observability radius are fixed parameters that do not change with R. Under these assumptions, L is proportional to the area of R and as a consequence to the number of nodes N .</p><p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that the same technique follows through if we are dealing with multiple moving sources whose trajectories are specified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ILLUSTRATIONS</head><p>We present two illustrations of the techniques developed in this paper. The first example demonstrates how bounds behave when the number of sensors that need to observe the source change. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, we have a set of ten potential sensors. We vary the number of desired observers from one to the maximum possible, ten. For each value of k, our k-of-m program presented earlier computes the bound on lifetime. The resulting bounds on lifetime are in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>.</p><p>Next, we see the impact of aggregation via the example network in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. Here, we have a set of three potential sensors and we desire maximum quality (k=3), but we allow nonhierarchical aggregation. We ran our programs for the aggregated and unaggregated versions. They reveal that aggregation has the potential to increase lifetime by a factor of 2.67 over the  unaggregated case if aggregation costs are small compared to receive costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In previous work, we derived tight or near-tight but topology insensitive bounds for non-aggregating sensor networks where the source resided in a region according to a location p.d.f. In this paper, we generalized our bounds to the case of aggregating networks with specified topology and even source movement.</p><p>These bounds were derived by employing the formalism of feasible role assignments (FRAs). We argued that there is a finite set of assignments of roles to nodes that allow sensing in a non-redundant manner. Every bit received at the basestation must have employed one of these FRAs. The question then is -what FRAs must we use and in what proportion such that lifetime is maximized. The resulting lifetime provides a bound on the lifetime of actual networks. The role assignment technique is conceptually simple and extremely powerful since it can allow arbitrarily complex ways of gathering data and still yield crisp bounds via a linear program. However, it is computationally burdensome. We showed in this paper that a class of role assignment problems permit a transformation to linear programs based on network flows that can be solved in polynomial time. It is important to emphasize that not all role assignment problems can be similarly transformed. But several ones of practical importance -pure routing, non-hierarchical and constrained hierarchical aggregation, multiple or moving sources, sources with specified trajectories -are amenable to such a transformation. An interesting open question is whether a similar transformation exists for networks that allow generalized hierarchical aggregation.</p><p>While the framework here accommodates fairly sophisticated data gathering scenarios, other practical concerns, chief amongst them the energy spent in the medium access control (MAC), remain to be incorporated. It is our hope that the techniques reported here will provide a starting point in constructing the ultimate bounds on the lifetime of data gathering wireless sensor networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
