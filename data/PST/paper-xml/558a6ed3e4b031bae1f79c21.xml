<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present a model for TCP/IP flow control mechanism. The rate at which data is transmitted increases linearly in time until a packet loss is detected. At that point, the transmission rate is divided by a constant factor. Losses are generated by some exogenous random process which is only assumed to be stationary. This allows us to account for any correlation and any distribution of inter-loss times. We obtain an explicit expression for the throughput of a TCP connection and bounds on the throughput when there is a limit on the congestion window size. In addition, we study the effect of the TimeOut mechanism on the throughput.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>We analyze in this paper the performance of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), the widely-used transport protocol of the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. TCP is a reliable window-based flow control protocol where the window is increased until a packet loss is detected. Here, the source assumes that the network is congested and reduces its window. Once the lost packets are recovered, the source resumes its window increase. As a performance measure, we consider the throughput of a long time TCP connection having an infinite amount of data to send. A mathematical model is presented to find a closed form expression for the throughput of the connection. We assume that the reader is familiar with basic mechanisms of TCP such as Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance algorithms, the two methods for loss detection: Duplicate ACKs and TimeOut, the Delay ACK mechanism, the limitation on the congestion window due to receiver buffer, etc. (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> for a survey on TCP issues).</p><p>A remarkable attention has been given to TCP modeling within the research community <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>. This is not surprising since 95% of today Internet traffic is carried over TCP. Closed form expressions for the throughput have been obtained. These expressions have helped to understand the impact of different network and TCP parameters on the throughput of the connection and on the efficiency of network resource utilization (e.g. Fairness). Recently, these expressions have been also used to adapt the rate of UDP flows (e.g. audio and video) in a way to be friendly with TCP flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</p><p>The mathematical analysis of TCP requires two steps. First, we need to construct a model for the window size evolution. Most of the existing models ignore the Slow Start phase and make the assumption that the source stays always in Congestion Avoidance mode. A fluid model has often been used. The window of the connection is assumed to increase linearly as a function of time until a loss occurs; then it is divided by two. An initialization to one packet has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> in case of losses detected via TimeOut. The phase of recovery from losses is assumed to be negligible and the source resumes its linear increase directly after the reduction. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, a packet-level model has been proposed to account for the discrete nature of TCP. Indeed, the volume of data in the network at any moment is in multiple of packets. It increases by one once the increase in the window exceeds the packet size. Later in our paper, we will show how a fluid model can be corrected to account for this discreteness of TCP.</p><p>Second, TCP analysis requires a characterization of time between congestion events (i.e. between moments at which the congestion window is reduced). Namely, one needs to model the impact of the path between the source and the destination on the connection. Particular models are considered in the literature. The fixed point approach used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref> gives a deterministic time between congestion events. The assumptions made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> can also be shown to imply a deterministic time between congestion events. An exponentially distributed time with a constant intensity has been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> between congestion events. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, the intensity of the exponentially distributed time between congestion events is assumed to increase with the window size. Instead of working in real time, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> chose to work in a virtual time. This time is obtained by sampling the congestion window at the moments of ACK arrivals. Again, they consider the case where times between congestion events in this virtual time are identically and exponentially distributed. The distribution as well as the moments of the congestion window are found in this virtual time and a method is suggested to go back to the real time. An expression of TCP throughput is provided for each of these models. Our experimentations over the Internet show however that the times between congestion events can have general distribution. They can vary from an approximately deterministic case to a considerably bursty case. Moreover, some correlation may exist between these times. We note, in particular, that if packets are dropped independently with a constant probability then the times between drops are not independent (since the instantaneous transmission rate is variable). We believe that the Internet is so heterogenous that different types of distributions of times between congestion events will always exist. We also believe that making simple assumptions on the process of congestion events will lead to a wrong estimation of TCP throughput. In particular, we have shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> that the throughput of TCP increases when the moments at which the congestion window is reduced tend to appear in bursts. This results in performance problems in applications based on explicit expressions for TCP throughput. Consider for example the case of TCP-friendly applications using explicit expressions for TCP throughput to adapt their rate (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref> and references therein). These are typically real time applications designed to compete fairly for the available bandwidth with TCP transfers. Suppose that these applications use an expression for TCP throughput that makes a simple assumption on the process of congestion events (e.g. deterministic or Poisson). These applications will suffer when the process of congestion events is highly bursty. They can perform better and transmit at a higher rate by basing their throughput calculation on a more precise model for congestion events.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the case of a general sequence of times between congestion events. In the sequel, we call a congestion event a loss event. A loss (event) is a moment where the congestion window is reduced by a given constant factor. It can be the result of multiple packet losses. Ideally, a TCP connection must divide its window by two whatever is the number of packet losses within a Round Trip Time (RTT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. All we assume is that this process of loss moments is stationary ergodic. With this minimal assumption, we are able to obtain explicit expressions for the throughput of TCP. Our loss model is general enough to allow us to capture any correlation or any distribution of inter-loss times.</p><p>For the dynamics of TCP, we decided to focus on the transmission rate which is the number of packets in the network (or the volume of data) divided by the RTT of the connection. The source is assumed to have always data to send. The number of packets in the network is thus equal to the number of packets that can be fit within the window. Denote by X(t) the transmission rate of the connection at time t. At any moment, we can multiply X(t) by RTT to get the window size in terms of packets. We assume that X(t) increases linearly with time at a rate α. If we denote by b the number of data packets covered by one ACK, then α = 1/(bRT T 2 ). Let ν denote the decrease in the transmission rate when a loss event occurs. Usually ν is equal to one half but we consider a more general scenario to account for other possible flow control mechanisms (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>). The moments of losses are modeled by a general stationary ergodic point process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> with non-null and finite intensity λ. Let {Tn} +∞ n=-∞ be a particular realization of the point process. Consider for the moment the case where losses are quickly detected without the need for a long TimeOut period (e.g. via Duplicate ACK mechanism or via an efficient fine-granularity TimeOut mechanism). Then, the evolution of the transmission rate can be described by the following equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Xn+1 = νXn + αSn, (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where X n is the value of X(t) just prior to the arrival of the loss at T n and S n := T n+1 -T n . The pair {T n , X n } can be considered as a marked point process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</p><p>In the next section, we use the machinery of stochastic processes to study this model of the rate evolution. We compute the throughput, that is the time average of process X(t). We also compute the first two moments of the transmission rate at loss arrivals for the stationary regime. Then different examples of loss processes are studied: deterministic, Poisson, i.i.d. and Markovian arrival processes. The expression of the throughput is provided for each of these particular cases. In Section 2.3, we extend our model to account for the case where there is a limitation on the evolution of the transmission rate caused by the receiver advertised window; we provide bounds on the throughput for that model. In Section 2.4, we explain how to extend our model to the case when some losses are detected via a conservative coarsegranularity TimeOut mechanism which is used in most TCP implementations. In section 3, we present the testbed as well as the results of our experimentations. In particular, our results demonstrate that different types of loss processes exist in the Internet and that often the distribution of inter-loss times cannot be approximated by a constant or by an exponential distribution. Our experimentations show also the common problem of linear rate increase models. When the transmission rate of TCP indeed exhibits a linear increase, our model gives excellent results. The linear rate increase is known to hold for TCP connections in which the propagation delay is large in comparison with queuing delays, since in that case, RTT is almost constant (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>). However, in the case where queueing delays are non negligible as in Local Area Networks, TCP window growth exhibits some sub-linearity due to the increase of the RTT with the window size. In this case, we find that linear rate models overestimate the real throughput. We conclude Section 3 with a method to correct the error caused by the fluid assumption. With this method, the deterministic case of our fluid model has given the same results as the packet level approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Finally, we conclude the work in Section 4.</p></div>

The objective is to be conservative and to reduce the load on the operating system. This coarsegranularity together with the back-off mechanism of the retransmission timer in case of retransmission losses introduce some idle times during which the congestion window is not increasing and the transmission rate is approximately equal to zero.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">MODEL VALIDATION</head><p>Our work has been mainly motivated by the fact that the loss of TCP packets over the Internet may present a more complicated structure than the simplistic approaches proposed in the existing literature. We have run real TCP connections between several Internet sites. For each connection we measure the time between loss events (i.e. between moments at which the window is divided by two). We study then our model under different assumptions on the type of the loss process. After that, we evaluate how well linear rate increase models approximate real TCP performance. We introduce at the end a method to account for the discreteness of TCP. With this method, our model under deterministic inter-loss time assumption gives very close results to the detailed discrete model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. This can also be considered as a proof that <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> accounts only for deterministic loss processes.</p></div>

Given the TCP version of the source, we developed a tool that looks at the trace of every connection and provides the instants of window reductions (Tn). In the case of a loss detected via TimeOut, the tool provides the duration of the TimeOut period. In general, our tool determines the times S n and S n , the parameters λ T O and Z, and the average RTT from the measured trace file.</p><p>Each connection is run for 24 hours. Its trace however is divided at fixed intervals in a way to get a sufficient number of losses. We fix this interval to 20 minutes for ESSI, to 40 minutes for ENST and to one hour for Australia. This gives us a set of trace files for every connection. For each trace file, we measured the real throughput of the connection and we compared it to the expected throughput using both the expressions we derived from our fluid model, as well as the expression from the packet level model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. We examined the validity of different models for the distribution of interloss times (deterministic, Poisson, iid, general correlated).</p><p>The different moments and correlation functions of interloss times are calculated from the trace file.</p><p>We studied separately the effect of assumptions on the loss process and the correctness of our fluid model for TCP transmission rate evolution. The validation of the loss model was done as follows. We reconstruct for a given trace file the evolution in time of the proposed fluid model (i.e. the mechanism with a linear increase and multiplicative decrease with a silence time during TimeOuts and with the maximum limit on the congestion window; see Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>). We call this process the Exact Fluid Model and we calculate exactly its throughput. This throughput is calculated by computing the area below the transmission rate between two losses, and then by summing all the areas and dividing the result exactly the throughput we are trying to estimate in our analysis and which we (and other authors that use linear rate increase models to study TCP) are claiming represents real TCP throughput. Our measure of how well a given model for the distribution of inter-loss times approximates the real loss process will be how close the throughput predicted by our close form expression (5) agrees with the exact fluid model throughput. If the loss model is good (according to the above criterion), we are still not guaranteed that the measured throughput of the real TCP connection agrees with our throughput formulas. We expect the latter to be close to real TCP throughput if the linear rate increase model is appropriate, which is not always the case as we will see later. Ideally, the exact fluid model throughput must not deviate from the real TCP throughput and the throughput calculated under a given assumption on the type of the loss process should follow closely that of the exact fluid model.</p></div>

On such connection, one expects that models assuming deterministic inter-loss times will give bad results compared to the real throughput. On the MAN connection, we see that the variance of inter-loss times is closer to that of a deterministic distribution than that of an exponential distribution. Finally, on the WAN connection, it is clear that losses occur according to a Poisson process.</p><p>The above three figures show well that the inter-loss time process change from one path to another. It changes also on the same path. This observation confirms the utility of our general model for losses on TCP connections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Validation of the model for TCP</head><p>In this section we compare the exact fluid model to real TCP on the three connections we are considering. Our objective here is to test the validity of the TCP modeling (the linear growth assumption as well as the fluid assumption  It is mainly due to the sub-linearity of TCP congestion window evolution, which can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. This sublinearity is in turn due to the increase of the RTT with the congestion window (i.e. due to the increase of queuing time with respect to propagation delay). Linear rate increase models assume that the RTT is independent of the window size and use the average of the RTT to calculate the slope of the transmission rate increase. This overestimation does not exist on the WAN connection where the window is usually small and where the propagation delay plays a major role.</p><p>Models taking simple assumptions about the loss process deviate from the exact fluid model which in turn deviates from real TCP. Occasionally, they can give good results when the two deviations cancel each other. As an example, the assumption that inter-loss times are deterministic works well on the LAN connection, even though the loss process has a considerable variation (see Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>). This is due to the cancellation effect we described. Our approach solves the problem of inter-loss time modeling. However, the problem of TCP window evolution modeling still persists.</p><p>Another source for overestimation in our model is the fluid approximation. In fact, the transmission rate of TCP does not increase continuously but rather jumps when the number We use the packet level model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> to correct this problem of discreteness. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref> shows how the number of packets in the network changes as a function of time between two congestion events. The dashed thick line represents our fluid model and the continuous thick line represents the discrete TCP behavior described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Assume that X(t) is measured in packets per unit of time. A good approximation is to shift down our process X(t) by 1/(2RT T ) then to subtract from the throughput the deterioration caused by the last RTT before the resumption of the transmission (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>). It has been assumed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> that the number of packets transmitted during the last RTT is equal to half the window size. Thus, half E[X * n ] * RT T must be subtracted from the average integral of the transmission rate between two loss events in order to account for this last RTT before the resumption of the transmission. We get the following throughput</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">X d = X - 1 2RT T - E[X * n ] * RT T 2E[S n ] = X - b 2 + 1 2(1 -ν) αRT T</formula><p>Using this correction, we compare in Figures <ref type="figure">9,</ref><ref type="figure">10</ref>, and 11 our model with deterministic inter-loss times <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> with the packet level model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. The results of these two models practically coincide for all three connections. These results In general, the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> is close to the real throughput in two cases: when the linear rate increase assumption is correct and losses are quite deterministic (MAN connection) or when the linear rate increase assumption is not valid and inter-loss times vary considerably (LAN connection). The correctness of the model in the latter case is due to error cancellation between the model for TCP and the model for losses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Validation of bounds</head><p>To validate the derived bounds for the case of window size limitation, we choose to work on the WAN connection where our model for TCP is most appropriate. We plot the results for the whole day (Figure <ref type="figure">13</ref>). First, we see that from 0 to 10 o'clock the throughput calculated in the case of no limit on the congestion window significantly deviates from the exact fluid model. Our exact fluid model accounts for the rate limitation. This deviation means that the receiver advertised window is frequently reached during these hours and our bounds can be applied to estimate the throughput. We plot our two bounds on the same figure. They are indeed quite close to the exact fluid model throughput. We plot also the throughput obtained by the asymptotic approximation in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_65">29</ref>). This approximation is valid only when the maximum window is frequently reached. The figure shows that it approximates well the exact fluid model. One can envisage the use of this approximation once the expectation of the transmission rate at loss moments computed by (3) exceeds the maximum rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this work, we presented an analysis of TCP throughput under a general loss process. The only assumption on the loss process under consideration is stationarity and ergodicity. We provide explicit expression for the throughput in the case of no limit on the transmission rate. The throughput is shown to be inversely proportional to RTT and to the square root of the packet loss probability, as was already observed for much simpler loss models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>. We further provided bounds for the case when a limit exists on the maximum window size. We extend our work to include also the TimeOut mechanism.</p><p>The importance of our model is justified by the different types of loss processes we observed when measuring Internet traffic. The model we proposed is able to capture any correlation or any distribution of inter-loss times. Several existing models can be seen as particular cases of our general approach. On paths where TCP transmission rate indeed increases linearly between congestion moments, our model gives excellent results. However, on paths where TCP window growth is sub-linear, we notice some overestimation of the real throughput. In a future work, we will try to account for this sub-linearity in TCP modeling. Another direction for future research could be the identification of the parameters of the Markovian Arrival Process proposed to characterize losses on correlated paths.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the expectation E[X n ] is taken with respect to the stationary regime, ď = E[ Šn ], d = E[ Ŝn ], and where Šn := M 2α ∧ Sn, Ŝn := M α ∧ Sn.</figDesc></figure>

Each transfer consists of a continuous flow of data during a whole day. The source machine (clope.inria.fr) is running the New Reno version of TCP and is located at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis in south of France. The destination machines are located respectively at the ESSI school at 1 km from INRIA (nessie.essi.fr), at the ENST school at Paris (solo.enst. fr), and at the University of South Australia (linus.levels. unisa.edu.au). TCP Packets are of 1460 Byte size (not including TCP and IP headers). The machine in Australia advertises a window of 22 packets and those at ESSI and ENST advertise a window of 44 packets. These can be considered as three long-life TCP transfers across LAN (Local Area Network), MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), and WAN (Wide Area Network) networks. The three destinations implement the Delay ACK mechanism, so α = 1/(2RT T 2 ).</figDesc></figure>

The exact fluid model throughput is exactly the throughput we are trying to estimate in our analysis and which we (and other authors that use linear rate increase models to study TCP) are claiming represents real TCP throughput. Our measure of how well a given model for the distribution of inter-loss times approximates the real loss process will be how close the throughput predicted by our close form expression (5) agrees with the exact fluid model throughput. If the loss model is good (according to the above criterion), we are still not guaranteed that the measured throughput of the real TCP connection agrees with our throughput formulas. We expect the latter to be close to real TCP throughput if the linear rate increase model is appropriate, which is not always the case as we will see later. Ideally, the exact fluid model throughput must not deviate from the real TCP throughput and the throughput calculated under a given assumption on the type of the loss process should follow closely that of the exact fluid model.</figDesc></figure>
