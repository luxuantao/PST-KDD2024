<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a smartphone-only solution for the detection of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), which utilizes the builtin accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (Inertial Measurement Unit, IMU) in the detection. Depending on the patient's situation, it is possible to use the developed smartphone application either regularly or occasionally for making a measurement of the subject. The smartphone is placed on the chest of the patient who is adviced to lay down and perform a non-invasive recording, while no external sensors are needed. After that, the application determines whether the patient suffers from AFib or not. The presented method has high potential to detect paroxysmal ("silent") AFib from large masses. In this paper, we present the pre-processing, feature extraction, feature analysis and classification results of the envisioned AFib detection system based on clinical data acquired with a standard mobile phone equipped with Google Android OS. Test data was gathered from 16 AFib patients (validated against ECG), as well as a control group of 23 healthy individuals with no diagnosed heart diseases. We obtained an accuracy of 97.4% in AFib vs. healthy classification (a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 100%). Due to the wide availability of smart devices/sensors with embedded IMU, the proposed methods could potentially also scale to other domains such as embedded body-sensor networks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N this work, we consider the accurate detection of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with modern microelectromechanical (MEMS) accelerometers and gyroscopes embedded into modern smartphones. Previously, smartphone based AFib detection has been proposed through the camera of the smartphone while illuminating the user's finger with the camera flash (PPG, photoplethysmography) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Our approach is also based on smartphone, while the acquisition of the heart signal is made in an alternative way. The patient is adviced to lie down in a supine position and the smartphone is placed on the chest of the patient. This way, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used for unconventional purpose (typically IMU is used for determining the orientation of smartphone) namely for registering the tiny cardiogenic micromovements of the patient's chest. A measurement with similar duration as in camera based measurement is taken (approximately 2 minutes) with the already available MEMS sensors within the smartphone. We have previously found out that also the gyroscope has the potential to add robust information to the (1) Department of Future Technologies, University of Turku, Finland email:(tejuko@utu.fi)</p><p>(2) Heart Center, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.</p><p>heart signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Therefore we use both the accelerometer and the gyroscope for signal acquisition.</p><p>AFib is one of the most common heart arrhythmia which occurs in approximately 2% of the global population, prevalence being dependent on factors like sex, age and country <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It is also major cause of stroke, heart failure and other comorbidities. Occurrence of AFib increases the risk for a stroke, since a blood clot may form and convey into brain. Up to 90% of intermittent AFib episodes are asymptomatic and therefore a vast number of AFib cases remain unnoticed. Strikingly, acute stroke is relatively often the first sign of AFib. It has been estimated that around 70% of strokes due to AFib could be avoided with pre-emptive medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Large scale screening of "silent" AFib has been proposed as a way to reduce the stroke risk from persons suffering from asymptomatic AFib. The challenge is that most of the current methods are either too costly or incovenient for extensive long-term screening of whole population or higher risk age groups (60 years and above). A smartphone solution could thus provide cost-efficient means to screen these persons from the population. As the probability of having AFib increases with age, for example in the US, the prevalence of AFib is expected to more than double in the next 50 years as the population grows older <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It has been estimated that currently the medical cost caused by AFib is $26 billion annually in US only <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Thus, the financial impact of efficient AFib prevention can be significant. The hospitalization rate due to AFib is concentrated on the east coast of the US thus the costs are not equally divided <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Related work</head><p>PPG is based on measuring the blood volume changes through the skin capillary bed optically (typically fingertip) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. The measurement is carried out by illuminating the skin e.g. with a light-emitting diode (LED) and measuring the changes in light absorption. The previous implementations of smartphone based AFib detection have relied on the same principle while using the flash of the smartphone camera to illuminate the finger of the user and capturing a video of the color changes in the patient's finger. Although this is a common approach, the method needs to handle variations in fingertip placement -which may be a challenge, especially to elderly people <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> -and camera focus, which may have a negative effect on the signal acquisition. Furthermore, while the video recording approach is suitable for short term measurements it is not well suited as such for long-term continuos monitoring of AFib in body sensor networks due to issues such as power consumption.</p><p>There exist also smartphone/tablet based ECG devices and embedded devices, which can be used to detect a variety of heart conditions, including AFib <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. However, also in the case of smartphone based ECG there is generally a need for physical contact to the subject's skin, which may require electrodes potentially irritating the skin as well as other hardware and wires. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, an ECG-based screening system (AliveCor) was proposed for screening of AFib, which was embedded to a smart casing of the smartphone. The user presses the electrodes within the casing with two fingers (from different hands) and performs a short measurement, which is then modulated and transmitted through an ultrasonic interface to the smartphone and eventually processed automatically. Despite of being a promising system, also this method still requires extra hardware in order to be applied.</p><p>Seismocardiography (SCG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> is a non-invasive method based on measuring cardiogenic accelerations of the chest. Although considered as a promising approach, the utilization of SCG has not reached the level of ECG. The research concerning SCG has recently still gained more popularity. The emergence of modern MEMS accelerometers with tiny physical dimensions (for instance 2mm × 2mm or less) have increased interest towards this method. Ballistocardiography (BCG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> is based on measuring the whole body movements induced by heart movements with an accelerometer. Typically the sensor is attached below the user into a bed, a chair, or a scale. As an example of BCG, we would like to mention non-invasive sleep monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, which user interface was implemented on a smartphone. Recent advances in seismo-and ballistocardiography have been reviewed in <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. SCG-based methods are sometimes referred as BCG since the terminology is not very well-established.</p><p>SCG has been proposed to monitoring left ventricular function during ischemia in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> and measuring heart rate variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. Long-term SCG has been proposed as a non-invasive method to monitor ambulant subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. The potential of SCG-based monitoring using smartphones (and potentially other smart devices, for instance Google Glass) have been recently studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. Detection of AFib with ballistocardiography has been previously proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, and detection of AFib with seismocardiography in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</p><p>We extend here the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, where a single accelerometer axis of a custom built ECG/SCG board was used to separate between AFib and normal conditions (acquired before and after cardioversion). The application field proposed in this paper is to extend to smartphones and we describe a stand-alone App for AFib detection, which takes advantage of all available accelerometer and gyroscope axes. In addition, we derive a large number of new features in order to improve the performance of the AFib detection in comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> and extend to (multiple) other and more advanced classifiers for separation between AFib and normal conditions. In comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, where the AFib detection was applied using ballistocardiography during sleep/bed measurements, our approach has some similarities but the application field is different, as we are utilizing a smartphone-only solution for the screening of AFib using short-term measurements without any extra hardware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Patient protocol</head><p>The data collected for this study consists of 16 data recordings of a duration of a few minutes (typically less than five minutes) taken from AFib patients at hospital settings. Additional data was captured from a control group of 23 healthy individuals, taken at the premises of Technology Research Center, University of Turku, Finland. In both cases, the subjects were adviced to lie in a supine position, while a smartphone measurement was taken by placing a standard Sony Xperia Z-series smartphone on the chest of the patient. A dedicated data collection application used was responsible for the data acquisition. The data acquisition was initiated and terminated by pressing a button on the screen of the smartphone.</p><p>The patient tests were carried out at Turku Heart Center, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. The research protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital District of the South-Western Finland. The requirements for the inclusion of a patient for the study were:</p><p>• minimum age 18 years;</p><p>• the patient was an authorized representative of him-/herself and willing to agree and sign a written informed concent approved by the ethical review board; and • AFib was diagnosed from the patient via other standard modality such as ECG.</p><p>The criteria for the exclusion of the patient from the study were:</p><p>• the patient suffered from any additional health problems that would, in the view of the investigator's opinion, interfere the patients optimal participation to the study; • age under 18 years old;</p><p>• unwillingness or unability of using a smartphone; or • the patient suffered from severe memory problems. No information which could be used to identify the patient was stored to the memory of the smartphone. After data gathering, the data was transferred to a desktop personal computer to be used for the development and validation of the detection algorithms reported in this work. The acquisition of the data did not affect to the quality of care that the patient received in any way. The condition of the AFib patients was determined by simultaneous ECG during the smartphone measurements. As a control group we acquired healthy volunteers with no diagnosed heart diseases. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>  frequency) domain can be used as cues to detect AFib using ECG. The RR interval is defined as the time interval between two successive R-peaks of the ECG (R-peak being the most prominent peak in ECG). A good fingerprint of AFib is that the beat timings in ECG are irregularly irregular. We use the ECG based AFib detection methods as a starting point for developing IMU-based techniques for the detection of AFib.</p><p>We hypothesize that the beat-to-beat irregularity present in ECG will also be present in the IMU signal. As R-peaks do not exist in the SCG or GCG signal, some other fiducial points must be used instead. Because the AO (aortic opening) is usually the most prominent peak in SCG/GCG it is natural choice to be used as a reference. The respective AO-AO interval determines the beat interval in the case of SCG/GCG. It should be noted that the R-R and AO-AO intervals are not equal since the electromechanical delay is not constant <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. For consistency, the term RR interval is used in this paper for the AO-AO interval also. In addition to the timing of the beats, we also use other indicators related to the shape and the randomness of the heart signal as potential features for the detection of AFib [29], <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. The randomness indicators essentially measure the periodicity and shape of the heart signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Filtering and motion artifact removal</head><p>The pre-processing and feature extraction steps described in this section contain a review of earlier work implemented with a custom combination of accelerometer and ECG processing platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Due to changes in the implementation of the feature extraction (for example, the change in sampling frequency from 800 Hz in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> to approximately 200 Hz of the smartphone), these methods are discussed in the context of the smartphone application. Also, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, a single accelerometer axis was used to represent the data, whereas in this paper we use six data channels corresponding to three accelerometer and three gyroscope axes. The features represented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> are further supplemented by multiple new features.</p><p>The signal processing pipeline starts with filtering the data (all accelerometer and gyroscope axes) by a bandpass brickwall filter with pass-band frequencies between 1 Hz and 45 Hz (each axis separately). Although the heart rate may be lower than 60 bpm, the majority of the spectrum of heart-related SCG is still above 1 Hz. The purpose of this step is to remove the noise, bias of the signal and to emphasize the actual cardiac vibration signal.</p><p>For accelerometer Z (ACC-Z) data channel, a sliding window RMS (root mean square) filter is applied to capture the energy envelope of the data. If the RMS filtered signal exceeds the median value of the whole signal (in ACC-Z axis) more than an empirically set threshold value, the corresponding section of the signal is declared as an artifact and it is removed from the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. The smartphone is placed on the chest of the patient loudspeaker towards the head and display up so that the ACC-Z channel is parallel to the force of gravity when a person is in supine position. The justification for using ACC-Z axis is that it has been observed to provide good signal quality in our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. As a result, the temporal correspondence of all channels is maintained in the motion artifact removal step. After the noise removal has been completed the algorithm divides the artifact-free signal into constant length (10 seconds) 6-channel segments for further processing and feature extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. FEATURE EXTRACTION</head><p>In order to distinguish between AFib and healthy individuals we hypothesize that the following types of features could be helpful. First, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) differ between these two cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, and by calculating the actual AO-AO or RR interval in SCG it is assumed that an estimation for these features can be obtained, despite that the ECG's RR intervals and SCG's AO-AO intervals are not exactly the same. Second, entropy -either approximative entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, or spectral entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, could provide discrimination, since they measure the self-similarity and the distribution of the spectral content within the signal. As the signal waveform becomes more irregular and aperiodic in AFib, the entropy measures could capture the intrinsic change in the waveforms. Third, turning-point-ratios (TPR) have been used as measures of the complexity of the signal waveform in terms of statistical significance testing, and they have also been previously used to detect AFib in ECG <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. By using the above mentioned methods, some of which already in use in ECG based AFib detection, we hypothesize that the discrimination between the two classes could be obtained in a supervised manner. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref> a list of the selected features is shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Heartbeat detection</head><p>We apply short-term autocorrelation for the pre-processed data segments. This means that multiple autocorrelation windows (we use the term window with autocorrelation) are extracted from the input data specific to a certain axis. By calculating the time-domain autocorrelation and by extracting the  locations of its prominent peaks we obtain the RR intervals of the IMU signal for each axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. By using the sampling rate of approximately 200 Hz of the smartphone, and a window size of 2.5 seconds, the total amount of input samples for a single autocorrelation becomes 500 samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. Overlapping (overlap of 1.5 seconds) autocorrelations are repeated in 1 second intervals over the full duration of the signal segment (in this case of 10 seconds). From one signal segment (of length 10 seconds) we obtain eight RR intervals. This is because the centers of the autocorrelation windows locate 1.25 seconds apart from the borders of the signal segment and 1 second apart in the middle of the signal segment. The eight RR intervals returned by the algorithm are denoted as RR (1):(8) .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. HR and HRV features</head><p>As notations for the following subsections, we introduce mean absolute difference (MAD) and its other version called median absolute difference (here denoted as MEAD). These are derived by calculating either the mean (in MAD) or median (in MEAD) of the vector derived by taking the absolute values of the differences between consecutive samples of a given input vector x (for instance by using notation MAD(x), where x is a RR time interval series calculated from a signal segment).</p><p>The difference operator D is defined as RR (i) -RR (i-1) across the whole signal, and it returns the differences between the values of the consecutive elements. The justifications for using the median instead of mean is its tolerance to outliers.</p><p>The first generated feature set consists of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) which are attained from the RR interval series. The features that we use are rather simple in comparison with more sophisticated measures as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, but allow a more efficient implementation. HR (HR) is calculated as the median of RR (1):(8) and HRV (HRV 1 ) is calculated as MEAD(RR (1):(8) ). Furthermore, we use two higher order HRV estimates which are calculated from second order differences MEAD(D(RR (1):(8) )) and MEAD(ABS(D(RR (1):(8) ))), where ABS() calculates the absolute values of the elements. These are denoted as HRV 2 and HRV 3 , respectively. Using short-term autocorrelation in calculation of these metrics provides also tolerance to interpersonal variations, which are more significant in IMU signals than in ECG <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Approximate entropy estimate (APEN)</head><p>The signal self-similarity paramer AP_EN is inspired by approximate entropy (ApEn) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> and it is calculated by first subsampling the signal with 25 sample (0.125 second) steps. As the initial length of the signal is 2000 samples (10 seconds) the length of the subsampled signal is 80 samples. For the subsampled signal all-against-all matching is performed twice. At the first time, the number of matches between short subsequent signal segments SEG i (of length LD=2) against all other signal segments SEG j (of length LD=2) of the same signal (i = j) is calculated. A counter C is updated to contain the number of matches where max(ABS(SEG i -SEG j )) is less or equal than 0.2 times the overall standard deviation of the signal (while going through the whole subsampled signal and all individual elements of SEG). Based on C a (logarithmic) counter Φ M LD is updated as Φ M 2 = Φ M 2 +log(C) at each instance of the subsampled signal (initialized to zero at the beginning). For the second all-against all matching case the LD parameter is incremented with one, and a similar procedure as above is executed. Finally, the approximate entropy (AP_EN) is calculated from Φ M 2 -Φ M 3 , where both Φ M LD have been normalized (divided) by the total number of samples of the subsampled signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. The reason for the subsampling is to reduce the number of computations. The larger the AP_EN is, the more irregular the signal is, which is here used as an individual feature to predict AFib.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Turning-point ratios (TPR) and RRI-TPR</head><p>Operator RD extracts the total number of (increasing and decreasing) runs (i.e. consecutive increasing or decreasing sequences of values) in signal segment x. Turning point ratio (TPR) of x is defined as RD(x) divided by N -2 where N is the number of elements in x. The turning point ratio of a RR time interval series of signal segment x is denoted as RRITPR and it is defined as TPR(RR (1):(8) ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. Additionally, we use a total of 11 additional TPR features, which are calculated from the original pre-processed signal without extracting the RR time intervals. We use the pre-processed signal segment and its filtered versions as such as inputs to the TPR. The justification for this is that the overall complexity of the signal waveform in different frequency bands is assumed to convey information of the structure of the signal. TPR1 is calculated as TPR(x), where x is the original pre-processed signal segment (of a specific axis). Additionally, we use 10 more TPR values calculated from filtered signals. TPR3,8,9,10,11 are calculated from bandpass filtered signal, each parameter calculated with different passband range. TPR2,4,5,6,7 are calculated from bandpass filtered signal that is furthermore passed through absolute value operation and a long triangular shaped smoothing filter. We believe, that the number of runs in the signal after pre-processing and with different filters represent the complexity of the signal waveform, which can then be used as an indicator of Afib.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Spectral entropy</head><p>The estimation of spectral entropy starts with removing the breathing component from the acquired signal. This is implemented by substracting a median filtered version (S m ) of the signal from the original signal S. The median filter length in S m is 60 samples, i.e. 0.3 seconds with 200 Hz sampling rate. The resulting signal S n is calculated as S n =S-S m . S n contains the signal without the breathing component and in the following step all negative values of S n are replaced with zero values. The new signal is denoted as S nz , which contains only values greater or equal than zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Then, the signal S nz is multiplied with a Hamming window (to avoid unwanted side lobes) and a power spectrum is calculated by taking FFT from the signal. The purpose of this step is to extract the spectral content of the signal. The frequency interval F int (in the range [1 Hz, 11 Hz]) is then selected from the resulting signal S F F T and an estimated noise floor is then removed from the frequency content representation. The noise floor is extracted by finding frequencies with energy amplitude values S F F T &lt;1/6*max(S F F T ) within the F int . The purpose of noise floor removal is to avoid frequent low frequency components affecting to the result. The resulting S F F T N is normalized to unit probability resulting into probability density P F F T N . Finally, the spectral entropy of the signal is calculated according to the formula of entropy as SP_ENT =-(P F F T N * log(P F F T N )). In general, the larger SP_ENT is, the more random the signal frequency content is, which implies that the signal may be aperiodic. The signal periodicity (or lack of it) is then used as an individual feature indicating the presense or absence of Afib.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CLASSIFICATION AND FEATURE ANALYSIS A. Classification principle</head><p>Let us assume that two minutes of data has been obtained with the smartphone and 50 seconds of the captured data was detected as artifact free (the motion artifact removal procedure was described in Section II-B). The resulting 50 second data is divided into five 10 second segments. For each of these 5 segments feature extraction is carried out, so that the same features are calculated from each of the 6 data channels.</p><p>Finally, the features of each channel are concatenated in a row-wise form for classification. The total number of features per channel (axis) is 18 (including 1x HR, 3x HRV, 1x AP EN, 11x TPR, 1x RRI-TRP and 1x SP ENT features). Thus, the total number of features for one 10 second data segment is 108. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the classification process. For classification in Matlab we used Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel SVM (KSVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. The classifier was used to assign persons into either AFib or healthy class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Cross-validation and majority voting</head><p>We use leave-one-person-out (LOOCV) cross validation to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the AFib classification algorithm. The reason of using LOOCV is that it is well suited for cases where the amount of data is limited. LOOCV means that one person at a time is left out from the training set, so that the training set contains no data specific to the individual who is being tested (the classifier was not tuned with the test data of that person). This is possible since, as mentioned, each data segment is associated with an anonymous label corresponding to an individual. The classification procedure is iterated as many times as there are test persons in total N_TOT, where N_TOT=N_HEALTHY+N_AFib. After all iterations, all individual data segments have been associated into one of the two classes. After that, majority voting selects the most common class for each person (based on multiple successive 10 second segments of that individual), which is the final prediction result. Before the classification process, each data segment (feature vector) was associated with an anonymous label of the individual under test. This way it was possible to implement both the cross-validation and the majority voting in such a way that multiple data segments are associated to single individual. The majority voting simply calculates which class (AFib or healthy) is more common for a specific person and declares this class as the result of the final classification (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> upper right corner). The number of signal segments applied to classification from each person after artifact removal is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref> (the AFib and healthy classes are shown separately).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Classification results</head><p>The confusion matrices of our AFib detection method are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">IV</ref>. The sensitivity is calculated as TP/(TP+FN) (true positives divided by all positives) and specificity as 1-FP/(TN+FP) (true negatives divided by all negatives). The corresponding positive predictive value (PPV) is defined as TP/(TP+FP) and negative predictive value (NPV) as TN/(FN+TN). The best performing classifier was the KSVM with a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 100% (with majority voting). Without majority voting the sensitivity and specificity of KSVM were 84.7% and 98.7%, respectively. Without majority voting PPV and NPV for KSVM were 96.7% and 93.3%, respectively, and with majority voting 100% and 95.8%, respectively. PPV measures the probability that a subject with positive test result have the disease and NPV the probability that the subject with negative test result do </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFIB PATIENTS (ID)</head><p>#  not have the disease. Person specific LOOCV cross validation was used to obtain the confusion matrices. It can be observed from the confusion matrices without majority voting that a vast majority of data was situated in the healthy class, thus the overall classification result could be made more balanced by for instance, collecting more AFib data.</p><p>In order to highlight the effect of the features applied in this work for smartphone data in comparison with only two features used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> -i.e. HRV (heart rate variability) and SP ENT (spectral entropy) -the sensitivity and the specificity of the KSVM classifier and ACC-Z axis only (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> but with smartphone data) were 60.6% and 87.9%, respectively, without majority voting, and 75% and 95.7%, with majority voting (using the two features only). Thus, the applied new features improve the detection accuracy significantly. By using all six axis and only features HRV and SP ENT (a total of 12 features), the sensitivity and specificity of the KSVM classifier were 70.1% and 89.6%, respectively, without majority voting, and 87.5% and 91.3%, respectively, with majority voting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The prediction accuracy of different features</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> the AFib detection accuracy of the SVM, KSVM and RF classifiers with majority voting are shown with different features. The figure contains the sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) of each case as well as the accuracy (ACC), which is calculated as (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN). It can be observed, that in the case of KSVM the TPR (turning-pointratios), HRV (heart rate variability) and HR (heart rate) provide the best accuracy. In the case of SVM HR does not perform as well, but HRV, TPR and AP_EN compensate for this. The good performance of HRV in both is not surprising, as AFib generally occurs as random fluctuations in the RR interval. For the RF classifier the effects of HR, TPR and RRI_TPR to the classification are emphasized.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> it can be observed how the mean and standard deviation of the different features vary among all axes. Starting from the left (1st feature), spectral entropy SP_ENT, the mean is slightly higher in the case of AFib than with normal subjects, which is expected since the entropy is higher in the case </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RF (ENSEMBLE)</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The recognition accuracy of different classifiers with feature types. The features used are SPENT (total of 1/axis), HRV (total of 3/axis), HR (total of 1/axis), TPR (total of 11/axis), RRI_TPR (total of 1/axis), ApEn (total of 1/axis) and all of the (total of 18/axis) features together. In this case the actual number of features used is 6 times the number of features/axis (i.e. 6x18 for all features). The best feature classes and combined features (all features) are highlighted in each case.</p><p>Feature number   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>) in cases of healthy individuals and AFib. The different data axes are combined so that each mean and SD is based on utilizing data in all axes, i.e. there are six times more values in the calculation than for single axis. The y-axis scale is normalized against the global maximum value of each specific feature (in healthy and AFib classes jointly). The axes where p-value calculated with Wilcoxon rank sum test (between AFib and healthy classes) is not below 0.001 are also indicated. According to both two-sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test, only the feature number 15 does not contain statistically significant difference between the means or the medians (p &gt; 0.05, considering all axes).</p><p>of less periodic signals such as AFib. The mean of HRV is higher in AFib in comparison with healthy case and also the standard deviation of HRV is higher, which corresponds well to the definition of AFib as having irregularly irregular RR intervals. The third column from the left HR (heart rate), is measured in samples within a RR interval. It can be observed that the mean RR interval is approximately 181 samples for the healthy subjects and around 158 samples for the AFib patients. These correspond to the average heart rates of 66 bpm (beats-per-minute) and 76 bpm, respectively. However, during instant paroxysmal AFib the heart rate may be even much higher. The healthy control subjects of the study were younger than the AFib patients, which can explain part of the increase in the HR. However, in the view of the application of discriminating between AFib persons and healthy subjects, young control subjects are actually more challenging, since the HRV tends to smoothen with aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. It is more difficult to distinguish whether a young subject has AFib than an old subject. Anyway, it is expected that part of the increase in HR is explained by the nature of AFib. It can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, that the difference between each feature (except for the feature number 15) in AFib and normal cases is statistically significant.</p><p>Continuing the examination of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, the mean of the RRI_TPR feature is higher in the case of AFib, which can be expected, since the signal is more random in the AFib case and the RR intervals vary more. The interpretation of the other TPR features is more challenging, but they describe the overall shape of the signal, while it is assumed that the machine learning algorithm is capable to select a proper combination of these in order to distinguish between the healthy subjects and AFib. Finally, the mean of the approximate entropy AP_EN is higher in the case of AFib, due to the irregularity in the AFib waveform. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> all the data samples (by considering each axis separately) are shown against two most important (largest variance) principal components of the data. The healthy samples are in black (marked with dot) and AFib samples in red (marked with an x). It can be observed, that all the features facilitate the discrimination of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The performance of accelerometer and gyroscope axes</head><p>The detection accuracy of different accelerometer and gyroscope axes are compared (within the same framework and classifiers than before) in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The purpose of using features extracted from several axes is to enable the supervised machine learning algorithm to take care of the combination of the axes in a way which maximizes the recognition accuracy. However, each algorithm's way of interpreting the data is different, and it is beneficial to study how they perform in terms of mining knowledge from separate axes. First, it can be observed that the GYROX axis is the best in the case of KSVM, and in the case of SVM the GYROY axis. In the case of RF classifier, both GYROX and GYROY perform the best. In general it can be observed that the gyroscope axes are better in terms of detection accuracy than the accelerometer axes. Thus, the utilization of the smartphone's built-in gyroscope indeed seems to be beneficial for the purposes of AFib detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the case of RF classifier, the combining of the axes did not improve the overall recognition rate to the extent of the other classifiers.</p><p>In general, we consider that the combination of the axes provides tolerance to noise and artifacts (and the best performing axis is not necessarily known a priori), thus the combined result (ALL axes in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) usually is the best choice. We considered it as the final classification result. In general, in accounting also other applications that we have tested, for instance, accelerometer based gating in PET (positron emission tomography) imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>) we have noticed that the signal quality of ACCZ axis is usually the best one when considering the accelerometer axes only, and when considering all the six data channels the GYRO-Y axis is usually is the best one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT ISSUES</head><p>We have implemented a smartphone application, which performs signal acquisition by user's request, feature extraction, and KSVM based classification (which was one of the best performing classifiers in this study). All the processing steps are performed locally on a smartphone. As a result the application informs the user, whether he/she suffers from AFib or not. However, there are still some issues that need further investigation before the application would reach a commercial level in order to be distributed globally. For instance, as the sampling rate was stable enough for the smartphone that we used, its base frequency may be different in other smartphone models. There also exist a varying component in the sampling frequency of a few Hz, which is most probably related to running other programs on the same operating system. Furthermore, the IMU devices containing the accelerometer and the gyroscope may have different device parameters, which vary between smartphone models due to chip level implementation issues. All these can have an effect to the overall performance and applicability of the developed algorithms and thus need to be taken into account.</p><p>The mobile application (called SUMM) is based on Android (mobile) operating system developed by Google. We have tested the application on smartphones by various vendors. Due to good sensor signal quality, Sony Xperia Z-series family smartphones were most frequently used. The device sampling rate detected for accelerometer and gyroscope in that case was between approximately 198 Hz and 200 Hz. Apart from Sony Xperia Z-series, Samsung Galaxy S5 also gave the sensor sampling rate around 200 Hz. The feature vector used in KSVM classification was generated with the device specific sampling rate. As mentioned, the smartphone specific sampling rate can vary slightly from the sampling rate used in generating the training set. We did not encounter any problems due to this slight difference. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows two example screenshots from the application running in Sony Xperia Z3. The two images on the left show the summary of a person with normal sinus rhythm and the images on the right show a summary of a person with AFib. Only ACCZ and GYROY axes signals, which are usually the best axes, are shown in the figure.  <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The distribution of the data in two main principal components (bi-plot) after principal component analysis (PCA). The data has been normalized before applying the PCA. The AFib samples are in red (marked with an x) and healthy samples in black (marked with dot). As in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, the different data axes are combined so that the dimension of each feature is 18 (and it is based on utilizing data in all axes, i.e. there are six times more samples than for single axis). Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The recognition accuracy of different classifiers with a changing accelerometer and gyroscope axes. The total number of features in each axis is 18. The best axes and combined axes (using all axes) are highlighted in each case.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Two screenshots from the AFib detection application running in Sony Xperia Z3. On the left a normal subject, and on the right an AFib subject. The data is shown only in (ACC-Z and GYRO-Y) axes. Before starting the measurement, the information of the user is filled in, and after the measurement the application informs the user whether he/she has AFib. The patient in this case suffered from chronic AFib, where the heart rate is made lower by medication and therefore the heart rate of the AFib patient is relatively low.</p><p>Recent iPhones have a built-in motion co-processor, which can be expected to decrease the jitter in the sampling rate. In our initial tests, the maximum base sampling frequency obtainable with iPhone was approximately 100 Hz, while the signal quality observed appeared visually very good. Eventually there would be a need to implement a solution, which could adapt to slight differences between the signals (sampling rate, signal morphology) originating from different devices. Thus, our current implementation can be seen as a proof-of-concept work, which will require further development in order to be applied more widely. Whether the different base sampling frequency has an effect to the performance of the envisioned application in iPhone, and which measures need to be taken, will be left for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head><p>In this paper we presented a smartphone-only solution targeted to screening of AFib from large masses. Our solution was based on the well known principles of seismocardiography <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, [18], <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, extended with a newly proposed cardiac sensing modality gyroscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, in the context of ballistocardiography machine learning was used to classify between AFib and normal persons using data from bed sensor. In our approach, IMU signals obtained from a smartphone which is placed on the chest of the patient are used to detect AFib. In the year 2016 there existed about 2 billion smartphones globally which is estimated to increase to more than 2.6 billion in 2019. Thus, this work is first step towards implementing efficient AFib screening of the global population.</p><p>Despite of this, a lot of research needs to be conducted before the release of the envisioned AFib screening solution. The effect of premature atrial beats (premature heart beats originating from the atria), premature ventricular beats, and other arrhythmias such as atrial flutter to the performance of the develeped algorithm should be evaluated, as these might be similar in appearance to AFib. To accomplish this, we will need to extract data from synchronized ECG and smartphone SCG, to verify the apprearance and to distinguish between different phenomena present in SCG and ECG. Also, other arrhythmias will need to be covered, as this paper only focused on the separation between AFib and sinus rhythm. As a summary, much research is still needed in order to develop a final solution for AFib screening with high clinical value. Also, the sample size of this study was quite small and more extensive clinical studies will need to be performed in the future.</p><p>We want to emphasize, that the purpose of the application is not to make the final diagnosis for a person suffering from AFib, but to advice to seek for medical care and final diagnosis by a cardiologist. In an envisioned usage scenario of the system, a patient (or a person belonging into a risk group) performs self-measurements to screen for occurrence of AFib. In the case of a positive result given by a smartphone, there would be a need to visit a cardiologist to rule out the possibility of AFib. In any case, a trained cardiologist will use ECG (and potentially other modalities) for the final diagnosis. This paper concentrated on detection. are planning that in the future there could be more categories to be classified, corresponding to a more versatile set of heart conditions and abnormalities. This might somewhat lower the performance of individual abnormality detection (as in ECG), but on the other hand better serve the mobile application user's cardiac health.</p><p>Collecting (Big) data from application users could also be a viable option for improving the classification performance. However, as the true classes for this data might not be known, it would be beneficial to explore the application of unsupervised classification methods for obtaining the data classes or categories. We have also initially applied PCA to reduce the dimension of the feature space (108 features), but at this point an improvement to the classification accuracy was not yet obtained. As the application gives the classification result very rapidly after the data collection, we did not see the application of dimensionality reduction necessary. As there already exist mobile ECG devices, which can be used for the diagnosis of various heart abnormalities, an interesting issue to study in the future would be the combination of the IMU data and ECG, and whether it would allow improving the detection of AFib and other conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have implemented an application for the detection of AFib, which takes advantage the inbuild IMU unit within smartphones to acquire a heart signal. This is an alternative approach to smartphone camera and flash illumination based AFib detection and has some advantages. The approach that we propose is based on compact MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope, which are being constantly developed by smartphone component manufacturers keeping in mind the potential health applications. The IMU based approach could also be scalable to other wearable devices and even body-sensor networks utilizing multiple IMUs. We obtained sensitivity of 93.8%, specificity of 100.0% and detection accuracy of 97.4% in AFib detection, while excluding any data specific to the person under test from the training set (leave-oneperson-out cross validation, LOOCV). We are expecting that the final application (either freely available or commercial) could provide a positive impact on global cardiac health, due to wide availablity of smartphones worldwide.</p></div>
