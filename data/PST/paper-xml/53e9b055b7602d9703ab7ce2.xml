<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The problem of sequential testing of multiple hypotheses is considered, and two candidate sequential test procedures are studied. Both tests are multihypothesis versions of the binary sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), and are referred to as MSPRT's. The first test is motivated by Bayesian optimality arguments, while the second corresponds to a generalized likelihood ratio test. It is shown that both MSPRT's are asymptotically optimal relative not only to the expected sample size but also to any positive moment of the stopping time distribution, when the error probabilities or, more generally, risks associated with incorrect decisions are small. The results are first derived for the discrete-time case of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations and simple hypotheses. They are then extended to general, possibly continuous-time, statistical models that may include correlated and nonhomogeneous observation processes. It also demonstrated that the results can be extended to hypothesis testing problems with nuisance parameters, where the composite hypotheses, due to nuisance parameters, can be reduced to simple ones by using the principle of invariance. These results provide a complete generalization of the results given in [36], where it was shown that the quasi-Bayesian MSPRT is asymptotically efficient with respect to the expected sample size for i.i.d. observations. In a companion paper [12], based on the nonlinear renewal theory we find higher order approximations, up to a vanishing term, for the expected sample size that take into account the overshoot over the boundaries of decision statistics.</p></div>

A sequential test picks a stopping time and a final decision rule to effect a tradeoff between sample size and decision accuracy.</p><p>The majority of research in sequential hypothesis testing has been restricted to two hypotheses. However, there are several situations, particularly in engineering applications, where it is natural to consider more than two hypotheses. Examples include, among a multitude of others, target detection in multiple-resolution radar <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and infrared systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, signal acquisition in direct sequence code-division multiple access systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, and statistical pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. It is thus of interest to study sequential testing of more than two hypotheses.</p><p>It is well known that for binary hypotheses testing , Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) is optimal, in the sense that it simultaneously minimizes both expectations of the sample size among all tests (sequential and nonsequential) for which the probabilities of error do not exceed predefined values (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wald</ref> and Wolfowitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, Chernoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and Lehmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). Unfortunately, if , it is not clear if there even exists a test that minimizes the expected sample size for all hypotheses. Moreover, existing research indicates that even if such a test exists, it would be very difficult to find its structure. For this reason a substantial part of the development of sequential multihypothesis testing has been directed toward the study of practical, suboptimal sequential tests and the evaluation of their asymptotic performance, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, and many others. A model for studying such asymptotics was first introduced by Chernoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, wherein he studied the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) case and assumed a cost per observation that was allowed to go to zero. Generalization to non-i.i.d. cases (where loglikelihood ratios fail to be random walks) have been made by Golubev and Khas'minskii <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Lai <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Tartakovsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, as well as Verdenskaya and Tartakovskii <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</p><p>For the binary SPRT, it is well known that renewal theory is useful in obtaining asymptotically exact expressions for expected sample sizes and error probabilities (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>). An approach to applying renewal theory techniques to sequential multihypothesis tests was recently elucidated by Baum and Veeravalli <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, wherein they studied a generalization <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> of the SPRT to more than two hypotheses that is motivated by a Bayesian setting. This quasi-Bayesian multihypothesis SPRT (or MSPRT) was shown to be amenable to an asymptotic analysis using nonlinear renewal theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, and asymptotic expressions for the expected sample size and error probabilities were obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Furthermore, it was established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> that the quasi-Bayesian MSPRT is asymptotically efficient with respect to expected sample size, for the i.i.d. observation case.</p><p>In this paper, we continue to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the quasi-Bayesian MSPRT, as well as a related test that corresponds to a generalized likelihood ratio test. The latter test was suggested by Armitage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> in various contexts. We provide a complete generalization of previous results, including that obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, in the following directions: i) we show that both MSPRT's are asymptotically optimal relative not only to the expected sample size but also to any positive moment of the stopping time distribution; and ii) we extend these results to general, possibly continuous-time, statistical models that may include correlated and nonhomogeneous observation processes. We also demonstrate that our results are applicable to hypothesis testing problems with nuisance parameters. This complete generalization justifies the use of the MSPRT's in a variety of applications, some of which are discussed in the paper.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we formulate the problem, present a motivation, and describe the structure of sequential test procedures. In Section III, we derive lower bounds for the finite moments of the stopping time distribution under very general conditions, which then are used in proving asymptotic optimality. In Section IV, first we consider the discrete-time i.i.d. case and prove that, under certain natural conditions, both tests minimize not only the expected sample size but also any positive moment of the stopping time distribution as error probabilities (or, more generally, decision risks) tend to zero. Then the asymptotic optimality results are shown to be valid for general statistical models that involve correlated and nonhomogeneous observation processes. This generalization to non-i.i.d. cases is done in the spirit of the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, and we borrow many auxiliary results from this work. Section V deals with a specific class of multipopulation problems-the so-called "slippage" problems. It is shown that slippage problems are related to problems that arise in target detection in multiresolution or multichannel systems. In Section VI, we illustrate the general results through examples related to detecting signals in multichannel systems, including composite testing situations with nuisance parameters. Finally, in Section VII we give some concluding remarks.</p><p>Higher order approximations for the expected sample size up to a vanishing term will be given in the companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. These approximations take into account the overshoot over the boundaries of decision statistics, and their derivation is based on nonlinear renewal theory. In the companion paper, we also present simulation results which confirm that the obtained approximations are highly accurate not only for small but also for moderate error probabilities which are typical for many applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Basic Notation</head><p>Throughout the paper P is a probability space on which everything is defined, is a random process (defined on ), which is observed either in discrete or continuous time. By will be denoted a sub--algebra of generated by observed up to time . We first consider the problem of sequential testing of simple hypotheses " P P " where and P are completely known distinct probability measures. An example where the measures P are not completely known (belong to some families of distributions) will be considered in Section VI.</p><p>A pair is said to be a sequential hypothesis test if is a Markov stopping time with respect to the family (i.e., ), and is an measurable function (terminal decision function) with values in the set . Therefore, is identified with accepting the hypothesis . Next, let be the prior distribution of hypotheses, , and let the consequence of deciding when the hypothesis is true be evaluated by the loss function . Suppose, without loss of generality, that the losses due to correct decisions are zero (i.e.,</p><p>). The risk associated with making the decision is then given by where for , P is the probability of accepting the hypothesis when is true (the conditional probability of error). Note that is the risk associated with wrong decisions; their sum constitutes the average risk which does not include the observation or experiment cost. In the particular case of the zero-one loss function, where for , the risk is the same as frequentist error probability , which is probability of accepting incorrectly. That is, for the zero-one loss function We now introduce the following class of tests</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(2.1)</formula><p>where is a vector of positive finite numbers. In other words, the class consists of the tests for which the risks do not exceed the predefined numbers . In what follows, E will denote the expectation with respect to the measure P . A reasonable formulation of the problem of optimizing sequential tests under given prior information is to find a test that minimizes the average observation time, E E , among all tests belonging to the class</p><p>The structure of such a test has been determined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). Specifically, if time is discrete, i.e., and the observations are i.i.d., the optimal stopping time is given by , where is the first time , , for which . Here is the posterior probability of the th hypothesis based on the first observations, is the vector of posterior probabilities with th component excluded, and is a nonlinear function depending on the distribution of observations. Thus the optimal test involves a comparison of posterior probabilities with random thresholds which must be determined for each model. In general, it is nearly impossible to find the form of the functions (for some special cases see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). Furthermore, even if one is able to find the boundaries of the optimal test, it would be difficult to implement this procedure in practice. In addition, while in the case of two hypotheses Wald's SPRT minimizes not only the average observation time E but also both expectations E and E , it is unclear if such a test exists for (i.e., the test which minimizes E for all ). However, in an asymptotic setting when the risks (error probabilities) are sufficiently small, such tests may be found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Sequential Test Procedures</head><p>In the following, we simplify the structure of the optimal test by replacing the nonlinear random thresholds with simple functions (constants in the case of the zero-one loss function). Specifically, we consider the two following multialternative sequential tests which will be called multihypothesis sequential probability ratio tests (MSPRT's). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> The time parameter may be either discrete or continuous. Let P be the restriction of the measure P to the -algebra and let P Q denote the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) processes with respect to a dominating measure Q . If Q P , the corresponding LLR process will be denoted . if</p><p>That is, we stop as soon as the threshold in (2.2) is exceeded for some , and decide that this is the true hypothesis. This test is motivated by a Bayesian framework and was considered earlier by Fishman <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Golubev and Khas'minskii <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Sosulin and Fishman <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Tartakovsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, as well as Baum and Veeravalli <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Indeed, in the special case of zero-one losses the stopping times may be rewritten as where and where</p><p>is the posterior probability of the hypothesis . Note also that if (does not depend on ), the stopping time of the test is defined by where i.e., we stop as soon as the largest posterior probability exceeds a threshold.</p><p>2) Test : Let and</p><p>(2.3) be the Markov "accepting" time for the hypothesis . The test is defined as follows:</p><p>if This test represents a modification of the matrix SPRT (the combination of one-sided SPRT's) that was suggested by Lorden <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. It was considered earlier by Armitage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Lorden <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, Dragalin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Tartakovsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, as well as Verdenskaya and Tartakovskii <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. Note also that if and the loss function is zero-one, then and the Markov time may be represented in the form where i.e., is the generalized likelihood ratio between and the remaining hypotheses.</p><p>Suppose the distributions of the observations come from exponential families, which are good models for many applications. Then the test (as defined in (2.3)) has an advantage over the first test in that it does not require exponential transformations of the observations. This fact makes it more convenient for practical realization and simulation. Furthermore, may easily be modified to meet constraints on conditional risks (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>) that may be more relevant in some practical applications. However, as we shall see in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>,</p><p>has the advantage that it is easier to design the thresholds to precisely meet constraints on the risks . We begin our analysis by deriving bounds on the risks in terms of the thresholds. This allows us to choose the thresholds in such a way as to guarantee that the tests belong to the class defined in (2.1). We emphasize that the bounds hold under general assumptions, and require neither independence nor homogeneity of the observed data. The proof is given in the Appendix (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> for related results). It should be pointed out that the following implication holds:</p><p>(2.5)</p><p>To show (2.5) we rewrite and as and Then, inequality (2.5) follows from the fact that A consequence of (2.5) is that if the thresholds are chosen according to (2.4), then .</p></div>

LOWER BOUNDS FOR MOMENTS OF THE STOPPING TIME DISTRIBUTION</head><p>The following theorem is of fundamental importance for proving asymptotic optimality. It establishes the potential asymptotic performance of any sequential or nonsequential multihypothesis test in the class as the risks go to zero. For convenience, we write . Also the standard abbreviation P-a.s. is used for the almost sure convergence under the measure P. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Case of i.i.d. Observations</head><p>So far we considered quite a general case imposing only minor restrictions on the structure of the observed process. In this subsection we consider the discrete-time case and assume that, under hypothesis , the random variables are i.i.d. with a density (relative to some sigma-finite measure) and that the densities and are distinct for all . In other words, these densities do not coincide with probability one (w.p. 1) in the sense that P for all and all . In general, the 's will represent -valued random vectors, i.e., . Let us define to be the log-likelihood ratio of the individual observation , i.e., and Further, we define E Note that the are the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information numbers ("distances"), and is a minimal distance between the hypothesis and other hypotheses. Due to the aforementioned condition of distinctness of measures, these KL distances are strictly positive. We shall also assume that . In what follows, we will consider a general, asymmetric case (with respect to risk constraints) where it is assumed that the numbers approach zero in such a way that for all (4.1)</p><p>That is, we assume that the ratios (or more generally and ) are bounded away from and . This guarantees that any does not go to zero at an exponentially faster (slower) rate than any other . Note that we do not require that the 's go to zero at the same rate-if this were the case all the 's would equal . The reason for allowing 's other than is that there are many interesting problems for which the risks for the various hypotheses may be orders of magnitude different.</p><p>The following lemma establishes the asymptotic lower bounds for the moments of the stopping time in the i.i.d. case. It is then used to prove the asymptotic optimality of the analyzed tests in the class (2.1) as . For , the asymptotic formulas of (4.3) describe the behavior of the first term of expansion of the mean sample size. The behavior of the second term remains unclear-it may tend to infinity or may be of the order of a constant. In the companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we derive higher order approximations to the expected sample size up to a vanishing term. These approximations require further conditions on the higher moments of the LLR's. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, in a special asymmetric case, the second term is of the order of (a constant) whenever the second moment of LLR's is finite. In general, however, the second term is shown to tend to infinity as a square root of the threshold. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 4.2:</head><p>We emphasize that the tests considered asymptotically minimize all positive moments of the observation time, under only the condition of positiveness and finiteness of the KL distances-finiteness of higher order moments is not required. The required condition holds in most practical problems. In particular, in problems of signal detection, all that is required is that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) be finite and positive. and the same is, of course, true for the test . This fact may be derived by using the results of Lorden <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We conjecture that (4.6) is also true for the more general case given in (4.1). We do not have a rigorous proof, but simulation results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> support our conjecture.</p><p>Remark 4.4: Since the two proposed MSPRT's have distinctly different structures, and are both asymptotically optimal, it is natural to ask if this asymptotic optimality is shared by a host of other tests. Clearly, since we only have first-order optimality, simple modifications of the proposed MSPRT's (such as adding a constant delay) preserve the optimality property. However, it is interesting to see if some other seemingly reasonable test with a very different structure will also have this property. As an example, consider the following. For simplicity, let for all and let be the maximum-likelihood test procedure of the form if where the threshold is chosen so that . Note that this test is a natural extension of the optimum fixed sample size test under a constraint on the Bayes risk . Now, using the results of Sosulin and Fishman <ref type="bibr">[30, pp. 179-182]</ref> it can be proved that in a symmetric i.i.d. Gaussian case E E as</p><p>That is, the seemingly reasonable maximum-likelihood test is not asymptotically optimum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Non-i.i.d. Case</head><p>Many results in sequential analysis, including the ones that we obtained above, are based on the random walk structure of LLR's. In this subsection we study the situation where the LLR's lose this nice property, and are general, possibly continuous-time, processes. The motivation for this study is as follows. The random walk structure is not valid in many practical applications where observations are nonhomogeneous and/or correlated. In addition, there is an important class of problems with nuisance parameters that admit invariant solutions. Invariant LLR's are not random walks even in the simplest cases where the models generate i.i.d. observations. Note that the derivation of lower bounds for E in Theorem 3.1 (see <ref type="bibr">(</ref> 4 This definition of strong complete convergence should not be confused with that of complete convergence (which is equivalent to 1-quick convergence) given in Hsu and Robbins <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, Tartakovsky established a result similar to (4.11) for the MSPRT but for the situation where constraints are imposed on the conditional error probabilities P . The asymptotics (4.9) and (4.10) are new and perhaps the most useful, since they allow us to obtain asymptotics under a variety of constraints.</p><p>The rigorous proof of Theorem 4.2 is given in the Appendix. Here we present a heuristic argument that leads to this theorem. We focus our attention on the test , since, as is clear from (2.5), the corresponding asymptotics for follow from those for .</p><p>Introduce the following notation:</p><p>Note that the condition (4.8) implies in particular that the mean value of the LLR is asymptotically equal to , as . Thus we may expect that for the large where is the stochastic part of . Now, if fluctuations of are not too large, which is expressed in terms of P --quick convergence , then it may be expected that the stochastic part is substantially less than (in average). Therefore, which for large and gives E Since , we also expect E On the other hand, if we choose the numbers as in (2.4), the right-hand side of the latter inequality is the first term of expansion in the lower bound for E in the corresponding class (see Theorem 3.1). Thus we expect that the tests and are asymptotically optimal when the error probabilities approach zero. It should be pointed out that since is not a Markov time, it is usually not easy to check the -quick convergence condition (4.8). The following condition implies (4.8) and is sometimes useful. If, for any P (4.13) then (4.8) is true. The integral in (4.13) is replaced by a sum in the discrete-time case. (See Chow and Lai <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for some related inequalities and conditions in the i.i.d. case, and Tartakovsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> for the general case.) This condition will be checked in a number of examples in Section VI. Remark 4.5: In the i.i.d. case, the condition E is necessary and sufficient for the -quick convergence of (see (4.13) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). Therefore, Theorem 4.2 implies the asymptotic formulas (4.4) in Theorem 4.1 for under conditions E . Since Theorem 4.1 holds for any under the weaker condition E , this shows that Theorem 4.1 does not follow from Theorem 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SLIPPAGE PROBLEMS</head><p>In this section we apply the general results obtained above to a specific multiple decision problem called the slippage problem (see Ferguson <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Mosteller <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>). Suppose there are populations whose distribution functions are identical except possibly for different shifts . On the basis of samples from the populations we wish to decide whether or not the populations are equal or one of these populations has slipped to the right of the rest and, if so, which one (e.g., which is the "odd" one).

EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section we consider examples which are meaningful for many applications including target detection in multiple-resolution radar <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and infrared systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, signal acquisition in direct sequence code-division multiple-access systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, and statistical pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The first is a discrete-time but non-i.i.d. example, the second is a continuous-time example, and the third includes nonparametric models and invariant sequential tests. The main goal in these examples is to show that the conditions required for our results, particularly in the non-i.i.d. cases, are reasonable and are usually met in practice. Detailed numerical and simulation results for the i.i.d. case are presented in the companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Example 1: Discrete-time detection/identification of a deterministic signal in the presence of correlated noise in a multichannel system.

It should be noted that in the application to signal detection, the quantity is a constraint on the risk associated with missing the signal when it is actually present on one of the channels (see (5.2)). Similarly, is a constraint on the risk associated with deciding that the signal is present on channel , which is a weighted sum of false alarm probability and the probability of incorrect classification (see <ref type="bibr">(5.3)</ref>).

Now, from the analysis of Section IV-B, it is not clear if condition (4.8) is necessary to guarantee the corresponding optimality of the tests. In the following, we show that if (4.8) is not fulfilled, the sequential tests considered may have infinite moments.

So far we considered the case of simple hypotheses assuming that the measures P P P were completely known. However, in many practical applications, the models are known only partially (parametric uncertainty) or they may even be unknown (nonparametric uncertainty). The above ideas, particularly Theorem 4.2, may be used to prove asymptotic optimality of invariant multihypothesis sequential tests for composite hypotheses " P ," . Here are families of distributions, either parametric or nonparametric, and it is assumed that they can be reduced to simple ones by using the principle of invariance (for further details related to the invariance principle in testing hypotheses, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ferguson [14]</ref> and Lehmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). 5  In fact, Theorem 4. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Most of the research on sequential hypothesis testing over the last fifty years, starting with the classical works of Wald <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> and Wald and Wolfowitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, has dealt with the case of i.i.d. observations and the optimality (or asymptotic optimality) of sequential tests relative to the expected sample size. However, in many practical applications the i.i.d. assumption does not hold. Furthermore, the behavior of higher order moments may be of interest. The results presented in this paper show that the proposed MSPRT's are asymptotically optimal under fairly general conditions that cover nonhomogeneous and correlated stochastic processes observed either in discrete or continuous time, stochastic models with nuisance parameters, and even nonparametric models. In addition, the tests are shown to be asymptotically optimal not only with respect to the expected sample size but also with respect to any moment of the stopping time distribution. This justifies the use of the MSPRT's in a variety of applications, some of which have been described in this paper.</p><p>Throughout the analysis of the paper we assumed that the hypotheses were simple with respect to the informative parameters. If the hypotheses are composite, then an adaptive approach may be applied (see, e.g., Dragalin and Novikov <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) to find asymptotically optimal solutions. However, we have reasons to believe that in spite of their asymptotic optimality, the corresponding adaptive tests will not perform well in practice. (The asymptotic convergence is generally too slow for such tests.) Thus a reasonable partitioning of composite hypotheses into a number of simple ones and subsequent application of the MSPRT's may be beneficial in practice.</p><p>The results presented above do not cover an important case for many applications, namely, one where there is an "indifference" zone. This important extension will be considered elsewhere. ). This completes the proof of ii). Proof of Theorem 4.2: Theorem 4.2 will be proved only for the MSPRT . For the MSPRT the proof is essentially the same and is omitted. In fact, most of the results, including the asymptotic optimality of , follow immediately from (2.5).</p></div>
