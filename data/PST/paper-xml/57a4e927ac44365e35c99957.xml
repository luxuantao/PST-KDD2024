<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the emergence of ever-growing advanced vehicular applications, the challenges to meet the demands from both communication and computation are increasingly prominent. Without powerful communication and computational support, various vehicular applications and services will still stay in the concept phase and cannot be put into practice in the daily life. Thus, solving this problem is of great importance. The existing solutions such as cellular networks, roadside units and mobile cloud computing are far from perfect because they highly depend on and bear the cost of additional infrastructures deployment. Given tremendous number of vehicles in urban area, putting these underutilized vehicular resources into use offers great opportunity and value. Therefore, we conceive the idea of utilizing vehicles as the infrastructures for communication and computation, named vehicular fog computing (VFC), which is an architecture that utilizes a collaborative multitude of end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out communication and computation, based on better utilization of individual communication and computational resources of each vehicle. By aggregating abundant resources of individual vehicles, the quality of services and applications can be enhanced greatly. In particular, by discussing four types of scenarios of moving and parked vehicles as the communication and computational infrastructures, we carry on a quantitative analysis of the capacities of VFC.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Urban vehicular networks are recognized as a significant component of the future intelligent transportation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and they support various mobile services ranging from the content sharing applications (e.g. advertisements and entertainments) to the information spreading services (e.g. emergency operations for natural disaster and terrorist attack) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. These urban vehicular networks ensure driving safety, traffic efficiency and great convenience by exchanging valuable information. During the last decade, with the emergence of more advanced equipments and technologies, such as cellular networks and cloud computing, vehicular networks and associated applications have been developed dramatically. As a consequence of this trend, a significant issue also appears, namely, the sharp increases in the demand of both data communication and computational capability. New applications such as augmented reality (AR) techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, selfdriving and etc. all deal with complex data processing and storing operations, which require higher level of data communication, computation and storage. This poses great challenges to the existing conventional vehicular networks, especially in terms of communication and computational capacities. To meet this ever-increasing demand in communication and computational capacity, using vehicular clouds as data centers and augmented processing resources is an appealing idea. For instance, the parked vehicular clouds at a company parking lot can be utilized to handle the computational tasks or they can be employed to collaborate with each other to transmitting message and sharing communication resources.</p><p>In order to solve the communication and computational capacity problem, some existing methods were proposed, including 3G and 4G cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, roadside units (RSUs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and mobile cloud computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, they are not sufficient for the following reasons.</p><p>Cellular networks provide an augment in communication but quite limited, and they are controlled primarily by network operators which is not efficient and effective from the application aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.

Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TVT.2016.2532863, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 3 and time consuming when uploading real-time information because mobile cloud computing uses the client-server communication model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Mobile cloud computing also requires a high quality of network connections with remote infrastructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, it remains a great challenge for researchers and engineers to find out how to deal with communication and computational demands more efficiently and conveniently.</p><p>Nowadays, the global number of vehicles has increased rapidly and reached a staggering number of one billion in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. As a direct consequence, heavy traffic with slow-moving vehicles occurs frequently and numbers of parked vehicles are quite huge especially in many urban areas. This situation is usually regarded as a nightmare senario, but we can view it from a new perspective and consider these parked and slow-moving vehicles as huge underutilized resources. Thus, we eventually come up with the novel idea of vehicular fog computing (VFC), which employs vehicles as the infrastructures to make the best utilization of these vehicular communication and computational resources. Specifically, VFC is an architecture that utilizes a collaborative multitude of end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of communication and computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Apart from the cloud characteristics, such as providing data, computing, storage and application services to end-users, VFC distinguishes itself from other existing techniques with its proximity to end-users, dense geographical distribution and support for mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Therefore, VFC exploits the best of the features of slow-moving and parked vehicles, such as clustering distribution in locations, to enable them to collaborate with nearby vehicles. The specific fog computing multi-tier architecture modified and adopted by the VFC is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In this way, this proposed vehicular system can meet the demands for considerable communication and computational capacity, and it works better compared to the conventional systems. It is also worth emphasizing that the multitier architecture of VFC depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is fundamentally different from that of the original fog computing paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Specifically, in the fog computing architecture, vehicles and mobile devices are end users, and between these edge users and the cloud, there exists the fog server layer. By contrast, in the VFC architecture, vehicles and mobile devices themselves are parts of the 'fog' too.</p><p>The idea of considering vehicles as the infrastructures is technically practical. For instance, the existing researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> view parked vehicles as infrastructures, which developed the concept of parked vehicles assistance (PVA) to enable parked vehicles to join vehicular networks as static nodes. Wireless devices and rechargeable batteries also help in this process, enabling parked vehicles to easily communicate with one another and with nearby moving cars. Due to  the characteristics, such as large-number, long-time staying and specific locations, these parked vehicles are very ideal choice to serve as static backbones and service infrastructures. Both communication and computational capacity in urban areas can be greatly enhanced when these vehicles as infrastructures collaborate together and form a type of new hybrid networks.</p><p>As an extending paradigm of Fog Computing, the VFC has a lot of common features with Fog Computing, such as the geo-distribution and low latency communication. Fog Computing is a network between the underlying networks and the clouds. It extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network, enabling creation of refined and better applications or services <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. In contrast to the cloud, which is more centralized, Fog computing targets the services and applications with widely distributed deployments. Since Fog is localized, it provides low latency communication and more context awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Fog suits applications with to serve users and having autonomy in service sharing. They coined this concept to refer to: a group of largely autonomous vehicles whose corporate computing, sensing, communication and physical resources can be coordinated and dynamically allocated to authorized users. Then they also described several application scenarios specifically such as data cloud in a parking lot, data center at the mall as well as dynamically synchronizing traffic lights. And Whaiduzzaman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> also conducted a survey on VCC and they emphasized the idea that as for VCC, the vast number of vehicles on streets, roadways and parking lots will be treated as plentiful and under-utilized computational resource, which can be used to provide public services. However, our research is quite different from theirs. Although we both mentioned the features such as using under-utilized infrastructures, our VFC concept highlights the new features as instead of sending the information to the remote server, utilizing near-located vehicles resources and letting them collaborate with each other. Because we do not need to send information to remote servers, this brings significantly less time delay and less deployment cost. The geo-distribution, local decision making as well as real-time load-balancing features are of great novelty and can definitely distinguish our proposed concept from others.</p><p>The specific differences are compared in table I. On one hand, the VCC is bandwidth constrained, latency sensitive and more expensive to deploy, while the VFC is based on geodistribution and has real-time load-balancing and local decision mechanism. What is more important, as is mentioned above, VFC depends more on the collaboration of near-located • We propose a novel system of VFC that employs vehicles as infrastructures for communication and computation to enlarge the available resources and to enhance the achievable capacities. To our best knowledge, we are the first to consider and investigate this intriguing and important problem.</p><p>• We analyze all the four scenarios of utilizing moving and parked vehicles as infrastructures for communication and computation, respectively. Moreover, we quantitatively characterize the communication and computational capacities with specific case study supported by real vehicular mobility environment. nighttime, most vehicles are parked along roads or in parking lots. Parked vehicles along roads can play a vital role in relaying packets, while those in a parking lot can make up a large computation cloud. In this way, both communication and computational capabilities of the area can be greatly enhanced. We now discuss these four application scenarios in more details.</p><p>A. Moving Vehicles as Infrastructures 1) Communication: Vehicular networks generally contain two types of nodes: vehicles and RSUs. Vehicular communication was developed as a part of the intelligent transport system which seeks to achieve safety and productivity through intelligent transportation by integrating various information. Communications in an intelligent transport system are achieved with the combination of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. In V2I communication, the energy consumption of roadside infrastructure wireless nodes, e.g., RSUs, is one of the most important constraints that must be taken into consideration in pursuing high reliability and long lifetime of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. As for V2V communication, direct exchange of information happens between vehicles and the main problem is whether the distance between two vehicles is smaller than the communication range to build up a successful connection. It can be seen that network connectivity is one of the most important issues for enabling information transmission, especially for V2V communication.</p><p>Therefore, we turn to the VFC, which utilizes moving vehicles as communication infrastructures, for help to solve this communication problem and to bring better network connectivity.</p><p>VFC takes the advantages of multi-hop characteristic and moving features of vehicles to carry the information from one place to another place, which is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (a). Moving Because of these communication hubs, the fog is formed and instead of sending information to cloud servers, tasks are completed by utilizing computational and communication resources locally, which involves both local decision making and geo-distribution features. All these bring less delay, lower cost and higher efficiency. To sum up, VFC does a better job in communications compared to the VCC, because the former can deploy tasks with less time delay and less cost utilizing geo-related vehicles while the latter needs a lot of information transmission between the mobile access points and remote servers.</p><p>To characterize moving vehicles and employ them as infrastructures, we firstly need to know vehicular speed distribution in the space and time domains. With this knowledge, we can explore the relationship between connectivity and mobility of vehicular networks. This help us to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the communication circumstances in urban areas and therefore to accurately assess the potentials of using moving vehicles as infrastructures.</p><p>2) Computation: Moving vehicles, particularly slow-moving vehicles, are important components for computational infrastructures in VFC. For example, a cloud can be formed by vehicles which are equipped with embedded computers jammed around an intersection of city roads, where a RSU may also be deployed to connect to the remote clouds. The schematic of such a system is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 (b)</ref>, where the RSU connect with the remote cloud computing centers by wired Internet. In such a VFC system, with the help of local mobile cloudlets, offloading or loading computation can be achieved through V2V communications. Congested vehicles can also exchange information through V2I communications with RSUs, while RSUs communicate with remote cloud computing centers through Internet. Thus, the whole system becomes a hybrid cloud which aggregates computation resources from both mobile cloudlets and remote clouds, and then reallocates them to vehicles in order to satisfy the computation demands of individual vehicles. It is worth emphasizing that mobile cloudlets may also carry out computational tasks for remote clouds. This is particularly attractive, as it turns otherwise wasted energy due to congestion into valuable and useful computational power.</p><p>B. Parked Vehicles as Infrastructures   other to achieve large computing tasks. Thus, these parked vehicles become abundant computation infrastructures, providing a great deal of computation resources. This senario is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (b). According to the literature, meeting huge computation demands is challenging because individual vehicles have limited computing resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. This computation capacity problem can be perfectly solved by VFC, as VFC can provide powerful computation resources and achieve computing tasks in less time as well as at higher efficiency. For instance, when the parked vehicles in a company parking lot join VFC, these vehicles form a small data center and therefore can deal with various complex tasks which require large computation capability.</p><p>There exist very limited works on the topic of using parked vehicles as infrastructures. We anticipate more realistic scenarios and practical approaches will be proposed to promote this application in the future. In our current paper, we assess the potential computational capacity of utilizing parked vehicles as infrastructures and provide a primary quantitative analysis on the advantages of this application.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Datasets and Preprocessing</head><p>In order to investigate vehicular mobility and connectivity in urban scenarios, we conduct our study on two real-world large-scale urban vehicular traces, Shanghai trace and Beijing trace.</p><p>Shanghai trace <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> was collected by the SG project <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, in which mobility trace data from over 4,000 taxis were collected during the whole month of February 2007 in Shanghai. In this trace, reports were sent back to the data center by GPRS. Specifically, the frequency of reports was either every 1 minute when a taxi had passengers on-board or every 15 seconds when it was vacant. The information reported included the taxi's ID, the longitude and latitude coordinates of the taxi's location, the speed and other factors like heading angle as well as the status of the taxi. In our study, we preprocess the dataset in the following way. To analyze the vehicular mobility and connectivity, we need to know the exact location of every taxi in a large number of time-points. Therefore, it is important to sample appropriate time-points with a fixed frequency so as to obtain the real-time topology. Since GPS reports were collocated in discrete time at the time interval of 15 seconds or 1 minute, we sample the date every 10 minutes. Thus, every 10 minute, a new real-time topology is obtained, and in this way, we collect 144 topologies in 24 hours. After empirical data processing, we found that it is an acceptable sampling frequency because most of the sampled topologies have no significant change in just 10 minutes. Beijing trace <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> is the largest urban city vehicular data trace available. In collecting Beijing trace, we used the mobility track logs obtained from 27,000 participating Beijing taxis carrying GPS receivers during May 2010. Specifically, we utilized the GPS devices to collect the taxis' locations and time stamps and GPRS modules to report the records every 15 s for moving taxis.</p><p>The specific information contained in such a report includes the taxi's ID, the longitude and latitude coordinates of the taxi's location, time stamps, instant speed, and heading. Similarly the dataset is appropriately preprocessed before analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Moving Vehicles 1) Communication:</head><p>The communication capacity is of great significance in vehicular networks because information exchanges cannot happen without reliable communications. Among various variables that impact capacity, the connection is one of the most important metrics. The amount of connection between vehicles fundamentally represents how good network communication conditions between vehicles are. Thus, we focus on the connectivity to investigate the capability of utilizing moving vehicles as communication infrastructures. As it is important to study how the mobility of a vehicular network impacts its connectivity, as measured by the topology metric known as component size, we firstly unveil the fundamental relationship between mobility and connectivity of large-scale urban vehicular networks by analyzing Shanghai trace.</p><p>We consider the establishment of communication links based on a simple unit disc model by defining the unit disc communication range R to judge whether a successful link is established.</p><p>In this work, we set the communication range to R = 600 m. In order to depict the key characteristics of large-scale vehicular networks, we offer the following definitions. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S(t) = C(t)</formula><p>In the sequel, we will drop the time index t to simplify notations, and we simply denote the component by C and the component size by S, which are two key metrics in our study.   For the purpose of revealing the relationship between mobility and connectivity, we conduct an empirical analysis of the component speed and component size. We draw a scatter-plot in More detailed analysis of this dichotomy relationship can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Because the communication capacity and the connectivity both reflect the underlying information transferring capability, we can infer that the communication capacity exhibits similar dynamic changing trends with the connectivity. More specifically, on one hand, when the component speed is larger than a certain threshold speed A, the power-law fitting model reflects the true relationship between the component size and corresponding maximum component speed.</p><p>As mentioned previously, the component speed describes the mobility while the component size depicts the connectivity of network. This power-law relationship indicates that for the The faster a vehicle moves, the fewer vehicles it can successfully connect with, leading to a smaller component size and hence poorer communication capacity. On the other hand, when the component speed is smaller than A, this relationship changes into a uniform distribution, which implies that the component speed may correspond to any component size, ranging from the minimum size to the maximum size. In other words, the mobility when lower than a threshold has no apparent impact on the connectivity of the network, i.e., the communication capacity.</p><p>Based on the above analysis, we can make evaluations and predictions for connectivity and hence communication capacity, according to mobility metrics such as vehicular speeds or component speeds. This provides us a better understanding of the communication characteristics in vehicular networks and offer relevant guidelines for us to design associated vehicular applications. Basically, once we know the influencing factors of connectivity from a higher level, i.e., communication capacity, we can design more efficient and practical methods to improve it.</p><p>2) Computation: Computation is an important key aspect for VFC and therefore we carry out a case analysis to investigate computational capability. In this case, we employ Beijing trace. This is because it is well known that the traffic loads in Beijing are huge and vehicles are always congested at the intersections within the Fifth Ring Road, ideal for investigating the potential of utilizing slow-moving or congested vehicles as computational infrastructures. More specifically, we choose ten intersections with high traffic jams and study the computation capacity of the vehicles in these selected regions.</p><p>In order to analyze the computation capacity, we firstly focus on the variables such as resident number of vehicles, patterns of staying time, incoming and outgoing processes, which all affect the capacity of a vehicular mobile cloudlet. These variables, which can be acquired </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E n (t) = E n (t + T ) = t -∞ λ n (s) exp - t s µ n (r)dr ds,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>which matches the fitting models described previously.  As can be clearly seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>, the probability density functions (PDFs) of the incoming, outgoing and the resident numbers of vehicles (taxis) are time-variant. By observing the arrival and departure time intervals in many short time periods, we find that these three variables follow exponential distributions approximately. Thus we can use Poisson distributions to fit the numbers of incoming, outgoing and resident vehicles. The computation capacity indicates the computation potentials or more specifically, the computation resources available in a certain region. In our paper, the computation capacity is defined as the cumulative sum of individual vehicles' staying times in a certain area, assuming that every vehicle has similar computation capability. By understanding the specific dynamic changes of computation resources in the whole region, we can achieve better utilization of the available computation capacity.</p><p>We simulate and predict the computing capacity of a mobile cloudlet based on the real trace and the proposed model under the assumption that individual vehicle computing capacity follows a normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. We firstly validate the proposed mobility model via a persuasive approach, in which we randomly choose 50% of the taxis in the trace to train the parameters in the model, and compare the results obtained by the model and real trace. Then, we train the parameters of the model again by using all the taxi data in the trace, and we predict the computation capacity of a cloudlet with different vehicular traffics. In order to train the model's parameters, we choose one of the selected intersection regions, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p><p>0:00 6:00 12:00 18:00 0:00 6:00 12:00 18:00 0:00 6:00 12:00 18:00 0:00 6:00 12:00 18:00 0:00 0 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Parked Vehicles</head><p>In order to have a closer look at parked vehicles as infrastructures, the pattern of vehicular parking is required. We begin our investigation based on Shanghai trace to obtain the empirical   can relay packets and therefore the link between two parked vehicles can be regarded as a reliable connection if the traffic is sufficiently dense to maintain the appearance of vehicles for relaying packets. As also mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, the short inter-vehicles distance which is less than 2R can bring good connectivity. Furthermore, connected multi-hop relaying can help data transmission, where relays receive packets and forward them immediately. Additionally, store-carry-forward or opportunistic multi-hop delivery with uncertain transmission delay can be implemented even if the traffic is sparse, which offers a solution for intermittent and sparse networks.</p><p>When considering the communication role of parked vehicles, therefore, we are able to analyze the communication characteristics of parked vehicles in the similar way as moving vehicles.</p><p>For instance, we can consider the contact time and downloading delay in this process in the future. Moreover, because VFC has unique advantages by utilizing the nearby parked vehicles as infrastructures, we can further study the improvement of communication capacity using VFC compared to conventional networks in our future investigation.</p><p>2) Computation: We mainly focus on the existing computation capacity research in this section with a more delicate and quantitative discussion on the computation capacity when utilizing parked vehicles as infrastructures. Inspired by the emergence of cloud computing, many associated techniques as well as paradigms are developed by researchers and IT companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. A phenomenal adoption of cloud computing and cloud IT service appears all over the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. However, conventional vehicular networks are not perfect owing to inadequate utilization of computational resources of parked vehicles. When parked vehicles act as infrastructures, they become perfect candidates for providing lots of 'data center on wheel' with significant advantages in computation and storage over moving vehicles, simply because they are better connected with each other. These parked vehicle groups, which are mainly on roadways, along streets, or in parking lots, constitute a large amount of under-utilized computational resource. Some research works were conducted to investigate this problem. For instance, Olariu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> proposed the concept of vehicular cloud which is defined as a group of vehicles whose spare computing, sensing, communication and storage resources can be coordinated and dynamically allocated to users. Arif et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> envisioned a vehicular cloud involving cars in long-term-stay parking lot of a typical international airport and predicted the parking occupancy in order to schedule resources and further assign computational tasks. Gu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref> also conducted researches on the data center architecture that leverages the extra storage resources in parking lots. These resources can form an auxiliary vehicular data center such that the pressure on the conventional data center can be mitigated and the total communication cost is also reduced. The vehicular data center's management policies and specific approaches or models about computational capacity estimation are very good research topics in this field.</p><p>Moreover, let us consider the computation capability of parked vehicles as the parking capability with the help of the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>. In this case, by defining the capability as the total value of each vehicle's parking time, parking capability is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>, which is a reference  <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>, where we observe the obvious patterns regarding for example the capacity of parked vehicles for work purpose and the capacity of vehicles parked at home.</p></div>

CHALLENGES AND OPEN PROBLEMS</head><p>As mentioned previously, various vehicular services cannot be put into practical use in our daily life if the communication and computational capacity are not sufficiently powerful to support them. Therefore, we propose VFC, a system which employs vehicles as infrastructures and makes the best utilization of nearby vehicular resources. Because this is a brand new idea, there exist lots of challenges and open problems about VFC waiting for us to explore. In this section, we present and discuss these challenges and open problems, such as building up appropriate mobility vehicular models, analyzing computational capacity, constructing practical operation system, handling with security problems and associated applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Mobility Model for Vehicles</head><p>In vehicular networks, thousands of vehicles move from place to place and they attempt to connect with each other as long as the communication condition is permitted. To implement VFC, we need design effective protocols and associated management mechanisms to connect with nearby moving or parked vehicles. Clearly, an appropriate and accurate mobility model is essential to predict and evaluate the movement of surrounding vehicles and thus to provide explicit understanding of communication conditions. Therefore, studying mobility model for vehicles is of fundamental importance in designing a VFC system. Some mobility models have been addressed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>. However, the existing models are not completely precise and often insufficient for accurate characterizations for the 8:00 10:00 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:00 22:00 24:00 0 0.5 and space domains. Specifically, we need to study vehicular mobility more delicately and quantitatively to derive more specific and accurate mobility models for various environments that are more useful for practical applications. Knowing the underlying mobility patterns and vehicular behaviors will help to conduct better communication and computational resources utilization and assignment, and therefore to realize an effective VFC system, leading to maximum efficiency in both equipment and energy. It also enables us to further design the associated applications which serve as vital components of more advanced vehicular networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Capacity Analysis and Resource Management</head><p>In this study, we have demonstrated huge potential computation capacity with VFC by utilizing moving and parked vehicles as infrastructures. However, more capacity analysis and theories are needed in order to evaluate and quantify the real capacity improvement in practical applications.</p><p>The research in this critical area is still in its very early stage. In future, we expect more specific tests and/or simulations to explore the capacity under various practical circumstances of VFC.</p><p>Resource management in VFC is another important problem to study in order to take the full advantage of available vehicular computation and as storage resources. The computational utilization can be promoted by managing the resources and minimizing the cost for computation, such as how the service requester and network operator can interact as well as how the computational tasks are managed and distributed among numerous nearby vehicular resources. In order to achieve an efficient cooperation and integration among all surrounding vehicles, we need to design appropriately associated protocols and mechanisms. Thus, more theories and methods are waiting to be explored in this area.</p><p>Some approaches have been proposed to encourage the resources share between nodes in networks, such as reward-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> and punishment-based mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>.</p><p>These approaches can also promote the resources utilization in VFC with commercial agreements and guidelines on user behaviors. Users' interaction can seriously affect the performance of VFC, because how the access request to the resource of individual vehicles is accepted or authorized is another important factor that impacts on achievable communication and computation performance. To achieve efficient resource utilization of hundreds of vehicles, we firstly need to guarantee these vehicles agree to join the VFC network and authorize to exchange data with each other. Thus there are also some related work in designing the associated protocols or agreements interaction desires. People will be attracted to let their vehicles join the VFC once they feel that these convenience and powerful features considerably outweigh the 'costs' they pay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. System Implementation</head><p>In order to support a practical VFC system, a typical vehicle needs to be equipped with certain devices, including integrated embedded computer, a GPS device, sensing devices, digital maps and communication device along with intelligent algorithm. Integrating these devices has helped drivers acquire real-time information about road conditions and outside world. By augmenting these devices with VFC, vehicles may become networked computing centers on wheels. Note that many of these enabling devices already exist in current popular vehicle models. Other high-end vehicle models have more sophisticated sensing devices and powerful computational equipment to conduct safety and entertainment tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. Clearly, new future vehicles will have even better hardware and software to support VFC.</p><p>With this integrated wireless communication and computation system, adequate power supply of individual vehicle plays a vital role in the operation of the whole system. It is noted that with the help of power supply such as rechargeable vehicular battery embedded in vehicles, parked vehicles can perform associated VFC tasks when their engines are switched off. In fact, the power consumption of achieving related VFC tasks is very little, compared to the energy requirements of providing driving assistance, controlling vehicle system or supporting certain entertainment applications. Thus, relative communication and/or computation tasks of the VFC can be adequately supported in individual vehicle with the current vehicular battery supply. However, it is highly desired to develop much more energy-efficient integrated wireless communication and onboard computation system for vehicle in order to popularize VFC applications.</p><p>In order to effectively utilize vehicles as infrastructures for communication and computation, new techniques and related supporting facilities must be developed and installed in places to be put into use. For instance, the wireless communication and computational equipments within vehicles are set to support the connections between cloud control center and vehicles.</p><p>Apart from this, we also need control centers as supporting facilities to manage the cloudlet and to link vehicular networks to the Internet. Moreover, protocols and algorithms for optimizing the computational resources and controlling the process of delaying packets are also needed to be proposed. Building a complex system such as VFC is a comprehensive project, which requires the close collaboration and integration from individual parts of the whole system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Incentives and Security</head><p>The incentive of designing VFC is primarily to meet communication and computational demands. VFC will greatly promote the development of advanced vehicular applications and service to offer safer and more enjoyable driving experiences. As VFC can support huge communication and computational demands, various more complex applications and services will non longer stay in concept phase and are expected to be implemented in the near future. This can bring us great convenience and advantages. Safety-assisted applications enable vehicles to sense threats and hazards of environment in real time with a 360 degree awareness. Entertainment services also enable us to keep close contact with friends, enjoy colorful Internet applications and even interesting human-computer interaction with great convenience. All these applications require to exchange huge amount of information with the outside world, and they critically rely on the powerful communication and computational capacity because they can easily reach hundred of or even several GB in operation. Thus, solving these demand problems is the powerful incentive of VFC.</p><p>Apart from the above research incentives of VFC, there also exist the vehicle owners' incentives. Due to the utilization of vehicular computational as well as storage resources, we need to give some money to vehicle owners in order to let them rent out their resources. If they get paid from the VFC platform operator, they will be more willing to let their vehicles join the VFC as part of a dynamic data center. Therefore, proposing incentive models for using vehicular resources will also be hot research area. Because both the VFC users and the vehicle owners can obtain benefits from using or renting the resources, the business about this issue will also attract more and more attention.</p><p>Given a variety of vehicular applications operating in the VFC system, the security and privacy of the VFC network are extremely important issues. Due to the process of sharing content and accessing data, there exist some security problems such as weak authentication, lack of sufficient protection, misuse of protocols and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>. The vehicle operators therefore face more danger from the information stealing, hostile attack and virus infection. For instance, because many social network sites are not taking adequate steps to protect privacy, some information about the mobile users (e.g., identities, interests, email address, etc.) may be obtained by others users or some third parties, leading to potential malicious usage and privacy leakage <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>. Thus it to achieve security and conditional privacy preservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. Considering the limited number of existing studies, we can expect that this security problem will attract more and more researchers and it will remain a hot area to study in the next few decades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Applications</head><p>and its novel idea of employing vehicles as infrastructures is expected to be operational in our daily live soon, and many associated vehicular applications can be envisioned, e.g., driving safety, entertainment services, and emergency networks. Especially for those applications needed rich computational processing, the VFC framework will play a vital role in speeding up computing and thus reducing the delay. For instance, when an accident happens, we want to envision a solution to reschedule the traffic lights and thus dissipate the huge traffic backlog in an efficient way. This leads to a great demand in computation resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. If VFC is put into use, we can pool all vehicular computational resources together to create the effect of a powerful super-computer. In this way, with better traffic lights schedule, we can de-congest the afflicted area as fast as possible. Apart from this, a lot of entertainment applications will also be promoted by stronger computational power. And the applications such as data mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>, human computer interaction (HCI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref> and AR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> also require rich computational resources. They all bring great convenience to our life. Data mining techniques may be utilized to provide high quality, useful and real-time context information to services and hence to improve its quality and efficiency. HCI and AR will be in practice in our daily life with better communication and computation environments. Moreover, for higher level of reliability and adaptation, these applications will be redesigned to suit the unique characteristics of VFC. This brings many research opportunities. For example, because various applications have different purposes and capacities of mobile devices are heterogeneous in real life, an adaptive optimization mechanism that can simultaneously support the system efficiently and allocate computing tasks effectively is really in need <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>. Therefore, there are lots of open problems and challenges waiting for us to explore in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this work, we have presented an overview of vehicles as the infrastructures for communication and computation, a new paradigm referred to as vehicular fog computing. With increasing number of vehicular terminals, this paradigm brings great opportunities as well as challenges. We have discussed all the four scenarios of utilizing moving and parked vehicles as communication and computational infrastructures, respectively. Our study has demonstrated the huge potential enhancement in the communication and computation capacity that can be realized by VFC.</p><p>Specifically, with the help of VFC, better connectivity and more opportunities of relaying packets can be achieved, leading to more reliable communication with higher capacity. VFC also greatly improves the computational performance, compared to conventional systems, due to making the best use of currently under-utilized computational resources of individual vehicles. Once the communication and computational capacity are improved, more advanced developments will appear in the field of vehicular applications and mobile cloud computing. Although still in its infancy, this paradigm is a promising model that can fundamentally reshape vehicular networks and various vehicular applications in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>4 Fig. 1 .</head><label>41</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

With S representing the size of component C, the component speed V is given by In the network topology terminology, the vehicular speed refers to the movement of a node per unit time, showing the individual motion from a node level. By contrast, the component speed reflects the mobility at the component level, which is a more macroscopic metric than vehicular speed. Given all the vehicles in the same component, the component speed provides us with the mobility of the network, instead of an individual vehicle. We emphasize this because the component speed gives us more mobility information from a network perspective. With these definitions of metrics, we calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the complementary CDF (CCDF) for both the vehicular speed and component speed based on Shanghai trace data. We observe that the CDFs of the vehicular speed and component speed are</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>Fig. 5</head><label>5</label><figDesc>Fig. 5 to explore this relationship. As for the component size ranging up to 500, the scatter-plots of the maximum component speed versus the component size are presented in the main plot as well as the top-right subplot of Fig. 5. With a log-log scale, we can appreciate a power-law decaying relationship from the fact that most plots are on or near the straight red line with a fixed slope. Thus for the component speed larger than 20 m/s, the component speed clearly exhibits a power-law decaying relationship with the corresponding component size. Moreover, blue spots in the main scatter-plot correspond to the case of the component size larger than 500. We draw the bottom-left box-plot to have a close look into this case. In this bottom-left box-plot, every blue strip represents the component speed distribution with an x-axis of 30, i.e., with a width 30 in component size, while the length of a blue strip in the y-axis indicates the interquartile range of the component speed, reflecting the variability of the component speed. Additionally, each black dashed line represents the corresponding maximum and minimum values, while the red-plus symbols indicate extreme outliers. This box-plot of Fig. 5 for the component sizes between 1200 and 2640 clearly indicates a uniform distribution when the component speeds are smaller than 20 m/s. Therefore, we observe a dichotomy in the relationship of the component speed versus the component size, partitioned by certain threshold component speed A. In this case, A ≈ 20 m/s. More detailed analysis of this dichotomy relationship can be found in [30].</figDesc></figure>
