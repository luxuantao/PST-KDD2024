<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>acceleration, and flow parameters), as well as monitoring of the by-products of the combustion process.</p><p>Silicon (Si) is well suited for a broad range of sensor and actuator applications but is generally limited in electronic device performance to below 250 C and in mechanical device performance to below 600 C (due to a decline in its elastic modulus with increasing temperature). The bulky packaging required to keep Si-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) within operating limits (in practice, below 250 C) in high-temperature environments is both space and cost intensive, if not impractical, for many applications. Consequently, for high-temperature MEMS applications (e.g., above 350 C), there is a need for semiconductors with good mechanical and thermal stability and a wide bandgap for stable electronic properties at elevated temperatures. Silicon carbide (SiC) has these properties, as well as additional attractive features. Compared to Si, SiC demonstrates higher chemical inertness and radiation resistance, which expands its potential to MEMS for space satellite systems. At the same time, single and polycrystalline SiC can be grown on large area substrates and are compatible with batch-fabrication processes used in Si micromachining and integrated circuit (IC) industries. To a large extent, SiC device fabrication technology leverages off of the Si technology infrastructure.</p><p>A principal focus area for SiC MEMS has been SiC sensor systems for gas turbine engines. To meet the efficiency, emissions, cost, and safety goals set by military and commercial customers, the next generation of gas turbine designs require instrumentation in or near the hot-gas flow path, which must operate above 350 C. Sensors are needed for turbine development testing and in-flight service in order to measure combustor liner temperature, rotor and stator metal temperatures, internal cooling temperatures, steady-state and transient cooling flow and temperature, pressure and rate of change of pressure, hot gas path leakage, and coolant leakage. Conversion of electronic control and sensor systems from Si to SiC-based devices will not only increase efficiency and safety through enabling instrumentation but also reduce the overall weight of an aircraft by eliminating the packaging, wiring and connectors necessary to link sensor systems with control electronics. This reduction would directly translate to increased range and lower fuel costs.</p><p>Most of the high-temperature sensors needed for gas turbine engines will find application areas in rocket technology to monitor combustion temperature, pressure, and by-products. Gas sensors sensitive to hydrogen are required for launch pad and in-flight safety systems, and gas sensors for hydrocarbon and CO are needed for monitoring the condition of the cabin atmosphere in manned spacecraft. These sensor systems can be fabricated based on SiC technology.</p><p>In internal combustion engines, a primary concern in engine operation is the ignition timing. Premature fuel ignition results in a waste of power and therefore compromises fuel efficiency. Automobile manufacturers are looking for better ways to optimize emissions, spark timing, knock detection, and control of the air/fuel ratio. These engine control needs can be met with the utilization of SiC-based in-cylinder pressure sensors. In-cylinder pressure sensors will also allow for a comparison of the compression ratio of the different cylinders for engine diagnostics. Power fluctuations caused by excessive air will be detected by the pressure sensor, allowing the air/fuel ratio to be adjusted to maintain a smooth flow of power. Furthermore, improved ignition will reduce tailpipe emissions and the accumulation of carbon residues that coat the cylinder walls and degrade engine life.</p><p>SiC-based MEMS devices will benefit manned and unmanned spacecraft as well. Currently, unmanned spacecraft require thermal radiators to dissipate heat generated by onboard Si-based electronics. Implementation of SiC-based electronic systems, which can operate at temperatures above 350 C, will eliminate the need for thermal radiators, thus reducing the overall weight of the spacecraft. Additionally, SiC electronics and sensors are much less susceptible to radiation damage than their Si counterparts, thereby reducing the need for radiation shielding and, as a result, the spacecraft weight. Reduced spacecraft weight, and increased operating temperature and radiation resistance of on-board electronics and sensor systems, will dramatically increase the functionality of unmanned spacecraft, allowing them to more aggressively probe harsh planetary environments. Communication satellites will have extended operating lifetimes and the ability to carry more critical on-board electronic systems.</p><p>The need for instrumentation in harsh environments, in particular at temperatures above 350 C, has spurred the research and development of SiC MEMS, resulting in rapid advances in the technology over the last several years. The subsequent sections review the current state of the art in SiC MEMS device technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SiC MATERIAL PROPERTIES</head><p>Any discussion of SiC as a material for microdevices first requires an understanding of the crystalline nature of SiC. SiC exhibits a one-dimensional polymorphism called polytypism. All polytypes of SiC have an identical planar arrangement of Si and C atoms, which are distinguished by differences in the stacking sequence of the identical planes. Disorder in the stacking periodicity of similar planes results in a material that has numerous crystal structures (polytypes), all with the same atomic composition. The magnitude of the disorder is such that more than 250 SiC polytypes have been identified to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Despite the large number of polytypes, only three crystalline structures exist: cubic, hexagonal, and rhombohedral. Historically, the cubic phase of SiC has been referred to as ß-SiC, and the hexagonal and rhombohedral phases have been called -SiC. Recently, a more descriptive nomenclature that identifies both the crystalline symmetry and stacking periodicity has been adopted. Using this system, cubic SiC is called 3C-SiC. 3C-SiC is the only cubic polytype known to exist. The most common -SiC polytypes have hexagonal symmetries and are called 6H-SiC, 4H-SiC, and 2H-SiC. A graphic of the stacking order of the different SiC polytypes is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Although all SiC polytypes have the same atomic composition, the electrical properties differ. For instance, the bandgap for SiC ranges from 2.3 eV for 3C-SiC to 3.4 eV for 2H-SiC. Despite having the smallest bandgap, 3C-SiC has the highest electron mobility (1000 cm /Vs) and saturation drift velocity (10 cm/s), due in part to its cubic crystalline symmetry.</p><p>SiC has always been noted for its excellent mechanical properties, specifically, hardness and wear resistance. In terms of hardness, SiC has a Mohs hardness of nine, which compares favorably with values for other hard materials such as diamond (ten) and topaz (eight). In terms of wear resistance, SiC has a value of 9.15, as compared with 10.00 for diamond and 9.00 for Al O . SiC is not etched by most acids and can only be etched by alkaline hydroxide bases (i.e., KOH) at molten temperatures ( 600 C). SiC does not melt, but sublimes at about 1800 C. The surface of SiC can be passivated by the formation of a thermal SiO layer, but the oxidation rate is very slow when compared with Si. The above-mentioned properties are not generally polytype dependent. A summary comparing important semiconductor properties of 3C-and 6H-SiC with other noted semiconductors is presented in Table 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SiC THIN-FILM GROWTH</head><p>A key impediment to the commercialization of SiC as a high-temperature semiconductor is the availability of largearea, high-quality, defect-free SiC substrates suitable for epitaxial growth. Although 3C-SiC has the least complex crystal structure and is the stable low-temperature phase of SiC, bulk crystal growth of 3C-SiC is very difficult, and electronic-grade substrates are not commercially available. Several companies have developed successful processes to grow electronic-grade bulk 6H-SiC crystals, and wafers with diameters up to two inches are commercially available. Presently, these wafers are relatively expensive (e.g., two orders of magnitude higher in price than a 4-in-diameter (100) silicon wafer), which limits their use to applications that can accommodate the high cost. In addition, as described below, bulk micromachining of SiC substrates by wet-and/or dry-etching processes is at best a nascent technology.</p><p>Harsh environment (e.g., high temperature) MEMS applications with potentially large markets (e.g., in-cylinder pressure monitoring in internal combustion engines) are usually characterized by low-cost requirements. Therefore, our work has been motivated by the necessity to develop a low-cost SiC MEMS technology to penetrate a much more diverse set of markets. Additionally, we have been motivated to leverage off of the latest fabrication process technologies available from Si, as well as the expertise in Si micromachining, to push the SiC MEMS technology further, faster. As a result, we have pursued large-area substrates, starting with 3C-SiC on Si.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Homoepitaxy of 6H-SiC</head><p>The bulk of the research into the development of SiC for microfabrication has focused on 6H-SiC for hightemperature, high-power, and high-frequency microelectronics. An excellent and detailed review on this subject can be found in a recent publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For high-temperature electronic devices, high-quality n-and p-doped singlecrystal SiC films are required. The most common method to grow these films is by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD). The most popular approach uses Si-and C-containing gases and high temperatures (1500-1700 C) to grow homoepitaxial 6H-SiC films on 6H-SiC substrates. The most commonly used precursor gases are silane and propane. Hydrogen is used as the carrier gas. Typical dopant gases are trimethyl-aluminum (Al(C H ) ) and diborane (B H ) for p-type films and N , ammonia (NH ), and phosphene (PH ) for n-type films. SiC is an excellent diffusion barrier, which makes doping by diffusion impractical in SiC. Doping by ion implantation is possible, but dopant activation is not often straightforward <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In situ doping continues to be the most effective doping technique in SiC. APCVD has also been used to grow 3C-SiC films on 6H-SiC substrates and 4H-SiC films on 4H-SiC substrates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Heteroepitaxy of 3C-SiC on Si</head><p>Unlike the other polytypes, single-crystal 3C-SiC can be heteroepitaxially grown on silicon substrates by both APCVD and low-pressure (LP)CVD. Similar to APCVD of 6H-SiC epitaxial films, the most common 3C-SiC on Si APCVD process uses hydrogen as the carrier gas, silane as the Si source gas, and propane as the C source gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. An example of a radio-frequency (rf)-induction, vertical APCVD reactor is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Less common processes use dichlorosilane as an Si source and acetylene as a C source <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Single C-and Si-containing sources such as methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) and methylsilane have also been used <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Heteroepitaxy is possible because 3C-SiC and Si have similar cubic crystal structures. 3C-SiC has a zinc blende structure with a lattice constant of 0.436 nm, and Si has a diamond structure with a lattice constant of 0.543 nm, resulting in a lattice mismatch of approximately 20%. The two-source growth process overcomes the large lattice mismatch by a process called carbonization, which is used to form a thin 3C-SiC film directly from the Si substrate. Carbonization involves the conversion of the near surface region of the Si substrate to 3C-SiC by heating the substrate and exposing the surface to a C-containing gas. Carbonization temperatures generally range from 1250 to 1360 C, depending on the process. The carbon-containing gas dissociates into hydrocarbon reactants, which bond with Si on the wafer surface, forming a thin, heteroepitaxial 3C-SiC film. Because SiC is an excellent diffusion barrier material, the carbonization process is self-limiting. Film growth is continued by introducing an Si-containing gas into the flow and initiating homoepitaxial growth of 3C-SiC on the heteroepitaxial 3C-SiC carbonization layer. Films as thick as 40 m have been grown on small Si substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Moreover, 3C-SiC films have been grown on large-area substrates (4 in) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, enabling the batch fabrication of 3C-SiC MEMS devices.</p><p>A troubling problem associated with 3C-SiC heteroepitaxy on Si substrates is the formation of voids at the SiC/Si interface. These voids are sealed microcavities, which are common to samples grown by most APCVD and LPCVD processes. The void density can be quite high, with values as high as 10 voids/cm reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The voids compromise the contact between the 3C-SiC film and the Si substrate and may contribute to the large defect density in 3C-SiC films. The mechanism for void formation is not clear, but it has been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that voids result from Si out-diffusion from uncarbonized regions of the Si substrate during the carbonization process. Void formation also appears to be dependent on the temperature ramp-up rate during the carbonization step. Typically, the carbonization temperature ramp-up is extremely fast, about 50 C/s. Our group has developed a process using a slow carbonization temperature ramp-up rate, which produces films with extremely low void densities, approximately 2 voids/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> have since developed growth processes with similar results.</p><p>The main advantage of 3C-SiC from a MEMS perspective, however, is that 3C-SiC is the only SiC polytype that can be heteroepitaxially grown on Si substrates. Heteroepitaxy on Si gives 3C-SiC a distinct advantage over 6H-SiC in terms of batch fabrication since high-quality, largearea Si substrates are readily available and comparatively inexpensive. In addition, there are the benefits of leveraging off of the latest fabrication process technologies and the micromachining technology expertise available from Si. In 1995, our group was the first to construct an APCVD reactor large enough to accommodate two 4-in Si wafers and demonstrate uniform heteroepitaxy across the wafers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Since then, Hoya Corporation has constructed an LPCVD reactor capable of growing 3C-SiC on large numbers of 4-in wafers, and has recently reported growth on 6-in substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Polycrystalline SiC (Poly-SiC)</head><p>For many MEMS applications, poly-SiC is attractive, particularly in connection with surface-micromachining fabrication techniques. Unlike single-crystal 3C-SiC and 6H-SiC, poly-SiC can be deposited on a wide variety of substrate types, including suitable sacrificial layers such as SiO . SiC has been deposited by plasma-enhanced (PE)CVD, sputtering, and electron beam evaporation at substrate temperatures ranging from 200 to 1000 C <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. These films are either amorphous, as in the case of lowtemperature PECVD, or polycrystalline with a low degree of texture and a temperature dependence to the distribution of grain orientations. APCVD and LPCVD processes have also been used to deposit poly-SiC on Si substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, resulting in films with characteristics much like the aforementioned films. APCVD and LPCVD techniques do not place limits on substrate size, and thus are well suited for producing poly-SiC films for batch processing.</p><p>We have used APCVD to deposit and characterize poly-SiC films on polysilicon thin-film substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Polysilicon was chosen because of its potential as a sacrificial layer in a SiC-based surface-micromachining process. As mentioned previously, SiC is not etched in KOH except at temperatures above 600 C, whereas Si is readily etched at temperatures below 70 C. Thus, a 2-3-m-thick polysilicon layer deposited on a thermally oxidized Si wafer would provide an excellent substrate for a poly-SiC surfacemicromachining process using KOH as a release agent. In this study, poly-SiC films were grown on polysilicon using the heteroepitaxial growth process. It is well established that for polysilicon films, texture influences the thermal conductivity, elastic modulus, film stress, and oxidation rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The same is likely for poly-SiC. This process makes possible the ability to grow highly textured poly-SiC by controlling the substrate texture.</p><p>One of the advantages of poly-SiC as a MEMS material is that it can be deposited by APCVD onto an electrically insulating sacrificial layer, such as SiO . We have verified that no carbonization of the SiO layer is required for poly-SiC growth on SiO <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. We found that films grown at 1050 and 1160 C adhered well to the SiO substrate, while films deposited at 1280 C delaminated during film growth or shortly after. At the lower growth temperatures, the films were randomly oriented, with grain size increasing with increasing temperature. Lower deposition temperatures resulted in the incorporation of excess Si in the films, although the concentration was less than 10%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PROCESSING TECHNIQUES</head><p>The advancement of SiC MEMS technology is facilitated by the development of processing techniques to circumvent the limitations of Si-based processes in SiC micromachining. This includes oxidation, metallization, etching, and some novel alternative methods that will be discussed in this section. However, SiC has the advantage in that it can be processed using many of the standard processing tools common to Si IC fabrication. In terms of material compatibility, a definitive study has shown that SiC does not contaminate Si processing equipment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. As will be seen below, we have pursued the development of bulkand surface-micromachining processes using 3C-SiC and poly-SiC, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Oxidation</head><p>Stable thermal oxides can be grown on all polytypes of SiC using the same methods used to grow SiO layers thermally on Si substrates, although the mechanism is different. For Si, oxidation is achieved by the direct reaction of silicon with oxygen. A thin ( Å) native oxide is always present on the surface of Si exposed to air, but thick oxides ( 1 m) suitable for MEMS applications are grown by exposing Si substrates to oxygen at temperatures above 1000 C. Hydrogen is added to the process to enhance the oxidation rate. For SiC, the same processes are used, but because the oxide-formation mechanism is more complex, the oxidation rate is much lower. For example, a process used to grow a 1.5-m-thick thermal oxide on Si yields only a 900-Å-thick thermal oxide on 3C-SiC. The difference is best illustrated by examining the mechanisms required to form a thermal oxide on SiC. During the oxidation process, SiC reacts with O to form SiO and CO <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Because SiC is more chemically stable than Si and thereby less likely to dissociate and react with oxygen, the time to form a thermal oxide of equivalent thickness is longer for SiC. Additional time is required for CO to diffuse out of the SiO film. As with Si, hydrogen enhances the oxidation rate.</p><p>For many MEMS applications, only a thin oxide passivation layer is required. For applications requiring thicker oxide layers, a method using the complete thermal oxidation of polysilicon films deposited on SiC substrate layers can be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Oxide thicknesses of over 3 m can be achieved by the successive deposition and complete oxidation of polysilicon films. For some high-power and high-temperature electronics applications, thermal oxides of SiC are not of sufficient quality to provide dielectric isolation between active layers, and research programs searching for solutions to this problem are currently under way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Metallization</head><p>To develop stable ohmic and Schottky contacts for hightemperature SiC electronic devices, a wealth of research has been conducted on metal contacts, and several comprehensive reviews on the subject have been written <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In general, the best high-temperature contacts are metals with high melting temperatures, such as Ni and W. These metals can be used to form either ohmic or Schottky contacts to 3C-and 6H-SiC. This section will focus only on metal contacts to 3C-SiC.</p><p>The best and most widely used ohmic contact to 3C-SiC is Al. Al is the preferred ohmic contact because it is easily deposited by sputtering or evaporation, it is a readily available metal in silicon processing, and a wire bonding/packaging technology for Al currently exists. Unfortunately, Al melts at about 600 C, making it unsuitable for high-temperature contacts. Sputter-deposited Ni, W, Mo, and other complementary metal-oxide-semiconductorcompatible refractory metals make ohmic contacts to 3C-SiC after a short, high-temperature, postdeposition anneal. Binary compounds such as TiSi and WSi , and alloys like Au-Ta, have also been proven to make ohmic contacts to 3C-SiC.</p><p>The best Schottky contact to 3C-SiC is Au. Like Al, Au is easily deposited, and a wire bonding/packaging technology currently exists. Unlike Al, Au is not Si compatible, so use of Au requires that metallization be performed outside of IC fabrication facilities. Although Au has a relatively high melting temperature, it is not suitable for a high-temperature contact material due to electromigration at relatively low temperatures. High-melting-point metals like Ti and Ni have been reported to also show Schottky characteristics on 3C-SiC. Comprehensive tables summarizing the deposition conditions and evaluation data for metal contacts to n-and p-type 3C-SiC are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Etching</head><p>To fabricate SiC-based MEMS devices, selective etching is required to pattern the SiC films into the desired structural shapes. For Si-based devices, patterning can be performed by dry (plasma) or wet chemical etching. While wet chemical etching of SiC is usually not practical, plasma-etching techniques at or near room temperature have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. These techniques use the same F-based plasma chemistries developed for Si, SiO , and Si N films. Of these, CF , CHF , NF , and SF , mixed with O , are the most commonly used. Usually, etching is conducted in reactive ion etching (RIE) mode, meaning that pressures are kept below 200 mtorr and sputtering of the substrate is suppressed. For the most part, these recipes can be used for device fabrication. However, the etch rates are relatively low (e.g., by an order of magnitude) when compared with etch rates for Si under similar conditions.</p><p>Most RIE processes for SiC require plasmas consisting primarily of O mixed with the fluorinated compound. Plasma compositions of 90% O mixed with CHF give reasonably high etch rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Unfortunately, common photoresists cannot withstand exposure to these highly oxygenated plasmas for long enough times to sufficiently etch micrometer-thick SiC films. Therefore, other masking materials, such as Al, are used. Al is an effective masking material in these plasmas but may be responsible for a phenomenon called micromasking. Micromasking occurs when sputtered atoms from the mask or chamber are deposited in the etch field and mask sections of the underlying etch field. If the etching process has a high degree of anisotropy, micromasks will produce undesirable "grass-like" structures in the etch field. Decreasing the anisotropy of the plasma can undercut and eliminate the micromasks but will also reduce the anisotropy of the etched features. Using graphite electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> or adding small concentrations of hydrogen to the plasmas reduces the micromasking effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Etch selectivity is another key issue facing SiC MEMS processing. As seen later in this paper, SiC surfacemicromachining processes utilize SiO and polysilicon films for sacrificial layers and SiO films for dielectric isolation. In general, plasma conditions that etch SiC at high rates etch SiO and polysilicon at even higher rates. Some progress has been made in improving the etch selectivities of SiC to Si and SiO . The best reported selectivities for unheated samples were 2 : 1 for SiC to Si and 1 : 3.6 for SiC to SiO <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Etch selectivities of 5 : 1 for SiC to Si and 4 : 1 for SiC to SiO have been achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, but only for SiC samples heated to 300 C, which may be impractical for many processes. Because these conditions are nowhere near ideal for micromachining, great care must be taken when etching SiC on non-SiC substrate materials. Examples of SiC-based MEMS devices that utilize plasma etching during the fabrication process are lateral resonant devices, which will be presented in the next section.</p><p>As stated previously, bulk micromachining of SiC is very difficult, owing to its chemical inertness. Standard Si bulk-micromachining techniques, which use wet chemical etchants, are not effective in etching SiC. Some success in bulk micromachining of SiC using nonstandard techniques has been demonstrated. For example, a laser-assisted photoelectrochemical etching (PEC) technique for n-type 3C-SiC has been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Subsequently, a p-type 3C-SiC etch stop in a n-type 3C-SiC PEC process was developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. PEC has since been extended to 6H-SiC and used in a pressure sensor fabrication process <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. A key limitation of the PEC etch process is that directionality is poor. As a result, for example, accurate and repeatable control of the lateral dimensions of diaphragms in pressure sensor fabrication is difficult.</p><p>For many MEMS applications, such as pressure sensing, hybrid devices consisting of SiC films on bulkmicromachined Si substrates have been fabricated. Si bulk-micromachining techniques are well suited to fabricate these structures. SiC is so resistant to Si anisotropic etchants that it acts as an outstanding etch stop. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows examples of patterned SiC structures that have had the underlying Si substrate removed by Si bulkmicromachining techniques. The most basic hybrid structure is a 3C-SiC membrane on a Si substrate. A 3C-SiC film of the desired thickness is first grown on the front side of a Si substrate. A thermal oxidation step is then performed to grow a 1.5-m-thick thermal oxide on the exposed back side of the Si wafer. The back-  side oxide is photolithographically patterned to expose the diaphragm etch features, and the front-side oxide, which is comparatively thin, is etched off the 3C-SiC surface. The sample is then immersed in a KOH etch bath to etch away the exposed Si regions and form the SiC diaphragms. We have demonstrated the potential of this technique for batch fabrication by bulk micromachining approximately 275 2-m-thick 3C-SiC diaphragms on a 4-in Si wafer <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> is a 35 mm photo of a 4-in Si wafer with 3C-SiC diaphragms. Examples of hybrid structures, such as pressure sensors, are also discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Microfabricated Molds</head><p>As an alternative to conventional SiC RIE, we have developed microfabricated SiO molds to be used in conjunction with polishing to pattern poly-SiC films into micrometer-sized features. The SiC micromolding process combines SiC film growth, SiC polishing, and dissolving of the SiO molds to achieve the desired features. The process is simple and does not suffer from the difficulties associated with RIE of SiC.</p><p>The mold process begins with the growth of a 1.5-mthick film on a 4-in silicon wafer by thermal oxidation. The SiO film is then photolithographically patterned and etched to form the mold. Following mold definition, the wafer is prepared for SiC growth. Film growth occurs at 1180 C with silane and propane flowing at 204 sccm and 52 sccm, respectively. The growth rate of SiC under these conditions is approximately 2 m/hr, which is sufficient to completely fill the mold within an hour. The poly-SiC film adheres well to both the Si substrate and the SiO mold. Removal of the film on top of the mold is accomplished by mechanical polishing using a relatively aggressive polishing recipe, which employs a 3-m-diameter diamond particle suspension and a 29.5-cm-diameter perforated polishing pad. Once the top surface of the SiO mold is exposed, the polishing is stopped, and a 49% (by weight) hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution is used to remove the mold.</p><p>Using this process, lines and gaps as small as 1 m can be fabricated as the deposition process provides excellent conformal coverage to the mold topography. Furthermore, the SiC anchors strongly to the Si substrate, and the adhesion is not affected by the aggressive polishing step. This process can be used to make complex structures with smooth sidewalls, though the top surfaces will evidence microscratches as a function of the polishing process. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows SEM photos of SiC micromotor gears fabricated using this process. Compare the magnified view of the smooth SiC sidewalls in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> to that of the comparably rough RIE etched poly-SiC lateral resonant device in Section IV-D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SiC MEMS DEVICES</head><p>The processing techniques described in the previous sections have provided the stepping stone to the first generation of SiC MEMS devices. A range of prototype sensors have been fabricated and tested for the measurement of temperature, gas species, pressure, and various other associated parameters in high-temperature environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Temperature Sensors</head><p>Some of the first SiC-based sensors were fabricated from poly-SiC due to the ease of deposition and the ability to deposit poly-SiC on many different substrates. In 1990, the fabrication of a poly-SiC thin-film thermistor on an alumina substrate was reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The sensor was fabricated from rf-sputter-deposited SiC, using sintered SiC as a target, Ar as a sputtering gas, and a deposition pressure of 20 mtorr. The substrate was maintained at a deposition temperature of 650 C. Au-Pt comb-shaped thick films were used as electrodes. Various packages for the thermistor were developed, and the device was tested at temperatures from 0 to 500 C. The authors found that the thermistor constant (B) increased linearly with temperature over the entire temperature range. Compared with conventional metal-oxide thermistors, the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) for the SiC devices decreased more slowly with increasing temperature. Additionally, the sensor exhibited good thermal stability and a rapid thermal response. The authors observed a resistance change of only 5% after a continuous test at 500 C for 1000 h.</p><p>A second group reported the fabrication of SiC-based resistive temperature sensors on Si substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. SiC films for this sensor were prepared by plasma-assisted CVD, using dichlorosilane and methane as Si and C source gases. Stoichiometric SiC films were obtained with a dichlorosilane flow rate of 15 sccm, a methane flow rate of 5-10 sccm, an rf power of 70 W, and a substrate temperature of 750 C. Poly-SiC films were deposited on thermally oxidized Si substrates and patterned into resistors by RIE. To reduce thermal conduction to the substrate, the resistors were made into cantilever structures using bulk micromachining of the Si substrate by KOH etching, with the contact pads anchored to the substrate. The resistors were tested at temperatures between 0 and 300 C and exhibited a temperature coefficient of resistance of 1800 ppm/ C. The sensor was placed into a nitrogen flow stream to evaluate its performance as a gas mass flow sensor. The output characteristics of the SiC sensor showed a square root dependence, and the output sensitivity was 0.05 mV/sccm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Gas Sensors</head><p>A promising approach to detect incompletely combusted hydrocarbons in the engine exhaust utilizes solid-state sensors based on SiC. Without exception, 6H-SiC is the dominant polytype for gas sensing. These sensors are based on simple Schottky diode and MOS structures. 6H-SiC, having the highest crystal quality of all the commercially available polytypes, provides the best surface for Schottky contacts and MOS devices.</p><p>The first SiC-based gas sensors were 6H-SiC MOS structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Called metal-oxide-SiC (MOSiC) structures, these sensors use catalytic metals such as Pt and Pd as the gate metals. The sensor works on the principle that hydrogen atoms or hydrogen-containing radicals diffusing through the gate will collect at the metal-oxide interface and form a dipole layer, which lowers the flat band voltage of the MOS capacitor. Hydrogen sensors have been fabricated from Si MOS structures, but the operating temperature is limited to below 250 C. However, many hydrocarbons dissociate at temperatures between 350 and 500 C, making SiC the semiconductor of choice for solidstate MOS hydrocarbon gas sensors.</p><p>Early SiC MOS gas sensors were made using 6H-SiC substrates, on which a 40-nm-thick SiO layer was thermally grown <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Approximately 50 nm of Pt was deposited by either e-beam evaporation or dc magnetron sputtering on the SiO surface and patterned to form the MOSiC structure. The sensors were tested at temperatures as high as 800 C without failing. At 450 C, the sensors were able to detect the presence of saturated hydrocarbons such as methane, propane, ethane, and butane at concentrations below 0.6% volume. Moreover, the sensors functioned in both vacuum and air at elevated temperatures. The response of the sensor exhibited an increase commensurate with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule being detected. With an operating temperature well above 500 C, these sensors are well suited for deployment in exhaust streams very near the combustion chamber.</p><p>Schottky diode-type 4H-SiC hydrogen and hydrocarbon gas sensors have also been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The sensors were constructed from 4-5-m-thick 4H-SiC films epitaxially grown on 4H-SiC substrates. Approximately 400 Å of Pd was sputter deposited and patterned to form circular contacts to the 4H-SiC. The sensors were tested over a temperature range of 100-400 C in a hydrocarbon environment. At 400 C, the devices showed a sensitivity of 300 ppm to hydrogen and propylene. Recently, we have fabricated Al/3C-SiC Schottky diodes with high breakdown voltages. Though 3C-SiC films have a higher defect density, they are again better suited for batch fabrication because they can be grown on large-area Si substrates. An I-V curve for an Al/3C-SiC Schottky diode is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. The ability to fabricate Schottky diodes on these films foreshadows the viability of gas sensors using 3C-SiC.</p><p>A third method of fabricating SiC-based gas sensors uses porous SiC <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. These sensors consist of a chromium grid, which is evaporated onto a layer of porous SiC. The porous layer is formed by PEC of an n-type 6H-SiC wafer. The thickness of the porous layer was not reported. A nickel contact was deposited on the nonporous back of the 6H-SiC wafer. The Cr grid serves to set up a potential in the porous SiC region. It is believed that hydrocarbon gases have a characteristic dissociation potential; so by varying the grid potential, distinct hydrocarbons will dissociate. The concentration of each species is determined by reading the magnitude of current flow across the device for each grid potential. This sensor is an improvement over the previously mentioned devices in that it does not require high temperatures to operate, and it can discriminate between hydrocarbon species. Tests using methane, propane, and argon conducted at temperatures between 200-500 C verified these capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Pressure Sensors</head><p>Kulite Semiconductor Products, Leonia, NJ, has developed a 6H-SiC-based pressure sensor that is reported to exhibit stable operation at 500 C <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The sensor uses ntype 6H-SiC piezoresistors on a p-type 6H-SiC diaphragm. The diaphragm is fabricated using the PEC etching process of 6H-SiC described above. During the development of the etching process, Kulite demonstrated a p-type etch stop for n-type PEC etching. The fabrication process begins with epitaxial growth of p-type 6H-SiC on n-type 6H-SiC wafers, followed by the epitaxial growth of n-type 6H-SiC on the p-type epilayers. PEC etching is used to bulk micromachine the n-type 6H-SiC wafer into 50-m-thick diaphragms and also to pattern the n-type epitaxial 6H-SiC into piezoresistors. Multilayer Ti/TiN/Pt/Au metal contacts are used in conjunction with Au wire bonding to package the device. A full-scale output of 40.66 mV at 1000 psi and 25 C, decreasing to 20.33 mV at 500 C, is reported. The device has a temperature coefficient of gauge factor of 0.19%/ C at 100 C and 0.11%/ C at 500 C. Despite the attractiveness of an "all-SiC" high-temperature pressure sensor, a key limitation of this approach, in addition to small wafer sizes and complex fabrication processes, is that the PEC etch process directionality is poor, making lateral dimensional control (e.g., diaphragm size) difficult.</p><p>A second approach developed by Daimler Benz, AG, and the Technical University of Berlin for fabricating SiC-based pressure sensors utilizes 3C-SiC films grown on siliconon-insulator (SOI) substrates and Si bulk micromachining to produce dielectrically isolated 3C-SiC piezoresistors on a thick Si membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The piezoresistors were realized by conventional heteroepitaxial growth of 3C-SiC on the SOI substrates, followed by photolithography and RIE. The thin oxide in the SOI substrate prohibits leakage currents between the 3C-SiC piezoresistors and the Si substrate, a problem that is magnified at high temperatures. For each sensor, a circular Si diaphragm was micromachined to a thickness of 100 m using RIE in an SF /O plasma, and four 3C-SiC piezoresistors were patterned using SF /O RIE. A thermally grown capping oxide was used over the piezoresistors for electrical isolation. Sputter-deposited TiWN was used for high-temperature ohmic contacts. The sensor was tested in the temperature range between 25-400 C and at pressures up to 500 KPa. The sensor showed a linear output voltage over the pressure range and a temperature coefficient of sensitivity of 0.16%/ C at 400 C. Recently, Daimler Benz also reported the development of a hermetic pressure sensor capsule for their SiC-based pressure sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. This sensor design takes advantage of well-established Si micromachining techniques. However, the hybrid SiC/Si device is subject to SiC/Si thermal mismatch effects, which may degrade long-term device performance and lifetime in the presence of thermal cycling. This would also be the case for our current pressure sensors, described next.</p><p>We have recently developed two SiC-based pressure sensor prototypes. The prototypes differ only by the material used for the piezoresistive sensing elements, with the first prototype using NiCr thin films and the second using ptype polysilicon. These two materials exhibit reasonable gauge factors and are electrically and chemically stable at temperatures above 300 C <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The diaphragm material is a 2-m-thick, 3C-SiC film grown on an Si wafer in our rf-induction, vertical APCVD reactor. The 1 1 mm diaphragm was formed by bulk micromachining the underlying Si substrate from the back side in KOH. The thin NiCr film was sputter deposited and patterned into four piezoresistors, which were arranged in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. The piezoresistors were positioned near the four edges of the diaphragm. Similarly, highly doped ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>10 cm ) p-type polysilicon, which has a gauge factor between 20 and 30, was deposited by LPCVD and identically patterned to form the sense elements in the second prototype. SiO films were used for dielectric isolation and passivation, and Al was sputtered and annealed at 450 C to form ohmic contacts to the NiCr and polysilicon piezoresistors.   linearity up to 300 C. The TCR was found to be less than 40 ppm/ C. The NiCr piezoresistors exhibit stable resistivity up to 300 C, but at higher temperatures, the resistivity decreases with increasing temperature. The resistivity of the polysilicon film after patterning is 0.106 -cm, and the total resistance of the polysilicon resistors was about 30 k . The change in resistance as a function of temperature decreases with increasing temperature. The TCR is 2560 ppm/ C at 25 C and exhibits the characteristic exponential decrease to 1440 ppm/ C at 300 C. The polysilicon piezoresistors exhibit good thermal stability at 400 C. The sensitivity of the polysilicon/3C-SiC pressure sensor is 0.14 mV/(Vpsi) and decreases with increasing temperature. It exhibits better linearity than the NiCr/3C-SiC pressure sensor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Lateral Resonant Devices</head><p>Lateral resonant devices are basic to surface micromachining and are used extensively as building blocks for a variety of sensor and actuator implementations. Sibased lateral resonant devices, however, are not suitable for operation in high-temperature environments. The first reported SiC-based surface-micromachined lateral resonant devices were fabricated using poly-SiC films deposited on polysilicon sacrificial layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The substrate was first prepared by growing a 1-m-thick thermal oxide on a silicon wafer. The thermally grown SiO layer electrically isolated the contact pads and served to protect the Si substrate during release. A 2-m-thick polysilicon film was then deposited on the oxidized Si substrate. Poly-SiC was deposited on top of the polysilicon using a three-step SiC growth process (in situ clean, carbonization, film growth). RIE was used in conjunction with photolithography to pattern the poly-SiC film into the desired shape. The free-standing sections of the resonator were released by using a timed-etch in KOH, to which SiC is impervious. Supercritical drying was used to minimize stiction problems associated with the release. A schematic diagram of the SiC surface-micromachining process using a polysilicon sacrificial layer is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, and SEM photos of a typical poly-SiC lateral resonant device are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>. This device was resonated at a frequency of 42.6 using an actuation voltage of 110 V. Although polysilicon proved to be an adequate sacrificial layer material for SiC surface micromachining, SiO is preferred, since it can be used as both the electrical isolation layer and sacrificial layer. Based on the successful APCVD depositions of poly-SiC on SiO , we have developed an SiC surface-micromachined lateral resonant device using an SiO sacrificial layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. These structures were fabricated from 2-m-thick poly-SiC films grown on 3.5-m-thick SiO sacrificial layers on Si substrates. The poly-SiC films were photolithographically patterned using RIE to form the resonator structure. The devices were released by a timed etch in 49% (by weight) HF solution, which removed the underlying SiO to form the free-standing poly-SiC structures. These devices were resonated at frequencies between 18 and 50 KHz, depending on the device geometry, using voltages of 50 V.</p><p>Motivated by the belief that SiC will outperform Si at high temperatures, we studied the resonant frequency of poly-SiC and polysilicon lateral resonant structures at temperatures up to 900 C <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. All devices used in this study were fabricated from 2-m-thick films deposited on SiO sacrificial layers, using the same photolithographic mask and surface-micromachining process. Testing was performed in an argon-filled chamber, which was equipped with a heated sample stage capable of reaching temperatures The resonant frequency of a lateral resonant structure is a function of device geometry and material properties and is described by the following equation:</p><p>where is the thickness of the beam, is the Young's modulus, is the width of the beam, is the mass of the device, and is the length of the beam. Taking into account the thermal expansion properties of the device, it can be shown that the thermal expansion of and will cancel out, and the thermal expansion of is very small and should cause an increase in the resonant frequency of the device. However, the resonant frequency of both the poly-SiC and the polysilicon devices decreased, implying that the Young's modulus is reduced at elevated temperatures. Poly-SiC, which exhibits a smaller variation in Young's modulus with temperature, is superior to polysilicon as a structural material for high-temperature MEMS applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Atomizers</head><p>Micromachining is a technology that is not limited to the production of only microsensors and microactuators but can be used to batch fabricate precision mechanical pieceparts. This is especially important in the development of micromachined SiC fuel atomizers as an alternative to conventional metal atomizers in gas turbine engines. Integrated flow modulation systems are an important aspect of the quest for optimization of gas turbine engine performance, and micromachined structures lend themselves more readily to the incorporation of actuators capable of varying flow rates and spray angles of fuel-injection systems.</p><p>Micromachined silicon atomizers were fabricated on 4in Si wafers using a deep RIE etching process <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. A typical silicon atomizer is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>. The device was fabricated by deep RIE of both sides of a double-sided polished (100) Si wafer. The flexibility of the fabrication process allowed for the testing of many design geometries and ultimately the optimization of the device geometry using a statistical response surface methodology. Comparative tests of conventional and Si atomizers indicated that the Si atomizers outperformed conventional atomizers, especially at low pressures. Unfortunately, the Si atomizers lacked the erosion resistance of conventional atomizers. In hopes of increasing the erosion resistance of the structures, we applied a 3C-SiC coating to the Si atomizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Because the atomizers were fabricated from single-crystalline Si wafers, the high-temperature deposition process with carbonization was used. This was the first attempt at growing 3C-SiC on high-aspect-ratio Si topographies. Conformal coverage of the atomizer surfaces was achieved, with thickness ranging from 1.5 m on the top surfaces to 0.5 m on the swirl chamber floor.</p><p>The performance of the SiC-coated atomizers in terms of flow rate, Sauter mean diameter (SMD), and spray angle was compared with silicon atomizers using MIL- C-7024 Type II jet-fuel stimulant. The flow rates for the coated atomizers were consistently 7-11% higher than the noncoated atomizers. The SMD's were the same for both atomizer types. Higher spray angles at low pressure (14 psi) and high pressure (100 psi) were also observed for the 3C-SiC coated atomizers. The spray angle is a rough gauge of atomizer efficiency, with wider spray angles denoting better performance.</p><p>To qualitatively gauge the improvement of the erosion resistance of the Si atomizers by applying the SiC coating, a 30-h erosion test was performed. The test fluid consisted of jet fuel mixed with abrasives like iron oxide, quartz, and Arizona road dust. The test fluid was pressurized to 150 psi. SEM analysis of the region near the exit orifice [highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12(a)</ref>] was performed, since this region is subject to the highest erosive damage. SEM analysis of atomizer performance in erosion tests was constrained to this area. The uncoated atomizers showed significant edge rounding near the exit orifice, whereas the coated atomizers showed no evidence of edge rounding. Figs. 13 and 14 are SEM photos of uncoated and coated atomizer exit orifice edges before and after the 30-h erosion test. The success of the performance tests prompted the fabrication of solid SiC atomizers of similar geometry using novel micromachining and microfabrication techniques. Examination of the SiC atomizer surfaces revealed SiC protrusions from various locations on the device. These outgrowths are generated during the SiC atomizer fabrication process. An SEM photo of the SiC atomizer, which is a significant enabling achievement in precision SiC bulk micromachining, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>. The flow performance of the SiC atomizers was compared to that of Si micromachined atomizers of like design. Despite the protrusions on the flow surfaces, the test results show that the performance of the SiC atomizers compares favorably with that of the Si atomizers in terms of flow rates and spray angles. In addition, the SiC atomizers operate continuously at much higher pressures than the Si atomizers, spraying at pressures of up to 300 psi, with critical support areas at half the thickness of the Si atomizers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SiC-ON-INSULATOR TECHNOLOGY</head><p>Unlike poly-SiC, 3C-SiC cannot be grown directly on SiO or any other suitable nonconducting sacrificial mate- rial, thereby making surface micromachining and electrical isolation of single crystal 3C-SiC structures and devices very difficult. The need for single-crystal SiC-on-insulator structures is great, which has motivated researchers to borrow from SOI fabrication techniques in order to produce SiC-on-insulator substrates. Three processes to fabricate SiC-on-insulator structures have been reported in the literature: 1) growth of 3C-SiC on SOI substrates, 2) the Smart Cut process, and 3) wafer bonding.</p><p>The first attempts to create an electrically isolated 3C-SiC film used SOI wafers as substrates for epitaxial growth of 3C-SiC. The SOI wafers were produced either by ion implantation of O into the subsurface region of Si wafers (SIMOX) or by bonding two thermally oxidized Si wafers and removing all but a very thin layer of one of the wafers (Unibond). The processing details for each of the techniques can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. To create SiC-on-insulator substrates from SOI wafers, the thin Si layer atop the buried oxide must be fully converted to 3C-SiC; otherwise, an undesirable 3C-SiC-on-Si-on-SiO structure is created. The conversion process must occur during the carbonization step, which is a self-limiting process, putting an upper thickness limit of 200 nm on the Si layer. It has been observed that during the carbonization process, out-diffusion of oxygen from the buried SiO layer occurs, leaving sealed cavities in the insulator structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. These sealed cavities may adversely affect the electrical and mechanical properties of the insulator layer. SIMOX substrates have the added disadvantages that the thickness of the implanted oxide layers is limited to a few thousand angstroms and the quality of the implanted oxide is much less than the buried thermal oxide of the Unibond process.</p><p>The Smart Cut process was first developed to produce SOI structures for silicon-based microelectronics <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The process combines ion implantation with wafer bonding to create the SOI structure. Two Si wafers, hereafter called the handle wafer and the implant wafer, are thermally oxidized. Into the implant wafer, hydrogen ions are implanted through the oxide layer (1 m thick) plus a thin silicon layer. After implantation, the wafers are bonded together and annealed. The implanted hydrogen condenses in the Si, forming a well-defined layer of voids that serves as a seam, breaking the implant wafer into two parts and leaving the thin Si layer bonded to the handle wafer. The annealing step also serves to anneal out any ion-induced lattice damage in the thin Si layer. After bonding, the Si surface is polished and readied for processing.</p><p>The Smart Cut process has been adapted to SiC-oninsulator structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Instead of using a thermally oxidized Si wafer as the implant wafer, 6H-SiC substrates with 1m-thick deposited oxide layers are used. These implant wafers were successfully bonded to 6H-SiC, polycrystalline SiC, and Si handle wafers. The process works well because it does not require the carbonization of an Si layer to form SiC; thus, the underlying oxide is not subjected to conditions that contribute to cavity formation. In theory, the technique should work to create 3C-SiC-on-insulator structures on large-area substrates, but stress issues may play a role in determining the success with large Si wafers. Smalldiameter 6H-SiC wafers (2 in) limit the overall area of SiCon-insulator structures that this process can create. It also has been reported that implantation damage, which reduces the conductivity of the 6H-SiC layer, is not annealed out during the bonding step <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Annealing out these defects may require temperatures too high for the SiO layer.</p><p>A third method to create SiC-on-insulator structures uses a process familiar to MEMS fabricators, wafer bonding <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The process begins with epitaxial growth of 3C-SiC on an Si substrate. A handle wafer is prepared by thermally oxidizing a Si wafer. A thermal oxide is then grown on the 3C-SiC film. The two oxide surfaces are treated and the wafers are bonded. The handle wafer is protected and the bonded pair is immersed in KOH, removing the SiCcoated Si wafer, leaving a 3C-SiC-on-insulator structure. Unfortunately, only 30% of the SiC film area remained bonded after KOH etching.</p><p>We have developed a similar technique to produce 3C-SiC-on-SiO structures with an area transfer yield of up to 80% on a 4-in wafer <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Our process utilizes a polysiliconto-polysilicon bond to create the desired structure. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">16</ref> shows a schematic diagram of the 3C-SiC-on-insulator fabrication process. The process begins with epitaxial growth of a 0.5-m-thick 3C-SiC film on a 4-in Si wafer, hereafter called the transfer wafer (Wafer 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">16</ref>), after which the SiC film is chemically cleaned and thermally oxidized to produce a 0.3-m-thick SiO film from the topmost 0.2 m of 3C-SiC. A 0.5-m-thick polysilicon film is grown on the SiO layer and completely oxidized, resulting in a total oxide thickness of 1.44 m on the 3C-SiC film. Following the second thermal oxidation, a 2.0-m-thick polysilicon film is deposited on the wafer and polished to a mirror finish by chemical-mechanical polishing. Concurrently, a 1.5-m-thick thermal oxide followed by a 2.0-m-thick polysilicon film is deposited on a second wafer, hereafter called the handle wafer (Wafer 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">16</ref>). As before, the polysilicon surface is polished to a mirror finish.</p><p>The polysilicon-to-polysilicon bonding process consists of three steps: 1) a prebond surface treatment, 2) room- temperature bonding, and 3) high-temperature annealing.</p><p>Step 1) is a standard organic and metallic (RCA) cleaning of the polished polysilicon surfaces. Step 2) places the polysilicon surfaces firmly together, using van der Waals attraction to keep the surfaces in contact.</p><p>Step 3) is an anneal at 1100 C in nitrogen for at least 5 h.</p><p>Following the anneal, the bonded pair is submerged in ethylenediamine-pyrocatechol, which etches away the transfer wafer, leaving a 3C-SiC-on-SiO structure atop the handle wafer. A transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of the structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17</ref>. The 3C-SiC film is too thin for most MEMS applications, so a thick ( 1.0 m) film is homoepitaxially grown on the 3C-SiC-on-SiO substrate. The substrate is prepared for homoepitaxial growth by a four-step process: 1) mechanical polishing, 2) thermal oxidation, 3) chemical etching, and 4) in situ hightemperature hydrogen etching. The region of highest defect density in 3C-SiC films grown on Si substrates is near the SiC/Si interface. The bonding process exposes this region by "flipping" the SiC film over. Mechanical polishing with a SiC-based slurry is used to remove this region. Any defects created during the polishing step are removed by the subsequent thermal oxidation and chemical etching steps. Any residue on the 3C-SiC surface is removed immediately  before homoepitaxial growth by the in situ hydrogen etch, which is performed at 1000 C. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">18</ref> shows a TEM micrograph of the homoepitaxial 3C-SiC film grown on the 3C-SiC-on-SiO structure. The TEM shows a clear reduction of crystalline defects in the homoepitaxial film, as compared with the underlying 3C-SiC, which was grown by the conventional 3C-SiCon-Si heteroepitaxial process. The TEM observations were confirmed by rocking curve XRD. Although the physical mechanism responsible for the reduction of defects has not yet been identified, it is believed that the surface treatment prior to homoepitaxial growth plays a key role.</p><p>The potential impact of this process for high-temperature MEMS is great. For the first time, large-area, singlecrystalline 3C-SiC can be produced on top of thick oxide layers, making electrically isolated 3C-SiC MEMS devices possible by bulk-and surface-micromachining techniques. The reduced defect density is a significant accomplishment and will improve the performance of both mechanical and electronic structures in 3C-SiC-based MEMS devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>The field of SiC MEMS for high-temperature (e.g., above 350 C) applications is advancing beyond material characterization and process development toward the fabrication of prototype devices, some of which have been packaged and demonstrated in high-temperature and erosive environments. Development of sensors and actuators will most certainly continue, and as early prototypes are successfully demonstrated, more application areas and corresponding devices will be conceived. This will, in turn, give rise to the need for additional material characterization and process development, as more sophisticated devices are required. ct par Advances in two related areas will further enable SiC MEMS to have an impact on commercial and military applications: 1) reliable SiC electronics and 2) viable hightemperature wire bonding and packaging technologies. Fortunately, research on SiC-based electronics, including metallization, for high-temperature applications has been and will continue to be intense. As larger area, defect-free 6Hand 4H-SiC wafers become available, improvements in electronic device performance and overall cost will occur. Following in the path of Si, integrated SiC surface-and bulk-micromachining processes can be envisioned, given the technology building blocks presently available. However, advances in wire bonding techniques and packages for high-temperature applications have been few. This should change as SiC electronics, sensor, and actuator technologies become more advanced. By all indications, the future looks bright for SiC-based MEMS for applications in harsh environments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
