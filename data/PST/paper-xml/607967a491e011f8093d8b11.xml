<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have received considerable research attention recently. Most GCNs learn the node representations in Euclidean geometry, but that could have a high distortion in the case of embedding graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure. Recently, some GCNs are proposed to deal with this problem in non-Euclidean geometry, e.g., hyperbolic geometry. Although hyperbolic GCNs achieve promising performance, existing hyperbolic graph operations actually cannot rigorously follow the hyperbolic geometry, which may limit the ability of hyperbolic geometry and thus hurt the performance of hyperbolic GCNs. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperbolic GCN named Lorentzian graph convolutional network (LGCN), which rigorously guarantees the learned node features follow the hyperbolic geometry. Specifically, we rebuild the graph operations of hyperbolic GCNs with Lorentzian version, e.g., the feature transformation and non-linear activation. Also, an elegant neighborhood aggregation method is designed based on the centroid of Lorentzian distance. Moreover, we prove some proposed graph operations are equivalent in different types of hyperbolic geometry, which fundamentally indicates their correctness. Experiments on six datasets show that LGCN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. LGCN has lower distortion to learn the representation of tree-likeness graphs compared with existing hyperbolic GCNs. We also find that the performance of some hyperbolic GCNs can be improved by simply replacing the graph operations with those we defined in this paper.</p></div>

The current GCNs usually follow a message passing manner, where the key steps are feature transformation and neighborhood aggregation. Specifically, GCNs leverage feature transformation to transform the features into higher-level features, and neighborhood aggregation in GCNs averages the features of its local neighborhood for a given node. GCNs have aroused considerable attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and are widely used in many application areas, e.g., natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>, recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref> and disease prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</p><p>Most GCNs learn the node features in Euclidean spaces. However, some studies find that compared with Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic geometry actually can provide more powerful ability to embed graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. As a consequence, several recent efforts begin to define graph operations in hyperbolic spaces (e.g., feature transformation, neighborhood aggregation), and propose hyperbolic GCNs in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. For instance, HGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> extends the graph convolution on the hyperboloid manifold of hyperbolic spaces, while HAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> leverages the Poincaré ball manifold to design hyperbolic graph operations.</p><p>Despite the promising performance of hyperbolic GCNs, existing hyperbolic message passing rules do not rigorously follow hyperbolic geometry, which may not fully embody the ability of hyperbolic spaces. Specifically, these hyperbolic GCNs suffer from the following issues: (1) Some hyperbolic graph operations could make node features out of the hyperbolic spaces. For example, a critical step of HGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the feature transformation, is actually conducted in tangent spaces. However, it ignores the constraint of Lorentzian scalar product in tangent spaces, which leads to the node features deviate from the hyperboloid manifold. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> The current hyperbolic neighborhood aggregations do not conform to the same mathematical meanings with Euclidean one, which could cause a distortion for the learned node features. Actually, the mathematical meanings of Euclidean neighborhood aggregation can be considered as the weighted arithmetic mean or centroid of the representations of node neighbors. However, the neighborhood aggregation in hyperbolic GCN may not obey the similar rules in hyperbolic spaces.</p><p>Taking HGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> as an example, it aggregates the node features in tangent spaces, which can only meet the mathematical meanings in tangent spaces, rather than hyperbolic spaces. Since we aim to build a hyperbolic GCN, it is a fundamental requirement to ensure the basic graph operations rigorously follow the hyperbolic geometry and mathematical meaning, so that we can well possess the capability of preserving the graph structure and property in the hyperbolic spaces.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a novel Lorentzian Graph Convolutional Network (LGCN), which designs a unified framework of graph operations on the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic spaces. The rigorous hyperbolic graph operations, including feature transformation and non-linearity activation, are derived from this framework to ensure the transformed node features follow the hyperbolic geometry. Also, based on the centroid of Lorentzian distance, an elegant hyperbolic neighborhood aggregation is proposed to make sure the node features are aggregated to satisfy the mathematical meanings. Moreover, we theoretically prove that some proposed graph operations are equivalent to those defined in another typical hyperbolic geometry, i.e., the Poincaré ball model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, so the proposed methods elegantly bridge the relation of these graph operations in different models of hyperbolic spaces, and also indicates the proposed methods fill the gap of lacking rigorously graph operations on the hyperboloid model. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of LGCN, well demonstrating the superiority of LGCN in link prediction and node classification tasks, and LGCN has lower distortion when learning the representation of tree-likeness graphs compared with existing hyperbolic GCNs. We also find the proposed Lorentzian graph operations can enhance the performance of existing hyperbolic GCN in molecular property prediction task, by simply replacing their operation operations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">LGCN: OUR PROPOSED MODEL</head><p>In order to solve the issues of existing hyperbolic GCNs, we propose LGCN, which designs graph operations to guarantee the mathematical meanings in hyperbolic spaces. Specifically, LGCN first maps the input node features into hyperbolic spaces and then conducts feature transformation via a delicately designed Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication. Also, the centroid based Lorentzian aggregation is proposed to aggregate features, and the aggregation weights are learned by a self attention mechanism. Moreover, Lorentzian pointwise non-linear activation is followed to obtain the output node features. Note that the curvature of a hyperbolic space (i.e., −1/𝛽) is also a trainable parameter for LGCN. Despite the same expressive power, adjusting curvature of LGCN is important in practice due to factors of limited machine precision and normalization. The details of LGCN are introduced in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Mapping feature with different curvature</head><p>The input node features of LGCN could live in the Euclidean spaces or hyperbolic spaces. For 𝑘-dimensional input features, we denote them as h 𝑘,𝐸 ∈ R 𝑘 ( 𝐸 indicates Euclidean spaces) and h 𝑘,𝛽 ′ ∈ H 𝑘,𝛽 ′ , respectively. If original features live in Euclidean spaces, we need to map them into hyperbolic spaces. We assume that the input features h 𝑘,𝐸 live in the tangent space of H 𝑘,𝛽 at its origin 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">= ( √︁ 𝛽, 0, • • • , 0) ∈ H 𝑘,𝛽 , i.e.</formula><p>, T 0 H 𝑘,𝛽 . A "0" element is added at the first coordinate of h 𝑘,𝐸 to satisfy the constraint ⟨(0, h 𝑘,𝐸 ), 0⟩ L = 0 in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>). Thus, the input feature h 𝑘,𝐸 ∈ R 𝑘 can be mapped to the hyperbolic spaces via exponential map:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">h 𝑘,𝛽 = exp 𝛽 0 (0, h 𝑘,𝐸 ) . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>If the input features h 𝑘,𝛽 ′ live in a hyperbolic space (e.g., the output of previous LGCN layer), whose curvature −1/𝛽 ′ might be different with the curvature of current hyperboloid model. We can transform it into the hyperboloid model with a specific curvature −1/𝛽:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">h 𝑘,𝛽 = exp 𝛽 0 (log 𝛽 ′ 0 (h 𝑘,𝛽 ′ )).<label>(11)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Lorentzian feature transformation</head><p>Hyperbolic spaces are not vector spaces, which means the operations in Euclidean spaces cannot be applied in hyperbolic spaces.</p><p>To ensure the transformed features satisfy the hyperbolic geometry, it is crucial to define some canonical transformations in the hyperboloid model, so we define:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Definition 4.1 (Lorentzian version). For 𝑓 : R 𝑛 → R 𝑚 (𝑛, 𝑚 &gt; 2) and two points x = (𝑥 0 , • • • , 𝑥 𝑛 ) ∈ H 𝑛,𝛽 , v = (𝑣 0 , • • • , 𝑣 𝑛 ) ∈ T 0 H 𝑛,𝛽</formula><p>, we define the Lorentzian version of 𝑓 as the map H 𝑛,𝛽 → H 𝑚,𝛽 by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">𝑓 ⊗ 𝛽 (x) := exp 𝛽 0 ( f (log 𝛽 0 (x))), f (v) := (0, 𝑓 (𝑣 1 , • • • , 𝑣 𝑛 )), (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where exp</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">𝛽 0 : T 0 H 𝑛,𝛽 → H 𝑚,𝛽 and log 𝛽 0 : H 𝑛,𝛽 → T 0 H 𝑚,𝛽 .</formula><p>Lorentzian version leverages logarithmic and exponential map to project the features between hyperbolic spaces and tangent spaces. As the tangent spaces are vector spaces and isomorphic to R 𝑛 , the Euclidean transformations can be applied to the tangent spaces. Moreover, given a point v = (𝑣 0 , • • • , 𝑣 𝑛 ) ∈ T 0 H 𝑛,𝛽 , existing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> directly apply the Euclidean transformations on all coordinates (𝑣 0 , • • • , 𝑣 𝑛 ) in tangent spaces. Different from these methods, Lorentzian version only leverages the Euclidean transformations on the last 𝑛 coordinates (𝑣 1 , • • • , 𝑣 𝑛 ) in tangent spaces, and the first coordinate (𝑣 0 ) is set as "0" to satisfy the constraint in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>). Thus, this operation can make sure the transformed features rigorously follow the hyperbolic geometry.</p><p>In order to apply linear transformation on the hyperboloid model, following Lorentzian version, the Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication can be derived: Definition 4.2 (Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication). If M : R 𝑛 → R 𝑚 is a linear map with matrix representation, given two points</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">x = (𝑥 0 , • • • , 𝑥 𝑛 ) ∈ H 𝑛,𝛽 , v = (𝑣 0 , • • • , 𝑣 𝑛 ) ∈ T 0 H 𝑛,𝛽 , we have: M ⊗ 𝛽 (x) = exp 𝛽 0 ( M(log 𝛽 0 (x))), M(v) = (0, M(𝑣 1 , • • • , 𝑣 𝑛 )). (13) Let M be a 𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix, M ′ be a 𝑙 × 𝑚 matrix, x ∈ H 𝑛,𝛽 , M⊗ 𝛽 x := M ⊗ 𝛽 (x), we have matrix associativity as: (M ′ M)⊗ 𝛽 x = M ′ ⊗ 𝛽 (M⊗ 𝛽 x).</formula><p>A key difference between Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication and other matrix-vector multiplications on the hyperboloid model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> is the size of the matrix M. Assuming a 𝑛-dimensional feature needs to be transformed into a 𝑚-dimensional feature. Naturally, the size of matrix M should be 𝑚 × 𝑛, which is satisfied by Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication. However, the size of matrix M is (𝑚 + 1) × (𝑛 + 1) for other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> (as shown in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>)), which leads to the constraint of tangent spaces cannot be satisfied, i.e., ⟨M log 𝛽 0 (h 𝑘,𝛽 𝑖 ), 0⟩ L ≠ 0 in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>), so the transformed features would be out of the hyperbolic spaces. Moreover, the Lorentzian matrix vector multiplication has the following property: Theorem 4.1. Given a point in hyperbolic space, which is represented by x 𝑛,𝛽 ∈ H 𝑛,𝛽 using hyperboloid model or x 𝑛,𝛼 ∈ D 𝑛,𝛼 using Poincaré ball model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, respectively. Let M be a 𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix, Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication M⊗ 𝛽 x 𝑛,𝛽 used in hyperboloid model is equivalent to Möbius matrix-vector multiplication M⊗ 𝛼 x 𝑛,𝛼 used in Poincaré ball model.</p><p>The proof is in Appendix B.1. This property elegantly bridges the relation between the hyperboloid model and Poincaré ball model w.r.t. matrix-vector multiplication. We use the Lorentzian matrixvector multiplication to conduct feature transformation on the hyperboloid model as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">h 𝑑,𝛽 = M⊗ 𝛽 h 𝑘,𝛽 .<label>(14)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Lorentzian neighborhood aggregation</head><p>As in Remark 3.1, in Euclidean spaces, the neighborhood aggregation is to compute the weight arithmetic mean or centroid (also called center of mass) of its neighborhood features (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(a)</ref>). Therefore, we aim to aggregate neighborhood features in hyperbolic spaces to follow these meanings. Fréchet mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> provides a feasible way to compute the centroid in Riemannian manifold. Also, the arithmetic mean can be interpreted as a kind of Fréchet mean. Thus, Fréchet mean meets the meanings of neighborhood aggregation. The main idea of Fréchet mean is to minimize an expectation of (squared) distances with a set of points. However, Fréchet mean does not have a closed form solution w.r.t. the intrinsic distance 𝑑 𝛽 H in hyperbolic spaces, and it has to be inefficiently computed by gradient descent. Therefore, we propose an elegant neighborhood aggregation method based on the centroid of the squared Lorentzian distance, which can well balance the mathematical meanings and efficiency: Theorem 4.2 (Lorentzian aggregation via centroid of sqared Lorentzian distance). For a node feature h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑖 ∈ H 𝑑,𝛽 , a set of its neighborhoods 𝑁 (𝑖) with aggregation weights 𝑤 𝑖 𝑗 &gt; 0, the neighborhood aggregation consists in the centroid c 𝑑,𝛽 of nodes, which minimizes the problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">arg min c 𝑑,𝛽 ∈H 𝑑,𝛽 ∑︁ 𝑗 ∈𝑁 (𝑖)∪{𝑖 } 𝑤 𝑖 𝑗 𝑑 2 L (h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑗 , c 𝑑,𝛽 ),<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where 𝑑 2 L (•, •) denotes squared Lorentzian distance, and this problem has closed form solution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">c 𝑑,𝛽 = √︁ 𝛽 𝑗 ∈𝑁 (𝑖)∪{𝑖 } 𝑤 𝑖 𝑗 h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑗 |∥ 𝑗 ∈𝑁 (𝑖)∪{𝑖 } 𝑤 𝑖 𝑗 h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑗 ∥ L | .

Similar to Fréchet/Karcher means, the node features computed by Lorentzian aggregation are the minimum of an expectation of squared Lorentzian distance. Also, the features of aggregation in Lorentzian neighborhood aggregation are the centroids in the hyperboloid model in geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. On the other hand, some hyperbolic GCNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref> aggregate neighborhoods in tangent spaces (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(c</ref>)), that can only be regarded as centroid or arithmetic mean in the tangent spaces, rather than hyperbolic spaces. Thus Lorentzian aggregation via centroid of squared Lorentzian distance is a promising method, which satisfies more elegant mathematical meanings compared to other hyperbolic GCNs.  As shown in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">16</ref>), there is an aggregation weight 𝑤 𝑖 𝑗 indicating the importance of neighborhoods for a center node. Here we propose a self-attention mechanism to learn the aggregation weights 𝑤 𝑖 𝑗 . For two node features h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑖 , h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑖 ∈ H 𝑑,𝛽 , the attention coefficient 𝜇 𝑖 𝑗 , which indicates the importance of node 𝑗 to node 𝑖, can be computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">𝜇 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝐴𝑇𝑇 (h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑖 , h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑗 , M 𝑎𝑡𝑡 ),<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where 𝐴𝑇𝑇 (•) indicates the function of computing the attention coefficient and the 𝑑 × 𝑑 matrix M 𝑎𝑡𝑡 is to transform the node features into attention-based ones.

We summarize the properties of graph operations of these hyperbolic GCNs in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. It can be seen that: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The existing hyperbolic GCNs do not have all of the three properties except LGCN. More importantly, none of the existing hyperbolic neighborhood aggregation satisfy expect-agg. (2) All the Poincaré ball GCNs satisfy inside 𝑓 and inside 𝑛 , while existing hyperboloid GCNs cannot make sure these properties. That is because they do not consider the constrain of tangent spaces and the transformed features will be outside of the hyperboloid. Note that because of lacking non-linear activation on the hyperboloid model, HGNN 𝐻 avoids this problem by conducting non-linear activation on the Poincaré ball, which is implemented via projecting node representations between the Poincaré ball and hyperboloid model. That brings extra computing cost, and also indicates a principle definition of graph operations is needed for the hyperboloid model. On the other hand, LGCN fills this gap of lacking rigorously graph operations on the hyperboloid model to ensure the features can be transformed following hyperbolic geometry. (3) Only LGCN satisfies expect-agg. Most hyperbolic GCNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref> leverage aggregation in the tangent spaces (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(c</ref>)), which satisfies expect-agg in the tangent spaces, instead of the hyperbolic spaces.</p></div>

The results of the link prediction are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, and a lower average distortion indicates a better preservation of the graph structure. We can find that LGCN has the lowest average distortion among these GCNs, which is benefited from the well-defined graph operations. Also, all the hyperbolic GCNs have lower average distortion compared with Euclidean GCNs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.5">Efficiency comparison.</head><p>We further analyze the efficiency of some GCNs. To better analyze the aggregation in Theorem 4.2, we provide a variant of LGCN named LGCN 𝐹 , which minimizes Eq.

Note that the aggregation of LGCN 𝐹 is a kind of Fréchet mean which dose not have closed-form solutions, so we compute it via a state-of-the-art gradient descent based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Here we report the link prediction performance and training time per 100 epochs of GCNs on Disease dataset in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. One can see that GCN is the fastest. Most hyperbolic GCNs, e.g., 𝜅GCN, HAT, LGCN, are on the same level with GAT. HGCN is slower than above methods, and LGCN 𝐹 is the slowest. Although hyperbolic GCNs are slower than Euclidean GCNs, they have better performance. Moreover, HGCN is significantly slower than LGCN, since HGCN aggregates different nodes in different tangent spaces, and this process cannot be computed parallelly. HAT addresses this problem by aggregating all the nodes in the same tangent space. Despite the running time of HAT and 𝜅GCN are on par with LGCN, LGCN achieves better results. Furthermore, both LGCN and LGCN 𝐹 aggregate nodes by minimizing an expectation of distance. However, the aggregation in LGCN has a closed-form solution while LGCN 𝐹 has not. Despite LGCN 𝐹 has a little improvement with LGCN, it is not cost-effective. To sum up, LGCN can learn more effective node representations with acceptable efficiency. 5.4.6 Parameter sensitivity. We further test the impact of attention matrix size of LGCN. We change the horizontal dimension of matrix from 4 to 256. The results on the link prediction task are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. We can see that with the growth of the matrix size, the performance raises first and then starts to drop slowly. The results indicate that the attention matrix needs a suitable size to learn the attention coefficient. Also, LGCN has a stable perofmance when the horizontal dimension ranges from 32 to 128.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY</head><p>Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry with a constant negative curvature. There are some equivalent hyperbolic models to describe hyperbolic geometry, including the hyperboloid model, the Poincaré ball model, and the Klein ball model, etc. Since we have introduced the hyperboloid model in Section 3.1, here we introduce the Poincaré ball model. More rigorous and in-depth introduction of differential geometry and hyperbolic geometry can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</p><p>Poincaré ball. We consider a specific Poincaré ball model D 𝑛,𝛼 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which is defined by an open 𝑑-dimensional ball of radius 1/ √ 𝛼 (𝛼 &gt; 0): D 𝑛,𝛼 := {x ∈ R 𝑛 : 𝛼 ∥x∥ 2 &lt; 1}, equipped with the Riemannian metric: 𝑔 D x = (𝜆 𝛼 x ) 2 𝑔 R , where 𝜆 𝛼 x = 2/(1−𝛼 ∥x∥ 2 ), 𝑔 R = I 𝑑 . When x = 0 ∈ D 𝑛,𝛼 , the exponential map exp 𝛼 0 : T 0 D 𝑛,𝛼 → D 𝑛,𝛼 and the logarithmic map log 𝛼 0 : D 𝑛,𝛼 → T 0 D 𝑛,𝛼 are given for v∈T 0 D 𝑛,𝛼 \{0} and y ∈ D 𝑛,𝛼 \{0}:</p><p>The Poincaré ball model and the hyperboloid model are isomorphic, and the diffeomorphism maps one space onto the other as shown in following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><p>and M be a 𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix, Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication is shown as following:</p><p>Let x 𝑛,𝛼 ∈ D 𝑛,𝛽 , Möbius matrix-vector multiplication has the formulation as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>:</p><p>For 𝑝 H 𝑛,𝛽 →D 𝑛,𝛼 (x 𝑛,𝛽 ) = x 𝑛,𝛼 and a shared 𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix M, we aim to prove 𝑝 H 𝑛,𝛽 →D 𝑛,𝛼 (y 𝑛,𝛽 ) = y 𝑛,𝛼 .</p><p>For x 𝑛,𝛽 = (𝑥 (𝛽)</p><p>𝑛 ), and the logarithmic map of x at 0 𝑛,𝛽 = ( √︁ 𝛽, 0, • • • , 0) ∈ H 𝑛,𝛽 , i.e., is shown as following:</p><p>The Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication is given as following:</p><p>Then we map y 𝑚,𝛽 to the Poincaré ball via Eq.

The maps between the two models in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) ensure they have a same curvature, i.e., −𝛼 = −1/𝛽, 𝛼 = 1/𝛽. Therefore, combining Eq. (32) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula">34</ref>), we have:</p><p>Therefore, Lorentzian matrix-vector multiplication is equivalence to Möbius matrix-vector multiplication. □</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2 Proof of Theorem 3.2</head><p>Proof. Combining Eq. ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), we have following equality:</p><p>where 𝜇 &gt; 0 is a scaling factor to satisfy 𝜇 𝑗 ∈𝑁 (𝑖)∪{𝑖 } 𝑤 𝑖 𝑗 h 𝑑,𝛽 𝑗 ∈ H 𝑛,𝛽 . Also, we can infer from Eq.

Here we prove the theorem in the case of leveraging Leak-lyRelu activation function, as an example. Let</p><p>, 𝜎 (•) be the LeaklyRelu activation function, and Lorentzian non-linear activation is given as following:</p><p>where 𝜎 (𝑣 𝑖 ) = max(𝑘𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑖 ) for 𝑘 ∈ (0, 1). Let x 𝑛,𝛼 ∈ D 𝑛,𝛽 , Möbius non-linear activation has the formulation as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>:</p><p>For 𝑝 H 𝑛,𝛽 →D 𝑛,𝛼 (x 𝑛,𝛽 ) = x 𝑛,𝛼 and the LeaklyRelu activation function 𝜎 (•), we aim to prove 𝑝 H 𝑛,𝛽 →D 𝑛,𝛼 (y 𝑛,𝛽 ) = y 𝑛,𝛼 . For Möbius non-linear activation, we first map the features x 𝑛,𝛼 ∈ D 𝑛,𝛼 into the tangent space T 0 D 𝑛,𝛼 via logarithmic map</p><p>we have log 𝛼 0 (x 𝑛,𝛼 ) = 𝑙x 𝑛,𝛼 . Also, note that the LeaklyRelu activation function satisfies: 𝜎 (log 𝛼 0 (x 𝑛,𝛼 )) = 𝑙𝜎 (x 𝑛,𝛼 ). Möbius pointwise non-linear activation in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">40</ref>) is equivalent to:</p><p>Moreover, for Lorentzian pointwise non-linear activation, similar to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>), we also map the feature x 𝑛,𝛽 = (𝑥</p><p>𝑛 ) to the tangent space T 0 D 𝑛,𝛽 via log</p><p>where x(𝛽) = (𝑥 (𝛽)</p><p>𝑛 ), and 𝑞 =</p><p>Thus, the results of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">39</ref>) for LeaklyRelu is given as: σ ⊗ 𝛽 log 𝛽 0 (x 𝑛,𝛽 ) = 𝑞 0, 𝜎 ( x(𝛽) ) = m. Also the Lorentzian norm of m also satisfies as: ∥m∥ L = ∥𝑞𝜎 ( x)∥ = 𝑞∥𝜎 ( x)∥. The Lorentzian non-linear activation is given as:</p><p>Furthermore, according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">33</ref>), we project the 𝜎 ⊗ 𝛽 (x 𝑛,𝛽 ) = y 𝑛,𝛽 into the Poincaré ball model as following: 𝑝 H 𝑛,𝛽 →D 𝑛,𝛼 (y 𝑛,𝛽 ) =</p><p>∥𝜎 (x 𝑛,𝛼 ) ∥ = y 𝑛,𝛼 . Therefore, Lorentzian pointwise non-linear activation is equivalence to Möbius pointwise non-linear activation. □</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS C.1 𝛿-hyperbolicity</head><p>Here we introduce the hyperbolicity measurements originally proposed by Gromov <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Considering a quadruple of distinct nodes 𝑣 1 , 𝑣  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, is a worst case measurement, which focuses on a local quadruple nodes, and does not reflect the hyperbolicity of the whole graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Moreover, both time complexity of 𝛿 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 and 𝛿 𝑎𝑣𝑔 are 𝑂 (|𝑉 | 4 ). Since 𝛿 𝑎𝑣𝑔 is robust to adding/removing an edge from the graph, it can be approximated via sampling, while 𝛿 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 cannot. Therefore we leverage 𝛿 𝑎𝑣𝑔 as the measurement.</p></div>			</div>
