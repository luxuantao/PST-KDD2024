<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this work, we present PRISM (Power-efficient, Robust, hIgh-compression, Syndrome-based Multimedia coding), a video coding paradigm based on the principles of coding with side information (which, unlike the classical Wyner-Ziv coding scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, is characterized by an ambiguous state of nature characterizing the side-information [2]). PRISM's architectural goals are to inherit the low encoding complexity and robustness of motion-JPEG style intra-frame video codecs while approaching the high compression efficiency of full-motion interframe video codecs. The PRISM paradigm roughly swaps the encoder-decoder complexity with respect to conventional video coding architectures through the novel concept of moving the motion compensation task from the encoder to the decoder. These traits make PRISM wellmatched to uplink-rich media applications involving wireless video and security cameras, multimedia-equipped phones and PDA's etc.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Today's video codec architectures have been driven predominantly by the downlink transmission model of TV broadcast. This has led to the paradigm of a computationally heavy encoder (dominated by the motion compensated prediction task) and a relatively light decoder. With the emergence of media-rich "uplink" wireless video transmission applications, there is need for a rehaul of these downlinkfriendly video architectures. The new architecture calls for: (i) low-power and complexity at the mobile/sensor video encoding unit; (ii) high compression efficiency due to both bandwidth and transmission power constraints; and (iii) robustness to packet/frame drops caused by wireless channel impairments.</p><p>Current video codecs fail to deliver on all these demands simultaneously. Predictive or inter-frame video codecs achieve high compression efficiency but are computationally heavy This work was sponsored in part by NSF Grants CCR-0096070(CAREER) and CCR-0219722, and by industrial gift awards from Intel Corporation and Philips Research.</p><p>at the encoder (due to the motion compensation task). They are also very fragile to channel loss (due to the predictive coding framework). Intra-frame codecs on the other hand are less complex and more robust but attain very poor compression efficiency. This raises the question of whether it is possible to architect a new coding paradigm that can attain all these goals, possibly at at the expense of shifting the computational burden from the encoder to the decoder.</p><p>Motivated by this, in this work, we present PRISM (Powerefficient, Robust, hIgh-compression Syndrome based Multimedia coding) that was first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Unlike other side-information based video codecs in the recent literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5]</ref> that are based on the classical Wyner-Ziv framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, PRISM is based on a modified side-information paradigm where there is inherent uncertainty in the state of nature characterizing the side information (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> for details). This allows for the expensive motion compensation task to be shifted from the encoder to the decoder.</p><p>A typical network configuration involving the PRISM codec consists of a low-complexity PRISM encoder at the transmit node and a conventional low-complexity decoder at the receive node that are interfaced through a base station that has a "trans-coding proxy" that efficiently converts the PRISM bit-stream into a standard bit-stream (e.g., MPEG/H.26L). Under this architecture, the entire computational burden can be absorbed into the network device shielding both transmit and receive mobile units. In this paper, in addition to describing the PRISM framework, we will present a specific implementation aimed at keeping it close to current commercial standards that are based on block DCT and block motion compensation. The scope extends to beyond this narrow instantiation however.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BASIC CONCEPTS</head><p>We first examine an instructive example that was first presented in <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). 0-7803-7750-8/03/$17.00 ©2003 IEEE.</p><p>ICIP 2003</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Example for Coding with Side Information</head><p>Let X and Y be correlated length 3-bit binary data that can equally likely take each of the 8 possible binary 3-tuples individually. However, the Hamming distance between X and Y is at most 1. The goal is to efficiently encode X in the two scenarios shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> so that it can be perfectly reconstructed at the decoder. Here too, X can be encoded using 2 bits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scenario 1:</head><p>In the first scenario (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a)), Y is present both at the encoder and at the decoder. Similar to the predictive coding mode in standard video coding, here X can be predicted from Y . The residue (X ⊕ Y ) of X with respect to Y takes 4 distinct values and hence can be encoded with 2 bits.</p><p>Scenario 2: Here, unlike the first scenario (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1  (b)</ref>) the encoder for X does not have access to Y . However, it does know the correlation structure between them and also knows that the decoder has access to Y . Surprisingly even in this seemingly worse scenario X can be encoded with 2 bits! This can be done using the following approach. The space of codewords of X is partitioned into 4 sets each containing 2 codewords, namely, Coset1 ([0 0 0] and [1 1 1]), Coset2 ([0 0 1] and [1 1 0]), Coset3 ([0 1 0] and [1 0 1]) and Coset4 ([1 0 0] and [0 1 1]). The encoder for X identifies the set containing the codeword for X and sends the index for the set using 2 bits. The decoder, in turn, on the reception of the coset index, uses Y to disambiguate the correct X from the set by declaring the codeword that is closest to to Y as the answer. Note that the distance between X and Y is at most 1, and the distance between the 2 codewords in any set is 3. Hence, decoding can be done perfectly. This mode of encoding where the decoder has access to correlated side information is known as coding with side information <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1:</head><p>The mapping from the source codeword space to the space of coset indices can be done in a computationally efficient way through the framework of coset codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> resulting in low encoding complexity. 2: Coset1 is a repetition channel code <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> of distance 3 and the other sets are cosets <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> of this code in the codeword space of X. We have used a channel code that is "matched" to the correlation distance (equivalently, noise) between X and Y to partition the source codeword space of X resulting in high compression performance. 3: This partitioning of X is also universal. The same partitioning of X works for all Y regardless of the value of Y as long as both X and Y satisfy the correlation structure. e.g., if X is [0 1 0], then the same encoding for X (index of Coset 3) will be applicable to all cases of Y i.e., [0 1 0], [1 1 0], [0 0 0] and [0 1 1] thus providing robustness w.r.t the value of Y .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The PRISM approach</head><p>We consider the video coding problem now. Let X denote the current macro-block to be encoded (e.g., X is a vector of size 256 if macroblocks of size 16 × 16 are chosen) . Let Y denote the best (motion-compensated) predictor for X in the previous frame and let Y = X + N (We model X, N as independent Laplacian random vectors.). We first encode X in the intra-coding mode to come up with the quantized codeword for X. Now, using the insight from the above example, we find a channel code that is matched to the "correlation noise" N, and use that to partition the quantized codeword space of X. We can thus expect to approach the compression performance of predictive coding incurring only the complexity of intra-coding at the encoder.</p><p>Note that, unlike the example presented above, in the video case we are dealing with real-valued sources with complex and imprecisely known correlation noise structures. Thus, there is, in general, a non-zero probability of decoding error in our case. This can be addressed by a combination of detection and concealment strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PRISM: IMPLEMENTATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Encoding</head><p>In this section, we briefly describe a block-based implementation of the PRISM approach the details of which can be obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. The video frame to be encoded is first divided into non-overlapping spatial blocks (we choose blocks of size 16 × 16 or 8 × 8.) and encoded ad follows: 1. Classification: Real video sources exhibit spatio-temporal correlation noise structures whose statistics are highly spatially varying. Within the same frame, different blocks exhibit different degrees of correlation with their temporal predictors. This step aims at classifying the correlation noise structure (based on offline mixture modeling) of the current video block being encoded so as to facilitate the use of the appropriate channel code. Each block is then transformed using the two-dimensional DCT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Scalar Quantization:</head><p>The DCT coefficients are quantized with a step size proportional to standard deviation of N. If a very fine step size is chosen to encode X, then there</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X N Y Fig. 2.</formula><p>The top line shows the quantized codewords for X.

Since the magnitude of N is large the decoder decodes the circled codeword and makes a decoding error.</p><p>can be decoding errors, since the codewords will be too "close" so that the side information Y cannot disambiguate them correctly 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Syndrome Encoding:</head><p>Now the space of quantized codewords which has been appropriately generated using the statistics of N can be partitioned using a Euclidean space trellis channel code <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> analogous to the repetition channel code used to partition the source codeword space in the example in Section 2.1. In our particular implementation, we use a memory-7 rate-1/2 trellis code from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Refinement Quantization:</head><p>A target reconstruction quality corresponds to a particular quantization step size. When the coefficients that are syndrome encoded are quantized, the choice of the base quantization step size is limited by N. This is done so as to minimize the probability of decoding error. To attain the target quantization step size, the coefficients need to be re-quantized further. This is accomplished in the refinement quantization stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):</head><p>We note that at the encoder, side information encoding is done in principle with respect to the statistics of the motion compensated prediction error between the block X that is to be encoded and the "best" predictor Y for this block in the frame memory. At the decoder, all that is available is the frame memory. Thus the encoder needs to transmit a CRC check (of sufficient strength) of the quantized sequence. In contrast to the conventional paradigm, it is the decoder's task to do motion search here, as it searches over the space of candidate predictors one-by-one to decode a sequence from the set labeled by the syndrome. When the decoded sequence matches the CRC check, decoding is declared to be successful.</p><p>The bit-stream associated with a block is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>1 This is illustrated through the example in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Here the top line shows the quantized codeword set for X, and the two bottom lines show the partition of the space of quantized codewords. The rectangular box shows the observed codeword which lies in the first partition. Since the magnitude of N is more than the quantization step size, the decoder uses the side information Y to decode the incorrect (circled) codeword.</p><p>Pure Source Coded bits Refinement bits CRC bits bits Syndrome Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Decoding</head><p>1. Motion Estimation and Syndrome Decoding: As described above, it is the decoder's task to do motion estimation in this framework. All the sequences that are labeled by the received syndrome can be represented on a trellis. The Viterbi algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> can be used on the 128-state rate-1/2 trellis to identify the correct sequence from the from the set of candidate sequences that is "nearest" to the candidate predictor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Estimation and Reconstruction:</head><p>Once the quantized codeword sequence is recovered, it is used along with the predictor to obtain the best reconstruction of the source. Any of the sophisticated signal processing algorithms (e.g., spatio-temporal interpolation) or post processing mechanisms can be deployed in this framework and these can only serve to improve the overall performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we present some preliminary simulation results that illustrate the various features of PRISM. The current implementation of our coder operates well in the high quality (PSNR of the order of 30 dB) regime. The extension to lower bit rates is a bit more involved, and is a part of the ongoing work.</p><p>We present compression results obtained for the first 15 frames of the Mother and Daughter (352x288), Carphone (176x144) and the Football (352x240) video during our experiments. The reference system is an implementation of the H.263+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> video coder. The first frame in all cases is encoded in the intra mode and the remaining frames are encoded in the non-intra mode. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> summarizes the rate-PSNR 2 performance of PRISM in comparison with the H.263+ coder for the three chosen sequences. From a pure objective compression point of view, we note that the performance of the current implementation of PRISM lies between the inter and intra coding modes of H.263+. Surprisingly, we discovered that the subjective performance of 2 As was mentioned in Section 2.2 in general there is a probability of decoding error associated with the coding with side information paradigm. In the above simulations, we targeted a block error rate of about 0.5%. This results in isolated block errors that virtually go unnoticed by the subjective eye with simple concealment approaches. The PSNR calculations for PRISM plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> take into account the PSNR associated with the blocks that are decoded correctly. We also conducted preliminary tests on the robustness of the proposed PRISM framework. For both PRISM and the reference system, we introduced a frame loss by removing the second frame in the video sequence from the frame memory. This while the third frame is encoded off the second frame, it is decoded off the first frame. This leads to drift which accumulates and propagates in the H.263+ case. In contrast, the decoded quality is only moderately affected in PRISM and drift does not occur. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref> (a) and (b) compares the decoded visual quality for the Football sequence using PRISM and H.263+ respectively. There is practically no drop in quality for PRISM while in the case of H.263+ the drop in quality is very significant leading to glaring visual artifacts (see the player with jersey number 57). These experiments clearly illustrate the inherent robustness of PRISM. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
