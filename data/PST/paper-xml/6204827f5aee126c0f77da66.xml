<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite the increasing availability of empirical data, capturing the topology and behavior of complex system, we continue to lack a versatile computational toolbox for unveiling a system's self-and interaction dynamics due to the challenges raised by the vast search space of potential functions, uncertainties in observed topologies and nodes activities, and detrimental effects of system collectivity. To address this we develop a two-phase approach for autonomous inference of a system's hidden dynamics, by first extracting the relevant family of dynamic functions via global regression and then performing local fine-tuning in the reduced model space to obtain the precise reconstruction. Focusing on a general framework for complex network dynamics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in inferring neuronal, genetic, social, and coupled oscillators dynamics upon both synthetic and various real topologies. Importantly, the approach exhibits remarkable robustness against incompleteness and noises which are unavoidable in empirical data, including low resolution, observational and dynamical noises, missing and spurious links, and even dynamical heterogeneity. We apply the two-phase approach to inferring the early spreading dynamics of H1N1 upon the worldwide airline network, and find that the inferred dynamical equation also captures the spread of other infectious diseases such as SARS and COVID-19. These findings together offer an avenue to discover the hidden microscopic mechanisms of a broad array of real networked systems.</p></div>

The collected observations, often in the form of time-series data, allow us to extract the relevant time-scales and dynamic patterns of the system's individual components. To gain meaningful insights on the system, however, such a reductionist approach, tracking all individual components, is insufficient. Indeed, complex system behavior emerges not just from the single units, but rather from the dynamic exchanges characterizing their interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> . This requires us to infer complex network dynamics, i.e. to retrieve both selfand interaction dynamics from the accumulating data of network topologies and nodal activities.</p><p>The balance of self vs. interaction dynamics is most naturally captured by a general equation that tracks the activities of all nodes via <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> dx i (t) dt = F x i (t) + n j=1</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A ij G x i (t), x j (t) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x i (t) ? (x i,1 (t), . . . , x i,d (t)) is node i's d-dimensional activity, representing, e.g. the membrane potential of a neuron in a brain network <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , the proportion of infected people in a country or region <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or the state of a component in an oscillator network <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . These activities are driven by the self-regulation function F(x i ) ? (F 1 (x i ), . . . , F d (x i )) , designed to describe the dynamics of all nodes in isolation, and by the pairwise function G(x i (t), x j (t)) ? (G 1 (x i , x j ), . . . , G d (x i , x j )) which captures the dynamic mechanisms of interaction between the nodes. Finally, the network A ij , an n ? n adjacency matrix, denotes the influence or flow from node j to i, where n is the number of nodes in the system. Barzel  and Barab?si showed that, with appropriate choices of the nonlinear functions F and G, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is able to describe a broad range of complex systems and, importantly, exhibits general dynamical scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . However, for most real systems, the functions F and G are unknown. Hence, a pressing lacuna in the study of complex systems is a versatile computational toolbox for automatically inferring Eq. (1) from the observed data of network topology A ij and node activities x i (t). Such a toolbox will allow us to peek into the hidden mechanisms of a broad array of relevant systems.</p><p>Complex biological, social or technological systems lack the fundamental physical rules that govern particle systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , so we often do not have a priori knowledge of their internal microscopic mechanisms. Therefore, the goal is not to only identify the model's parameters but rather to retrieve the structure of F and G and infer the explicit model itself. Despite the recent significant progress in developing methods to infer the governing equations of single-or few-body dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> , such as springs, pendulum <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , planetary motions of the solar system <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , and chaotic oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , the task of inferringnetwork dynamics poses particular challenges: F and G are usually of different types hence one cannot obtain their compact forms if assuming that they can be decomposable into orthogonal basis functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> ; Not only the data of nodal activities are noisy but the mapped network topologies are also incomplete, e.g. including missing and spurious links <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> ; Collective behavior, e.g. synchronization or consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , emerges due to the couplings between nodes, which can conceal the specific forms of microscopic mechanisms underlying network dynamics.</p><p>To overcome the challenges largely raised by complex networks we propose here a two-phase inference approach. First, we use a global crude-regression to obtain a rough reconstruction of the dynamics, which narrows down the search space of dynamic functions into a limited set of relevant functions that compose F and G. With this reduced space at hand we proceed to locally fine-tune the specific coefficients preceding each relevant function, obtaining the precise and compact form of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) which is most consistent with the observations. Our analysis indicates that the two-phase methodology allows us to achieve efficient and, most importantly, highly accurate inference, even in the face of unfavorable scenarios, such as noisy or low-resolution data or an only partially mapped topology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1a</ref>). Such confounding factors are practically unavoidable in empirical observations, and therefore our method's performance against these confounders offers a crucial advantage in our pursuit of data-driven models to capture complex network dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-phase inference approach</head><p>Lacking a priori knowledge of the structure of F and G, a natural approach is to pre-construct two extensive libraries L F and L G that contain a variety of elementary functions. The combinations of these elementary functions can potentially generate the true network dynamics. In contrast to previous studies of inferring single-or few-body dynamics where the library contains only orthogonal basis functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , the elementary functions here include polynomials, trigonometric, exponential, fractional, rescaling, sigmoid and other activation functions frequently used in various domains (see SI Tables <ref type="table">S1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>). This setting is helpful for finding a compact and optimal model to capture system behaviors, but also makes the inference problem more difficult because, due to the lack of orthogonality, the elementary functions in L F or L G can be similar with each other and thus less discriminative. Besides, an inferred dynamical models composed of only orthogonal basis functions might lack generative power.</p><p>Introducing the time series data x i (t), where i = 1, 2, . . . , n, into L F and L G , we obtain two time-varying matrices ? F (t) ? L F (x i (t)) and ? G (t) ? L G (x i (t), x j (t)) that encode the patterns of node activities imposed by the elementary functions in L F and L G (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1b</ref>). Hence, the inference problem can be recast to selecting appropriate patterns in ? F (t) and ? G (t) that best match the evolution of observed system state ?(t), i.e. to inferring the sparse coefficients ? F and ? G that best solve</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">?(t) = ? F (t)? F + A ? G (t)? G ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where A ? A ? I d , ? F ? ? F ? I d , ? G ? ? G ? I d , symbol ? denotes Kronecker product and I d is the d-dimensional identity matrix. If there is only one node Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) can be solved by previous methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> ; If the topology, captured by matrix A, is a lattice or a regular network, the system is reduced to a low-dimensional space (i.e. most eigenvalues are zero or degenerate).</p><p>Here we aim to address the problem of inferring complex network dynamics in the general setting where each node state is d-dimensional and the network topology is heterogeneous. Consequently, this problem is high-dimensional and irreducible. Indeed, in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) ?(t</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">) ? R nd , ? F (t) ? R nd?m1d , ? F ? R m1d , A ? R nd?nd , ? G (t) ? R nd?m2d</formula><p>, and ? F ? R m2d , where m 1 and m 2 are the numbers of functional elements in L F and L G respectively. In the present paper m 1 + m 2 ? 25, 80 and 140 for one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems respectively for in simulation validations (see SI Tables <ref type="table">S1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>). Such high dimensionality often induces over-fitting and leads to a model without generative power, let alone the uncertainties in the data of network topology and node activities. To solve this challenging problem we suggest a two-phase strategy and also show that our approach is efficient in the sense that each sub-step is essential (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref>(k,l)).</p><p>Phase I: Global regression. The purpose of this phase is to assess the relevance of each elementary function in L F and L G to the true, yet unknown, network dynamics. Given the observations of x i (t) for all i at time t we approximate the derivatives ?(t) (see SI Sec. I-A) and calculate the matrices ? F (t) and ? G (t). These values are highly skewed and can span several orders of magnitude (SI Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">S3</ref>) due to the skewness of node degrees and the nonlinearity of system dynamics, which could induce overestimation of the importance for inherently low-value constituents. To eliminate this severe effect it is crucial to normalize each column in ?(t), ? F (t) and ? G (t). Then, the inference problem described by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) is further recast to an optimization formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">argmin ? F ,? G T 0 ? F (t)? F + A ? G (t)? G -?(t) 2 dt + ?( ? F + ? G ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ? &gt; 0 is a hyper-parameter that regulates the sparsity of coefficient vectors ? F and ? G . We employ the regression analysis method of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (i.e. lasso) to solve (3) and perform 5-fold validation to obtain the most appropriate value of ? (see SI Sec. I-C Algorithm 1). The resultant ? F and ? G capture the relevance of each elementary function in L F and L G , enabling the identification of leading elementary functions that are most probably constituents of the true F and G (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1c</ref>). Consequently, Phase I is able to significantly narrow down the model space. However, the dynamical equation inferred by such regression alone lacks generative power. For instance, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1d</ref>, the trajectory generated by an inferred dynamical equation of Phase I deviates from that of the true network dynamics.</p><p>Phase II: Local fine-tuning. In order to reconstruct generative and concise expressions for F and G we next perform fine-tunning in the reduced model space (see SI Sec. I-C Algorithm 2). In contrast to Phase I we now use the original values of ?(t), ? F (t) and ? G (t), i.e. without normalization, to further identify the necessary elementary functions and learn their precise coefficients. Since spurious or missing links in the observed network topology have an adverse effect on the learning, we randomly sample a subset of nodes and their partial neighbors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1e</ref>, also see SI Sec. I-C). Such samplings imitate the feature of observed, usually incomplete, topologies. Another issue is determining the minimal number of elementary functions required for reconstructing F and G. To do so, we sequentially remove the elementary functions with smallest inferred coefficients and calculate, using a weighted version of Akaike's information criterion (wAIC, see SI Sec. I-B), the information inconsistency between the observed nodes' activities and the remaining set of elementary functions. This process stops when removing a certain elementary function consistently increases the value of wAIC. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1e</ref>, each curve in a plot at the left column represents the information inconsistency vs. model complexity for one topological sample. And we find that, indeed, the joint operation with wAIC and topological sampling are helpful for inference from noisy and incomplete data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref>(k,l)).</p><p>The final sets of elementary functions and their coefficients ?F and ?G compose the forms F and ?, leading to the successful inference of network dynamics described by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). Indeed, as demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1f</ref>, the trajectory generated by the inferred dynamical equation agrees well with the numerical simulations of the true network dynamics. It is worth noting that the ground truth, i.e. the form of the true equation, keeps unknown during the whole procedure and is only used to assess the accuracy of the final inferred results, hence our approach works in an autonomous unsupervised way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inferring complex network dynamics</head><p>To validate the effectiveness of our approach we apply it to infer five network dynamics, including Hindmarsh-Rose 37 (HR, d = 3) and FitzHugh-Nagumo 37 (FHN, d = 2) neuronal systems, social balance dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> (SB, d = 1), Kuramoto dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> (d = 1), and coupled heterogeneous R?ssler oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> (d = 3). These networked dynamical models are widely used in different domains, exhibiting diverse properties such as different dimensions, oscillations or chaoticity, dynamical homogeneity or heterogeneity, evolution of the states on nodes as well as on edges. To obtain the nodes' activities data we respectively simulate these dynamics with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical method on a variety of toplogies, including Erd?s-R?nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) synthetic networks, and five empirical networks -cellular-level brain networks of C. elegans and Drosophila (mushroom-body region), Advogato social network, power grids of North-Europe and United States. These topologies are accounted also for the diversity of our tests, such as random or skewed nodes' degrees, different network sizes and average degrees, directed or undirected links. The details of these dynamics and the properties of the networks are described in SI Secs. II and III. Hence, the time series of node activities and each network topology are the observation data to be inputted into our approach. The five specific equations governing these dynamics are the ground truths that we aim to infer.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> demonstrates the procedure of inferring FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal network dynamics. Through the global regression Phase I identifies ten most relevant elementary functions for each dimension of FHN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b</ref>), and then by local fine-tuning Phase II autonomously learns the compact and optimal structure of the dynamical equation as well as the most appropriate coefficient for each of the necessary elementary functions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2c</ref>). The structure of the inferred equation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2c</ref> perfectly matches the ground truth in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a</ref> and the learnt coefficients are also highly accurate. Indeed, the relative errors ? = (? -?)/?, where ? and ? are true and learnt coefficients respectively, are all lower than 3% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2d</ref>). The dynamical equation inferred by our approach exhibits generative power, being able to generate nodes' activities and trajectories that agree well with observation data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>(e,f)).</p><p>We find that our approach also successfully infers the structure of the equations governing other four network dynamics. Regarding the accuracy of learnt coefficients, the relative errors |?| &lt; 3% for the Hindmarsh-Rose dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) and the edge dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>) on both synthetic and empirical networks. In Kuramoto dynamics and coupled heterogeneous R?ssler oscillators the self-dynamics are nonidentical, i.e. each node has its own form of self dynamics (see SI Sec. III). Hence we aim to infer an effective form of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) that minimizes the inconsistency between inferred and true nodes' activities.</p><p>Even for these more challenging cases, the two-phase approach still succeeds in the autonomous learning of network dynamics with relative coefficient errors |?| &lt; 5% or &lt; 20% (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(e,g)). Both activities and trajectories generated by the effective equations exhibit high agreement with the true averaging dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(f,h,i)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inferrability of network dynamics</head><p>Synchronized dynamics. A complex system of many nodes can exhibit collective behaviors due to the coupling between these nodes, making the inference of network dynamics more challenging than that of single-or few-body dynamics. Indeed, if a network is completely synchronized, i.e. all of its nodes behave in the same manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , it is impossible to distinguish the activities of a node and its neighbors. Hence, the microscopic interacting mechanism G(x i , x j ) between nodes will be cloaked and undiscoverable. In other words, more synchronized is a network, more difficult to infer its dynamics. To validate the capability of our two-phase approach in inferring partially synchronized network dynamics, we tune the coupling strength between nodes to change the degree of network synchronization (i.e. the order parameter R , see SI Sec. IV). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4a</ref>, although the inference inaccuracy increases when nodes' activities become more synchronized, it is remarkable that our approach still successfully infers the true FHN equation even when the network is highly synchronized ( R ? 0.7). Here the inference inaccuracy is quantified by symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , i.e. sMAPE =</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1 m m i=1 |Ii-Ri| (|Ii|+|Ri|)</formula><p>, where m is the cardinal number of the set that contains both inferred and true elementary functions, I i and R i are inferred and true coefficients respectively. The sMAPE ranges as [0,1] and quantifies the accuracy of the inferred dynamical equation (not just the goodness-of-fit to observed nodal activities). Specifically, the more accurate the inference result, the closer the sMAPE value to zero. Dynamical heterogeneity. Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) assumes that nodes have the same form F of self-dynamics, yet this is not always true. For instance, although the self-dynamics of Kuramoto model is simply one elementary function ? representing the natural frequency of a node, different nodes can have different values of ? (i.e. ? i = ? j ). For such nonidentical dynamics it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to infer a specific form F i (x i ) for each node i due to an n-fold increase in the dimensionality of potential model space. Therefore we aim to infer an effective dynamical equation that best captures the averaging dynamics. Fig. <ref type="figure">3(e,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>) has shown that the two-phase approach is able to successfully infer the structure of dynamical equations for Kuramoto model and coupled nonidentical R?ssler oscillators with low errors of coefficients. Here we further explore to what extent of the dynamical heterogeneity our approach can tolerate. To do so we assign each node a value of ? randomly generated from a normal distribution N (0, ?) and increase the standard deviation ?. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4b</ref>, the inference inaccuracy indeed increases when the heterogeneity of self-dynamics becomes higher, and the two-phase approach can tolerate heterogeneity ? ? 0.5.</p><p>Deficient libraries. Although we built two rather comprehensive libraries of elementary functions, it is still possible that some elementary functions of the true unknown dynamics are missing. Another possibility is that the compact form of true dynamics cannot be composed by these elementary functions. For these cases, our two-phase approach will infer an alternative dynamical equation which is still able to capture the observed behaviors of the system. To validate such capability we apply the two-phase approach to infer gene regulation (GR) and Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal (HR) dynamics on scale-free networks. When the true coupling functions are intentionally removed from L G the approach learns an alternative equation for each dynamics. The original and the inferred equations are described in SI Sec. IV-B). The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4c</ref> show that the trajectories generated by the inferred and the true equations are close to each other, and the discrepancy is small for all nodes (see also SI Sec. IV-B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inferring from incomplete and noisy data</head><p>Our approach autonomously infers the hidden microscopic mechanisms of complex network dynamics from the data of topologies and nodes' activities.

Thus it is crucial for an inference approach to be robust against these uncertainties.

To validate our approach's robustness against low resolution we numerically simulate the five typical nonlinear network dynamics in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref> with step-size 0.01, and then down-sample the nodes' activities data, i.e. regularly sample a proportion of data points in the time series of each node's activity. We calculate the failure ratios in inferring the structure of true dynamical equations (SI Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S14a</ref>) and also the inference inaccuracies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5a</ref>) out of 100 independent runs. The results show that the two-phase strategy requires only a proportion of 5% to 50% data for inferring these network dynamics.</p><p>Observational and dynamical noises. Observational noises are induced by the measuring process and dynamical noises represent the intrinsic stochasticity in dynamics. To produce the former we add Gaussian noises to nodes' activity data and quantify the intensity of observational noise with signal-tonoise-ratio (SNR) (see SI Sec. V-A); To imitate the latter we add a stochastic term of Gaussian white noise with intensity ? into the true dynamical equations and generate the nodes' activities data by numerical simulations of these stochastic differential equations (see also SI. Sec. V-A). We test the effect of these two types of noises on the performance of the two-phase approach. It is worth noting that we do not use any denoising preprocess in the procedure. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5b</ref> and SI Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S14b</ref> show that the approach can tolerate dynamical noise with ? ? 0.15, meaning that it successfully reconstructs the hidden equations when the stochastic intensity is not higher than 15% of the average amplitude of true deterministic dynamics. Moreover, as exhibited in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5c</ref> and SI Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S14c</ref> the approach can tolerate 30-dB observational noise, a remarkable robustness that has not been achieved even in inferring only single-or few-body dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</p><p>Spurious and missing links. Spurious and missing links in empirical data induce an incomplete network topology A ij , which further leads to an inaccurate interaction matrix ? G . To test the impact of these erroneous links we randomly add or remove a fraction of links from the true network topology that was used to simulate the nodes' activities. Owing to the topological sampling in Phase II, our approach is robust against such incompleteness. Indeed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5(d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S14(d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>) the approach is able to tolerate 25% spurious and 30% missing links.</p><p>Comparison with previous methods. Two most illuminating and effective methods for dynamics inference are SINDy proposed by Brunton et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and ARNI proposed by Casadiego et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . SINDy has been applied to various nonlinear systems (mostly few-body though), and ARNI originally aimed at inferring network topology but can be transferred to infer network dynamics by minor modification (see SI Sec.V-C). Here we compare our approach with SINDy and ARNI from different aspects, including the amount of required data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5f</ref>), the robustness against observational noise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5g</ref>), correlated dynamical noise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5h</ref> and also SI Sec. V-A), missing links (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5i</ref>), and different network sizes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5j</ref>). While ARNI needs fewer data points if network topology data are complete and nodal activities data do not have any noises (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5f</ref>), the two-phase approach outperforms both SINDy and ARNI in inferring complex network dynamics from incomplete and noisy data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5g-j</ref>). We also perform comparisons with SINDy's variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> regarding partially synchronized or heterogeneous dynamics (see SI Figs. S13 and  S17). These results together indicate that our approach can better handle networked high-dimensional systems and better cope with incompleteness and uncertainties in data.</p><p>Ablation studies. Besides the two-phase strategy, our approach also involves three important compo-nents, namely, normalization in the first phase yet non-normalization in the second for solving the issue raised by highly skewed observations at different nodes, topological sampling for imitating the feature of observed incomplete topologies, and optimal selection by wAIC for determining the most appropriate complexity of inferred dynamics. The essentiality of the two-phase strategy and the three components is demonstrated by ablation studies. Specifically, we ablate each phase or component and assess the performance of degenerated approaches. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5(k,</ref><ref type="figure">l</ref>) and SI Sec. V-B, indeed, the inference inaccuracies significantly increase if the phases or components are individually ablated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inference of empirical systems</head><p>The validations above are based on simulated activity data of several networked dynamics that have ground-truths for the quantification of inference accuracy. Next, we demonstrate the capacity of the two-phase approach on empirical data, i.e. real network topology and real nodes' activities. Specifically, we apply our approach to infer the spreading dynamics of infectious disease H1N1. The network underlying this diffusion system is the worldwide airline network, which captures the human mobility between different countries or regions and has been shown to be playing a dominant role for global disease spreading <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . We extract The network structure from OpenFlights data <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> and describe it as a weighted adjacency matrix A.

The total passengers daily are approximately ? = 8.9 ? 10 6 and, taking into account the population P i of each node i, the network matrix is modified to</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">?ij = ? n i=1 P i A ij .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The magnitude order of entries in matrix ? are around 10 -2 to 10 -3 .</p><p>The nodal activities x i (t) are extracted from the daily reports of infected cases in each country or region <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</p><p>Here we consider the nodes whose accumulated H1N1 cases are more than 100 and focus on the early spreading dynamics, i.e. in the 45 days since the first case was reported in each node, which captures the system behaviors before government control. From function libraries L F and L G where the number of terms m 1 + m 2 = 42, our approach successfully infers a concise effective dynamical equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">dx i dt = ax i + b N j=1 ?ij 1 1 + e -(xj -xi) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where a = 0.074 and b = 7.130 (see SI Sec. VI and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">S18</ref>). In contrast, with the same L F and L G , SINDy ends up to infer the coefficients of all functional terms as zero, i.e. it cannot identify the relevant terms. It is interesting that our approach infers a sigmoid (nonlinear) form, rather than the linear form of epidemic models used in previous literature, to better capture the coupling dynamics. This might be caused by the fact that people usually consciously travel less if their countries/regions or the destinations have high infection risk. While Eq. 5 describes the dynamics of all nodes with the same parameters a and b, we also extend it by taking into account of dynamical heterogeneity in the nodes, i.e. to obtain a i and b i from each node i' activity data (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6(b-e</ref>) and also SI Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">S18</ref>).</p><p>Because empirical systems lack ground-truths, we verify the effectiveness of our approach by testing the generalizability of the inferred Eq. 5. Specifically, based on the daily reported numbers in the first 45 days since the first SARS or COVID-19 case is identified for each node <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , we find that Eq. 5 is also able to capture the early spread of SARS and COVID-19 upon the worldwide airline network. Indeed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>(f-i) and SI Figs. S19-S20, the evolution of cumulative numbers of SARS cases (for nodes whose eventual infected cases are more than 100) and COVID-19 cases (for nodes whose eventual infected cases are more than 2000) agree well with the activities generated by Eq. 5 with heterogeneous parameters a i and b i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have established an approach for autonomously inferring the governing equations of complex network dynamics from the observation data of nodes' activities and network topology, enabling the discovery of hidden microscopic mechanisms of complex systems. The goal of our approach is to infer the original equation rather than to fit the nodes' activities, hence we employed six known dynamical models widely-used in biological, social and physical sciences to generate nodal activities and then performed the inference. The effectiveness of our approach was validated by the comparisons between the inferred and the original equations, as well as by the demonstration of inferring the early spreading dynamics of infectious diseases.</p><p>Complex networked systems raise particular challenges for dynamics inference, such as correlated nodes' noises, incomplete network topology, synchronized nodes' activities, and dynamical heterogeneity. Hence we performed extensive tests on eight synthetic or real network topologies and for six dynamical models whose ground-truths are known. The applicability range of our approach is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5(d,</ref><ref type="figure">e,</ref><ref type="figure">h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>). In particular, our approach works well when synchronization is not stronger than 0.7 and the fraction of missing or spurious links is not larger than 25%. In other words, if networks experience stronger synchronization or have more erroneous links our approach might fail to infer the original governing equations. Note that other factors, such as the amount of observation data and the complexity of system dynamics, may also impact the inferrability.</p><p>Although many real networks have been successfully mapped so far and the incompleteness of network topologies was taken into consideration in our work, there are still real complex systems whose network structure information are totally missing. For the later cases, a possible scheme could be inferring their topological structure, especially directed or causal networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> , from nodes' activities data first and then applying our approach to infer the system dynamics. It is worth noting that nodes' activities based network reconstruction is also challenging, especially when the number of nodes is large <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> , because the number of parameters needing to be estimated is about n 2 where n is network size. Therefore, how to simultaneously infer both structure and dynamics of complex systems is still an outstanding problem.</p><p>In the present work we have tested the robustness of our approach against observational noises and both uncorrelated and correlated dynamical noises. However, stochasticity in the dynamics of some real complex systems can be stronger than we considered here. As stochasticity plays a significant role in some system functions, such as in brains <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> and cells 56 , the highly stochastic systems are better described by stochastic differential equations. Several recent efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> provided important insights to learning or inferring dynamical models that capture the properties of stochastic systems. There is also another limitation in our present work. Our approach does not account for discrete or boolean dynamics, or systems that contain thresholding terms or exhibit irregular dynamics with instability properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</p><p>Our work also raises several questions worthy of future pursuit. First, we have shown that alternative governing equations would be inferred by our approach to capture the dynamical behaviors of a networked system if the term libraries happen to be deficient. Nevertheless, automatically generating an appropriate term library, perhaps using the symbolic regression technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , should be beneficial. Second, we considered multi-dimensional nodal activities, i.e. the activity of a node is described not by a scalar but by a vector. In real complex systems experimental access might be limited to a sub-dimension of the activity vector. Champion et al. showed that Koopman operator and time-delay embedding techniques are helpful for capturing the dynamical properties of sub-dimension observable systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> . Yet, the problem remains unsolved for complex networked systems. Finally, recent investigations showed that components in a complex system can have higher-order, beyond pairwise, couplings and such higherorder interactions may significantly impact the dynamics of networked systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . Hence, extending our framework to inferring higher-order dynamics is an important direction for future work.   x i, 1 ( t)</p><p>x i,2 (t)   c.

Previous studies on inferring singleor few-body dynamics employed orthogonal basis functions. Such orthogonality, though makes inference tasks less challenging, can induce non-compact forms of inferred equations, especially due to the fact that F and G here often have different forms for a variety of complex network dynamics in different domains. Hence, here we construct two comprehensive libraries, L F and L G , for self-and interaction dynamics respectively, including polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, fractional, rescaling, and various activation functions as listed in Table .(S1) and (S2). Such comprehensive libraries can cover significantly more scenarios in neuronal, biological, social, ecological, and technological domains. On the other hand, the setting significantly increases the space of potential dynamical models, and the lack of orthogonality also decreases the discriminability of the elementary functions in the model space. These make the inference of complex network dynamics much more challenging, let alone the impact of inaccurate data of network topologies and the influence of collective behaviors that could conceal the specificity of F and G forms.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>: Library L F for self-dynamics</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Functions ?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Evaluation metrics sMAPE</head><p>To evaluate the inaccuracy of inferred equation, we used the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) <ref type="bibr">[S3]</ref> sMAPE = 1 n</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">n i=1 |I i -R i | (|I i | + |R i |) , (<label>S9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where n is the cardinal number of the set that contains the inferred and true terms (i.e. elementary functions), I i and R i are inferred and true coefficients respectively.

It is worth noting that if an inferred term should not exist in the true equation or true term is not successfully inferred, the value of sMAPE will significantly increase. Therefore, the metric sMAPE captures not only the errors of inferred coefficients but also the incorrectness of inferred function structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Normalized Euclidean distance (NED)</head><p>To evaluate the discrepancy between the inferred and true dynamics, we used the metric of normalized Euclidean distance (NED) that represents the distance between the two trajectories generated by the inferred and the true dynamical equations respectively.

By AIC one aims to select an optimal model that best fits the observations with the fewest variables from the model candidates. However, we find that the original AIC does not work well in the inference problem we aim to solve in the present paper. Hence we use a criterion of weighted AIC (wAIC), i.e. to balance the fitting accuracy and the model complexity, where w is the inferred coefficient of a term from Phase I. This adjustment introduces the coefficients inferred by Phase I as another indicator of terms' importance. A term a larger w i inferred from Phase I is more likely to be able to capture the properties of the underlying unknown dynamics. Thus, multiplying w or 1/w with AIC amplifies the impact of removing this term from the equation. The smaller the wAIC, the more consistent is the composition of the elementary functions with observed data and less important is this removed term. To be specific, to evaluate the relevance of a term i, we remove this term from the equation inferred by Phase I and calculate the value of wAIC i of the new shortened equation, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S2</ref>. Greedily repeating this process, we obtain the wAIC for each leading term. Then we sort these terms based on their wAIC values, and remove terms one by one with wAIC values from small to large. This process will give us a shorten equation each time, in the meantime, we calculate this shorten equation's AIC values. The optimal equation is the one at the tuning point (where the curve starts consistently increasing) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1e</ref> in the main text.

For example, if a term is inherently low-valued, a regression method will probably assign a relatively large coefficient to it, which might indicate the term is more relevant. However, this is not always true since it could be caused by the fact that the scale of this term is inherently smaller than that of other terms.

Because, for most systems of interest, the underlying dynamical equation often consists of only a few terms, the reduced libraries L * F and L * G contain top ? terms with the largest absolute coefficients described by the weight vector w. To determine whether the hidden equation should contain a constant term, we compare the AIC values of the equations with and without constant. If the AIC value of the equation with constant is far smaller than that without constant, the hidden equation probably has a constant term. In the present paper we set ? = 10, i.e. obtain top ten leading elementary functions for L * F and L * G by algorithm I. Note that the hyper-parameter ? in Phase I is automatically selected by 5-fold cross validation, a widelyused trick to estimate the most appropriate value of hyper-parameter. Specifically, to choose the best ? from a set {? 1 , ? 2 , ? ? ? , ? r }, we parameterize the loss function (L(? 1 ), L(? 2 ), ? ? ? , L(? r )), and randomly divide the nodes' activities data into five sets, with one set for test and the other four sets for training. We apply each value of ? and calculate the corresponding score of lasso regression. Finally the hyperparameter with the highest regression score is selected as the optimal value of ? <ref type="bibr">[S5]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase II</head><p>Through Phase I we have obtained a reduced model space that represents the set of most relevant elementary functions. With the reduced libraries L * F , L * G at hand, next we propose Phase II to infer a concise form as well as appropriate coefficients for the hidden dynamical equation. The procedure of Phase II has two key sub-steps, i.e. topological sampling, and fine-tuning with wAIC. Topological sampling is done by following steps: First, we randomly choose S nodes from all n nodes, meanwhile we keep the information of these S nodes' partial neighbors. Based on the S nodes' self-and interaction matrices, i.e. ? F and ? G , we perform fine-tuning process to distill the elementary functions as well as their coefficients. Repeating topological sampling to acquire K sets of samples, and averaging the coefficients corresponding to elementary functions selected from K samples, we are able to obtain a general inferred equation even in incomplete topologies. In the present work we usually set S = 10 and K = 20. The pseudocode is described as follows.</p></div>

The original ARNI is a model-free inference approach for network structure reconstruction <ref type="bibr">[S36]</ref> . ARNI uses the idea of matrix pseudoinverse to connect a node to other most relevant nodes by minimizing the cost between numerical derivatives of observed time series and the sum value of basis functions, enabling the inference of network topology from nodes' activities. We would like to emphasize that although ARNI originally aimed at inferring network structure, it can also be used to infer network dynamics if network structure is given. For a fair comparison, we transfer ARNI to infer network dynamics as follows. We apply the same idea of matrix pseudoinverse and add most relevant elementary functions one by one, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">S16</ref>, until the cost is lower than a threshold. To improve ARNI's ability of coping with the possible incompleteness in observed network structure, we also perform topological samplings in ARNI. The resulting elementary functions and their coefficients are the value averaged for multiple topological samplings. The details of ARNI modification can be seen in our code. We also perform robustness comparisons between our approach and SINDy variant <ref type="bibr">[S30]</ref> against observational noises. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S17</ref>, where the task is to inferring HR dynamics from simulated activity data with 40dB observational noise. The simulation time T = 500 with step size ?t = 0.01. The network is generated with directed BA model with size n = 100 and average degree k = 5. Inference inaccuracy (sMAPE)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI Details of empirical system inference</head><p>In the main text we have demonstrated the applicability of our approach to inferring dynamical equations from empirical data. Specifically we used the global spreading data of H1N1 disease reported daily from April 24th to July 6th in year 2009. As we focused on the dynamics of early spreads before governments introduce quarantine policies, only the first 45 daily data were used for the inference. For instance, if the first case in a country was reported on May 1st, we employed the data from May 1st to June 14th. Note that, although the starting time of spread for different countries are different, in the coupling dynamics G(x i , x j ) the time t is the same date for all nodes. In other words, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref> and Figs. S18-S20 the initial time t [/day] being shifted to t = 1 for all nodes are just for the convenience of visualization. The inference approach indeed used the original dates and data. The comparisons between the inferred and the empirical activities are also displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">S18</ref> for H1N1, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S19</ref> for SARS and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S20</ref> for COVID-19.

For example, we delete interaction terms xi,1 1+e -?(x j,1 -?) and 1 1+e -?(x j,1 -?) (? = 10, ? = 1), yet to infer HR network dynamics with r = 0.004 and x 0 = -1.5. Even for such deficient libraries our approach infers alternative equations</p><p>that still capture the HR network dynamics (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref> in the main paper), as well as the alternative equation</p><p>to capture GR network dynamics (see also Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Inferrability comparison studies</head><p>In this subsection we compare our approach with SINDy <ref type="bibr">[S29]</ref> and its variant <ref type="bibr">[S30]</ref> regarding inferrability, i.e. the capacity of dealing with partially synchronized networked dynamics or dynamical heterogeneity.</p><p>The results showing in Fig. <ref type="figure">S13</ref> indicate that our method is better at coping with synchronization and dynamical heterogeneity. The network properties and dynamics settings are the same as that in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> of the main paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V Details of robustness analyses</head><p>In this work we validated the robustness of our approach against five types of unavoidable uncertainties in observation data, including observational, uncorrelated and correlated dynamical noises in data of nodes' activities, missing and spurious links in observed topologies, low resolution by experimental techniques.</p><p>To construct incomplete topologies we randomly add or delete a proportion of entries in the true adjacency matrix A ij ; To imitate the constraint of low resolution we regularly down-sample the time series of nodes' activities. In the following we describe in detail the simulations of data with observational, dynamical and correlated noise, and show the failure ratio of inferring the structure of true elementary functions out of 100 independent runs in Fig. <ref type="figure">S14</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Noisy data</head><p>There are usually two types of noises in time series data, i.e. dynamical noise and observational noise <ref type="bibr">[S31]</ref> . The latter is raised in the observation or measurement process, while the former indicates the inherent stochasticity of system dynamics. To test the robustness of our approach against these two types of    <ref type="formula">5</ref>) in the main text with identical parameters a and b for all nodes (i.e. effective), and the infected numbers generated by the form of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) yet with heterogeneous parameters ai and bi for each node i (i.e. heterogeneous). The parameter for effective dynamics are a = 0.040 and b = 105.160, and those ai and bi for heterogeneous dynamics are shown in the sub-plots respectively. Note that Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) was inferred based only on H1N1 data, hence the results in this figure show that the inferred equation is also able to capture the early spreads of COVID-19.</p></div>			</div>
