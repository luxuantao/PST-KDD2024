<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents a qualitative-reasoning method for predicting the behavior of mechanisms characterized by continuous, time-varying parameters. The structure of a mechanism is described in terms of a set of parameters and the constraints that hold among them : essentially a 'qualitative differential equation'. The qualitative-behavior description consists of a discrete set of time-points, at which the values of the parameters are described in terms of ordinal relations and directions of change. The behavioral description, or envisionment, is derived by two sets of rules: propagation rules which elaborate the description of the current time-point, and prediction rules which determine what is known about the next qualitatively distinct state of the mechanism. A detailed example shows how the envisionment method can detect a previously unsuspected landmark point at which the system is in stable equilibrium.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>People have a fundamental desire to understand how things work, and an equally fundamental desire to explain their understanding to others. In this paper, I describe a class of knowledge structures to support prediction, explanation and question answering using causal descriptions of physical systems. Within the following framework for causal reasoning (inspired by De Kleer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">7]</ref>), I address the problem of how a qualitative description of the behavior of a system is derived from a qualitative description of its structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral</head><p>Functional description description description ~This research was supported in part by NIH Grant LM 03603 from the National Library of Medicine.</p><p>The structural description consists of the individual variables that characterize the system and their interactions; it is derived from the components of the physical device and their physical connections. The behavioral description (or envisionment) describes the potential behaviors of the system as a network of the possible qualitatively distinct states of the system. I reserve the term functional description for a description that reveals the purpose of a structural component or connection in producing the behavior of a system. Thus, the function of a steam-release valve in a boiler is to prevent an explosion; the behavior of the system is simply that the pressure remains below a certain limit. The existing literature frequently obscures this distinction by using the term 'function' to refer to behavior.</p><p>The goal of this research is to develop a knowledge representation capable of describing human commonsense reasoning and explanation about physical causality. Commonsense causal reasoning is qualitative reasoning about the behavior of a mechanism which can be done without external memory or calculation aids, although it may draw on concepts learned from the advanced study of a particular domain, e.g. automobile mechanics, computer architecture, or medical physiology. In 6rder to be useful for modeling human commonsense knowledge, the computational primitives of our representation must not require excessive memory or processing resources.</p><p>Simulation of the behavior of a mechanism is useful, for example in medical diagnosis, for determining the consequences of a hypothesized primary change, for predicting the expected course of the patient's disease, and for investigating the effects of hypothetical therapies. Qualitative simulation is important because the physician typically lacks precise numerical values for many parameters characterizing the patient's state, and some parameters may be difficult or impossible to measure. In spite of this, the physician is clearly capable of making useful predictions. The knowledge representation described here was inspired by the attempt to capture the knowledge revealed by a physician explaining a case of kidney disease with an unusual presentation. A detailed analysis of the physician's behavior is presented elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, 1 propose a simple but very general descriptive language for structural descriptions, and a qualitative-simulation process for producing the behavioral description. The representation described here begins with a description of the structure of a mechanism that is similar to, but weaker than, a differential equation. The qualitative simulation produces a description of its behavior that corresponds to, but is weaker than, the continuous function that is a solution to the differential equation. Thus, the representation is intended to produce a useful qualitative description of behavior, starting with a qualitative description of structure that would be too weak to support more traditional reasoning methods (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Within the structural description, a mechanism is described as a collection of description consists of a finite set of time-points representing the qualitatively distinct states of the system, and values for each parameter at each time=point.</p><p>A value is a description of the real number corresponding to a parameter at a particular time-point. This description consists of the ordinal relations holding among the different values in the behavioral description, and the I0 value (the sign of the time derivative) of the parameter at that time. The envisionment proceeds first by propagating the implications of initial facts through the constraints to complete a description of the system's state at the current time-point, and second by predicting the characteristics of the next distinct qualitative-state description.</p><p>After reviewing related work, a simple example demonstrates the basic properties of the representation and the envisionment process. Then a more elaborate example shows how, without external information, the simulation process deduces the existence of a previously unsuspected landmark value, and shows that the mechanism moves to a stable equilibrium about that value. The envisionment process has been implemented in MACUSP, as a program called ENV <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[10]</ref>, which has run all the examples included here. The figures presenting the results of the envisionment have been laid out by hand for publication and are not in the actual output format. Appendices provide more formal specifications of the representation and the envisionment process, as well as an additional example addressing related issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Research</head><p>Answering a question about the behavior of a physical system involves two quite different operations. Problem formulation includes selecting which of several ways the physical situation should be described to allow a deeper examination. Problem solving, in the narrow sense, starts with a formal description of a well-structured problem and derives an acceptable solution. The different approaches to problem formulation taken by experts and novices have been examined by psychologists such as Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> and Larkin, McDermott, Simon, and Simon <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[22]</ref>. In particular, when solving problems in physics <ref type="bibr">Chi et al.</ref> show that experts describe the given situation in terms appropriate to the underlying physical principle (e.g. conservation of momentum) required for a solution, while novices describe the same situation in terms of the physical objects in the surface statement of the problem. Naturally, the expert is then able to proceed directly to the solution, while the novice must search a larger space of alternate solutions. The work described here is a method of solving problems previously formulated, applicable at either level of expertise.</p><p>Artificial intelligence methods for qualitative reasoning about mechanisms were first developed by Rieger and Grinberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[25]</ref>, whose knowledge representation consists of events, tendencies, states, and state changes, related by several different types of causal links. Their system produces realistic qualitative simulations of the behavior of mechanisms. However, their representation lacks a strong distinction between the structure and behavior of a mechanism, which we feel is critical to causal reasoning. More generally, their representation is ambiguous about whether its elements refer to the structure, potential behavior, or actual behavior of the mechanism being described. The CASNET program of Weiss, Kulikowski, Amarel and Safir <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[27]</ref> uses causal links to propagate confirmation scores among pathophysiological states describing the progression of glaucoma. However, the program has no knowledge of the relationship between physiological mechanisms and pathophysiological states, and so expresses causal relationships known to its authors, rather than doing causal reasoning itself. McDermott <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[24]</ref> has proposed an ambitious temporal logic for reasoning about events, actions, and plans as well as processes involving continuously varying parameters. In a sense, he has taken Rieger and Grinberg's representation based on states and events, and created a much extended representation on a better logical foundation, that is capable of addressing a larger set of issues. His logic, however, is oriented toward expressing the behavioral description as actions and events of various kinds, so the structural description is stated as conditionalized events, not as a separate type of description. Since McDermott's goal is to establish a logical framework for temporal reasoning, he demonstrates his logic by expressing many small example sentences rather than larger inference scenarios. Thus, he does not present a detailed set of rules and axioms for inferring behavior from structure. The aim of the present paper is to specify such a set of rules for causal inference, and to use only those features of a logic needed to express the rules.</p><p>The envisionment approach to reasoning about mechanisms based on the relationship between structure and behavior, rather than between actions and events, has been developed by researchers such as De Kleer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">7]</ref> and Forbus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">12]</ref>. When the qualitative description of a system's state is not strong enough to specify which of several futures it will actually follow, the envisionment becomes non-deterministic and the behavioral description contains a branch. Much of the research on envisionment processes has studied the use of external sources of information (e.g. quantitative <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[6]</ref> or teleological <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[7]</ref>) to resolve non-determinism in the envisionment.</p><p>There is little agreement on the exact role or expressive power of the functional description, which shows how the structure and components of the system contribute to its ability to perform its overall function <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">19]</ref>. The functional description of a system should make explicit not only what behaviors are possible for a system, but why. Thus, a functional description must include terms that refer implicitly to changes past the final state of the system (e.g.</p><p>stable equilibrium), or even to states that do not occur in the envisionment (e.g. the steam-release valve prevents explosions). The function of the steam-release valve, for example, must include a teleological relationship with the design process, in which the valve was added to the structure in order to prevent a certain behavior.</p><p>There is significant disagreement, as well, about the exact nature of the envisionment process. The main issue is the means for describing continuously variable parameters. De Kleer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">7]</ref> describes changing parameters according to the sign of the derivative (the IQ value, standing for incremental qualitative value), and an algebra for propagating IQ values across addition constraints.</p><p>Forbus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[11]</ref> observes that IO values alone are inadequate for more than incremental-perturbation analysis, and expands the description to include the signs and magnitudes of both the amount and the derivative of a parameter. In practice, his system uses only the ordinal relations among quantities belonging to partially ordered quantity spaces, rather than performing arithmetic operations on numerical magnitudes. Hayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">17]</ref> initially proposed the concept of a quantity space, but his efforts were directed toward developing an adequate ontology for causality involving liquids, and he did not use the quantity space in a significant way in his examples, remaining agnostic about its properties. Thus, there is a recognized need for a qualitative method for reasoning about quantities without losing the fine distinctions needed in particular applications.</p><p>Another important issue, not fully addressed by previous proposals, is the ability of the envisionment to detect previously unsuspected points at which qualitatively significant changes take place. Forbus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[11]</ref> and Hayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[16]</ref> both assume that landmark values indicating qualitatively significant changes are provided as part of the initial description of the situation. De Kleer's "roller coaster" envisionment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[6]</ref> usually makes the same assumption, although it is able to posit a change taking place within an interval if the roller coaster's behavior is different at the two ends. However, the point at which the change takes place is not then introduced into the envisionment for further qualitative reasoning. Determining where that point is, and what its properties are, is passed off to the quantitative-reasoning component. As we shall see in Section 5, the envisionment process proposed here is able to detect a previously t3. KUIPERS unsuspected point at which qualitatively significant changes occur and dctermine many of its properties, without going beyond qualitative reasoning.</p><p>A number of researchers are developing methods for deriving behavior from structure in digital electronics, for the purpose of circuit verification (Barrow <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>) or fault diagnosis (Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">5]</ref>, Genesereth <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[14]</ref>). Because of the discrete nature of the parameter values, digital electronics is a significantly different domain from physical systems characterized by continuous, analog parameters. In particular, although the simulation of the device may be symbolic <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, the precise values of the parameters can be described and used, so the simulation is not, strictly speaking, qualitative. Furthermore, current work has studied the propagation of information to establish a coherent state for the circuit at a single instant in time. These reasoning techniques do not address (yet) the evolution of the state of a circuit over time. Finally, as we shall see below, there is a relatively small set of possible constraints that may hold among parameters in an analog system, and relatively few ways that a set of changing parameters can change over time. In digital electronics, on the other hand, the constraints that can hold among parameters, and the way future states can depend on the past, are limited only by the set of available or constructible component types. Thus, many of the important issues in deriving behavior from structure will be different in the two domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Two Other Ways to Reason about Physical Systems</head><p>We can develop certain aspects of our qualitative-reasoning method by comparison with other formal reasoning methods using differential equations. Physical scientists reason about physical systems by describing the structure of a system with a differential equation, then determining its behavior by solving the equation, either analytically or by numerical simulation. The solution can then be analyzed to detect previously unsuspected landmark values of the system's parameters where its behavior changes qualitatively: zero-crossings, maximum or minimum values, and inflection points. Perturbation analysis of the system in the neighborhood of such a point can reveal the existence of (e.g.) a stable equilibrium. There are two costs to using such a reasoning method: the computational resources to perform its primitive operations, and an interpretation process to construct a meaningful description from its output.</p><p>Consider an example of a simple physical system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2</ref>) consisting of a closed container of gas (at temperature 1") receiving heat from a source (at Ts).</p><p>A commonsense description of the behavior of this system is "The temperature of the gas increases until it is equal to the temperature of the source". Our goal is a causal reasoner which can produce a description of this form from a description of the causally-relevant structure of the system.</p><p>A numerical simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[13]</ref> of this system requires a complete description, in that the value of each parameter at each point in time must be given as a // / / // / FIG. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2</ref>.

The relationship between AT and inflow must also be specified precisely, so we assume strict proportionality with a numerically specified constant. The simulation algorithm is conceptually simple, computing the values of all parameters at a time-point from their values in the previous time-point. It does, however, require arithmetic operations on real numbers, which are more than we might be willing to assume as primitive operations in the human. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> gives the structural and behavioral description of the simple heat-flow system, as appropriate for numerical simulation. The output of the numerical simulation requires substantial further interpretation to recognize and classify important events in the behavior of the system. There is no information about the nature of the dependencies between the different parameters, or how the outcome might vary for different values of the numerical parameters. The fundamental problem is that the numerical description required for this type of simulation has very few states of partial</p><p>The structural description:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">~T=T~-T AT inflow = -- 10 d --</formula></div>

The simulation process cannot run without complete knowledge, and its output can only be matched to a numerically identical system. The analytic solution of a differential equation provides a substantially different description of the system. In order to describe the causal structure of the simple heat-flow system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2</ref>) as a differential equation we must specify the relationship between inflow and AT explicitly, in this case as a strict proportionality, but with a symbolic constant k. It can then be solved analytically as is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>The language of differential equations provides very useful states of partial knowledge about the system, in that quantities may be represented symbolically instead of as real values. There is also a very rich symbolic vocabulary of relationships that may be asserted between quantities in formulating the problem or describing the solution: the arithmetic operators, the trigonometric functions, logarithm, exponentiation, and many others. While these properties make differential equations the fundamental descriptive tool of the physical sciences, they cannot be solved analytically by humans without external memory resources. In spite of this descriptive power, the analytic solution of differential equations requires global and knowledge-intensive operations such as indefinite integration.</p><p>We have seen two quite distinct treatments of continuously varying parameters in these two representations. One treats quantities as real numbers, revealing their changes in the course of incremental simulation, but requires a sophisticated interpretation to derive an understanding of the behavior of the mechanism given the simulation. The other representation treats parameters as real-valued continuous functions, and yields an easily interpretable solution, but requires a sophisticated mathematical inference method which often fails to produce a closed-form solution. Qualitative reasoning about physical systems must be able to handle states of incomplete knowledge such as weakly specified functional relationships, and non-numerical initial parameter values. As a form of human commonsense reasoning, it must also require only modest computational facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[18]</ref>, but must still be able to handle systems without closed-form solutions, and must be able to recognize unexpected points of qualitative change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Qualitative Simulation with Ordinal Quantities</head><p>The qualitative simulation, like the other formal models, begins with a structural description which consists of a set of constraints holding among timevarying, real-valued parameters. The three principal types of constraints are:</p><p>(1) Arithmetic: (X=Y+7). The values of the parameters must have the indicated relationship at each point in time.</p><p>(2) Functional: (Y = M+(X)). Y is a strictly increasing function of X (decreasing if M ).

The functional relationship, in particular, provides a weaker level of description than is possible with numerical or analytic solutions of differential equations. The relationship inflow = M;(AT) in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> states only that the relationship is strictly monotonically increasing, and that inflow = 0 corresponds to AT = 0. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> gives the qualitative structure description for the simple heat-flow system in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2</ref>.</p><p>The problem we observed in the last section with numerical simulation and analytic solutions of differential equations lies in the restricted states of partial knowledge and in the excessively powerful computational machinery required.

The configuration of changing values is examined to determine</head><p>what can be inferred about the next qualitatively distinct state of the mechanism.

The qualitative structural and behavioral descriptions offer simplicity of mechanism, in that the qualitative-simulation process depends on the ability to create and match simple assertions, rather than on arithmetic operations or symbolic integration. They also offer the ability to represent partial knowledge, in that both values and functional relationships are only constrained to lie in qualitatively defined classes. Both simplicity of mechanism and states of partial knowledge are valuable properties of a commonsense knowledge representation.</p><p>The next example shows that the qualitative simulation can also provide an essential property of a description of physical causality: the ability to detect previously unsuspected values at which qualitatively significant changes take place.</p></div>

However, one important product of causal reasoning about a physical system is the existence of previously unsuspected values at which qualitatively significant changes take place. We can explore this issue in the context of a more realistic heat-flow problem, where there are flows of heat both into the gas from the source, and away from the gas into the surrounding cooler air.

The problem is to deduce the existence of an equilibrium temperature (1",) between the temperatures of the heat source (Xs) and the air (Z,), and to show that the system moves to a stable equilibrium about that temperature. A commonsense description of the behavior of this system is "The temperature of the gas moves to a temperature between the temperature of the air and that of the source, and remains steady".</p></div>

As we shall see, it first propagates newly discovered information through the constraints to complete the description of the system at a given time-point. Once that description is sufficiently complete, the envisionment process examines the set of currently changing values to determine the next qualitatively distinct state. If the description of the current state is not sufficiently well specified to determine the next state uniquely, the behavioral description branches according to the three possible states of an unspecified IQ value or ordinal relation. If the alternating cycle of sprouting a new time-point and propagating information among its values should become bogged down in intractible branching, the causal-structure description may be summarized and simplified (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> and<ref type="figure">Appendix D</ref>). The new description is less constrained, hence weaker than the old one, but by being simpler it may avoid branching and allow the envisionment process to continue.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper is concerned with the qualitative simulation of physical systems whose descriptions are stated in terms of continuously varying parameters. These continuous systems are interesting because they pose unsolved problems in the representation of knowledge, and because they appear fundamental to commonsense knowledge of causality in the physical world. There appears to be a 'cluster' of knowledge of manageable size about the possible interactions among continuously changing parameters which we can hope to capture and represent <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The examples presented above demonstrate a representation for qualitative reasoning about causality in physical mechanisms. The system as described in this paper has been completely implemented in MACLlSP. The structural description is essentially a qualitative form of a differential equation, specifying a set of parameters which characterize the state of the mechanism and a set of constraints holding among the parameters. Qualitative simulation produces a behavioral description which specifies the ordinal relationships and directions of change of the parameter values at each point in time.</p><p>Just as differential equations do not provide a theory of physics, but rather a language for stating theories of physics, the work presented here is a 'qualitative mathematics' intended as a language for stating theories of qualitative reasoning about particular mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[9]</ref>.

The inequality constraint holds between two parameters and a switch, so that the switch holds the boolean value corresponding to the truth of the given relationship between the values of the parameters at that time.

The value of the same parameter in the time-point created by the envisionment rule is A' or B' respectively.

KUIPERS</head><p>Future directions for research on these 'qualitative differential equations' include a mathematical exploration of their properties and the correctness of the qualitative-simulation algorithm (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), a reformulation of the prediction rules (Appendix C), and an extension to the formalism to allow time to be treated as a structural, as well as a behavioral, parameter.</p></div>

A parameter is symbol denoting a continuously differentiable real-valued function of time (p~: R --, R).</p><p>Def. A constraint is a pair (P, A) consisting of:</p><p>(1) a set P of parameters, (2) a set A of axioms stating relationships between the values and IQ values of the parameters in P. (See <ref type="bibr">Appendix B.)</ref> Def. A structural description is a 4-tuple (P, U, C, A) consisting of:</p><p>(1) a set P of parameters, (2) a set U of subsets of P, called units, partitioning P into mutually exclusive subsets,</p><p>(3) a set C of constraints, holding among the parameters in P, (4) a set A of axioms stating additional, situation-specific relationships between the values and IQ values of the parameters in P.</p><p>(E.g. constant(p) =&gt; (for-all (t) (IQ-value(p, t) = steady)).)</p><p>Def. A time-point is a symbol denoting a real number in the domain of some parameter.</p><p>Def. A value is a symbol denoting a real number in the range of some parameter.</p><p>Def. An IQ value is one of the three symbols {increasing, steady, decreasing}, denoting the sign of the derivative of a parameter at a particular time-point.</p><p>Def.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C. The Envisionment Rules</head><p>The envisionment, or qualitative simulation of the behavior of a device, proceeds using three types of rules.</p><p>(1) Propagation rules propagate information across constraints about the values of parameters at a given time-point.</p><p>(2) Prediction rules determine the nature of the next distinct qualitative-state description from what is known about the current state.</p><p>(3) Recognition rules detect global properties of the envisionment such as cycles, case-joins, and quiescence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.I. Propagation rules</head><p>Propagation rules propagate information about the values of parameters at the current time-point according to the relationships among the parameters and constraints describing the structure of the mechanism. Landmark values are only acquired by being built into the structural description (e.g. the speed limit is 55 mph), or being detected as critical points of functions (Rule P2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.2. Prediction rules</head><p>The configuration of changing values (the parameters whose current IQ value is not steady) can be analyzed to select the state or states that immediately then the next values of those changing parameters are equal to their limit points and any changing parameters without limits are perturbed in their direction of change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">If no changing values are equal to landmark values</head><p>and some changing values are moving toward limit points and the limit points divide into exactly two sets of corresponding values, then branch according to the non-deterministic move-to-limit rule (case 2.3. <ref type="bibr">1.3)</ref> and any changing parameters without limits are perturbed in their direction of change. 3.4 Otherwise the current state is declared "lntractible".</p><p>We are currently experimenting with alternate formulations of the prediction rules which may enable us to handle certain cases difficult to express in the decision-tree format. Thus the definition of 'intractible' for the envisionment system is likely to change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.3. Recognition rules</head><p>Recognition rules recognize global configurations in the envisionment that allow the set of time-points to be simplified. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D. Summarizing the Structural Description</head><p>The syntactic transformation rules for summarizing the causal-structure description are the following (in mathematical notation, rather than graph diagrams). They are applied repeatedly until the structural description cannot be simplified further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. KUIPERS</head><p>The transformation is implemented by installing the new constraint, linked with the existing parameters. The existing constraints are left in place but 'turned off' so their rules are no longer activated in response to newly asserted values. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix E. Momentum and Cyclic Behavior</head><p>In examining the envisionment of the double heat-flow system, people occasionally ask about momentum: "What if the value keeps on going rather than stopping at its limit?" Naturally, this can only occur if the system is sufficiently complex to support that behavior, and if that complexity is reflected in the causal structure description. The example of the oscillating spring demonstrates both momentum and the creation of important new landmark values. This</p></div>			</div>
