<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Maintenance plays an important role in industrial production, especially in areas where the loss of system failure is large. Various maintenance policies have been developed to improve system safety, reduce system failures and lower manufacturing cost. Preventive maintenance (PM) is a policy that occurs when the system is still operating, aiming to retain the system or specified components in a certain condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. PM policy focusing on single-component degrading system has been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, in recent years, due to the increasing complexity and variety of production systems, more attention is being paid to PM on multi-component systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The existing PM policies for multi-component degrading system can be categorized into two classes. The first class assumes that each component only has two states, i.e., functioning or failed. Component degradation is described in terms of failure rate or hazard rate, and so on with the objective to find an optimum strategy that minimizes maintenance cost. Usually, PM is triggered when the system reliability or availability falls below a certain prescribed level. As a result, the problem becomes optimization of PM thresholds or other parameters that lead to cost minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. For instance, Zhou and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> derived a dynamic PM policy by sequentially optimizing maintenance cost at every maintenance point. Samrout et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> addressed the problem of PM optimization by referring component degradation to as proportional hazard rate. Lin and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> investigated the PM problem under reliability constraints and adopted importance measures to minimize non-periodic PM cost. For some more recent works, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The second class is based on discrete-state Markov chains, where component states are usually divided into several classes such as 'as good as new', 'preventive maintenance due' and 'failed' <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Gürler and Kaya <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed an approximation to represent component lifetime as a number of finite stages. Nourelfath and Ait-Kadi <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> addressed the problem of prioritizing resources between components under the reliability constraint. Modelling by discrete Markov chains still owns some disadvantages, e.g., the classification of component states is arbitrary. Moreover, it assumes that failures can only occur at discrete time points. Therefore, it is more appropriate to treat component degradation as a continuous stochastic process.</p><p>In the literature, most maintenance policies are cost-centred, i.e., policies are developed by minimizing maintenance cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, for companies, as maintenance action is meant to generate profit, it is more reasonable to view maintenance as a value-generating action. Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> highlighted the critical idea that when making the maintenance decision, cost, along with the value resulting from improved reliability, should be considered. Hitherto, few studies have been undertaken to address the problem of value-based maintenance policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by the idea of maintenance value, our PM policy is developed from the value perspective. In the previous works, for imperfect maintenance, the repair rate was assumed to be constant and the maintenance cost was invariant <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, maintenance cost of complex system would vary, especially for imperfect maintenance, where maintenance cost would be different if the maintenance degree varies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Resources should be allocated to components with less maintenance cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, a PM policy for multi-component system concerning continuously degrading components is developed. The maintenance objective is to maximize the maintenance net value. Different from previous stationary maintenance policies, a dynamic PM policy is proposed, with the advantage of incorporating short-term information. The PM policy consists of two steps: (i) determine which component to maintain; (ii) determine to what degree the component should be maintained. The yield-cost importance is introduced to determine the most importance component.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents system description and reliability analysis for the system composed of continuously degrading components. Section 3 constructs the PM objective and introduces yield-cost importance to make the maintenance decision. Section 4 gives a numerical example to illustrate the proposed method. Finally, Section 5 concludes the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Basic assumptions</head><p>In this study, the following assumptions are used:</p><p>(1) Components are mutually independent.</p><p>(2) Each component is continuously monitored.</p><p>(3) Compared to the time period between two consecutive PM actions, the duration of PM activity is negligible. (4) Degradation is the only cause of system failure. The effects of aging, wear and other cumulative damages are integrated into a degradation process. (5) Only one maintenance crew is available and only one component can be maintained at a time. (6) Maintenance action does not change the degradation path of components. The impact of maintenance activity lies in restoring the system or component to a new state. The degradation path is regarded as a characteristic of the system in filed operation, which is not influenced by maintenance.</p><p>The aforementioned assumptions were used in the literatures, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">System description</head><p>The system considered here is a series-parallel system with degrading components. Denote the degradation level of component i over time t as X i ðt; μ i ; θ i Þ, where μ i is the fixed-effect parameter, and θ i is the random-effect parameter; in most cases, X i ðt; μ; θÞ is a monotonic function over time t <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> gives simple description of the component degradation process. In addition, X i ðt; μ i ; θ i Þ is non-negative due to the nature of degradation measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Reliability and lifetime distribution analysis</head><p>In this paper, component failure is defined as "soft failure", i.e., a component fails whenever the degradation level X i ðt; μ i ; θ i Þ exceeds threshold value L i . The set of failure threshold values, L ¼ fL i ; i ¼ 1; 2; …; ng, is assumed to be pre-set. Without loss of generality, degradation level is assumed to be monotonically increasing, and reliability of component i at time t is represented by the probability that X i ðt; μ i ; θ i Þ stays below threshold L i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R i ðtÞ ¼ PfX i ðt; μ i ; θ i Þ o L i g:<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>Let W i ðtÞ denote the functioning identifier of component i at time t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">W i ðtÞ ¼ 1 if component i functions at time t: 0 if component i fails at time t: (<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>The system reliability is  where WðtÞ ¼ fW i ðtÞ; i ¼ 1; 2; …; ng and Ψ ðÞ is the system structure function.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">RðtÞ ¼ PfΨ ðWðtÞÞ ¼ 1g;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>For a series-parallel system composed of m subsystems, with each subsystem containing n i components, its reliability can be obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">RðtÞ ¼ ∏ m i ¼ 1 1 À ∏ n i j ¼ 1 ð1 À R ij ðtÞ ! :<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">Let X i ðt; μ i ; θ i Þ ¼ h i ðt; μ i ; θ i Þ denote the degradation level of component i,</formula><p>where h i ðÞ is the degradation path. Assuming the inverse function of degradation path h À 1</p><p>i ðt; μ i ; X i ðtÞÞ exists, the lifetime distribution of component i can be denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F i ðtÞ ¼ PfX i ðtÞ 4 L i g ¼ 1 À PfX i ðtÞ r L i g ¼ 1 À F θ i ðh À 1 i ðt; μ i ; X i ðþT 0 ÞÞÞ;<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where F θ i ðÞ is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of θ i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">PM objective function</head><p>The influence of PM activity lies in revenue improvement and cost generation. In this paper, we adopt net value ðZ S Þ as the PM objective. It is defined as the difference between revenue (V) and cost (C), that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Z S ¼ V À C:<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>The cost items we consider here include operating cost within usage span and component maintenance cost at each PM action.</p><p>In the literature, component maintenance cost is usually considered as a constant amount corresponding to specified maintenance action such as replacement, imperfect maintenance and minimal repair. However, for imperfect maintenance, component maintenance cost varies with different amount of resources assigned. It would be more appropriate to view component maintenance cost as a variable, rather than a constant. As the maintenance action is to improve component reliability or extend component lifetime, the maintenance cost is closely related to the component reliability distribution before and after the maintenance. For instance, if a component is to be restored to a higher reliability level, the cost would be higher. Hence, in this paper, the component maintenance cost is modelled as a function of component reliability distribution, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">c i ¼ Z 1 0 ðg i ðR π i ðtÞÞ À g i ðR i ðtÞÞÞ dt;<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where R π i ðtÞ is the reliability distribution of component i after maintenance, and g i ðÞ is the component value concerning the reliability distribution. For the component replacement, R 1 0 g i ðR π i ðtÞÞ dt can be viewed as the purchase price of a brandnew component, and R 1 0 g i ðR i ðtÞÞ dt can be viewed as the component salvage value.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the user demand, e.g., reliability, availability, and safety constraints. Maintenance policy should be able to meet specific user demand. In this study, we consider the reliability constraint, that is, within usage duration, the reliability of the system should stay above the threshold σ, i.e., RðtÞ Z σ, for all t 4 0. PM action is triggered whenever the system reliability R(t) falls below σ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">T k ¼ arg inf t ft : RðtÞ r σ; t 4 T k À 1 g;<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>where T k is the time point of the kth maintenance action. The maintenance objective is to maximize Z S within the mission period S:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Z S ¼ Z S 0 vðtÞ dt À Z S 0 cðtÞ dt À ∑ n i ¼ 1 ∑ e i k ¼ 1 c i ;<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>where e i denotes the number of PM actions on the ith component, c(t) is the operating cost and v(t) is the operating revenue.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Dynamic PM formulation</head><p>To obtain the net value within the time horizon, we need to determine the number of PM actions, which requires long-term information. However, in practice, only short-term information is available. Hence, in this study, we turn to a dynamic policy, which optimizes the maintenance net value for each PM actions.</p><p>The difficulty of value-based PM optimization lies in quantifying the benefits generated by maintenance action <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Particularly, how to represent the maintenance value in the form of reliability distribution remains unknown. In our model where a critical boundary is given, the reliability distribution can be transformed into a lifetime distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. This transition gives the opportunity to evaluate the value of PM actions.</p><p>At each PM activity point, the PM policy is developed with the goal of maximizing the net value for each maintenance action:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">π n ¼ arg max π fEðZ π i Þg;<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>where π represents the PM action, and Z π i denotes the net value generated by the current PM action on the ith component.</p><p>Let Y(t) be the system yield function, denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">YðtÞ ¼ Z 1 0 ðvðtÞÀcðtÞÞ dt<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>The expected system yield can be obtained by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">EðYðTÞÞ ¼ Z 1 0 YðtÞ dFðtÞ;<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>where F(t) is the lifetime distribution of the system.

However, as it is difficult to obtain an analytical solution for Eq. ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), numerical method is used here. An important issue concerning the numerical method is the computational complexity; optimizing EðZ i Þ directly would lead to computational inefficiency. In fact, different components would make different contribution to the system performance. Only those components of importance are worthwhile to take maintenance action on. Therefore, to reduce the search apace, we introduce the yield-cost importance to determine which component should be maintained.</p><p>The yield-cost importance denotes the net value variation due to the shift of component lifetime/reliability distribution.

The expected net value reaches its peak at the improved degradation level of 1.8, i.e., when the degradation level of component 2 is restored to 1.8, we get the maximum net value of 37.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Maintenance decision within the usage span</head><p>Sequential maintenance actions within the whole period have been studied and the system reliability variation within the time horizon is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. The result implies that the maintenance action should be taken at the time points of 5.58 year, 9.16 year, and 14.73 year. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> summarizes the components to maintain and their restored degradation level within the usage span. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> indicate that for the first maintenance action, component 2 is maintained and its degradation level should be restored to 1.8. For the second maintenance action, components 1 and 2 are replaced by new ones. For the last maintenance action, component 3 is maintained, with the degradation level being restored to 10.8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Example 2general series-parallel system</head><p>In this section, we consider a series-parallel system composed of four subsystems in series (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The systems consist of 11 components, following linear degradation processes. The data concerning degradation parameters and maintenance cost are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, which are modified from exponential data presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The variations of cost and revenue comply with Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">28</ref>). The parameter are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows the results of maintenance actions and corresponding maintenance level within the time horizon of 200 years. Four maintenance actions are performed within the usage span. For the first two maintenance actions, component 5 is restored to a new degradation level. This is due to the fact that the expected lifetime of subsystem 1 is shortest among the four subsystems, which is a bottleneck in the system. In subsystem 1, component 5 has the longest expected lifetime and as a result, maintaining component 5 generates the maximal net value. For the third action, maintaining only one component cannot restore the system back to functioning under the reliability constraint. According to the proposed maintenance policy, components 5 and 11 are replaced as their importance ranks are higher than other components. At the time of performing the last maintenance action, component 6 becomes the bottleneck of the system. Maintaining the component to the degradation level of 423 generates the maximal net value under the reliability constraint till the end of the usage span. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> presents the system reliability within the time horizon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This study proposes a PM policy for system with continuously degrading components. Considering the case that only one maintenance crew is available, a dynamic PM strategy is developed with the objective of maximizing the maintenance net value. Yield-cost importance is introduced to determine the most important component. The proposed importance measure reduces  computational complexity for maintenance decision making. This method can be used for maintenance of complex systems where computational efficiency is the main concern. For practical applications, the proposed maintenance model aids to recognize the bottleneck of the system and prevent the system from unexpected      failures. In addition, in case the system has failed, the proposed model helps to identify the failed component and reduce downtime of the system, which is of significance for safety-critical systems such as chemical plants and processing plants.</p><p>Further work can be done by relaxing some assumptions. For example, the relationship between the value of the component and its reliability function can be studied further to develop more precise models. Moreover, in this paper, it is assumed that component degradation is the only cause of failure. Future work can be done by considering sudden failures. If more than one maintenance crew are available, PM policy becomes to select an optimal combination of components, which is a typical PN-hard problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
