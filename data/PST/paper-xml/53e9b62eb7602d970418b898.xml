<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>unsupervised image segmentation remains a fundamental issue in low-level image analysis and computer vision since most high-level processing schemes must rely on reliable and robust segmentations. In this correspondence, we address the problem of nonsupervised texture segmentation. Although this problem has received considerable attention in the last decade 141,181, <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, [ll], <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[13]</ref>, completely data-driven segmentation methods, able to handle real-world textured images, remain beyond the present state-of-the-art. The algorithm presented in this correspondence is unsupervised in the following sense:</p><p>it does not require a priori knowledge on the textures of the image (in particular no learning step is necessary); the number of regions or texture classes needs not to be known either. Early attempts at nonsupervised texture segmentation have made use of texture measures associated with edge detection techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[8]</ref>. A more powerful approach consists in modeling the different textures with stationary statistical models, for instance Gauss-Markov random fields (GMRF) <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[12]</ref>. The image is usually divided into disjoint local windows [lo]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[12]</ref>. Each region is assumed to contain mainly one texture. This assumption enables one to identify locally the parameters of stationary texture models [ll], <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[12]</ref>. Windows with nearby parameters are then merged using clustering techniques [IO], <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[12]</ref>. One problem with these methods is the difficulty of the computation, from local windows, of reliable parameters for the underlying model. Several authors [4], <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[7]</ref> have $us proposed describing texture using statistical features <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[6]</ref> that are computed in local windows. The use of local texture features, instead of global texture models, reduces significantly the number of parameters to be determined. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>n. BAYESIAN IMAGE ANALYSE AND MARKOV RANDOM FIELDS</head><p>The general mathematical framework under concern in this correspondence is based on global Bayesian estimation along with MRF models. The goal of this theory is to extract a 2-D field of discrete labels describing the information of interest in a given image processing task from a given set of observed variables (in texture segmentation, for instance, the labels to be estimated are region labels). Let 0 = (Os, s E S) designate an observation field defined on a rectangular lattice S. k t E = (Es, s E S) denote the unobserved (hidden) label field, defined on the same lattice S.</p><p>Realizations of fields 0 (resp. E) will be denoted o = {os, s E S } (resp. e = {e,, s E S}). Let A be the (discrete) state space of random variable e, and Cl the (finite) set of all possible label configurations e = {e,, s E S}. If (E, 0) is assumed to be an MRF with respect to a chosen neighborhood system D = {Gs, s E S}, it can be shown Label p is maintained on small connected components (of size less than 1% of the image size). New regions are created for all other connected components.</p><p>An intricate issue for these different approaches is the determination of the number of textures present in the image. Model fitting criteria have been proposed recently to address this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[13]</ref>.</p><p>In this correspondence, we propose an alternate approach relying on an augmented state-MRF model that enables one to handle an a priori unknown number of regions'. Our model is inspired by the model described by Geman et al., in [4], with several significant differences. In [4], various texture features are used, along with an MRF model of the segmentation map. The algorithm is partially unsupervised but the number of regions is assumed to be known approximately and thresholds for discriminating the different textures have to be fine-tuned. In the approach proposed here, the segmentation is obtained using a deterministic relaxation procedure that simultaneously determines the current number of regions. This is achieved by introducing an additional state (corresponding to an outlier class) in the MRF model representing the image partition. This additional label enables the dynamic creation of new regions during the relaxation process (a similar idea has been suggested for motion-based segmentation by Bouthemy and FranGois [2]). Mixed windows may thus be split in several sub-regions, leading to reliable and robust parameter estimation. Besides, the method only q u i r e s the tuning of one parameter, which is a probability that determines all the thresholds on the texture features. The remainder of this correspondence is organized as follows. In</p><p>Section II, we briefly describe the general framework of the statistical approach used here (global Bayesian estimation, MRF models, and</p><p>This correspondence is a short version of the technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[7]</ref> in which additional details about the method as well as other experimental results can be found.</p><p>where C denotes the set of cliques associated to neighborhood system 0. Cliques c are subsets of sites that are mutual neighbors. The potential function V, is locally defined on clique c and expresses</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>the local interactions between the different variables of the clique (see [3] and [5] for an extensive presentation of MRF models).</head><p>Defining global energy functions is a powerful tool for specifying nonlinear interactions between different image features (luminance, edges, region labels, etc.). They help to combine and organize spatial and temporal information by introducing strong generic knowledge about the features to be estimated. Energy minimization techniques have been used in a wide range of applications including image restoration, edge detection, luminance and texture segmentation, surface reconstruction, visual motion analysis, and scene interpretation [3]. The choice of particular energy functions is either heuristic or may be guided by a statistical modeling of the interaction between the variables, as will be seen in the following.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Statistical Texture Features</head><p>The observations, on which the segmentation process is based, correspond to vectors of texture features describing various spatial statistics. These features are computed on local windows and are assigned to the pixel located at the center of the window. To each site is thus assigned a feature vector os = [ ~' ( s ) , . . . , om(s)] where oa (s), i = 1, . . . , m designates the ith texture feature computed at site s and m is the number of texture features. The features that have been used here include seven features proposed by Haralick (mean, variance, energy, correlation, entropy, contrast, and homogeneity), derived from the joint occurrency matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[6]</ref> and three other features proposed by Geman et aL, [4] (the gray level, the local contrast, and an "isotropic residual"). Several other parameters (all the parameters defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[6]</ref> and features based on the Fourier transform) have  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Global Energy Function</head><p>As in Section II, e,, s E S will designate the hidden variable assigned to site s, which describes the label of the region to which Term U1 describes the interaction between observations and labels. It is inspired by the model described by Geman et al., [4], with several significant differences. In [4], the model is based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance expressing the similarity of the distribution of texture features in blocks centered at two neighboring sites s and t. We introduce here a different potential function that measures the distance, at a given site s, between the distribution of texture features in a block B, centered at s (local distribution) and the distribution of texture features in the whole candidate region to which we want to assign site s (global distribution) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This technique enables us, in particular, to create new regions by detecting outliers during the relaxation process, as will be explained in Section HI-C. Accordingly, energy function U1 is decomposed as u~(o, e, R) = is a threshold that can be explicitly determined using statistical tables associated to the KS limit distribution [4]. Indeed, this is related to the probability p that the KS distance exceeds &amp;')whereas the two distributions are the same:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V ~{ O ( B ~) , o[~(e~)I)</head><p>Potential VI favors the labeling of site s with the region number e, = r if the local distribution at this site is consistent with the global distribution of the texture features in region r . A reasonable threshold c(;) may be selected by adjusting the probability p to a desired level. In practice, large values for p (p &gt; 0.7) enable one to discriminate textures with close spatial statistics whereas small values for p (p &lt; 0.3) only discriminate textures with very different statistics. The minimization of the global energy function (3), as well as the determination of the number of regions R, is performed using a deterministic relaxation algorithm described in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Relaxation Algorithm</head><p>To minimize the global energy function, stochastic relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[5]</ref> has not been considered since it is too expensive from a computational point of view. We have adopted a modified version of the standard deterministic ICM algorithm [l], which alternately updates the segmentation map e and the current number of regions.</p><p>Let us denote by R the current number of regions. The candjdate region labels for a given site s are thus labels r = 1, . . . , R. In the standard ICM algorithm [l], the label that produces the largest decrease of the energy function is selected to update site s. This amounts to the minimization of a local energy function that is derived from the global energy U by computing the energy variation induced by updating the site s [l], <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[5]</ref>. To cope with the unknown number of regions, an additional label p corresponding to an "outlier class"   </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F o r r # p : AU,(r) = ~[ 1 - ~( r -e t ) ] t n e i g h b o r o f s m + ( 2 r [ d ( o ( ' ) ( R ( e , = r ) ) . o('))(B,)) &gt; c(*)] -l} (8)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>is the parameter of the outlier class (4 &gt; 0 and a high value for disfavors the creation of new regions). A value of 4 = 2.5 was adopted in all experiments. This local update is applied in turn to the different sites in the image.</p><p>For the initialization of the process, an initial value of R = 1 is used, which corresponds to one single region in the image. This initial single region is updated using a maximum likelihood estimator of the label field, which is nothing but the minimization of the global energy without the prior term U2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[7]</ref>. The current number of regions R is updated once the relaxation on the label field e has converged. At the end of each relaxation stage (i.e., when the label field is stable),</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2 = 1 F o r r = p : Al',(p) = 11 [1 -2S(p -e t ) ] + 4. C E C</formula><p>the connected components of the outlier class (i.e., the pixels labeled p ) are relabeled with new region numbers (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). However, label p is maintained for all small connected components (of size less than 1% of the image size). These points will not be considered for the computation of global region characteristics, but may be visited and relabeled in the next relaxation step. This procedure allows a small region to grow until it reaches a size sufficient for providing significant statistics. The global statistical distributions associated with each significant region are updated after the relabeling process. This relaxation-relabeling process is pursued until stability is obtained on the label field. The number of iterations required to reach stability depends on the complexity of the scene. However, in practice, the process has been stopped after three complete relaxation-relabeling procedures with satisfactory results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>The segmentation technique described in the previous section has been applied to different mosaics composed of natural textures extracted from the Brodatz album, as well as on real-world textured images. Experimental results on images used in other references are presented to make the comparison with other approaches easier. Other results are reported in 171.</p><p>The features related to the joint occurrency matrices were computed on 16 gray-level images in 5 x 5 local windows, along four directions with a distance d = 3 (d = 2 yielded similar results). The other parameters (gray levels, contrast, and directional residuals) were computed on a 15 x 15 window. Parameter p was set to 1.5, which corresponds to a good balance between the a priori energy U2 and the data term U1 . The only parameter that needed to be tuned was parameter p [defined by (7)], which determines the different thresholds on the texture features. The results turned out to be largely insensitive to the adjustment of parameter p (the "optimal" value could be modified by 10% without noticeable changes in the segmentation: results obtained for different values of parameter p are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[7]</ref>). The CPU time, on a S u n 4 station, reached about 25 mn, for 128 x 128 images.</p><p>We first describe the results obtained on various texture mosaics, including different textures and object geometry. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>(a) presents the first mosaic, which is composed of three different textures. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b)</ref> shows the boundary of the underlying mosaic, which corresponds to the ground truth. The boundaries of the final segmentation are superimposed on the original image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(c)</ref>. The error between the ground truth and the segmentation obtained by the unsupervised method is depicted Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(d)</ref>. Three regions are obtained in this case for a value p = 0.75. The boundaries of the different regions are delineated quite accurately, even if the MRF prior tends to "smooth" the region boundary in high curvature areas. Similar qualitative results have been obtained on several other handassembled images corresponding to different mosaic patterns. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> reproduces a mosaic pattem close to the one used in the reference [4] (by Geman et al). A second typical mosaic, borrowed from <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref> (in which a MRF model is used for representing textures), is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. As can be seen, our result are qualitatively close to the one reported in [4] and <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>.</p><p>The processing of red-world (textured) images is generally more involved, mainly because the textures appearing in natural images are usually nonstationary. We present results of segmentation on three real-world images that have been selected for their representativity and their difficulty. The images show several textured regions with various (possibly nonstationary) spatial statistics (Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref>). Artifacts or nonstationary areas in textures are difficult to handle and lead generally to over-segmented images if they are not taken into account in the model. The approach proposed here, although using stationary texture models, seems quite robust to these phenomena, as will be seen. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> corresponds to an aerial image showing two cultivated fields: the boundary between the two regions is delineated quite accurately, although the upper region is not homogeneous. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> presents another aerial image. This kind of image is typical of realworld applications, in which the textures are nonhomogeneous and where the number of regions is difficult to determine, even visually. In this case four significant regions are obtained: in particular, the forest area has been segmented in two regions, with different spatial patterns. The two other regions are cultivated fields. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows a satellite image of the south-eastem part of France, with similar difficulties. The area includes a part of the Alps and a part of the Mediterranean Sea. Even on this hard example (which shows highly nonstationary textures), a relevant segmentation (Fig. <ref type="figure">8(b)</ref>) is obtained. The algorithm enables one to separate quite accurately the different significant areas: mountain, land, and sea. data-driven segmentation algorithm. The proposed approach does not require training on the textures to be partitioned. The number of regions in the image need not to be known either. The method makes use of local and global spatial statistics within a global statistical estimation framework relying on Markov random field models. The method only requires the tuning of one parameter that determines the thresholds on the different texture features. Several examples have shown the capability of the model to yield usable segmentations on hand-assembled images consisting of natural textures as well as on complex real-world textured images.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[ 5 ] 6 ~Fig. 2 .</head><label>562</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. distributions.
