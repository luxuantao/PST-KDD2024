<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper is devoted to stability analysis and control design of switched linear systems in both continuous and discrete-time domains. A particular class of matrix inequalities, the so-called Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities, provides conditions for open-loop stability analysis and closed-loop switching control using state and output feedback. Switched linear systems are analyzed in a general framework by introducing a quadratic in the state cost determined from a series of impulse perturbations. Lower bounds on the cost associated with the optimal switching control strategy are derived from the determination of a feasible solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman inequality. An upper bound on the optimal cost associated with a closed-loop stabilizing switching strategy is provided as well. The solution of the output feedback problem is based on the construction of a full-order linear switched filter whose state variable is used by the mechanism for the determination of the switching rule. Throughout, the theoretical results are illustrated by means of academic examples. A realistic practical application related to the optimal control of semiactive suspensions in road vehicles is reported.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>back <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Switched linear systems control design is more involved since σ(•) is a control signal to be determined from the available measurements in order to improve performance. This paper is devoted to the analysis and control design of switched linear systems in both, continuous-and discrete-time settings.</p><p>Stability analysis of continuous-time switched linear systems has been addressed by many authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the interested reader can find an interesting discussion on a collection of results on uniform stability of switched systems. However, very little attention has been devoted to the design of stabilizing output feedback control laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The reader is requested to see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for a rather complete review on stability of continuous-time switched linear systems, where special attention is given to the case of switching between two linear systems. The same reference also provides a discussion on hybrid feedback control based on output measurements, which, in our opinion, cannot be directly generalized to cope with the problem to be stated afterwards. The situation is even poorer in discrete time, where only a few works have appeared for the stabilization problem, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In this paper, the stability conditions for continuous-and discrete-time linear switched systems, provided, respectively, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, are used. They are expressed through the so-called Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities.</p><p>Due to its nonconvex nature, a more conservative, but easier to solve asymptotic stability condition is proposed. It is expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) plus a scalar variable, thus being solvable in polynomial time (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) by the machinery available in the literature to date. It is important to mention that these stability conditions do not suffer a common drawback appearing, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> where sliding modes are excluded and whose possible occurrence has to be a posteriori verified.</p><p>In this paper, the stability conditions expressed in terms of the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities are developed further to cope with the determination of lower and upper bounds on the cost associated with the optimal switching control strategy. It is important to stress that a simple generalization of the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities provides a solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman inequality, an useful property for optimal cost lower bound calculation, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. These problems are addressed in a general framework where a quadratic in the state cost is defined from a set of external impulse-type perturbations.</p><p>Throughout, simple numerical examples of third order are included for illustration purposes. A more realistic practical application of a switched linear system of fourth order is also considered. It consists of the design of a switching control strategy for semiactive suspensions in road vehicles, and is motivated by the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, where two different algorithms have been devised. The method in the present paper outperforms these algorithms in all realistic simulations carried out.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the problem to be solved is stated. The results on stability conditions and state feedback switching control of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for continuous-and discrete-time systems, respectively, are discussed. In the same section, lower and upper bounds on the optimal cost are provided. In Section III, the performance index used throughout the paper is determined. It consists of a guaranteed cost that bounds the effects caused by a series of external impulse perturbations. Section IV provides the solution to the output feedback switching control problem based on the design of a switched linear filter for continuous-and discretetime systems. Section V contains a practical application of the results obtained in the previous sections to semiactive suspensions that puts in evidence the main features of the theoretic results. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper. Appendixes I and II contain detailed proofs of two main theorems.</p><p>The notation used throughout is standard. Capital letters denote matrices and small letters denote vectors. For scalars, small Greek letters are used. For real matrices or vectors, ( ) indicates transpose. For square matrices, Tr(X) denotes the trace function of X being equal to the sum of its eigenvalues, and for the sake of easing the notation of partitioned symmetric matrices, the symbol (•) generically denotes each of its symmetric blocks. The set M denotes the set of all Metzler matrices, composed by square matrices Π ∈ R N ×N of fixed dimensions with nonnegative off-diagonal elements. Two subsets denoted as M c and M d are composed by Metzler matrices satisfying the normalization constraints N i=1 π ij = 0 and N i=1 π ij = 1 for all j = 1, . . . , N, respectively. Hence, each matrix in M c (M d ) has a null (unitary) Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue associated with a nonnegative eigenvector ν ≥ 0 ∈ R N . The unitary simplex defined for all vectors λ ∈ R N such that λ i ≥ 0 for all i = 1, . . . , N and N i=1 λ i = 1 is denoted by Λ. Given matrices U 1 , . . . , U N of compatible dimensions and λ ∈ Λ, the matrix U λ := N i=1 λ i U i denotes a matrix obtained by a convex combination. The n × n identity matrix is denoted as I n . Finally, δ(t) denotes the unitary impulse in both continuous-and discrete-time settings and the square norm of a trajectory s(t) defined for all t ≥ 0, denoted s </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>Consider a linear switched system of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h • x(t) = A σ (t) x(t) + Bw(t) (1)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">y(t) = C σ (t) x(t) + Dw(t) (2) z(t) = E σ (t) x(t)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which evolves from zero initial condition. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">σ(t) : t ≥ 0 → K := {1, 2, . . . , N}<label>(4)</label></formula><p>making clear that at each instant of time t ≥ 0, one and only one among N known linear systems defined by matrices</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">G i :=    A i B C i D E i 0    ∀i ∈ K<label>(5)</label></formula><p>is switched on. To ease the presentation, we have considered that the controlled variable z(t) does not depend directly on the external disturbance w(t) and matrices B and D do not depend on the switching signal, an assumption to be discussed afterwards. Certainly, based on the results provided here, the reader does not have difficulty in treating more general situations. Assuming that w(t) is an impulse disturbance (to be precisely defined afterwards) and a quadratic in the state cost functional denoted J(σ) is given, the purpose of this paper is to design an output feedback control law of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">σ(t) = u(y [0,t] )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where y [0,t] is the trajectory y(τ ) ∀τ ∈ [0, t], in such a way that the origin x = 0 is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point. Moreover, a quantitative measure on the quality of the proposed policy ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>) with respect to the optimal one is provided. This last requirement is given in terms of a lower J inf and an upper bound J sup such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">J inf ≤ inf σ ∈S J(σ) ≤ J sup (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where S is the set of all stabilizing switching signals. This last point is of particular importance since, as it is largely recognized, the determination of the optimal policy, and consequently, the correspondent minimum cost inf σ ∈S J(σ) is extremely hard even for linear switched systems constituted by a small number of linear systems of low order. Before proceeding, some results introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> on state feedback control design are important, since they establish the basis for the ones on dynamic output feedback control design reported in this paper. Consider a switched linear system of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">h • x(t) = A σ (t) x(t), x(0) = x 0<label>(8)</label></formula><p>and for some symmetric, positive definite matrices P 1 , . . . , P N , define the continuous piecewise quadratic function as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">v(x) := min i∈K x P i x (9)</formula><p>and the associated optimal index given by u(x) := arg min i∈K x P i x <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where it must be understood that, for each x ∈ R n , the value of u(x) is uniquely determined. In case the minimum indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> is attained by more than one index i ∈ K, then only one of them is arbitrarily selected.</p><p>Theorem 1: Let Q i ≥ 0 for all i ∈ K be given. The following statements are true.</p><p>1) Continuous time-If there exist a set of positive definite matrices {P 1 , . . . , P N } and Π ∈ M c satisfying the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A i P i + P i A i + N j =1 π j i P j + Q i &lt; 0<label>(11)</label></formula><p>for all i ∈ K, then the state feedback switching control σ(t) = u(x(t)) makes the equilibrium solution x = 0 of (8) globally asymptotically stable and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∞ 0 x(t) Q σ (t) x(t)dt &lt; v(x 0 ).<label>(12)</label></formula><p>2) Discrete time-If there exist a set of positive definite matrices {P 1 , . . . , P N } and Π ∈ M d satisfying the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">A i   N j =1 π j i P j   A i -P i + Q i &lt; 0<label>(13)</label></formula><p>for all i ∈ K, then the state feedback switching control σ(t) = u(x(t)) makes the equilibrium solution x = 0 of (8) globally asymptotically stable and</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">∞ t=0 x(t) Q σ (t) x(t) &lt; v(x 0 ).<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The existence of a solution for the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and relies on the existence of an asymptotically stable matrix A ∈ co{A 1 , . . . , A N }, which means that each matrix of the set A 1 , . . . , A N does not need to be asymptotically stable but they must admit an asymptotically stable convex combination; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Moreover, in continuous time, closed-loop asymptotic stability is assured even if the system evolves on a sliding mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, the numerical determination of a solution (if any) of the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities with respect to the joint variables (Π, {P 1 , . . . , P N }) is not a simple task due to the nonconvex nature inherited by the products of variables. Hence, a simpler, although more conservative stability condition can be expressed by means of LMIs, thus being solvable by the available machinery plus a line search. The next corollary shows that working with a subclass of Metzler matrices, with the same diagonal elements, this goal is accomplished.</p><p>Corollary 1: The results of Theorem 1 remain valid whenever the following hold.</p><p>1) Continuous time-If there exist a set of positive definite matrices {P 1 , . . . , P N } and γ &gt; 0 satisfying the modified Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">A i P i + P i A i + γ(P j -P i ) + Q i &lt; 0<label>(15)</label></formula><p>for all j = i ∈ K × K. 2) Discrete time-If there exist a set of positive definite matrices {P 1 , . . . , P N } and 0 ≤ γ &lt; 1 satisfying the modified Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">A i (γP i + (1 -γ)P j ) A i -P i + Q i &lt; 0<label>(16)</label></formula><p>for all j = i ∈ K × K.</p><p>The basic theoretical features of Theorem 1 are still present in Corollary 1. Moreover, the extreme situations enable interesting interpretations. Indeed, for γ → 0, (15) reduces to the Lyapunov inequality that assures asymptotic stability for any open-loop control such that σ(t) = i ∈ K ∀t ≥ 0. On the other hand, for γ → +∞, the feasibility of (15) requires the existence of a common quadratic Lyapunov function for all matrices {A 1 , . . . , A N }. In other words, this set of matrices must be quadratically stable in which case, asymptotic stability is preserved for any open-loop control such that σ(t) ∈ K ∀t ≥ 0 with possibly arbitrary fast switching. Since v(x 0 ) := min i∈K x 0 P i x 0 depends on γ, a line search procedure may be used to get a more precise upper bound to the cost of the optimal policy. Similar interpretations can be done for discrete-time systems.</p><p>Theorem 2: Let Q i ≥ 0 for all i ∈ K be given. The following statements are true.</p><p>1) Continuous time-If there exist a set of positive definite matrices {P 1 , . . . , P N } and Π ∈ M c satisfying the inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">A j P i + P i A j + N k =1 π ki P k + Q j ≥ 0<label>(17)</label></formula><p>for i, j ∈ K × K, then with V (x) := max i∈K x P i x, the following lower bound holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">inf σ ∈S ∞ 0 x(t) Q σ (t) x(t)dt ≥ V (x 0 ).<label>(18)</label></formula><p>2) Discrete time-If there exist a set of positive definite matrices {P 1 , . . . , P N } and Π ∈ M d satisfying the inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">A j N k =1 π ki P k A j -P i + Q j ≥ 0<label>(19)</label></formula><p>for i, j ∈ K × K, then with V (x) := max i∈K x P i x, the following lower bound holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">inf σ ∈S ∞ t=0 x(t) Q σ (t) x(t) ≥ V (x 0 ). (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>Proof: The proof of part 1) follows from the determination of the Dini derivative of the function V (x(t)) along any trajectory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Considering the set I(x) := {i : V (x) = x P i x, i ∈ K} and σ(t) = j ∈ K arbitrary, making use of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">V+ (x(t)) = max l∈I (x(t)) x (A σ (t) P l + P l A σ (t) )x ≥ x (A j P i + P i A j )x, ∀i ∈ I(x(t)) ≥ -x Q j x - N k =1 π ki x P k x ≥ -x Q j x (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where we have used the fact that x P i x ≥ x P k x for all k ∈ K and Π ∈ M c . Consequently, V+ (x(t)) + x Q σ x ≥ 0 for all (x(t), σ(t)) ∈ R n × K, which by integration from zero to infinity yields the desired result <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> since the optimal trajectory satisfies x(0) = x 0 and x(∞) = 0. The proof of part 2) follows the same pattern. Considering again that I(x) := {i : V (x) = x P i x, i ∈ K} and σ(t) = j ∈ K arbitrary, making use of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">V (x(t + 1)) = max i∈K x A σ (t) P i A σ (t) x = max λ∈Λ x A j P λ A j x ≥ x A j N k =1 π ki P k A j x ≥ V (x(t)) -x Q j x (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>where we have taken into account that all columns of</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Π ∈ M d belong to Λ. Consequently, V (x(t + 1)) -V (x(t)) + x Q σ (t)</formula><p>x ≥ 0 for all (x(t), σ(t)) ∈ R n × K, which summing up from zero to infinity yields the desired result ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">18</ref>) since the optimal trajectory satisfies x(0) = x 0 and x(∞) = 0. Theorem 2 allows an useful interpretation on the existence of an optimal control policy. Inequalities ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">17</ref>) are always feasible when Q i &gt; 0 for all i ∈ K as it can be readily verified with P i → 0. On the other hand, if <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> admits an unbounded feasible solution (the minimum eigenvalue of some P i &gt; 0 is arbitrarily large), then the lower bound V (x 0 ) → +∞, and we can conclude that the optimal control problem on the left-hand side of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> does not admit a stabilizing solution. To prevent this undesirable situation, assume that the eigenvector associated with the null eigenvalue of Π ∈ M c satisfies ν &gt; 0 ∈ Λ, and there exists λ ∈ Λ such that A λ is asymptotically stable. Multiplying <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> successively by ν i &gt; 0 and λ j ≥ 0 and summing up for all i, j ∈ K × K, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">A λ P ν + P ν A λ + Q λ ≥ 0.<label>(23)</label></formula><p>Hence, the inequalities (17) imply that</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">N i=1 ν i P i ≤ ∞ 0 e A λ t Q λ e A λ t dt. (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>Since the right-hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">24</ref>) is bounded, the conclusion is that the lower bound of the optimal cost (18) is bounded as well. Moreover, it is important to remember that under the same condition, that is, the existence of an asymptotically stable convex combination, from Theorem 1, the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities admit a feasible solution, thus providing a stabilizing switched control and an upper bound to the optimal cost. In the next section, the results are generalized to cope with more general models of switched linear systems given in (1)-(3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CLOSED-LOOP PERFORMANCE</head><p>In this section, the following version of the switched linear system (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3</ref>) is considered where, for the moment, the measured output variable is not taken into account. Assume that</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">h • x(t) = A σ (t) x(t) + Bw(t) (25) z(t) = E σ (t) x(t) (26)</formula><p>evolves from zero initial condition and that σ(•) is a stabilizing switched state feedback control. For each k = 1, . . . , m, an exogenous input of the form w(t) = e k δ(t), where e k ∈ R m is the kth column of the identity matrix I m , is applied and the corresponding controlled output z k (t) is obtained. Based on this, we define the following cost functional associated with the stabilizing control policy σ(•) as being</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">J(σ) := m k =1 z k 2 2 . (<label>27</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>The interpretation of this cost stems from the fact that, for a fixed stabilizing control policy, any trajectory of ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) with zero initial condition and w(t) = e k δ(t) is alternatively provided by the same equations subject to the initial condition x(0) = Be k and input w(t) = 0.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> This fact is also important to make clear that matrix B in (25) can be considered, with no loss of generality, independent of σ ∈ K. Indeed, if the input matrix were dependent on the switching policy, then the initial condition would be x(0) = B σ (0) e k , with B σ (0) being a fixed matrix for all k = 1, . . . , m. The results obtained so far can be applied to get lower and upper bounds to the cost (27) associated with the optimal state feedback switching control, for both continuousand discrete-time cases. Theorem 3: Consider the switched linear system (25)-( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) with zero initial condition and define <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> [inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>], then the switching control strategy σ(t) = u(x(t)) given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> is such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">Q i := E i E i for all i ∈ K.

(<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_33">)</formula><p>Proof: It follows from Theorem 1. Indeed, for continuousand discrete-time systems, considering successively the initial condition x(0) = Be k and w(t) = 0, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">J(σ) &lt; m k =1 min i∈K (Be k ) P i (Be k ) &lt; min i∈K m k =1 (Be k ) P i (Be k ) &lt; min i∈K Tr(B P i B) (29)</formula><p>which proves the proposed theorem.</p><p>In contrast to the result provided by Theorem 1 where the performance of each control policy was dependent on the initial state x 0 ∈ R n , Theorem 3 shows how to associate a unique stabilizing policy to a series of impulse-type perturbations applied to each external input channel. The consequence is somewhat similar to that observed in the classical H 2 theory of linear timeinvariant (LTI) systems where the control policy is effective to deal with perturbations of a wide frequency range acting on each input channel. In the next theorem, the same reasoning is applied to lower bound calculations.</p><p>Theorem 4: Consider the switched linear system (25)-( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) with zero initial condition and define Q i := E i E i for all i ∈ K. If there exist a set of positive definite matrices {P 1 , . . . , P N } and Π ∈ M c [M d ] satisfying the inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> [inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>], then the following lower bound holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">inf σ ∈S J(σ) ≥ max i∈K Tr(B P i B).

The main difficulty is concentrated on the determination of a Metzler matrix Π ∈ R N ×N that certainly requires further research efforts. For the moment, this difficulty is circumvented by replacing the search for a Metzler matrix by the determination of a scalar γ, as indicated in Corollary 1. This approach certainly introduces some conservatism on the calculations of the final bounds but it is numerically efficient. However, for Π ∈ R N ×N fixed, the associated lower and upper bounds follow from the solution of convex programming problems.

Similar reasoning can be applied to get the maximum lower bound. The next example illustrates the results obtained so far.</p><p>Example 1: Consider a continuous-time switched linear system (25)-(26) defined by the matrices</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">A 1 =    0 1 0 0 0 1 -2 -2 0    , A 2 =    0 1 0 0 0 1 0 -2 -2   <label>(33)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">B =    1 0 -1 -1 0 1    .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OUTPUT FEEDBACK CONTROL</head><p>In this section, the main control problem reported in this paper is solved. It consists of the design of a stabilizing fullorder output feedback controller that minimizes the upper bound of the cost functional J(σ) introduced in the previous section. To this end, the model ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-(3), given again for convenience, is considered</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">h • x(t) = A σ (t) x(t) + Bw(t) (36) y(t) = C σ (t) x(t) + Dw(t) (37) z(t) = E σ (t) x(t) (38)</formula><p>where the switching policy is of the form (6) since the switching strategy must be dependent only on the available measurements. The function u(•) is indeed a functional of y(•) in the sense that y(t) is viewed as the input of the following switched linear filter that rules out the changes of the switching index. Introducing the full-order switched filter</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">h • x(t) = Âσ(t) x(t) + Bσ(t) y(t) (39)</formula><p>with zero initial condition, where ( Âi , Bi ), i ∈ K are matrices to be determined, putting (36)-( <ref type="formula">38</ref>) and (39) together, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">h • x(t) = Ãσ(t) x(t) + Bσ(t) w(t) (40) z(t) = Ẽσ(t) x(t) (41) where x = [x x ] ∈ R 2n and Ãi = A i 0 Bi C i Âi , Bi = B Bi D , Ẽ i = E i 0 (42)</formula><p>which evolves from zero initial condition. Therefore, the solution of the stated output feedback switching control design problem requires the determination of the switched filter matrices Âi and Bi for all i ∈ K and a switching policy, such that the enlarged switched linear system (40)-( <ref type="formula">41</ref>) is asymptotically stable. However, in doing so, only switching rules that depend exclusively on x(•) are permitted. In order to apply the results of the previous section, we limit the search for a solution of the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities with a prescribed structure so as to structurally incorporate switching rules that depend only on the available information. Therefore, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">Pi = X V V Xi , detV = 0<label>(43)</label></formula><p>for all i ∈ K and notice that arg min i∈K x Pi x = arg min i∈K x Xi x.

In both cases, the goal is to determine a filter and a switching policy of the form (44) such that the upper bound of the cost functional J(σ) provided by Theorem 3 is minimized. To ease the presentation, we define Qi := Ẽ i Ẽi ∈ R 2n ×2n and Q i := E i E i ∈ R n ×n for all i ∈ K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Continuous-Time Systems</head><p>Considering the augmented continuous-time switched linear system (40)-(41), from Theorem 3, it is seen that if there exist a Metzler matrix Π ∈ M c , positive definite matrices Pi of the form (43), and the filter matrices Âi and Bi for all i ∈ K satisfying the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">Ã i Pi + Pi Ãi + N j =1 π j i Pj + Qi &lt; 0<label>(45)</label></formula><p>for all i ∈ K, then the switching control (44) makes the equilibrium solution x = 0 of (40) globally asymptotically stable with the associated cost satisfying</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">J(u) &lt; min i∈K Tr( B Pi B )<label>(46)</label></formula><p>where = σ(0) ∈ K is fixed and supposed to be provided by the designer. However, with no great difficulty, it can be determined by minimizing the associated cost whenever desired. The next theorem gives a complete solution to the output feedback switching control design problem stated before. Theorem 5: There exist matrices Âi and Bi , i ∈ K for which inequalities (45) are satisfied for some positive definite matrices Pi of the form (43) if and only if there exist a Metzler matrix Π ∈ M c , a positive definite matrix X, a set of positive definite matrices (Z i , R ij ), and a set of matrices L i for all i, j ∈ K × K, such that the following matrix inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">A i Z i + Z i A i + N j =1 π j i R ij + Q i &lt; 0 (47) A i X + XA i + C i L i + L i C i + Q i &lt; 0 (48) R ii &lt; Z i , R ij -Z j Z j -Z i • X -Z j &gt; 0, i = j (49)</formula><p>hold. Moreover, assuming that inequalities (47)-( <ref type="formula">49</ref>) are satisfied, there exist matrices Âi and Bi , i ∈ K such that the output feedback switching control σ(t) = u(x(t)) defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">u(x) = arg min i∈K x V (X -Z i ) -1 V x (<label>50</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_54">)</formula><p>where V is an arbitrary nonsingular matrix, makes the equilibrium solution x = 0 of (40) globally asymptotically stable and the associated cost satisfies J(u) &lt; min i∈K Tr(W i ) whenever matrices W i , i ∈ K are such that the LMI   </p><formula xml:id="formula_55">W i B Z i B X + D L • Z i Z i • • X    &gt; 0<label>(51)</label></formula><p>holds for all i ∈ K. Proof: See Appendix I.</p><p>As before, whenever Π ∈ M c is fixed, the matrix inequalities (47)-( <ref type="formula">49</ref>) and (51) reduce to LMIs, and so, they can be solved with no big difficulty by the machinery available in the literature to date. Another possibility is to restrict the set of Metzler matrices to those with the same diagonal elements. In this case, Corollary 1 applies from which a simplified version of Theorem 5, expressed by LMIs and an additional scalar, follows. Calling Φ(Π) the set of all variables satisfying the LMIs (47)-( <ref type="formula">49</ref>) and (51), the determination of the best output feedback switching control is accomplished from the solution of the optimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">min i∈K { inf Z i ,R i j ,L i ,W i ,X ∈Φ(Π) Tr(W i )}<label>(52)</label></formula><p>where the inner problem is convex. Once it is solved for each i ∈ K, the global (discrete) minimization with respect to i ∈ K is then performed. Since the index = σ(0) may be defined by the designer, it can be involved in the optimization process. However, keeping in mind problem (52), it appears that a good choice would be = i ∈ K, thus being determined by the outer optimization problem.</p><p>After the determination of the involved matrix variables, the filter matrices are readily calculated from the simple formulas (see Appendix I)</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">Bi = V -1 L i (53) Âi = V -1 M i (X -Z i ) -1 V (<label>54</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_58">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">M i := A i Z i + XA i + L i C i + Q i for all i ∈ K.</formula><p>At this point, it must be clear from (50), (53), and (54) that the nonsingular matrix V defines a similarity transformation that makes invariant the output feedback switching rule. In other words, each nonsingular matrix V defines a particular realization of the same switched linear filter and the same output feedback switching rule. Hence, Theorem 5 provides the parametrization of all feasible filters and the associated output feedback switching rule with Pi for all i ∈ K, presenting the prescribed block structure (43). The full-order filter is not in observer form, i.e., Âi = A i -Bi C i . To recover this condition, an additional constraint, unfortunately nonlinear, has to be added (the check is left to the reader)</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">M i = (V A i -L i C i )V -1 (X -Z i ) = A i Z i + XA i + L i C i + Q i .

It is important to keep in mind that if we want to determine a switching strategy by minimizing the cost J(u), then an observer-based solution although stabilizing is not the best that can be done. Moreover, it should be noticed that the output feedback strategies invoked by the theorems presented so far require the existence of stateobserver injection matrices Li = X -1 L i , i ∈ K rendering the set of matrices A i + Li C i quadratically stable (see, e.g., (57) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). The optimal filter and the associated output feedback switching control have been determined from the solution of the convex programming problem (52) with = i ∈ K, yielding J(u) &lt; 12.9725. Each subplot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows in solid line the time evolution of the state variables of the system and in dashed line the time evolution of the state variables of the filter. From t ∈ [0, 10), we have imposed the constant switching control σ(t) = 1. It is clear that both the system and the filter are unstable. At t = 10, the output feedback switching control is connected and the closed-loop system (and the filter) converge to zero, showing that the proposed switching control strategy is actually effective for stabilization.</p></div>

Indeed, a stabilizing output feedback control can be designed in two independent steps. First, assuming the state variable is available for feedback, any feasible solution of inequality (74) provides the control law σ(t) = u(x(t)) = arg min i∈K x(t) Z i x(t). Second, instead of x(t), this control law is applied to the state estimation x(t) provided by any stable observer-based switched filter satisfying inequality (75). Notice that this inequality requires more than simple asymptotic stability since all closed-loop observers have to share the same Lyapunov matrix X &gt; 0. However, since the matrix gains L i depend on i ∈ K, this condition is much less restrictive than quadratic stability. Unfortunately, in both continuous-and discrete-time cases, when the cost functional considered before is taken into account, the separation property does not hold anymore since the matrix inequalities couple all involved variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. PRACTICAL APPLICATION</head><p>This section discusses a practical application of the output feedback switching control design presented before. The problem consists of designing a switching control strategy for comfort-oriented semiactive suspensions in road vehicles, and is motivated by the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> where the so-called sky-hook (SH) approach is introduced and the recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where a new strategy, henceforth referred to as acceleration-driven damper (ADD) strategy, is proposed that improves on SH in certain frequency ranges of the road profile disturbance.

The coefficients M and m are the quarter-car body mass and the unsprung mass (tire, wheel, brake, etc.), respectively. The coefficients β, k, and k t are the bandwidth of the active shock absorber, the stiffness of the suspension spring, and the stiffness of the tire, respectively. The coefficients ∆ s and ∆ t are the length of the unloaded suspension spring and of the tire. Finally, c(t) and c in (t) are the actual and requested damping coefficients of the passive shock absorber. In order to simplify the computations, we assume that β is large enough so that c(t) ≈ c in (t). Moreover, we consider a genuine switching strategy, so that c(t) can assume only two values, namely c min and c max , to be specified later on.</p><p>The control strategy consists of minimizing the chassis vertical acceleration ξ(t) by a suitable choice of the control variable c(t) ∈ {c min , c max }.

By the way, the state feedback performance is quite close to that obtained by applying the theoretical optimal switching strategy corresponding to k t → ∞; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows the integral of the square of chassis acceleration against time. It can be seen that OF 1 is capable of lowering the acceleration in the transient better than the other methods.</p><p>In the second set of simulations, the road profile ξ r (t) has been generated as the double integral of a sample realization of  a white noise process with power χ 2 = 0.1. The performance of the seven algorithms given earlier, with the same values of the tuning parameters, has been measured as the power attenuation on the chassis acceleration, namely the ratio</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">Θ T = T 0 ξ(t) 2 dt T 0 ξr (t) 2 dt .</formula><p>This value, for T = 20 s, is reported in the second row of Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. The relative ranking of the proposed algorithms is in good agreement with the indices shown before, the only difference being the slight improvement of OF 2 with respect to OF 1 .</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows the behavior of the acceleration for the three methods OF 2 , SH, and ADD. The plot has been restricted to an interval of 2 s, in order to better represent the effects of the commutations in the three methods. The OF 2 strategy outperforms the other two algorithms at the price of faster switching commutation and shorter dwell intervals. Finally, the power attenuation Θ T as a function of T is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> to show the effectiveness of the proposed output feedback strategy.</p><p>Obviously, the choice of the design parameters (in particular Π) is still an open issue. As a reasonable guideline, one could exploit the performance bounds discussed in Sections III and IV. However, it must be stressed that the optimization of the upper bounds (46) or (64) with respect to Π does not ensure that the minimum of the real performance is attained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have developed a new method for analysis and control design for continuous-and discrete-time switched linear systems. As important contributions of the paper, it is worth mentioning: 1) the development of a new stability condition based on the so-called Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities, and although more stringent, a simpler to solve version using LMIs plus line search, 2) the definition of a quadratic cost based on a series of exogenous impulse-like perturbations and optimality characterization by means of lower and upper bounds calculations, the first one provided by a feasible solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman inequality and 3) the solution of the output feedback control problem based on the design of a switched linear filter or observer. The latter is possible when the associated performance cost is not taken into account. A kind of separation property between switched control design and switched filter design has been discussed.</p><p>However, in our opinion, some points deserve attention for further research. The first one is related to the development of an efficient numerical procedure to deal with Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities. In this framework, the fact that the nonconvexity is due to the product of scalars by symmetric positive definite matrices may be decisive. The second one, more appealing from the theoretical viewpoint, is on the development of a stability condition relaxing the assumption on the existence of a stable convex combination of the modes of the open-loop switched system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX I PROOF OF THEOREM 5</head><p>Consider symmetric matrices Pi ∈ R 2n × R 2n for all i ∈ K of the form (43), that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_101">Pi = X V V Xi , detV = 0 (87)</formula><p>and define the nonsingular matrices Ti ∈ R 2n × R 2n as</p><formula xml:id="formula_102">Ti = I n I n -X-1 i V 0<label>(88)</label></formula><p>for all i ∈ K. Therefore, there exist positive definite matrices Pi , i ∈ K satisfying the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities (45) if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">Si := T i   Ã i Pi + Pi Ãi + N j =1 π j i Pj + Qi   Ti &lt; 0 (89)</formula><p>for all i ∈ K. Introducing a new one-to-one set of variables, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_104">Z i := X -V X-1 i V (90) L i := V Bi (91) M i := V Âi V -1 (X -Z i ),<label>(92)</label></formula><p>each term of the matrix sum appearing in the left-hand side of inequality (89) can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_105">T i Pi Ãi Ti = Z i A i Z i A i XA i + L i C i -M i XA i + L i C i (93) T i   N j =1 π j i Pj   Ti = N j =1 π j i Z j 0 0 0 + N j =1 π j i (Z j -Z i )(X -Z j ) -1 (Z j -Z i ) 0 0 0<label>(94)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_106">T i Qi Ti = Q i Q i Q i Q i (<label>95</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_107">)</formula><p>where we have used the fact that, from (90), we have Xi = V (X -Z i ) -1 V and that Π ∈ M c . Using the Schur complement to (87), it is seen that Pi &gt; 0 if and only if X &gt; Z i &gt; 0, which indicates that Xi is well defined. Hence, defining</p><formula xml:id="formula_108">Y ij := Z j + (Z j -Z i )(X -Z j ) -1 (Z j -Z i ) for all i, j ∈ K × K, we obtain Si = S11 i • A i Z i + XA i + L i C i + Q i -M i S22 i (<label>96</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_109">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_110">S11 i = A i Z i + Z i A i + N j =1 π j i Y ij + Q i and S22 i = A i X + XA i + L i C i + C i L i + Q i .</formula><p>Let us assume that inequalities (47)-(49) are satisfied. Since the LMIs (49) imply that X &gt; Z j &gt; 0 for all j ∈ K, selecting any nonsingular matrix V ∈ R n ×n and setting Xi = V (X -Z i ) -1 V , we get Pi &gt; 0 for all i ∈ K. In addition, applying the Schur complement to (49), it is immediately verified that N j =1 π j i R ij &gt; N j =1 π j i Y ij so that the first block diagonal element of Si is negative definite as a consequence of (47). Due to (48), the second block diagonal element of matrix Si is also negative. Consequently, imposing M i = A i Z i + XA i + L i C i + Q i , we conclude that Si &lt; 0. Hence, determining the switched filter matrices Bi and Âi from (91) and (92), the augmented Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities (45) hold.</p><p>Vice versa, assume that the inequalities (47) hold for some positive definite matrix Pi of the form (43) and matrices Bi , Âi of the switched filter. Adopting the change of variables introduced in (90)-(92), it is immediately verified that Si &lt; 0 for all i ∈ K. As a consequence, the LMIs (48) are verified. On the other hand, letting R ii = Y ii -I n for i ∈ K and R ij = Y ij + I n for i = j ∈ K × K with &gt; 0 small enough, the LMIs (49) are verified and inequalities (47) hold due to the fact that the first block diagonal element of Si is negative definite.</p><p>To conclude the proof, notice that the stabilizing property of the output feedback switching rule (50) is a consequence of Theorem 3 and the determination of matrices Xi for all i ∈ K, as indicated before. Once again, from Theorem 3, the cost associated with this control policy is such that J(u) &lt; min i∈K Tr( B Pi B ) that can be rewritten as J(u) &lt; min i∈K Tr(W i ) with an additional matrix variable W i satisfying W i &gt; B Pi B for all i ∈ K. Using the Schur complement, the equivalent inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_111">W i B Pi Ti • T i Pi Ti &gt; 0<label>(97)</label></formula><p>for all i ∈ K provide (51). This concludes the proof of the proposed theorem. </p><formula xml:id="formula_112">Z i := X -V X-1 i V (<label>99</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_113">)</formula><p>L i := V Bi (100)</p><formula xml:id="formula_114">G i := -V Âi V -1 (X -Z i ) + V Bi C i (<label>101</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_115">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_116">M i := G i + (X -Z i )A i (<label>102</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_117">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_118">N i := V Bi C i + (X -Z i )A i (<label>103</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_119">)</formula><p>after a simple but tedious algebraic manipulations, the following matrix factorizations are obtained:</p><formula xml:id="formula_120">T i Ã i Pi Ãi Ti = I I A i Z i A i I I + M i N i (X -Z i ) -1 M i N i (<label>104</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_121">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_122">T i Qi Ti = Q i Q i Q i Q i (<label>105</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_123">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_124">T i Pi Ti = Z i Z i Z i X . (<label>106</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_125">)</formula><p>The importance of the transformation matrices Ti valid for each i ∈ K, introduced before is apparent since, as indicated in (106), the product T i Pi Ti is linearized and the same occurs for all products Ã i T i Pj Ãi Ti with j = i ∈ K × K that can naturally be expressed in terms of LMIs. Indeed, first noticing that</p><formula xml:id="formula_126">T i Ã i Pj Ãi Ti = T i Ã i ( Pj -Pi ) Ãi Ti + T i Ã i Pi Ãi Ti (107) it follows that T i Ã i ( Pj -Pi ) Ãi Ti = G i V -1 C i B i ( Xj -Xi ) G i V -1 C i B i . (<label>108</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_127">)</formula><p>Finally, putting all together, we are in a position to write inequality (98) in the equivalent form</p><formula xml:id="formula_128">Z i Z i Z i X &gt; F i J i • R i + + G i C i L i   N j =1 π j i (X -Z j ) -1   G i C i L i (<label>109</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_129">)</formula><p>where F i , J i , and R i are the affine matrix valued functions given in (65)-(67). As the reader can verify, the inequality (109) can be expressed as an LMI with respect to all involved variables but the elements of the Metzler matrix Π ∈ M d . Indeed, due to the fact that π j i ≥ 0 for all i, j ∈ K × K, the Schur complement converts it into a high-dimension matrix inequality. Theorem 6 is expressed in terms of an equivalent reduced-order matrix inequality (linear with respect to all variables but Π ∈ M d ).</p><p>Assume first that inequalities (68)-(69) are satisfied. Applying the Schur complement to inequality (69), multiplying the result by π j i ≥ 0, summing up for all j ∈ K, and remembering that N j =1 π j i = 1 for all i ∈ K, it is seen that </p><formula xml:id="formula_130"> N j =1 π j i (X -Z j ) -1   -1 &gt; H i   N j =1 π j i R ij   -1 H i &gt; H i + H i - - N j =1 π j i R ij (<label>110</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_131">)</formula><p>holds for all i ∈ K. Hence, inequality (68) remains true if its last block diagonal element is replaced by the quantity on the left-hand side of (110) from which the Schur complement with respect to the last row and column yields (109). Since the LMIs (69) imply that X &gt; Z j &gt; 0 for all j ∈ K, selecting any nonsingular matrix V ∈ R n ×n and setting Xi = V (X -Z i ) -1 V , we get Pi &gt; 0 for all i ∈ K. Furthermore, by letting the filter matrices to be given by ( <ref type="formula">72</ref>) and (73), we have Si &lt; 0 for all i ∈ K. Hence, the augmented Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities (63) hold.</p><p>Vice versa, assume that inequalities (63) hold for some Âi , Bi , and Pi as in (87). Then, apply the state-space transformation (88) and consider the expressions (99)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_118">103</ref>) to obtain the inequalities (109). In conclusion, by letting</p><formula xml:id="formula_132">H i =   N j =1 π j i (X -Z j ) -1   -1 (111) R ij = H i (X -Z j ) -1 H i + I (112)</formula><p>for some &gt; 0 sufficiently small, we have This concludes the proof of the proposed theorem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

The results follow the same pattern of each mentioned theorem and corollary, thus being omitted. Example 2: Consider a continuous-time switched linear system (36)-(38) defined by matrices A 1 , A 2 , Q 1 , Q 2 , and B given in Example 1, w(t) = 0, and initial condition x(0) = B[1 0] .

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head>1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>) is identical to (36)-(38). The output feedback stabilization problem has been solved by taking the following set of parameters: M = 400 kg, m = 50 kg, k = 2.0 × 10 4 N/m, k t = 2.5 × 10 5 N/m, c min = 3.0 × 10 2 (N • s)/m, and c max = 3.9 × 10 3 (N • s)/m. For these parameters, the two matrices A 1 and A 2 are both stable (although with poorly damped oscillating modes); hence, our main scope here is to improve the transient dynamical behavior of the system by minimizing the vertical acceleration of the chassis. Two sets of simulations have been carried out. The first set refers to the response of ξ(t) to a unit impulse on the road acceleration ξr (t). The first row of Table I reports the integral of the squared chassis acceleration obtained with different control strategies. The symbols in the table have the following meaning. 1) OF 1 : Output feedback switching control of Section IV-A designed with the output matrices of (81). 2) OF 2 : Output feedback switching control of Section IV-A designed with the output matrices of (82)-(83). 3) SF: State feedback switching control. 4) SH: Two-state sky-hook strategy. 5) ADD: Acceleration-driven damper strategy with sampling period δ T = 10 -3 s. 6) PS 1 : Passive suspension with fixed damping coefficient equal to c min . 7) PS 2 : Passive suspension with fixed damping coefficient equal to c max . The designs OF 1 and OF 2 depend on the tuning parameters r 1 , r 2 , and Π, which have been optimized after a limited number of trials. The resulting tuning parameters in OF 1 are r</figDesc></figure>
