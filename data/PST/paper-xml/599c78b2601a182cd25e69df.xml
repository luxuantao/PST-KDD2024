<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Safety critical systems involve the tight coupling between potentially conflicting control objectives and safety constraints. As a means of creating a formal framework for controlling systems of this form, and with a view toward automotive applications, this paper develops a methodology that allows safety conditions-expressed as control barrier functionsto be unified with performance objectives-expressed as control Lyapunov functions-in the context of real-time optimizationbased controllers. Safety conditions are specified in terms of forward invariance of a set, and are verified via two novel generalizations of barrier functions; in each case, the existence of a barrier function satisfying Lyapunov-like conditions implies forward invariance of the set, and the relationship between these two classes of barrier functions is characterized. In addition, each of these formulations yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), providing inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). The mediation of safety and performance through a QP is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, two automotive control problems that present both safety and performance considerations coupled with actuator bounds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Cyber-physical systems have at their core tight coupling between computation, control and physical behavior. One of the difficulties in designing cyber-physical systems is the need to meet a large and diverse set of objectives by properly designing controllers. While it is tempting to decompose the problem into the design of a controller for each individual objective and then integrate the resulting controllers via software, the integration problem is far from being a simple one. Examples abound in, e.g., robotic and automotive systems, of unexpected and unintended interactions between controllers resulting in catastrophic behavior. In this paper we address a specific instance of this problem: how to synthesize a controller enforcing the different, and occasionally conflicting, objectives of safety and performance/stability. The overarching objective of this paper is to develop a methodology to design controllers enforcing safety objectives expressed in terms of invariance of a given set, and performance/stability objectives, expressed as the asymptotic stabilization of another given set.</p><p>Motivated by the use of Lyapunov functions to certify stability properties of a set without calculating the exact solution of a system, the underlying concept in this paper is to use barrier functions to certify forward invariance of a set, while avoiding the difficult task of computing the system's reachable set. Prior work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> incorporates into a single feedback law the conditions required to simultaneously achieve asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point, while avoiding an unsafe set. Importantly, if the stabilization and safety objectives are in conflict, then no feedback law can be proposed. In contrast, the approach developed here will pose a feedback design problem that mediates the safety and stabilization requirements, in the sense that safety is always guaranteed, and progress toward the stabilization objective is assured when the two requirements "are not in conflict" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The essential differences in these approaches will be highlighted through a realistic example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Background</head><p>Barrier functions were first utilized in optimization; see Chapter 3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for an historical account of their use in optimization. More recently, barrier functions were used in the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to develop an interior penalty method for converting constrained optimal control methods into unconstrained ones <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Barrier functions are now common throughout the control and verification literature due to their natural relationship with Lyapunov-like functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, their ability to establish safety, avoidance, or eventuality properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and their relationship to multi-objective control <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Two notions of a barrier function associated with a set C are commonly utilized: one that is unbounded on the set boundary, i.e., B(x) → ∞ as x → ∂C, termed a reciprocal barrier function here, and one that vanishes on the set boundary, h(x) → 0 as x → ∂C, called a zeroing barrier function here. In each case, if B or h satisfy Lyapunov-like conditions, then forward invariance of C is guaranteed. The natural extension of a barrier function to a system with control inputs is a Control Barrier Function (CBF), first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In many ways, CBFs parallel the extension of Lyapunov functions to Control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), as pioneered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and studied in depth in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In each case, the key point is to impose inequality constraints on the derivative of a candidate CBF (resp., CLF) to establish entire classes of controllers that render a given set forward invariant (resp., stable).</p><p>The Lyapunov-like conditions that define a (control) barrier function are intrinsically coupled to the class of controllers that achieve forward invariance of a set C. As emphasized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, it is therefore essential to consider how one defines the evolution of a barrier function away from the set boundary, as this will translate directly to conditions imposed on a CBF. In the case of reciprocal barrier functions, existing formulations impose invariant level sets of B <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, via, Ḃ ≤ 0, as was done in earlier work on zeroing barrier functions (or barrier certificates) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> via ḣ ≥ 0; yet, in both cases, these conditions are too restrictive on the interior of C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contributions</head><p>The first contribution of this paper is to formulate conditions on the derivative of a (reciprocal or zeroing) barrier function that are minimally restrictive on the interior of C. These conditions will be formulated with an eye toward their extension to control barrier functions. It is clear that less restrictive conditions for a barrier function will translate into a control barrier function that admits a larger set of inputs compatible with controlled invariance; this will be important when integrating performance with safety later in the paper. Less obvious considerations include robustness of a controlled invariant set to model perturbations, Lipschitz continuity of feedbacks achieving controlled invariance, and, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for barrier certificates, convexity of the set of control barrier functions when computing them numerically.</p><p>For reciprocal barrier functions, we allow for B to grow when it is far away from the boundary of C in that we only require that Ḃ ≤ α(1/B), for a class-K function α. In the case of zeroing barrier functions, we adopt a condition of the form ḣ ≥ -α(h). The latter condition may be somewhat surprising in view of the well-known Nagumo's Theorem, which states that for a system without inputs and a C 1 function h, the condition ḣ ≥ 0 on ∂C is necessary and sufficient for the zero superlevel set to be invariant. Importantly, under mild conditions on C, it is demonstrated that the conditions we propose are also necessary and sufficient for forward invariance, and result in the relationships shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Moreover, it is shown how our conditions lead to Lipschitz continuity of control laws, robustness, and convexity of the class of control barrier functions.</p><p>Safety-critical control problems often include performance objectives, such as stabilization to a point or a surface, in addition to safety constraints. An important novelty of the present paper is that a Quadratic Program (QP) is used to "mediate" these (potentially conflicting) specifications: stability and safety. The motivation for this solution comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which developed CLFs to exponentially stabilize periodic orbits in a class of hybrid systems. The experimental Theorem 1: Propositions 1 and 3: realization of CLF inspired controllers on a bipedal robot resulted in the observation that, since CLF conditions are affine in torque, they can be formulated as QPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Moreover, this perspective allows for the consideration of multiple control objectives (expressed via multiple CLFs) together with forceand torque-based constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The present paper extends these ideas by unifying CBFs and CLFs through QPs.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(Assume C is compact) Int(C) is invariant C is invariant RBF ZBF Theorem 2:</formula><p>In particular, given a control objective (expressed through a CLF) and an admissible set in the state space (expressed via a CBF), we formulate a QP that mediates the tradeoff of achieving a stabilization objective subject to ensuring the system remains in a safe set. In particular, relaxation is used to make the stability objective a soft constraint on the QP, while safety is maintained as a hard constraint. In this way, safety and stability do not need to be simultaneously satisfiable, and continuity of the resulting control law is provably maintained. An alternative approach to controlled invariance has been developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> under the name of invariance control. This elegant body of work is based on an extension of Nagumo's condition to functions h of higher relative degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, namely, it focuses on derivative conditions on the boundary of the controlled-invariant set. As a consequence, the control law is discontinuous, such as in sliding mode control, and as in sliding mode control, chattering may occur. We, however, establish a control framework that yields checkable conditions for Lipschitz continuous control laws and well-defined solutions of the closed-loop system. This is important from a theoretical point of view as well as the practical benefit of avoiding chattering. The consideration of the existence of solutions to the closed-loop system is one of the important differences between barrier certificates for dynamical systems and control barrier functions for control systems.</p><p>The CBF-CLF-based QPs are illustrated on two automotive safety/convenience problems; namely, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping (LK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. ACC is being developed and deployed on passenger vehicles due to its promise to enhance driver convenience, safety, traffic flow, and fuel economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. It is a multifaceted control problem because it involves asymptotic performance objectives (drive at a desired speed), subject to safety constraints (maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you), and constraints based on the physical characteristics of the car and road surface (bounded acceleration and deceleration). A key challenge is that the various objectives can often be in conflict, such as when the desired cruising speed is faster than the speed of the leading car, while provably satisfying the safety-oriented constraints is of paramount importance. Lane keeping, maintaining a vehicle between the lane markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, is another safety-related problem that we use to illustrate the methods developed in this paper.</p><p>A preliminary version of this work was presented in the conference publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The present paper adds to those two papers in the following important ways: the relations between the two forms of barrier functions are characterized; barriers with a higher relative degree are considered; the adaptive cruise control problem is extended from the lead vehicle's speed being constant to the more realistic case of varying speed with bounded input force; and the lane keeping problem is considered under the proposed QP framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RECIPROCAL AND ZEROING BARRIER FUNCTIONS</head><p>This section studies two notions of barrier functions and investigates their relationships with forward invariance of a set. Consider a nonlinear system of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ẋ = f (x)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x ∈ R n and f is assumed to be locally Lipschitz. Then for any initial condition x 0 := x(t 0 ) ∈ R n , there exists a maximum time interval I(x 0 ) = [t 0 , τ max ) such that x(t) is the unique solution to (1) on I(x 0 ); in the case when f is forward complete, τ max = ∞. A set S is called (forward) invariant with respect to (1) if for every x 0 ∈ S, x(t) ∈ S for all t ∈ I(x 0 ).</p><p>A. Reciprocal Barrier Functions 1) Motivation: Given a closed set C ⊂ R n , we determine conditions on functions B : Int(C) → R such that Int(C) is forward invariant. These conditions will motivate the formulation of the barrier functions considered in this paper.</p><p>Assume that the set C is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C = {x ∈ R n : h(x) ≥ 0},<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">∂C = {x ∈ R n : h(x) = 0},<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">Int(C) = {x ∈ R n : h(x) &gt; 0},<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where h : R n → R is a continuously differentiable function.</p><p>Later, it will also be assumed that C is nonempty and has no isolated point, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Int(C) = ∅ and Int(C) = C.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Motivated by the barrier method in optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, consider the logarithmic barrier function candidate</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">B(x) = -log h(x) 1 + h(x) .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Note that this function satisfies the important properties</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">inf x∈Int(C) B(x) ≥ 0, lim x→∂C B(x) = ∞.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The question then becomes: what conditions should be imposed on Ḃ so that Int(C) is forward invariant? The conventional answer in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> has been to enforce the condition Ḃ ≤ 0, but this may not be desirable since it requires all sublevel sets of C to be invariant; in particular, it will not allow a solution to leave a sublevel set even if by doing so it will remain in Int(C). A condition analogous to this was relaxed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> where the key idea was to only require a single sublevel set to be invariant. Motivated by this, we relax the condition Ḃ ≤ 0 to</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Ḃ ≤ γ B ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where γ is positive. This inequality allows for Ḃ to grow when solutions are far from the boundary of C. As solutions approach the boundary, the rate of growth decreases to zero. For <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> to be an acceptable condition, we need to verify that its satisfaction guarantees that solutions to (1) stay in Int(C).</p><p>To see this, we note that differentiating (6) along solutions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Ḃ = - ḣ h + h 2 .</formula><p>Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> implies that the rate of change in h with respect to t is bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ḣ ≥ γ(h + h 2 ) log h 1+h .</formula><p>Assuming for the moment that solutions x(t, x 0 ) of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>) are forward complete, the Comparison Lemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> implies that h(x(t, x 0 )) ≥ 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">-1 + exp 2γt + log 2 h(x0)+1 h(x0)</formula><p>.</p><p>Therefore, if h(x 0 ) &gt; 0, i.e., x 0 ∈ Int(C), then condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> guarantees that h(x(t, x 0 )) &gt; 0 for all t ≥ 0, i.e., x(t, x 0 ) ∈ Int(C) for all t ≥ 0.</p><p>Apart from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, another barrier function that is commonly considered in optimization is the inverse-type barrier candidate</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">B(x) = 1 h(x) .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Note that B(x) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>) also satisfies the properties in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. If condition (8) holds, then by the Comparison Lemma, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">h(x(t, x 0 )) ≥ 1 2γt + 1 h 2 (x0)</formula><p>, and once again, x(t, x 0 ) ∈ Int(C) for all t ≥ 0, provided that x 0 ∈ Int(C).</p><p>2) Reciprocal Barrier Functions and Set Invariance: Based on the presented motivation, we formulate a notion of barrier function that provides the same guarantees in a more general context. Definition 1. For the dynamical system (1), a continuously differentiable function B : Int(C) → R is a reciprocal barrier function (RBF) for the set C defined by (2)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>) for a continuously differentiable function h : R n → R, if there exist class K functions α 1 , α 2 , α 3 such that, for all x ∈ Int(C),</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">1 α 1 (h(x)) ≤ B(x) ≤ 1 α 2 (h(x)) ,<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">L f B(x) ≤ α 3 (h(x)).<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Remark 1. The Lyapunov-like bounds (10) on B imply that along solutions of (1), B essentially behaves like 1 α(h) for some class K function α with</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">inf x∈Int(C) 1 α(h(x)) ≥ 0, lim x→∂C 1 α(h(x)) = ∞.</formula><p>The condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> on Ḃ = L f B, which generalizes condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, allows for B to grow quickly when solutions are far away from ∂C, with the growth rate approaching zero as solutions approach ∂C.</p><p>Remark 2. In the conference version <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a function satisfying Def. 1 was simply called a barrier function and not a reciprocal barrier function. The new terminology is necessary to make the distinction with a second type of barrier function used in the next subsection.</p><p>Theorem 1. Given a set C ⊂ R n defined by (2)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>) for a continuously differentiable function h, if there exists a RBF</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">B : Int(C) → R, then Int(C) is forward invariant.</formula><p>The following lemma is established to prove Theorem 1.</p><p>Lemma 1. Consider the dynamical system</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">ẏ = α 1 y , y(t 0 ) = y 0 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>with α a class K function. For every y 0 ∈ (0, ∞), the system has a unique solution defined for all t ≥ t 0 and given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">y(t) = 1 σ 1 y0 , t -t 0 , (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where σ is a class KL function.</p><p>Proof. Under the change of variables z = 1 y , the dynamical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ż = - ẏ y 2 = - α 1 y y 2 = -α(z)z 2 := -ᾱ(z). (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">) Since α(z) is a class K function, it follows that ᾱ(z) = α(z)z 2 is a class K function.</formula><p>The fact that ᾱ(z) is a continuous, nonincreasing function for all z ≥ 0 implies that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">14</ref>) has a unique solution for every initial state z 0 &gt; 0; see Peano's Uniqueness Theorem (Thm. 1.3.1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, Thm. 6.2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>). Furthermore, by the proof of Lemma 4.4 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, it follows that the solution is defined on [t 0 , ∞) and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">z(t) = σ(z 0 , t -t 0 ),</formula><p>with σ a class KL function. Converting from z back to y through y = 1 z yields the solution y(t) given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p><p>We now have the necessary framework in which to prove Theorem 1.</p><p>Proof. (of Theorem 1) Utilizing ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">11</ref>), we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Ḃ ≤ α 3 • α -1 2 1 B := α 1 B . (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">)</formula><p>Since the inverse of a class K function is a class K function, and the composition of class K functions is a class K function,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">α = α 3 • α -1</formula><p>2 is a class K function. Let x(t) be a solution of (1) with x 0 ∈ Int(C), and let B(t) = B(x(t)). The next step is to apply the Comparison Lemma to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> so that B(t) is upper bounded by the solution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. To do so, it must be noted that the hypothesis "f (t, u) is locally Lipschitz in u" used in the proof of Lemma 3.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, can be replaced by with the hypothesis "f (t, u) is continuous, non-increasing in u".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Adaptive Cruise Control Via QPs</head><p>A vehicle equipped with ACC seeks to converge to and maintain a fixed cruising speed, as with a common cruise control system. Converging to and maintaining fixed speed is naturally expressed as asymptotic stabilization of a set. With ACC, the vehicle must in addition guarantee a safety condition, namely, when a slower moving vehicle is encountered, the controller must automatically reduce vehicle speed to maintain a guaranteed lower bound on time headway or following distance, where the distance to the leading vehicle is determined with an onboard radar. When the leading car speeds up or leaves the lane, and there is no longer a conflict between safety and desired cruising speed, the adaptive cruise controller automatically increases vehicle speed. The timeheadway safety condition is naturally expressible as a control barrier function. Because relaxation is used to make the stability objective a soft constraint in the QP, while safety is maintained as a hard constraint, safety and stability do not need to be simultaneously satisfiable. In contrast, the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for combining CBFs and CLFs is only applicable when the two objectives can be simultaneously met. Simulations in Sect. VI will illustrate how the QP-based solution to ACC automatically adjusts vehicle speed under various traffic conditions.</p><p>1) ACC problem setup: We begin by setting up the dynamics of the problem based upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which assume that the lead and following vehicles are modeled as pointmasses moving in a straight line. The following vehicle is the one equipped with ACC while the lead vehicle acts as a disturbance to the following vehicle's objective of cruising at a given constant speed.</p><p>The dynamics of the system can be compactly expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">ẋ =   -F r /M a L x 2 -x 1   f (x) +   1/M 0 0   g(x)</formula><p>u.</p><p>Here, x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) := (v f , v l , D) where v f and v l are the velocity of the following and leading vehicle (in m/s), respectively, D is the distance between the two vehicles (in m); M is the mass of the following vehicle (in kg); F r (x) =</p><formula xml:id="formula_93">f 0 +f 1 v f +f 2 v 2</formula><p>f is the aerodynamic drag (in N) with constants f 0 , f 1 and f 2 determined empirically; a L ∈ [-a l g, a l g] is the overall acceleration/deceleration of the lead vehicle (in m/s 2 ) with a l , a l fractions of the gravitational constant g for deceleration and acceleration, respectively; u ∈ U ⊂ R, the control input of the following car, is wheel force (in N). Initially, we will suppose that the control input is unbounded, that is, U = R, and later, we address realistic bounds on wheel force.</p><p>Given the model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_92">43</ref>), we next present two constraints that are necessary in the context of ACC.</p><p>Soft Constraints.

These represent constraints that must not be violated under any condition. For ACC, this is simply the constraint: "keep a safe distance from the car in front of you".</p><p>There are numerous formulations of this concept including Time Headway and Time to Collision <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. In the context of this paper, to start with a simple formulation, we express this constraint as</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">Safety : D/v f ≥ τ d ,<label>(HC)</label></formula><p>where τ d is the desired time headway. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref>The constraint (HC) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_98">D -τ d v f ≥ 0,<label>(44)</label></formula><p>for the dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.

Simulation results obtained by applying the (ACC QP) controller are developed in Section VI. A sneak preview is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> to highlight a few properties of the designed controller and to motivate an important refinement.</p><p>The desired cruising speed v d is set to 79.2 (km/h), which is 22 (m/s). The system ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_92">43</ref>) is initialized at (v f (0), v l (0), D(0)) = (18, 10, 150). The left plot in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the desired cruising speed as a thick dashed line and the speeds of the lead and controlled vehicles as thin lines. The controlled vehicle achieves the desired cruising speed when it does not conflict with the time-headway constraint, and it settles to the speed of the lead car when required to maintain a safe following distance. The forward invariance of the safe set, defined by the hard constraint (HC) encoding the desired time headway τ d , is shown in the right plot of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The middle plot shows typical "comfort" limits on acceleration that should be respected by the controlled vehicle, which are violated because no constraint has been imposed on the wheel force that can be requested by the QP when the car accelerates and brakes. This motivates the development of a refined barrier function that is compatible with bounds on the two vehicles' inputs.</p><p>3) Force Constraints and CBFs: The QP formulated in subsection V-A2 generates a control input u ∈ R for the ACCcontrolled vehicle. In practice, however, the wheel force that can be generated by the car is constrained by physical limits (e.g., the maximal engine torque for acceleration, maximal braking capability, and road conditions). This requires the admissible set U to be bounded. Furthermore, to guarantee driver comfort, the wheel forces the controller is allowed to apply are typically much less than the maximal forces that can be generated by the vehicle.</p><p>Force Constraints. We now constrain the allowable wheel forces. Supposing that we do not want to accelerate or decelerate more than some fraction of g, the gravitational constant, we can write the constraints on acceleration and deceleration as inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_107">u ≤ a f M g, -u ≤ a f M g. (FC)</formula><p>where a f and a f are the fractions of g for deceleration and acceleration, respectively. That is, the input set is now:</p><formula xml:id="formula_108">U acc := [-a f M g, a f M g].</formula><p>Since it may be the case that these constraints will conflict with the torque values needed to satisfy the hard constraint (HC), we require a force-based barrier function allowing the hard constraints and force constraints to be simultaneously satisfied. In particular, we seek a function h F (x) such that for all x ∈ C F , where C F = {x |h F (x) ≥ 0}, there exists a trajectory of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_92">43</ref>) satisfying (HC) and the maximum braking limit (FC). That is to say, within the set C F , the ACC-equipped car can always brake to maintain a desired headway using an allowed amount of deceleration.</p><p>Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, an extended version of this paper, develops two CBFs<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> , h c F and h o F , that can be used to define the safe set C F . The function h c F has a much simpler form<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> than h o F , but makes a more conservative approximation of the safe set than h o F . When rolling resistance is ignored in the model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_92">43</ref>), h o F provides the maximal safe set compatible with <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> and the force bounds (FC), and will therefore be referred to as "optimal".

Lane Keeping Via QPs</head><p>In this subsection, we consider the Lane Keeping (LK) problem using a CBF-based QP, which aims to keep the vehicle "centered" in a possibly curved lane. We focus on the lateral movement of the vehicle by assuming that the vehicle has a constant longitudinal speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>1) Lane Keeping Problem Setup: Under the assumptions of constant longitudinal speed and a linear tire-force model, a two-state handling model can be augmented to the four-state lateral-yaw model given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. In the model, the state is x := (y, ν, ψ, r), where y and ψ are the lateral displacement and the error yaw angle in road fixed coordinates, respectively, ν is the lateral velocity, and r is the yaw rate (rotation rate about the vertical axis). The input u is the steering angle of the front tires, and the disturbance is the desired yaw rate r d , which can be calculated from the curvature of the road by</p><formula xml:id="formula_114">r d = v0</formula><p>R , where v 0 is a constant value for the longitudinal velocity and R is the road radius of curvature. Additionally, M is the total mass of the car, I z is the moment of inertia about the center of mass, a and b are the distance from the center of mass to the front and rear tires, respectively, and C r and C f are tire (stiffness) parameters.</p><p>The objective of the LK problem is to provide a steering input that keeps the car "centered" in the lane. Particularly, the car should satisfy the following hard control objective and the acceleration constraint.</p><p>Hard Constraint. This constraint requires the displacement of the vehicle from the center of the lane to be less than a given constant y max : |y| ≤ y max .</p><p>(LK-HC)</p><p>Since the width of US lanes is 12 feet and typical width of a car is 6 feet, we can take y max to be 3 feet, which is approximately 0.9 meters. Therefore, the hard constraint is |y| ≤ 0.9.</p><p>Acceleration Constraint. Due to the force limit of the car and for the comfort of the driver, the lateral acceleration needs to be bounded. We express this constraint as |ÿ| ≤ a max .</p><p>(LK-FC)</p><p>2) Encoding LK Constraints: The hard and acceleration constraints can be encoded formally as follows.</p><p>Encoding Acceleration Constraint. Since</p><formula xml:id="formula_115">M ÿ : = C f (u - ν + ar v 0 ) -C r ν -br v 0 -M v 0 r d ,<label>(52)</label></formula><p>the acceleration constraint (LK-FC) is equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_116">u ∈ U lk : = 1 C f (-M a max + F 0 ), 1 C f (M a max + F 0 )</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_117">F 0 = C f ν+ar v0 + C r ν-br v0 + M v 0 r d .</formula><p>Encoding Hard Constraint. Suppose that at time 0, the lateral displacement is y(0) and the lateral velocity is ẏ(0). Under the maximal allowable acceleration, it takes time T for the lateral speed to be reduced to zero, where T = | ẏ(0)| amax . Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_118">y(T ) = y(0) + T ẏ(0) - sgn( ẏ(0)) 2 T 2 a max = y(0) + 1 2 | ẏ(0)| a max ẏ(0).</formula><p>Motivated by the above formula, define</p><formula xml:id="formula_119">h F (x) = (y max -sgn( ẏ) y) - 1 2 ẏ2 a max<label>(53)</label></formula><p>and C F := {x|h F (x) ≥ 0}. Then, for every x ∈ C F , the controlled vehicle can remain in C F while keeping the acceleration within the allowable set (LK-FC). Indeed, differentiating <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref> for ẏ = 0 yields ḣF (x, u) =sgn( ẏ) + ÿ a max ẏ.</p><p>It follows that if ẏ &gt; 0, then ḣF (x, u) ≥ 0 when u = 1 C f (-M a max + F 0 ), and if ẏ &lt; 0, then ḣF (x, u) ≥ 0 when u = 1 C f (M a max + F 0 ). Finally, from (53), the limit of ḣF as ẏ tends to zero is well defined and equals zero.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparison of two QPs</head><p>Recall that Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> showed simulation results obtained by applying the QP controller in (ACC QP), where the force constraints were not taken into account. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> show simulation results for (ACC-QP2), where the force constraints are included.</p><p>Specifically, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> compares (ACC QP) with (ACC-QP2) using the optimal RCBF B o F and the conservative RCBF B c F . Note that, due to limits on the wheel forces, the speed converges to v d more slowly, and begins braking earlier, as evidenced by the top plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Since RCBF B o F is less conservative than B c F , the car maintains a smaller following distance, but the specified time-headway constraint is always satisfied, as indicated by the bottom plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Moreover, when using a force-based RCBF <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>, the force constraints are satisfied for all time, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Ultimately, the QP based controller (ACC-QP2) is able to satisfy all of the control objectives and constraints for the ACC problem outlined in Sect. V-A4 through a unified control methodology.</p><p>Remark 14. The conference paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> implements the above QP-based controllers in a real-time embedded processor on scaled cars. A video of the results is available on YouTube <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Comparison of RCBFs and ZCBFs</head><p>We also consider the ZCBFs for our ACC problem, which are associated with functions h o F and h c F given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. As expected, when using the controller from the QP (ACC-QP2) with ZCBFs, all constraints are satisfied just as with the RCBFs. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows a comparison of the generated vehicle acceleration using both types of CBFs, for both optimal and conservative cases. Our limited experience is that the ZCBFs generate a smoother input trajectory (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), while satisfying the force constraints. We suspect that this is due to the local Lipschitz constant of a RCBF potentially becoming arbitrarily large near the boundary of the safe set. </p></div>

LK simulation</head><p>The feedback gain K was determined by solving an LQR problem with control weight R = 600 and state weight   Simulation results for lane keeping are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The road is assumed to be curved and the longitudinal speed of the vehicle is a constant. We can see that the absolute value of the lateral displacement is always bounded by 0.9m, and the lateral acceleration is always bounded by 0.3g. Therefore, the displacement and acceleration constraints are both satisfied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper presented a novel framework for the control of safety-critical systems through the unification of safety conditions (expressed as control barrier functions) with control objectives (expressed as control Lyapunov functions). At the core of this methodology was the introduction of two new classes of barrier functions: reciprocal and zeroing. The interplay between these classes of functions was characterized, and it was shown that they provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the forward invariance of a set C under reasonable assumptions. Therefore, in the context of (affine) control systems, this naturally yields control barrier functions (CBFs) with a large set of available control inputs that yield forward invariance of a set C. Importantly, CBFs are expressed as affine inequality constraints in the control input that-when satisfied pointwise in the candidate safe set-imply forward invariance of the set, and hence safety. Utilizing control Lyapunov function (CLFs) to represent control objectives-which again result in affine inequality constraints in the control inputsafety constraints and performance objectives were naturally unified in the framework of quadratic program (QP) based controllers. Furthermore, continuity of the resulting controllers was formally established by strictly enforcing the safety constraint and relaxing the control objective. The mediation of safety and performance was illustrated through the application to automotive systems in the context of adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane keeping (LK).</p><p>Future work will be devoted to building upon the foundations presented in this paper in the context of safety-critical control of cyber-physical systems, with a special focus on robotic and automotive systems. At a formal level, this paper developed "force-based" barrier functions for the specific problems considered (ACC and LK), leaving as an open problem how to do characterize and compute such functions for general classes of control systems. In addition, formulating how to unify safety constraints, e.g., combining ACC and LK constraints into a single framework, has the potential to suggest methods for composing safety specifications. Going beyond automotive systems, the presented methodologies are naturally applicable to robotic systems, e.g., in the context of self-collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, end-effector (and foot) placement, and a myriad of other safety constraints. Exploring these applications promises to provide a formal framework for safety-critical operation of robotic systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
