<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since Boolean networks (BNs) were first applied to model and describe genetic regulatory networks in 1969 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, much attention has been drawn to the study and applications of BNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The dynamics of this kind of models are much simpler and more effective to express the genetic variables, which are quantified as "1" and "0" to stand for expressed and unexpressed states, respectively. Unfortunately, there were no systematic and effective tools that analyze and synthesize this kind of models until the semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices was proposed by Cheng and his colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Based on the new algebraic method, a multitude of interesting problems for BNs, such as controllability and observability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, fixed points and limit cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, stability and stabilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, optimal control <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, have been extensively addressed.</p><p>It should be noted that each gene of a genetic regulatory network may be updated according to one of several possible rules at each discrete time. A quintessential example is the bacteriophage λ, which has two different behaviors, lysis and lysogeny. Additionally, an asynchronous BN can be redescribed as a group of BNs, in which just one BN is active at each time <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. These can be regarded as the switching phenomenon in BNs. The reachability, controllability and stability have been well studied for deterministic switching BNs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. When the switching signal between two different constituent BNs is regulated by a probability structure, probabilistic BNs may have advantage to model rule-based properties and tackle existing uncertainties. Many interesting problems, including stability analysis, have been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Since genetic regulatory networks are structured by networks of regulatory interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins in the expression of other genes, a series of molecular processes are always involved in cells subject to some intrinsic fluctuations and extrinsic perturbations so that gene expression is considered as a stochastic process. Markov chains have been widely used to model gene networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In fact, probabilistic BNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> can be regarded as a special class of Markov Min Meng, Lu Liu and Gang Feng are with the Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. (e-mail: mengminmath@gmail.com; luliu45@cityu.edu.hk; megfeng@cityu.edu.hk).</p><p>The work described in this paper was supported by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China under Project CityU/11209514. chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Besides, in complex multicellular organisms, the rules of updates at each step of a particular gene may be quite different and it has been observed that transitions between states in a gene network occur randomly. A concrete example is the genetic toggle switch in a simple genetic circuit, where two proteins negatively regulate the synthesis of each other. With spontaneous transitions, the updates of the two proteins can be described by stochastic processes. BNs with Markovian jump parameters, or equivalently Markovian switching BNs, are thus suitable to model some gene expression with stochastic switching factors. This kind of BNs can be considered as an extension of deterministic switching BNs and probabilistic BNs. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, there are few papers concerning BNs with Markovian jump parameters. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, a necessary and sufficient condition depending on the transition matrix and time is developed for the stochastic stability of BNs under any Markovian jump signal. However, the computation is very complex and thus less desirable in practice.</p><p>On one hand, stability analysis for BNs with Markovian jump parameters enables us to determine whether a genetic network in the presence of stochastic switching signals will evolve into a desired state corresponding to a healthy and beneficial target. On the other hand, it is well known that there are often intracellular and extracellular noises existing in all components in cells due to random births and deaths of individual molecules and environment fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Such noises, regarded as disturbances, may affect the dynamics of the whole biological system, degrade the system performance and even destroy the stability of the concerned system. Thus, it is desirable to evaluate the impact of disturbances on BNs, which motivates our study in this paper.</p><p>In this paper, stability and l1 gain of BNs with Markovian jump parameters are analyzed via the tool of STP of matrices. A necessary and sufficient condition in a linear programming form for such BNs is derived based on some results of linear positive systems. This condition can be regarded as a Lyapunov stability criterion by designing a stochastic Lyapunov function. Motivated by the optimal control problem for BNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the payoff function of a player in a game <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, an l1 gain in a stochastic form for BNs with Markovian jump parameters is defined. Then, the l1 gain problem is formulated and solved by a sufficient condition established by constructing a Lyapunov function. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. First, the necessary and sufficient condition for global stability of Markovian switching BNs, which is dependent on the Markovian jump parameters, is more practical than that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Second, the effect of external disturbances on stochastic BNs is quantified by an l1 gain for the first time. Finally, the results in this paper are more general and can include some existing works, for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, as special cases.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces some necessary preliminaries of STP and system description. The global stability and l1 gain analysis of stochastic BNs are investigated in Sections III and IV, respectively. Section V gives illustrative examples to show the effectiveness of the obtained results, which is followed by a brief conclusion in Section VI.</p><p>Notations: Denote by N, R n and Mm×n the sets of nonnegative integers, n-dimensional column vectors and m × n real matrices, respectively. The i-th column of identity matrix In is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">δ i n , i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Denote D := {0, 1}, ∆n = {δ i n | i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, ∆ := ∆2. D n := D × • • • × D n and ∆ n := ∆ × • • • × ∆ n are Cartesian products. A matrix L ∈ Mn×r is called a logical matrix if L can be rewritten as L = [ δ i 1 n δ i 2 n • • • δ ir n ]</formula><p>, which is denoted as L = δn [i1 i2 • • • ir] for simpler notation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES AND SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</head><p>In this section, some necessary preliminaries of STP and system descriptions are introduced.</p><p>A bijection σ from D to ∆ can be defined as σ(1) = δ 1 2 and σ(0) = δ 2 2 . Then 1 and 0 are regarded to be equivalent to δ 1 2 and δ 2 2 , respectively. Therefore Boolean variables, as well as Boolean functions, taking value 1 or 0, can be considered in ∆ and said to be expressed in their vector forms. Then, by STP, the following lemma is presented, which is overwhelmingly important to convert BNs into the same form as linear systems.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Lemma 1. [8] Let f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ ∆ be an n-ary Boolean function with xi ∈ ∆, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Then, there exists a unique logical matrix M f ∈ L2×2n satisfying f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = M f x, (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">where x = n i=1 xi := x1 x2 • • • xn. Here, M f ∈ L2×2n is called the structure matrix of f .</formula><p>As is well known, the STP of matrices becomes exactly the conventional matrix product if b = c. So throughout the paper, the symbol " " will be omitted if no confusion can arise. In the following, the model of BNs with Markovian jump parameters is first presented and then converted into an algebraic form as Markovian jump linear systems.</p><p>Consider a BN with n nodes and s updated rules for every node as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">           x1(k + 1) = f θ(k) 1 (x1(k), x2(k), . . . , xn(k)), x2(k + 1) = f θ(k) 2 (x1(k), x2(k), . . . , xn(k)), . . . xn(k + 1) = f θ(k) n (x1(k), x2(k), . . . , xn(k)), (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">where xi(k) ∈ D, f θ(k) i : D n → D is a Boolean function, i = 1,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">pij = Pr{θ(k + 1) = j|θ(k) = i},<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where pij ≥ 0 for i, j ∈ S and ∑ s j=1 pij = 1 for any i ∈ S. As known, the stationary distribution and the positive recurrent state of a Markov process are of great significance. Therefore, it is convenient to assume that Markov process {θ(k), k ≥ 0} is ergodic, ensuring that {θ(k), k ≥ 0} admits a unique stationary distribution, and each state of the Markov process is reachable from any other state in S.</p><p>A BN is said to be globally stable at Xe = (x e 1 , x e 2 , . . . , x e n ) ∈ D n if for any initial value, the state converges to Xe. Taking Markovian jump parameters into consideration, we present the exact definition of global stability in stochastic sense for (2) as follows.</p></div>

Consider the vector form of Boolean variable xi and Boolean function f j i , still denoted by xi and f j i , respectively, in order to avoid redundancy, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, . . . , s. Then, By Lemma 1, the algebraic equivalent form of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref>) is obtained as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x(k + 1) = F θ(k) x(k),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x(k) = n i=1 xi(k) ∈ ∆2n , F θ(k)</formula><p>∈ L2n×2n is called the transition matrix of (2) and " * " is the Khatri-Rao product. Network (4) has the same form as Markovian jump linear systems. But here the state space ∆2n is finite.</p><p>Based on the above equivalent transformation, Definition 1 can be rewritten as the following definition.</p></div>

Sufficiency: In order to prove the sufficient part, one should first prove the fact that every sub-network has a common fixed point as xe under conditions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">9</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>Assume that xe is not a fixed point of sub-network i0, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">F i 0 xe ̸ = xe, i.e., Col2n (F i 0 ) = δ t</formula><p>2 n , for some t ̸ = 2 n . Subsequently, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, one derives that for every j ∈ S, λ T j F i 0 δ 2 n 2 n = λ T j δ t 2 n &gt; 0. Note that ∑ s j=1 pi 0 j = 1 for pi 0 j ≥ 0, then there exists at least one integer j * such that pi 0 j * &gt; 0.

Thus, xe is a common fixed point every sub-network, which means that (F i ) = δ 2 n 2 n , for all i ∈ S. Therefore, F i 12 = 02n-1 and F i 22 = 1 for all i ∈ S in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.

Therefore, xe is a common fixed point of all the sub-networks. Otherwise, if xe is not a fixed point of only one sub-network i0, then F i 0 22 = 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">F i 22 = 1 for i ̸ = i0, implying that, lim k→∞ s ∑ j=1 µj(k + 1) = lim k→∞ s ∑ j=1 s ∑ i=1 pijF i 22 µi(k) = lim k→∞ s ∑ j=1 s ∑ i=1,i̸ =i 0 pijF i 22 µi(k) = lim k→∞ s ∑ i=1,i̸ =i 0 s ∑ j=1 pijF i 22 µi(k) = lim k→∞ s ∑ i=1,i̸ =i 0 µi(k)</formula><p>from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">8</ref>).

Thus, for every i ∈ S, F i 22 = 1 and F i 12 = 02n-1. Consequently, w(k) satisfies ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_32">14</ref>), which is a positive and stable system.

Obviously, it is easy to obtain that condition (i) of Definition 3 holds from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">9</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Assume that the mode at time k is i, i.e., θ(k) = i, then the network will jump to another mode θ(k + 1) = j at time k + 1 with probability pij.

CONCLUSION</head><p>Stability and l1 gain of BNs with Markovian jump parameters, which can be regarded as an extension of deterministic switching BNs and probabilistic BNs, have been analyzed in this paper. A necessary and sufficient condition for stochastic global stability of Markovian switching BNs has been obtained based on the STP and some results of linear positive systems. It is also shown that the condition can be described in terms of Lyapunov functions. Then, the l1 gain has been proposed to evaluate the performance of stochastic BNs with external disturbances. The results derived in this paper are more general and can be regraded as extensions of some existing ones. Future work of interest is to consider some control problems for BNs with Markovian jump parameters.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>2, . . . , n, and {θ(k) : k ∈ N} represents the discretetime homogeneous Markov chain taking values in a finite set S = {1, 2, . . . , s} with a transition probability matrix P = (pij)s×s as</figDesc></figure>
