<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The ability to process geospatial data will be a great benefit for spatial data infrastructures. This requires the ability to compose data providing services with geoprocessing services. Discovering suitable geoprocessing services is a major challenge in this endeavour. Current (keyword-based) approaches to service discovery are inherently restricted by the ambiguities of natural language, which can lead to low precision and/or recall. To alleviate these problems, we propose to use an ontologybased approach to GI service discovery, which rests on two ideas. Ontologies describing geospatial operations are used to create descriptions of requirements and service capabilities; matches between these descriptions are identified based on function subtyping. We use a running example from the geospatial domain to analyse which problems can occur in existing keyword-and ontology-based approaches and how the discovery of geoprocessing services differs from other service discovery tasks. The example is also used for illustrating the prototypical implementation of the proposed approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The efficient use of distributed geographic information is a key factor in planning and decision-making in a variety of domains. To facilitate the access to geographic information, spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> are currently being set up within regions, countries and across national borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. They support the discovery and retrieval of distributed geospatial data sources and geographic information (GI) services by providing catalogue services and syntactic interoperability standards.</p><p>In recent years, the number of GI services available on the web has been rapidly and continually increasing. While at present, these services are generally isolated applications, their composability is often perceived as their greatest value as this enables more complex processing tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. First attempts at composing GI web services have been made. However, these relied on manually and statically coupling existing services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> while for future applications service composition is envisioned to be automated <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>The component GI services from which such complex services are composed fall into three categories: Services providing data, which are usually the starting point for any complex GI service; geoprocessing services, which perform some kind of computation or analysis on the provided data; and presentation services, which present the result of a complex service to the user. The functionality of services for both the retrieval and presentation of data are relatively limited, and service interfaces for them are standardised (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>) and already in widespread use. Instead, the focus of this paper is on geoprocessing services, which are only now emerging and form the most diverse category. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref> shows an example for a complex service that contains a geoprocessing service for computing the distance between two locations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">GI Service Discovery and Composition</head><p>The starting point for (manually or automatically) composing a complex service is always a specific problem. Discovering services that are appropriate for solving this problem from among a large number of available services is a central task within the GI web services domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Descriptions of service capabilities (i.e., of what the service does) and user requirements (i.e., what is needed to solve a given problem) are key elements during service discovery, which is essentially about finding a match between the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. When service discovery is done as part of service composition, the descriptions of the service and the user requirements have to match in two aspects: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> the semantics of the operation<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (or functionality) and (2) the semantics of the interfaces of adjacent services. The former ensures that the service actually does what the user expects it to do; the latter ensures that the service correctly interprets the data it receives as input from the preceding service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Problems in State-of-the-Art GI Service Discovery</head><p>SDIs provide catalogue services <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> for discovering appropriate data and services for a specific task. For these catalogues, standardised metadata templates have been Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref> An example for a complex service containing a geoprocessing service developed, most notably those defined in ISO-DIS 19115 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for geographic data and 19119 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for GI services. Users can formulate queries using keywords and/or spatial filters. The metadata fields that can be included in the query depend on the used metadata schema and on the query functionality of the service used for accessing the metadata.</p><p>Even though natural language processing techniques can increase the semantic relevance of search results with respect to the search request (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>), keywordbased techniques are inherently restricted by the ambiguities of natural language. As a result, keyword-based search can have low recall if different terminology is used and/or low precision if terms are homonymous or because of their limited possibilities to express complex queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Currently, a move towards using the W3C <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> standards WSDL (Web Service Description Language) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for the description and discovery of GI services is being discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. However, as these standards are largely based on free text descriptions and service taxonomies the problems remain the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Hypothesis and Research Questions</head><p>To alleviate and overcome the semantic heterogeneity and interpretation problems presented in the previous section, we propose to base the descriptions of geoprocessing services on ontologies. An ontology is an explicit formal specification of a shared conceptualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, where a conceptualization can be defined as a way of thinking about some domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. By using ontologies to enrich the description of data sources or services, the semantics of data content or service functionality become machine-interpretable, and users are enabled to pose concise and expressive queries. Furthermore, logical reasoning can be used for matchmaking between user queries and data and service advertisements in catalogues.</p><p>It is the overall hypothesis of this paper that a methodology providing (1) ontology-based descriptions of operations and (2) a matchmaking mechanism based on function subtyping leads to improved recall and precision during the discovery of geoprocessing services. This hypothesis leads to the following research questions:</p><p>&amp; Which problems during the discovery of geoprocessing services in conventional catalogues are caused by semantic heterogeneities? &amp; How is the discovery of geoprocessing services influenced by the overall task of service composition? &amp; Which aspects of geoprocessing services should be described using ontologies? &amp; Which methods can be used for matchmaking between these descriptions for the discovery of geoprocessing services? &amp; What kinds of ontologies (and ontology languages) are required for these descriptions and matchmaking methods?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Ontology-Based GI Service Discovery</head><p>The main contribution of this paper is the proposed approach for the enhanced discovery of geoprocessing services, which we will subsequently refer to as ontologybased GI service discovery. In this approach, operations are represented by a socalled semantic signature, which contains Description Logics (DL) concepts (instead of datatypes) to represent inputs and outputs, and a specification of pre-and postconditions in First Order Logic (FOL). Service discovery is based on a two-step matchmaking process between these descriptions. First, the semantic signature is used for efficiently filtering the potentially large number of services. This filtering is done using DL subsumption reasoning on the concepts representing inputs and outputs and should result in a relatively small number of services. In the second step, the pre-and postconditions of the remaining services are compared to those specified in the query using a FOL theorem prover. In this matchmaking step, several degrees of match (all of which are based on the idea of function subtyping) can be tested. This allows a fine-grained distinction and ranking between the services identified in the first step.</p><p>The specification of operations as part of domain ontologies plays an important role in this approach. These specifications describe the input and output types and the behaviour of the operation. Each of these parts of a specification provides a template for formulating descriptions of requirements and capabilities. This constrains the descriptions created by service providers and requesters and thus ensure greater recall during service discovery.</p><p>For the approach to work it is required that the same domain ontology (or shared vocabulary) be used by service providers and requesters. Therefore the basis for specifying operations and concepts for inputs and outputs should be widely agreedupon standards such as the ISO 19100 series of standards or the specifications of the OGC. The ontology of operations used in GI web services, which is presented in this paper, is developed based on the ISO standards 19107 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and 19111 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Overview</head><p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the notion of geoprocessing services and present existing approaches to GI service discovery and composition in current SDIs. We also introduce a running example that we use throughout the paper for illustration. Section 3 explains the notion of ontologies and presents the logical formalisms used in this paper (FOL, DL and Hoare Logic). It then introduces existing approaches to service discovery based on ontologies, which provide the building blocks for the proposed methodology. These include matching inputs and outputs described in DL and pre-and postconditions described in FOL as well as using shared domain vocabularies a a basis for these descriptions. The problems associated with each of these building blocks are also analysed. In Sections 4 and 5, the previously introduced building blocks are adapted and combined into a new methodology for semantic service discovery, which improves recall and precision and makes service discovery more efficient. Ontology-based descriptions of operations at the domain and application level, which are the basis for this methodology, are introduced in Section 4. Section 5 describes the matchmaking between these descriptions. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work in Section 6 and a conclusion and outlook to future work in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Spatial Data Infrastructures and Geoprocessing Services</head><p>Emerging spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) facilitate the discovery and retrieval of distributed geographic information. However, some key problems caused by semantic heterogeneity remain to be solved. In this chapter, we introduce the notion of geoprocessing services by defining their specific properties (Section 2.1). We then present mechanisms and components for GI discovery and retrieval that already exist in current SDIs (Section 2.2). In Section 2.3, we introduce a running example that we use throughout the paper for illustration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Geoprocessing Services</head><p>GI Services can be seen as web services providing functionalities that have traditionally been provided by monolithic geographic information systems (GIS). GIS are software systems that enable the capture, modelling, storage, retrieval, sharing, manipulation, analysis and presentation of geospatial (geographically referenced) data <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>Service interfaces have already been standardised for the presentation (Web Map Service, WMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>) and retrieval (Web Feature Service, WFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>) of geospatial data and are in widespread use. However, the semantics of the data that can be accessed and displayed using these service types is not always clear. An approach for describing geographic data in these services is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Geoprocessing Services analyse (and manipulate) geospatial data <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> . Examples include the following operations: buffering a geometry to create a new geometry, measuring the distance between two geometries or intersecting two (sets of) geometries. This list shows that the class of geoprocessing services is quite diverse and cannot easily be standardised. However, all geoprocessing services have a few things in common: &amp; They are information services <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> in the sense that they do not change the state of the real world but only of information space. Therefore, their inputs and outputs are important, and pre-and postconditions usually refer directly to these inputs and outputs and not to some external states (e.g., the validity of a credit card). &amp; The effect of executing a geoprocessing service is usually that a new fact becomes known (analysis) or a known fact has been updated (manipulation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Discovery and Composition of Geoprocessing Services in Current SDIs</head><p>A main motivation for setting up SDIs is to make the work with geographic data more efficient by addressing problems that occur with conventional GIS technology and geographic data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. For the research presented here, the most crucial of these problems are that data sets exist in a plethora of different data formats, are stored in a variety of different systems and that both are often not sufficiently or not at all documented.</p><p>There are two main standardization efforts in the geospatial domain, whose goal is to overcome these problems: the ISO Technical Committee (TC) 211, which develops the 19100 series of standards, and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), whose industry standards are often adopted by ISO.</p><p>GI Discovery in SDIs. In an SDI context, resources (geographic data and GI services) are usually arbitrarily distributed in large networks. In such a scenario, missing or insufficient documentation makes it difficult or even impossible for users to discover resources and to assess whether they might be useful for their tasks. Catalogues can be used to solve these problems, which makes them a fundamental part of SDIs. They allow providers to advertise resources by registering their metadata (push). A catalogue may also collect metadata from known service and data providers (pull). A requester can then use the catalogue's Blibrarian functions'' (discovery, browsing, querying) to find previously unknown resources that fit her needs. GI Service Composition. At present, GI services are generally isolated applications. Nevertheless, several services may be composed to create a new service, which is of special value for a particular question, even though they were not specifically designed for that purpose. It is this composability (and the more complex processing tasks it enables) that is often perceived as the greatest value of the web service paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In ISO terminology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the new complex service is called service chain, which is defined as a sequence of services where, for each adjacent pair of services, occurrence of the first action is necessary for the occurrence of the second action. Three types of service chains are distinguished: User-defined (transparent), workflow-managed (translucent) and aggregate (opaque) service chains. However, apart from the user-defined chaining, the description of these types is focused on the execution of the chain rather than on the actual service composition, which is the focus of this paper.</p><p>A service chain consists of several services each of which contributes one part to the overall functionality. During service composition a number of services have to be discovered which together provide the required functionality. Service discovery is hence a very important part of service composition, but service composition also imposes some constraints on service discovery (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The component services of the service chain that have already been discovered have to be taken into account during the subsequent discovery steps: &amp; To ensure that the data exchanged between services in a chain are interpreted correctly the outputs of a preceding and the inputs of a succeeding service have to be considered. &amp; To meet the overall requirements on the chain's functionality it has to be considered which parts of the functionality are covered by the services which have already been discovered.</p><p>The query resulting from these constraints can then be compared to service descriptions registered in some catalogue service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">A Running Example</head><p>To illustrate the problems that can occur when using existing approaches and to point out the benefits of the approach proposed in this paper, we use the following example throughout the paper. Susan is searching for services for building a complex service that computes the distance between two geographic features, e.g., between two airports or between a Bmissile launch location'' and a city (to determine whether this city is threatened). She has already discovered services providing the locations of the features (given some ID) as point geometries. The points are represented as a complex type consisting of two coordinates in some coordinate system (e.g., latitude and longitude in a geographic coordinate system). One of the requirements during Susan's search will be that the distance operation accepts these services' output types.</p><p>GetLocation(someID: int): (coord1: double, coord2: double) John is a service provider who has published a number of distance services. While all services have the same (syntactic) signature distance(x1: double, y1: double, x2: double, y2: double): double the semantics of the input they require, the output they produce and the functionality they provide, can differ widely. For example, the input parameters could represent geographic or projected coordinates (in a specific coordinate reference system) and the output could represent the distance in kilometres, miles or degrees. Some examples for the functionality that such a service might have are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Service discovery during service composition. The properties of services that have already been discovered impose constraints on the queries for further services For the running example, we assume that John offers four services with different functionality:</p><p>Service 1 returns the 2D Euclidian distance between two points in a plane expressed in Cartesian coordinates (Equation 2.1), which equals the length of a straight line between them (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>, upper left). Service 2 returns the distance between two vertices in a graph, which equals the length of the shortest path between them (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>, upper right). The vertices are assumed to lie in a plane. If we consider a graph whose edge weights represent distances (i.e., where all edge weights are greater than or equal to zero) the shortest path can e.g., be computed using Dijkstra's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Service 3 returns the great circle or geodesic distance between two points on a sphere expressed in geographic coordinates<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">4</ref> (Equation 2.2), which equals the length of the great circle section on the spherical surface that is defined by the two points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>, lower left). Service 4 returns the 3D Euclidian distance between two points in R 3 (Equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>.3). To allow for the third dimension, this service's syntactic signature has to include z1 and z2 input parameters. Thus, it also differs syntactically from the other services.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d Eucl2D ðx 1 ; y 1 ; x 2 ; y 2 Þ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi ðx 2 À x 1 Þ 2 þ ðy 2 À y 1 Þ 2 q ð2:1Þ d geod ð' 1 ; ! 1 ; ' 2 ; ! 2 Þ ¼ arccosðsin ' 1 sin ' 2 þ cos ' 1 cos ' 2 cos $ !Þ ð2:2Þ d Eucl3D ðx 1 ; y 1 ; z 1 ; x 2 ; y 2 ; z 2 Þ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi ðx 2 À x 1 Þ 2 þ ðy 2 À y 1 Þ 2 þ ðz 2 À z 1 Þ 2 q ð2:3Þ</formula><p>We also consider different discovery scenarios for Susan. The difference between Scenarios 1 and 2 is the kind of point returned from the GetLocation service she has already discovered. Scenarios 2a and 2b differ in the required functionality. Scenario 1: The GetLocation service returns points in a projected coordinate reference system, e.g., epsg:31466 (DHDN/Gauß-Kru ¨ger, zone 2) and Susan is looking for a service that computes distances in the associated projection plane. Scenario 2a: The GetLocation service returns points in a geographic coordinate reference system, e.g., epsg:4326 (WGS84) and Susan is looking for a service that computes distances on the associated sphere. Scenario 2b: The GetLocation service returns points in a geographic coordinate reference system, e.g., epsg:4326 (WGS84) and Susan is looking for a service that computes the 3D Euclidian distance between these points (Equation 2.4 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">5</ref> , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>, lower right).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d Eucl3D ð' 1 ; ! 1 ; ' 2 ; ! 2 Þ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi ðx 2 À x 1 Þ 2 þ ðy 2 À y 1 Þ 2 þ ðz 2 À z 1 Þ 2 q</formula><p>with x 1 ; y 1 ; z 1 ¼ f ð' 1 ; ! 1 ; RÞ and x 2 ; y 2 ; z 2 ¼ f ð' 2 ; ! 2 ; RÞ ð2:4Þ If Susan relied only on syntactic descriptions of the operations (i.e., their signatures) in her search, Services 1 to 3 would seem appropriate, because the result of the GetLocation service (two doubles) could be fed into all of them. However, the projected coordinates provided by the GetLocation services in Scenario 1 would be interpreted incorrectly in services that expect geographic coordinates (e.g., Service 3) and vice versa (e.g., Scenario 2 and Service 1). Furthermore, Susan would not be able to judge only from the signature what kind of distance operation a service performs and how the result produced by the service is to be interpreted. In one case (Scenario 2b) she would also miss a (partly) appropriate service (Service 4) when only comparing syntactic descriptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Building Blocks for Semantic Service Discovery</head><p>This section introduces the building blocks for the proposed methodology of ontology-based service discovery. We first explain the notion of ontologies and present the logical formalisms used in this paper (Section 3.1). Then we illustrate how ontologies can be used for matching the inputs and outputs and the pre-and postconditions of service descriptions (Section 3.2), and how this matchmaking can be supported by shared domain vocabularies (Section 3.3). Finally, Section 3.4 analyses existing problems with each of these approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Ontologies for Service Discovery</head><p>To overcome the problems described above, we propose to use ontological descriptions. An ontology is an explicit formal specification of a shared conceptualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. By using ontologies to enrich the description of services, their semantics become machine-interpretable, and users are enabled to pose concise and expressive queries. Furthermore, logical reasoning can be used to discover implicit relationships between search terms and service descriptions as well as to flexibly construct taxonomies for classifying services.</p><p>In the following sections we present three logical formalisms used in our work. We first introduce Hoare Logic as a language for specifying the behaviour of software components. We then present First Order Logic and Description Logics, which are employed for specifying the ontologies used in these behaviour specifications.</p><p>Hoare Logic. Hoare logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is a formal system that provides a set of logical rules for reasoning about some properties of a computer program, including determining whether a given program provides a certain functionality. The intended functionality of a program Q is specified in terms of initial preconditions (P), i.e., assertions about certain properties of the values taken by the relevant variables before the program initiation and the relations among them, and postconditions (R), i.e., assertions about the values after execution. The relation between the preconditions and postconditions is formulated as so-called Hoare triples of the form PfQgR which can be interpreted as follows: BIf the assertion P is true before initiation of a program Q, then the assertion R will be true on its completion.'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> Specifications based on pre-and postconditions can be used for discovering software components or services with a required functionality (Section 3.2.3).</p><p>First-Order Logic. We use First-Order Logic (FOL)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> for annotating and matching pre-and postconditions of operations. FOL is a branch of logic that is based on individuals and the relations (predicates) between them and permits the formulation of quantified statements about some or all the individuals in the universe of discourse. Predicates in FOL take only individuals as arguments and quantifiers only bind individual variables.</p><p>The primitive symbols of FOL are (1) parentheses, (2) variables, constants, functions, and predicate symbols, (3) the usual logical connectors, : (not), ^(and), _ (or), ) (implication), , (equivalence), and (4) quantifiers, 8 (for all) and 9 (there exists) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The goal of logic inference in FOL is to check whether a given knowledge base KB (a collection of sentences) entails a sentence a (KB a ), i.e., whether a follows logically from KB. Entailment in FOL is semidecidable, i.e., every entailed sentence can be found, but for non-entailed sentences, it is not always possible to decide whether they are entailed or not. Despite these theoretical limits, automated theorem provers can solve many hard problems in FOL. Inference procedures often employed include resolution and term rewriting <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>Description Logics. We employ Description Logics (DL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for annotating and matching inputs and outputs of operations. DL is a family of knowledge representation languages that are subsets of first-order logic (for a mapping from DL to FOL, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>).

In component-based software development, if parts selected from different suppliers are to be matched and combined, component compatibility is a vital concern. The notions of function subtypes, which is the basis for safe substitution of functions, has been proposed to judge whether two components are compatible. In the following sections, we first introduce function subtypes (Section 3.2.1) and then describe how they can be employed for matching inputs and outputs (Section 3.2.2) and pre-and postconditions of service descriptions (Section 3.2.3).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E !

The latter types are called predicate matches.</p><p>In our work, it has proven difficult to clearly separate pre-and postconditions. Therefore, only two types of match are considered in our approach: The generalised predicate match and the plug-in post match. Both types are presented in more detail below.

In principle, each of these local ontologies can be a combination of several other ontologies. However, it cannot be assumed that several local ontologies share the same vocabulary. This lack of a common vocabulary makes it difficult to compare different local ontologies.</p><p>In contrast, single ontology approaches use one global ontology, which provides a shared vocabulary for specifying the semantics of all services and queries. Such approaches can be applied to problems where all service descriptions available in a catalogue have been created with a very similar view on a domain, which also has to be shared by all requesters. Hybrid approaches also use a global shared vocabulary, which contains basic terms (the primitives) of a domain. At the same time it allows the semantics of each service or query to be described by its own ontology. As these local ontologies reuse and combine the primitives from the shared vocabulary, they become comparable to each other. In both approaches, it is assumed that the semantics of the primitives is understood (and this understanding is shared) by all requesters and providers in the domain. Therefore, the primitives require no further formal definitions. Nevertheless, it can sometimes be useful to represent a shared vocabulary as an ontology in order to impose a structure on it. Such an ontology is called a domain ontology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Remaining Problems</head><p>This section discusses possible problems of using the presented building blocks in a methodology for GI service discovery.</p><p>Matching Inputs and Outputs Based on DL Concepts. Even though DL concepts can be more expressive than simple syntactic types, simple comparisons of DL concepts that represent inputs and outputs of an operation are still not expressive enough for semantic service discovery. This has several reasons.</p><p>Two services with different functionality can still be represented using the same DL concepts for annotating inputs and outputs, e.g., two distance operations (Euclidian and geodesic), which take two gm point objects as input and return a distance object. Specifying the functionality of an operation requires the additional specification of pre-and postconditions.</p><p>It is possible in DL to specify some constraints for the input and output parameters, e.g., that the two gm point input parameters of a distance operation have to be in some geographic coordinate system. It is, however, impossible to state that both input parameters also have to have the same coordinate system. Similarly, while it is possible to state that the output parameter is a distance between two gm points, it cannot be stated that it is the distance between those gm points that were used as inputs to the operation. Specifying such constraints requires introducing variables and hence a more expressive language than DL.</p><p>Matching FOL Pre-and Postconditions. FOL is expressive enough to specify preand postconditions and constraints over variables. However, this increased expressiveness comes at a cost. FOL inference is semi-decidable, i.e., for nonentailed sentences, it is not always possible to decide whether they are entailed or not. Also, even for entailed sentences proofs might require a long time. This is critical as for each advertisement in the registry one implication has to be tested for each type of match. For large numbers of services, using FOL theorem provers is computationally too expensive.</p><p>Shared Vocabularies. In a highly heterogeneous and distributed environment like SDIs it has to be assumed that many different actors specify service descriptions in order to register and query service registries. To keep these service descriptions comparable it is crucial that they are based on a shared vocabulary. The approaches currently proposed for semantic service discovery (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>) can be classified as single ontology approaches. The use of ontologies at multiple levels is not intended. In the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, the need to map between different ontologies by means of mediators is acknowledged. However, how this is to be achieved, still remains unclear.</p><p>Even if shared vocabularies are used for the concepts describing inputs and outputs of operations, comparability is still not guaranteed if the semantic description is generated directly from an operation's syntactic description (e.g., in WSDL), e.g., as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Syntactic descriptions can differ significantly, even if the operations have the same functionality. The following two signatures are a simple example for two distance operations that could have the same functionality: distance1(x1:double, y1:double, x2:double, y2:double): double distance2(p1: point, p2: point): double</p><p>The input parameters of distance1 would all be semantically annotated using a coordinate concept from a domain ontology, whereas the input parameters of distance2 would be annotated using a gm points concept. If there is no subsumption relation between these two concepts, no match will be found during signature matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Therefore, when using an approach based on function subtypes, functions (or operations), too, should be part of shared vocabularies. Currently, we are not aware of any approach that uses shared vocabularies of operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Ontology-Based Descriptions of Operations</head><p>Ontology-based descriptions of operations play a crucial part in the presented approach. There are a number of proposals for representing operations (or services) in ontologies, most notably OWL-S 9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and WSMO 10 [47]. As WSMO is still under active development and subject to major revisions and because of some problems with OWL-S (see below) we have chosen to develop a lightweight representation for operation ontologies. Our goal was to develop a cognitively adequate, yet simple description of operations that can be used for matching inputs, outputs, pre-and postconditions based on the idea of function subtypes. In the following we argue why we consider the OWL-S approach to specifying operations to be inappropriate for our methodology and then propose a simple alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">A Simple Representation for Describing Operations</head><p>The OWL-S service profile is a representation of the operation the service provides. In OWL-S, operations are represented as OWL concepts, which-as all other DL concepts-are static. The ServiceProfile concept, which describes an operation's signature, has four functional properties: input, output, preconditions and postconditions. Service descriptions in OWL-S are instances of this concept, in which the fillers for these properties are OWL concepts.</p><p>We consider the conceptualization underlying the ServiceProfile class to be appropriate for representing operations. However, we believe that the representation of operations in OWL-S is too complicated. To implement the matching of operation descriptions described in Section 3.2.2 the constructs representing the input, output, pre-and postconditions first have to be extracted from the OWL representation, and each has to be compared separately to its counterpart in a query. The results of these comparisons then have to be combined following the rules of function subtyping.</p><p>In order to facilitate this parsing step, we propose to use a lightweight representation for operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. This representation consists of a semantic signature <ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">11</ref> containing DL concepts (instead of datatypes) to represent inputs and outputs and a specification of pre-and postconditions in First Order Logic (FOL).</p><p>The operation descriptions and the associated ontologies occur at two levels: At the domain level, they describe the generic operations of the domain and thus provide a shared vocabulary, on which, at the application level, service providers (or requesters) can base the descriptions of (or queries for) a particular operation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). In the following, we will first illustrate the semantic signature and the specification of pre-and postconditions on the domain level and then show how to derive semantic advertisements and queries from these domain-level descriptions.</p><p>As has been shown in Section 3.4, it is crucial that the semantic signature is not based directly on the syntactic signature (e.g., a WSDL description). Rather, there should be an agreed-upon set of operations that is specified as a part of the shared vocabulary in a particular domain. Similar to other domain ontologies, the operation descriptions should, wherever possible, be based on existing standards or agreements within the domain rather than designed from scratch. In the domain of geographic information (GI), the 19100 series of ISO standards published by ISO/ TC 211 provides a comprehensive and widely used collection of GI models that can serve as such a basis. Apart from descriptions in natural language, these standards often contain detailed UML class diagrams. Where the UML classes in these models contain operations, they are particularly suited as a starting point for developing operation ontologies. For example, the distance operation defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for gm objects (and by inheritance also for gm points) can serve as a basis for an ontological description of distance operations.</p><p>In order for the service to be executable once it has been discovered, a correspondence has to be established between the DL concepts in the semantic signature and the (XML schema) datatypes in the syntactic signature. So-called registration mappings <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> can be used for this purpose. However, these are outside the scope of this paper. For a detailed account on how to use registration mappings in SDIs, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Ontology-Based Descriptions of Operations at the Domain Level</head><p>In this section, we illustrate how, in the proposed methodology, an operation is described at the domain level. As an example, we use the distance operation between points, which will serve the provider and requester in our running example as a basis for specifying their advertisements and queries. The description is based on the following domain-level DL concepts and FOL axioms. As motivated above, we use the 19100 series of ISO standards as a basis for building a DL domain ontology. Here, we only consider a small subset of these models that allows us to describe the concepts occurring in the distance operation between two points (for the relevant standards, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>).</p><p>A geometry object (gm object) can (but need not) be associated to one coordinate reference system (coordRefSys) of type sc crs (Equation 4.1). Points (gm point) are a specific kind of geometric object (as are polygons and lines). They are defined as having between 1 and 3 coordinates each of which is represented as a number (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.2). Geographic and projected coordinate reference systems (geog crs and proj crs ) are specific families of coordinate reference systems (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.3). epsg 4326 is a geographic, and epsg 31466 is a projected coordinate reference system (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.4). Note that, as our approach is restricted to TBox reasoning (Section 3.1), coordinate reference systems are modelled as concepts rather than individuals (as in the FOL ontology presented below). There are several possible conceptualizations, e.g., using the mathematical expressions presented in Section 2.3 or the notions of metric and metric space <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. However, these present a number of difficulties. The former would become too complicated for more complex operations (e.g., buffer, interpolate) and be difficult or impossible to create using standard ontology or logic languages. With the latter, every distance operation would be (trivially) associated with a different metric. The use ontologies for just expressing such 1:1 correspondences would be too much overhead. And finally, neither primitives like geodesic metric nor complex mathematical expressions can be assumed to be known or understood by the average GI user. Thus, an alternative conceptualization is required.</p><p>The conceptualization we have adopted for our example uses a small set of primitives: A distance is modelled as the length of a curve in 3-dimensional Euclidian Space R 3 . The curve is defined as being the shortest possible curve in a particular sub-space of R 3 . R 3 provides a reference space for this conceptualization in several respects: &amp; It is the most complex (highest dimensional) space when dealing with geographic information. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">12</ref> Therefore, any other space can be Bembedded'' (or represented) in it. &amp; It is intuitive and well-known because it reflects our everyday experience. &amp; As we base the notion of distance on the notion of length in our conceptualization, we also have to provide a metric for measuring this length. The Euclidian metric of R 3 provides this (reference) metric.</p><p>With this conceptualisation, only one space and one metric to be considered, both of which are also intuitive to the average GI user.</p><p>Formally, the presented conceptualization can be based on the primitives and associated axioms listed below.

A binary predicate that links the notions of space and coordinate reference system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Semantic Advertisements and Semantic Queries</head><p>In the proposed methodology, a domain-level operation description is the basis for both a provider's advertisement and a requester's query for a specific service. The input and output types specified in the domain-level description can be further specialized by creating DL application ontologies that (further) constrain cardinalities and ranges of roles from the domain ontology. It is important, however, that the concepts in the application ontologies always have a taxonomic relation to the concepts used in the domain-level description of the chosen operation. Only if this is the case, the matching of inputs and outputs based on DL subsumption will lead to satisfactory results (Section 3.4). Also the FOL axioms describing the pre-and postconditions can be refined. We call the refined description of the operation semantic advertisement (for registration) or semantic query (for discovery).</p><p>In the following, we illustrate the specification of semantic advertisements and queries for our running example based on the generic distance operation for points (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.11).</p><p>Inputs and Outputs in Semantic Advertisements and Queries. The semantic types representing input and output, i.e., gm point and distance are the basis for John's semantic advertisements. He can further specialize the input and output types by creating DL application concepts that constrain cardinalities and/or ranges of roles specified for these concepts. Three examples of how this can be done are shown in Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.12 for the concepts representing the input parameters of John's distance operations. All concept definitions further restrict cardinalities and ranges of non-taxonomic relations specified for gm point in the domain ontology. A geog point is defined as having exactly (instead of at most) one geographic coordinate reference system and exactly two coordinates. The definition of proj point is the same except that it is restricted to projected coordinate reference systems. A 3d point is simply defined as having exactly three coordinates, and no further restrictions are introduced on its coordinate reference system.</p><p>Susan has to follow the same steps as John in order to describe the kind of distance service she is looking for. However, she does not have to define a new concept. She can directly use the concept that represents the output of the GetLocation service as a requirement in her query. The definitions of this concept in the scenarios of the motivating scenario are presented in Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.13. location1 represents a point in a Gauß-Kru ¨ger coordinate reference system (Scenario 1), while location2 represents a point in WGS84 (Scenarios 2a and 2b). In addition to inputs, outputs, pre-and postconditions, these specifications also contain variables. These become necessary if pre-and postconditions define constraints on the same object, as in the 2D-Euclidian distance example (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>, where the input points should be located on the same plane as the curve. Therefore, the scope of these variables ranges over both pre-and postconditions. It is also possible to define additional constraints on these variables (in pre-and/or postconditions), e.g., in the network distance example (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.15), the network, in which the input points are located, should be located in the the same plane as the curve. For simplicity, the type of a variable (which could also be seen as such an additional constraint) is specified in the variables section.  <ref type="formula">4</ref>.11. She can further constrain this specification based on the constraints the GetLocation service specifies as post-conditions (which become preconditions in Susan's query) and the functionality she requires.</p><p>In Scenario 1 we have assumed that the GetLocation service returns points in Gauß-Kru ¨ger, zone 2 (Epsg 31466 ). This results in the specification shown in Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.18. Note that the postcondition requires the shortest curve between p 1 and p2 to be embedded in the space that is defined by the given coordinate reference system. This means that Susan wants the distance to be measured in the reference system's projection plane. signature : distð p 1 : location1; p 2 : location1Þ : distance pre : À post : 9c; s : definesðEpsg 31466; sÞ ^shortestCurveðc; p 1 ; p 2 ; sÞd istð p 1 ; p 2 Þ ¼ lengthðcÞ ð4:18Þ</p><p>In Scenarios 2a and 2b, the GetLocation service returns geographic coordinates (e.g., in Epsg 4326).

First, the semantic signature is used for efficiently filtering the potentially large number of services. This filtering is done using DL subsumption reasoning on the concepts representing inputs and outputs as described in Section 3.2.2. As the result of this filtering step should be a relatively small number of services, we currently only consider plug-in or exact matches between semantic signatures. If the filtering turns out to be too strong, other types of matches could also be included.</p><p>In the second step, the pre-and postconditions of the remaining services are compared to those specified in the query in order to identify those services that provide the required functionality. This filter tests for the generalized predicate and the plug-in post types of match introduced in Section 3.2. For each type of match, a separate FOL proof obligation has to be derived from the specifications of pre-and postconditions in the semantic advertisement and query. These proof obligations are then tested using a FOL theorem prover. Each service is first tested for the stronger generalized predicate match. If a match is found, the weaker plug-in post match does not have to be tested as is implied by the generalized predicate match. The strictness of the type of match can then be used to rank the services.</p><p>Translating the Specifications into FOL Axioms. As introduced in Section 3.1, a specification for a component Q with precondition P and postcondition R has the following interpretation: If P is true before initiation of Q, then R will be true after its execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. We therefore translate specifications consisting of signature, preand post-conditions (Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>.1) into a single implication (Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>.2). The implicant is a conjunction of the type constraints for all input parameters and variables and the preconditions over the inputs and variables. The consequence is a conjunction of the type constraint of the operation's result and the postconditions over the inputs, the variables and the result. </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">. ; v n : ½t 1 ði 1 Þ ^. . . ^tn ði n Þ ^u1 ðv 1 Þ ^. . . ^un ðv n ÞP ði 1 ; . . . ; i n ; v 1 ; . . . ; v n Þ</formula><p>) ½t R ðopði 1 ; . . . ; i n ÞÞ ^Rði 1 ; . . . ; i n ; v 1 ; . . . ; v n ; opði 1 ; . . . ; i n ÞÞ ð5:2Þ Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> A schematic illustration of the two-step matchmaking procedure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Enhanced Discovery in the Running Example</head><p>To illustrate how keyword-based service discovery can be enhanced using ontologybased descriptions of operations we present the results of the proposed matchmaking procedure for the services and queries from the running example.</p><p>Matching Inputs and Outputs. From the examples given above, we can derive semantic signatures describing the services offered by John (Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>.4) and the queries posed by Susan (Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>.5). As we have so far only considered the distance operation's input parameters, we use the unmodified distance concept from the domain ontology in all signatures. The subsumption hierarchy that can be computed between the concepts used as inputs in these signatures is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. If Susan uses Query 1 in her request, she discovers Service 1 and Service 2 as plug-in matches (Section 3.2.2) because it can be inferred that location1 is more specific than proj point . If she uses Query 2 instead, she discovers Service 3 because location2 is more specific than geog point. Service 4, however, is not discovered by any of Susan's queries, because neither location1 nor location2 can be proved to be more specific than 3d point.</p><p>Matching Pre-and Postconditions. Matching between the service and query specifications containing pre-and postconditions can be used to differentiate between the services returned from the input/output matching step. We use a first Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> Inferred taxonomic relationship between the application concepts defined by John (dark grey) and Susan (light grey) and the domain concept gm point (white) order logic theorem prover (SPASS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>) to check the different kinds of match introduced in Section 3.2.2.</p><p>For each kind of match, a proof obligation is formulated, e.g., Q pred ) S pred for the generalized predicate match. If it can be shown that the proof obligation is entailed in the knowledge base, i.e., the domain ontology for distances (Section 4.2.1), a match is assumed. As entailment in FOL is only semidecidable, it is not always possible for non-entailed sentences to decide whether they are entailed or not. To avoid that in such cases the proof does not terminate, a time-out (e.g., 5 sec) is set for each testing a proof obligation. If no proof can be generated in this time, it is assumed that the specifications do not match. While introducing a time-out will enhance the performance of the reasoning step, it also means that true matches are not discovered in cases where the proof simply takes a long time.</p><p>Applying the generalized predicate match in the query scenarios of the running scenario produces the following results: &amp; For Scenario 1 (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.18), the operation returning the Euclidian distance in the plane (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>.14) is discovered as a match. This is because Epsg 31466 is a Gauß-Kru ¨ger coordinate reference system, and therefore defines a plane, in which all input points and the shortest curve are located. The other distance operations are no match because their input points and shortest curves are located in different subspaces of R 3 . &amp; For Scenario 2a (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>), the operation returning the geodesic distance (on a sphere) (Equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>) is discovered as a match. This is because Epsg 4326 is a geographic coordinate reference system, and therefore defines a sphere, on which all input points and the shortest curve are located. The other distance operations are no match because their input points and shortest curves are located in different subspaces of R 3 . &amp; For Scenario 2b (Equation 4.20), none of the presented distance operations is discovered even though the Euclidian distance in R 3 would (exactly) match the postcondition. This is because the precondition that all input points have Epsg 4326 as a coordinate reference system is not satisfied.</p><p>In order to find a match for the last case, we also applied the plug-in post match to the queries. As expected, this returns the same matches for the first two queries, but also the Euclidian distance in R 3 (Equation 4.17) for Scenario 2b (Equation 4.20). This means that this service's functionality (as expressed in the postcondition) but not its preconditions match Susan's query. If Susan wants to use this service on the results of the GetLocation service, she has to transform the coordinates from Epsg 4326 to coordinates in R 3 . </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Related Work</head><p>In recent years, a number of research groups have addressed the problem of ontology-based service discovery. In this section, we present the approaches most relevant to our work and point out similarities and differences to the methodology presented in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">OWL-S-Based Service Discovery</head><p>Since the OWL-S service ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is public and does not prescribe a framework implementation it has been used as the starting point of individual efforts towards semantic web services <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> a tool for matching between semantic descriptions of services and user requests is introduced that is based on OWL-S profile and the UDDI registry for web services <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The matchmaking is done using subsumption reasoning on the concepts describing inputs and outputs. The results for inputs and outputs are combined according to the rules defined in Section 3.2.1 for function subtypes. However, as this approach does not consider pre-and postconditions, no distinction can be made between operations with the same (semantic) signature.</p><p>Another approach based on OWL-S and DL subsumption reasoning is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In this approach, the whole profile (including inputs, outputs, pre-and postconditions) is defined as a subconcept of the DAML-S service profile. This concept is then classified in the subsumption hierarchy defined by the advertised service profiles using RACER <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> as a reasoning engine. Consequently, inputs and outputs cannot be treated differently as required by the rules for function subtypes. As has been illustrated in Section 4, this can lead to unintended results.</p><p>[28] also define an additional (very weak) type of match: The intersection match holds if the intersection of advertisement A and request R is satisfiable (:½A u R v ? ). The authors present experimental results that indicate that the approach of using DL subsumption reasoning for service discovery scales up to larger applications. This requires, however, that the TBox classification of the service profiles is done off-line before the matchmaking process starts and the classified TBox is then used to reason about requests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">LARKS Matchmaking of Agent Capabilities</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> the Language for Advertisement and Request for Knowledge Sharing (LARKS) is defined, which can be used to describe the capabilities of software agents. A capability specification in LARKS defines the context of the specification, the input and output variables, the constraints on these variables, the ontological descriptions used, and a textual description. As in OWL-S, a capability specification can be treated as a request or as an advertisement.</p><p>Given a request and an advertisement, the matchmaking process can apply five different filters, which can be arbitrarily combined by the requester. This enables a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency of the discovery process. In our context, the signature and constraint filters are of particular interest. In the signature filter, the input and output declarations of the request and the advertisement are compared using subtype inference rules and subsumption reasoning. The logical implications in the constraint filter are checked using subsumption reasoning for Horn clauses. The plug-in match, which is a combination of the signature and constraint filters, follows the rules of function subtypes as described in Section 3.2.1.</p><p>There are many similarities between the LARKS approach and the methodology presented in this paper. Both are based on matching inputs, outputs, pre-and postconditions based on the idea of function subtyping. Also, the use of different filters is similar to the two steps of our approach. The LARKS approach also includes keyword-based filtering, but it considers fewer types of match. Also, while a shared ontology is assumed for matching LARKS specifications, these ontologies do not contain operations.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a tool is presented, which implements the LARKS matchmaking approach for web service discovery and is partly based on the approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The Semantic Services Matchmaker (SSM) uses an extension to WSDL called Web Service Semantic Profile (WSSP), which has been inspired by the OWL-S profile, to describe the services semantically, and an (extended) UDDI registry <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for storing service advertisements. During the matchmaking, all filters developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> can be used. The SSM also provides a user interface, which features the automatic generation of service description templates from the service's WSDL document. The service provider only has to select a matching ontology concept for each input and output parameter. While this feature facilitates the annotation of web services, it can create problems if the inputs or outputs of syntactic signature do not match those of the semantic signature (as in our running example) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Also, while not stressed explicitly by the authors, the presented discovery tools can only work if a common ontology is used as a shared vocabulary by providers and requesters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Service Discovery in WSMO</head><p>The Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) and the associated Web Service Modeling Language (WSML) are being developed as part of the SDK Cluster, which aligns the research and development efforts in the areas of Semantic Web Services between EU-funded research projects. 13  The WSMO approach to service discovery 14 consists of four steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>:</p><p>1. During goal discovery, a requester locates a pre-defined goal that fits her requirements (expressed using natural language or any other means) from the set of pre-defined goals. 2. During goal refinement the selected goal is refined to reflect additional requirements of the requester. 13 see www.wsmo.org 3. In the service discovery step, services are discovered that can, according to their abstract capability, potentially fulfil the requester goal. As abstract capabilities do not consider the input provided by the requester nor the dynamics of the available set of services for this input at a specific point in time, they are not guaranteed to be correct, i.e., there might be executions of the service (concrete services in WSMO terminology) that are models of the description but cannot be provided. Therefore, service discovery in this step cannot ensure that the discovered services will actually fulfil the requester goal. 4. During service contracting the remaining services' contracting capability is used to determine if the services can actually fulfil the requester goal. The contracting capability includes the conditions that have to be fulfilled for a successful service provision, as well as the relation of the required input to the results of the service.</p><p>The proposed model does not impose any restrictions on how to implement it for specific applications, but proposes some useful formalisms for providing such implementation.</p><p>The methodology proposed in this paper has some similarities with the WSMO approach, but there are also a number of differences. The notion of operation ontologies is very similar to the notion of pre-defined goals in WSMO. However, our methodology also requires the provider to use these operations for specifying his service descriptions in order to ensure comparability between service descriptions and requests. The two-step process to increase efficiency and precision is another similarity. However, the two steps differ slightly because the services considered in each approach have different characteristics: &amp; As geoprocessing services (typically) have no effects on the real world, only postconditions have to be considered. &amp; For geoprocessing services, there is no external influence on the results (e.g., the availability of rooms at a certain time for a hotel booking service) as assumed in WSMO. This means that every service execution can be described by the service's pre-and postconditions, i.e., its semantic description is correct. &amp; The WSMO approach is focused on goals with concrete instances (Bflights between Madrid and Innsbruck'') and on the delivered results. In contrast, we assume that a service requester is interested in a particular functionality (kind of computation) between types of objects (Bdistance between two points'').</p><p>Due to these differences, we do not consider a contracting phase nor require different intentions for output types as suggested in the WSMO approach. Rather, we put a stronger focus on the substitutability of functionality in both discovery steps. Also, we can take input values into account already in the first step, which should lead to increased precision over the WSMO approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Service Discovery in METEOR-S</head><p>The METEOR-S 15 project aims at automating the publication, discovery, description and control flow of web services by integrating existing web service standards such as WSDL with Semantic Web technologies. METEOR-S adds semantics (using ontologies) at two levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>: at the level of individual web services and at the level of the registries that store the services. For the annotation of individual web services, a bottom-up approach is followed i.e., WSDL message types, both inputs and outputs, are mapped to the appropriate concepts in domain specific ontologies. In addition to the annotation of WSDL inputs and outputs, WSDL operations are also mapped to ontological concepts from an operations domain ontology and preconditions and effects are specified <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The user goals are expressed using service templates based on the concepts from the domain ontologies. In such templates, information about the requested operation and its inputs and outputs, and (optionally) preconditions and effects can be specified. The matching process uses subsumption reasoning to match operations, inputs, outputs, preconditions and effects of the annotated services against the ones of the template describing the request.</p><p>The aim of annotating registries is to enable the classification of web services based on their domain. Registries are specialized in a given domain, and store web services related to that domain. A specialized ontology, the registries ontology, is used for annotating registries, mapping the registries to a given domain and giving additional information about the registry, relations with other registries and relations to other domains.</p><p>The annotation of registries and its specialization in domains helps to deal with a potentially huge number of published services. However, the METEOR-S approach to service description and discovery presents some limitations. Similarly to previous releases of OWL-S, the METEOR-S annotation does not relate inputs, outputs, preconditions and effects, and therefore provides an inaccurate description of the service functionality. Furthermore, as the service descriptions are WSDL-centred, METEOR-S can have the same problems as the SSM if the inputs or outputs of syntactic signature do not match those of the semantic signature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">State-Oriented Service Discovery in the DIANE Project</head><p>The development of the service description and discovery procedure in the DIANE project <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is motivated by the fact that services with identical messages flows (i.e., inputs and outputs) may offer completely different functionality, and that services with identical functionality may use different message flows to achieve this functionality. Therefore, the proposed approach does not rely on an explicit signature matching step (i.e., on matching inputs and outputs), but derives the necessary messages from the comparison of state before and after the execution of the service (which is represented as pre-and postconditions).</p><p>The DIANE service description (DSD) can be represented in three different notations: the formally defined notation f-dsd, which offers the full expressiveness of the language and is mainly used for representation; the graphical notation (g-dsd) which is used to facilitate user interaction; and a Java representation, which enables to use program logic, e.g., for implementing domain specific similarity measures.</p><p>One important feature of this approach is the distinction between service and request descriptions. Requests can be be fuzzy declarative sets of services, in which the requester can also specify preferences. Thus, the matchmaking is no longer based on generic heuristics (as the types of match presented in this paper) but only checks whether a given service description is a member of the (fuzzy) query set of the requester. This approach uses many interesting ideas that could be used to extend the approach presented in this work, most notably fuzzy sets for vague matching, an easy-to-use graphical notation for interacting with users and domain-specific similarity measures. We believe that especially the last feature could yield very interesting results for the geospatial domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Process-Oriented Service Discovery</head><p>The goal of the service discovery approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is to capture enough service and query semantics to substantively increase precision (of keywordbased approaches) without reducing recall or making it unrealistically difficult for people to express these semantics. The proposed approach is based on describing services as process models, for which tasks, subtasks, mechanisms (i.e., resources used by a process), inputs, outputs and exceptions are used as primitives. These models (as well as their components) are Bincluded in the appropriate place'' in a process ontology based on the MIT Process Handbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. This so-called indexing step is based on the assumption that service providers choose a process description from the Process Handbook, specialize this description and then manually index it (with tool support). For details on the indexing steps and possibilities for automating it, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Matching services are discovered using the Process Query Language (PQL), in which constraints on types and values of and relations between processes (and their components) can be expressed.</p><p>The approach resembles our proposed methodology in that the authors propose to use a common operation (or process) ontology from which specific descriptions are derived. However, their model for describing services is based on processes and their approach for indexing process descriptions in the existing ontology is less strict than the types of match proposed in this paper. We therefore believe that their approach is suited for describing complex (and more abstract) services (e.g., in ecommerce) rather than atomic geoprocessing services with subtle differences as in our running example. It might be possible to combine both approaches to describe more complex geoprocessing services composed of several simple ones.</p><p>The authors also criticize logic-based approaches (deductive retrieval in their terminology) such as the methodology proposed in this paper because of (1) the computational complexity of the proof process which can make it extremely slow, and (2) the difficulty to model the semantics of non-trivial queries and services using formal logic. The first problem is alleviated in our approach by introducing an effective filtering step before engaging in the computationally expensive theorem proving. In order to alleviate the second problem, we plan to devise a user interface and/or query language that enables the requesters and providers to easily express their requirements. This will be part of our future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we have presented a methodology for ontology-based discovery of geoprocessing services based on ontologies of geospatial operations and function subtyping. Operations from domain ontologies are used as templates for formulating descriptions of requirements and capabilities. This constrains the descriptions created by service providers and requesters and ensures greater recall during service discovery. Also, as the results achieved for the presented example indicate, the proposed methodology enables more highly expressive service descriptions and allows finer distinctions between similar services and thus will also lead to higher precision than keyword-based approaches to service discovery. At the same time, the procedure is kept efficient by performing service discovery in two steps-first filtering out potential services based on their semantic signatures and only then using FOL theorem proving for discovering the actually matching services.</p><p>Lessons Learned from the Running Example. The presented running example has illustrated how proposed methodology improves the discovery of geoprocessing services over existing keyword-based methods. However, it has also shown that, even when using operation ontologies, some services might be missed because their inputs or outputs do not fit those of adjacent services that have already been discovered. In the running example, this is the case for Service 4 which provides the functionality required by Susan in Scenario 2b, but whose input does not match the output provided by the GetLocation service. In such cases, the methodology should allow greater flexibility. For example, if Susan is aware that the outputs of GetLocation might be problematic but confident that she could solve these potential problems (e.g., by using a coordinate transformation service) she should be able to relax the constraints imposed by the GetLocation service's properties. Another solution would be to automatically search for services that could bridge the gap between the GetLocation and the requested distance service. One possibility for such a solution would be to use architecture patterns as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>The example has also shown that not all types of match introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> can be used for our chosen conceptualization. This will also be the case for other conceptualizations that introduce variables for stating pre-and/or postconditions that do not refer to input or output parameters of the service. Nevertheless, the types of match applied to the chosen examples (generalized predicate match and plug-in post match) led to the results that are intuitively expected.</p><p>Finally, the DL and FOL domain ontologies introduced for the example could represent a starting point for a generic domain ontology for geoprocessing operations as many of these operations (e.g., buffer) inherently depend on a definition of distance. Due to the problems mentioned above, however, alternative conceptualizations that do not require the introduction of variables, should also be considered.</p><p>Future Research. There are a number of issues that will be addressed in future research. First, the procedure, which has so far only been tested with the simple distance example, should also be tested with other examples. It has to be investigated whether it also works (well) with more complex examples or how it has to be adapted in order to do so. Such tests will also show whether (and how easily) the used conceptualization is extendible.</p><p>In order to be usable in the context of SDIs, the methodology should be implemented within an existing SDI architecture. This means primarily that it has to be integrated with existing catalogues of GI services. In the course of this work, the methodology should be combined with our approach for ontology-based discovery and retrieval of geographic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Service requesters and providers should be (graphically) supported in specifying their queries and advertisements to spare them the laborious and difficult task of specifying FOL and DL axioms. As some of these axioms (e.g., on the types of inputs and outputs) have so far been stated in both the DL and the FOL specification, it should also be investigated how the two levels of specifications can be more efficiently combined. Finally, the approach should be aligned with OGC's emerging Web Processing Service specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> once this has been stabilized and reached some maturity.</p><p>Two important assumptions for the presented methodology to work are that (1) geospatial domain ontologies (including operations) exist and (2) service providers have semantically annotated their services. To meet these assumptions, further research is required on how to (semi-) automatically derive domain ontologies (including operations) from existing sources such as the UML class diagrams in ISO standards and OGC specifications. Furthermore, it should be investigated how semantic descriptions can be derived (semi-)automatically from program code and/ or how providers and requesters can best be supported in creating semantic advertisements and queries.</p><p>Finally, one major restriction of the presented methodology should be addressed. In its current form it deals with operations and queries at very fine level of granularity. While the fine-grained differences between operations can be of interest for an expert user, they might not play a major role in everyday applications. Therefore, the approach should be extended to examples at higher levels of granularity, i.e., starting from abstract goals (e.g., BWhich countries are at threat by some other country's missiles?''). For such questions, primitives might be elementary operations (like distance) themselves, and service discovery might consist of combining these operations. Thus, a formalism for describing compositions of operations and their joint behaviour as well as a methodology for (automatically) deriving possible compositions will be required.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3 Different kinds of distance measures in various kinds of spaces: Euclidian distance in the plane (upper left), shortest path in a graph (upper right), geodesic distance (lower left) and Euclidian distance in R 3 (lower right)</figDesc><graphic coords="8,71.88,183.98,135.39,135.15" type="bitmap" /></figure>
