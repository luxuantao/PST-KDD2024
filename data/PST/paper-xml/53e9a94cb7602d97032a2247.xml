<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This work was motivated by the desire to model the appearance of human skin. A good skin model has many obvious applications, notably in the entertainment industry, where virtual actors have to appear more life-like. Despite its importance this problem has only been marginally addressed in computer graphics. Traditional reflection models usually model the effects of subsurface scattering using a combination of a Lambert cosine term and an ambient term. Creating convincing pictures of human skin with these models is an art entirely left to the animator.</p><p>In this paper we propose a novel reflection model for a skin layer bounded by rough surfaces. Our model incorporates multiple anisotropic scattering within the skin layer. The only other model in computer graphics that is related to ours is the one proposed by Hanrahan and Krueger <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Their analytical model only handles skin layers bounded by perfectly smooth surfaces and they only account for single scattering. To handle multiple-scattering they use a Monte-Carlo simulation to precompute the distribution. In our experience the Monte Carlo method is too expensive to perform for all combinations of the values of the skin layer's parameters. Recently, Pharr and Hanrahan propose a generalization of the BRDF which takes into account volumetric scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, their technique still relies on an expensive Monte-Carlo simulation. This problem is adressed in recent work by Jensen et al. who use a diffusion approximation of the equation of radiative transfer to derive an analytical approximation for the reflection of light from a skin layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>At first we expected to find an "off the shelf" solution from one of the related engineering fields. One such field, the medical sciences, studies the optics of skin for such applications as non-invasive surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Most research there either uses the Monte Carlo method or a technique known as adding-doubling borrowed from the astronomy literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Unfortunately, both techniques are too expensive for our purposes. Next we turned to the atmospheric sciences, where the reflection from the ocean is very close to that from a skin layer. There we found a very attractive model based on the discrete ordinate approximation of radiative transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In particular, the work of Stamnes et al. solves the problem for a skin layer bounded by smooth surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. To handle rough surfaces the Monte Carlo is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We briefly mention that the discrete ordinate technique has been used in global illumination before <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p><p>Based on this extensive bibliographical search, we decided to extend Jin and Stamnes work to include rough surfaces. For this we first needed a good Bidirectional Transmittance Distribution Function (BTDF) model. We are aware of only one such model in computer graphics based on the wave theory of light <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Unfortunately this model is fairly complex, so we derive a simpler one in this paper for the first time. Our model is an extension of the BRDFs of Cook-Torrance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and of van Ginneken et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Given the BRDF and the BTDF of the surfaces and the optical properties of skin we show how to efficiently solve the problem by a suitable "diagonalization" of the "transfer matrix." We use the machinery of Fourier transforms and eigenanalysis to perform this task. To build practical reflection models for computer graphics, we fit low-order splines to our discretized functions. Our approach is orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo methods, requires less memory, and does not suffer from any noisy artifacts.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section details the physics involved and introduces the equivalent discrete problem. In Section 3 we show how to solve the discrete problem efficiently. Section 4 presents a derivation of our BTDF. Section 5 clarifies many implementation issues and discusses the corresponding "skin shader". In Section 6 we present some results, while in Section 7 we conclude and discuss future research. Material of a rather technical nature is addressed in the appendices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Physical parameters</head><p>The basic physical quantity is the radiance , which gives the amount of radiant power flowing from a particular position in a particular direction. Following Hanrahan and Krueger <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> we assume that the skin depth is along the -direction and that the skin's properties are uniform in each -plane. We use the dimensionless optical depth ¢ instead of , where is the mean free path of a photon in the medium. Consequently, the radiance is a function of optical depth and direction. We represent a direction by an ordered pair ! #" $ &amp;% '! )( 10 32 54 where ( 6 87 @9 BA ¢C is the cosine of the elevation angle C and 2 is the azimuthal angle (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (left)). In the following we always assume that the cosine ( ED GF . We therefore denote a downward direction by H " I P% H ( 10 32 54 . The use of the minus sign is purely notational in this context.  The optical properties of the skin are entirely modeled by its albedo and its phase function . The albedo gives the fraction of light that is scattered versus absorbed, while the phase function gives the probability that a photon travelling in a direction " is scattered in another direction " . We rely on the Henyey-Greenstein phase function, a useful model frequently seen in the optics literature: % " 0 " 4 H % "! H $# % 7 @9 BA '&amp; 4 ©( 0) §1 Here &amp; is the angle between the directions " and " . The anisotropy factor ¢2 43 F 0 65 models how much light is scattered forward. We associate with the phase function a linear scattering functional:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">7 98 A@ % § 0 " 4 1 B DC E 'F 0G % " 0 " 4 % § 0 " 4 IH " 0<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the integration is over all possible directions. The reflection and refraction at the skin's boundaries are modeled as isotropic rough surfaces. In our model we assume that the skin has a uniform index of refraction P and is bounded above and below by media having indices equal to P RQ and P ( , respectively. Both the transmission and reflection models depend on a roughness parameter S . The BRDF and BTDF are denoted by T ¡ ¨% " #0 " 4 and U ¡ ¨% " #0 " 4 , respectively, for light com- ing from material £ 2 0 # 0 WV arriving at material X 2 0 # 0 WV , where, for example, T YQ models the reflection off of the top surface. This nomenclature is clarified in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. We associate with these distributions linear reflection and transmission operators:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">`¡ ¨8 A@ % § 0 ! #" 4 E G T ¡ ¨% ba #" 0 ! #" 4 % § 0 ca #" 4 ( H " 0<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">¡ ¨8 A@ % § 0 ! #" 4 E G U ¡ ¨% '! #" 0 ! #" 4 % § 0 ! #" 4 ( H " 0<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the integration is over the positive hemisphere and the signs depend on the BRDF or BTDF considered, e.g., T DQ has opposite signs from T Q as is evident from Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Equation of Transfer</head><p>An equation for the radiance within the skin is obtained by considering its variation in an infinitesimal cylinder aligned with the direction " . The change is equal to the amount of light scattered into this direction minus the light absorbed and scattered out of this direction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H ( H H H ! 7 98 A@ B0<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 7</p><p>is the scattering operator defined in Equation 1. To completely specify the problem, this equation requires boundary conditions at the top and the bottom of the skin layer. At the skin's surface ( F ) the downwelling radiance is equal to the transmitted radiance plus the internal reflections of the radiance coming from the internal layer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">% F 0 H " 4 1 U WQ % H " ¢¡ 0 H " 4 ! ` Q 8 A@ % F 0 H " 4 1<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Similarly, if we assume there are no sources below the skin, the upwelling radiance at the bottom of the layer ( ¤£ ) is given by % § ¥£ @0 " 4 ` ( 8 A@ % § ¥£ @0 " 4 1</p><p>Once Equation 4 is solved using these boundary conditions, the BRDF and the BTDF due to scattering in the skin's layer are equal to T ¤¦ % H " ¢¡ 0 " 4 Q 8 A@ % F 0 " 4 ( §¡ and U ¨¦ % H " ¢¡ 0 H " 4 1 ( 8 A@ % § ¥£ @0 H " 4 ( §¡ 0 respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Angular Discretization</head><p>We discretize the angular part of Equation 4 in two steps.

Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">9</ref>is the main equation of this paper. In the next section we show how to solve it efficiently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Direct Solution of the Discrete Problem</head><p>This section is inspired by the work of Jin and Stamnes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, our compact vector/matrix notation greatly simplifies the presentation. Our approach is also more general, since we consider surfaces of arbitrary roughness at the boundaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Diagonalization</head><p>We assume that the skin is composed of a layer with constant optical properties sandwiched between two isotropic rough surfaces. In order to simplify the notation in this section, we will drop the dependence of all quantities on the index "! ". This is justified because the equations for different terms in the cosine expansion are entirely decoupled.</p><p>In the skin the radiance satisfies the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">H u% § 4 H Mu% § 4 1</formula><p>Ignoring the boundary conditions for the moment, we see that this is a homogeneous vector ordinary differential equation. Such an equation is solved efficiently by putting the matrix M into diagonal form. Indeed, in diagonal form the equations are decoupled and can be solved analytically. Diagonalizing M is equivalent to computing its eigenvalues and eigenvectors: M VLV¦ Q . Here L is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of M:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L diag % ¨ § Q 0 ¡ ¡ ¡ @0 © § ¢ 0 H § Q 0 ¡ ¡ ¡ 0 H § ¢ 4</formula><p>where § ¡ F for £ 0 ¡ ¡ ¡ @0 3¥ and V contains the eigenvectors stored columnwise.

The vector u¡ in Equation 10 is to be determined from the boundary conditions. The radiance in the layer is then obtained by inverting our earlier transformation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">u% § 4 Vw% § 4 V L¢ u¡ 1</formula><p>(11) Our next step is to find a vector u¡ satisfying the boundary conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Solving the Discrete Problem: Boundary conditions</head><p>We have just shown that the radiance in each layer can be solved for directly in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the transfer matrix. We can rewrite Equation <ref type="formula">11</ref>separating the parts corresponding to upward and downward directions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">£ u¤ #% § 4 u¦ % § 4 ¦¥ £ V¤ V¦ V¦ V¤ ¥ £ E% § 4 u¤ ¡ E% H 4 u¦ ¡ ¥ 0 (12)</formula><p>where each of the matrices E% U 4 § L¨ contains half of the exponentials. The goal in this section is to compute the unknown vectors u¤ ¡ and u¦ ¡ given by Equations 5 and 6. First, let R ¡ ¨and T ¡ ¨denote the discrete versions of `¡ ¨and ¡ ¨respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Summary</head><p>First we restore the subscript "! " to indicate that the radiances of Equation <ref type="formula">16</ref>correspond to a single term in the cosine series. Consequently, the complete description of the radiances is given by the following vectors u ¦ ¡ 0 ¡ ¡ ¡ @0 u ¦ and u ¦ ¡ B0 ¡ ¡ ¡ @0 u ¦ 1</p><p>These radiances are for a particular incoming direction H " ¡ I % H ( §¡ 0 F B4 . To get a discrete description of the BRDF T ¦ of the skin layer we sample the incoming directions at the ordinates ( IQ 0 ¡ ¡ ¡ 0 ( ¢ . The discrete representation of the BRDF is, therefore, a collection of</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">£ ! matrices R¤ of size ¥ ¤ ¥ (! F 0 ¡ ¡ ¡ @0 £</formula><p>). The £ -th column of this matrix consists of the vector u ¦ ¤ computed for the incident direction % H ( ¡ 0 F B4 , £ 0 ¡ ¡ ¡ @0 3¥ . In a similar fashion we build a set of matrices T¤ for the BTDF U ¦ of the skin layer (! F 0 ¡ ¡ ¡ 0 £ ). A high level description of the algorithm that computes these matrices is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>We have precomputed these matrices for different values of the parameters that model the skin layer. These parameters are the transparency ¦ ¢ ¢¡ , the albedo , the anisotropy factor of the phase function, and the roughness S of the surfaces bounding the skin layer. Each parameter is dimensionless and takes on values between zero and one. The ratio of the indices of refraction is kept constant throughout: it is set to 1 B</p><p>, roughly that of human skin. The number of ordinates ¥ was determined from the discretizations of the BRDF and the BTDF of the skin's surface (derived in the next section). For a roughness S F 1 we neededed ¥ V F ordinates while for other values ¥ # B was sufficient. The number of cosine series is always set to twice the number of ordinates: £ # ¥ <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Because the scattering matrix depends only on and , we first computed the eigen- structures for a set of values of the parameters. We used the £ ¥¤ routine from EISPACK <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We encountered no numerical problems except when the albedo was exactly one. An easy fix is simply to set the albedo to a value almost equal to one, i.e., $ PF 1 ¦ §¦ §¦ §¦ §¦ §¦ . Once the eigenstructures were available we used them to precompute the reflection T ¦ and transmission U ¦ of the skin layer. We used the routine ¥¤ © from LINPACK to solve the linear system of Equation <ref type="formula">15</ref>.</p><p>The precomputation generates a huge data set. Our next task was to compress the data using well chosen approximations. We first experimented with the elegant nonlinear representation of Lafortune et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We did get some good matches using three cosine lobes. However, in many cases the non-linear least square solver got stuck in local minima. For these reasons we adopted a less efficient but more straightforward compression scheme. First, not all cosine terms need to be included. For the reflection at the top of the layer we found that in general, terms ( £ B</p><p>) were sufficient, while for the transmission at the bottom ( £ B</p><p>) terms were required. These numbers were obtained by visually comparing the data to the approximation. We further compressed the data by fitting a cubic Bezier surface to the data stored in the reflection (resp. transmission) matrix R¤ (resp. T¤ ). We constrained the control vertices to respect the symmetry of these matrices (Helmholtz reciprocity).</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> we demonstrate the effect of our parameters on the reflection and transmission functions. The simple shapes of the lobes first led us to believe that they might be modeled by simple analytical expressions. The variation with each parameter is, however, quite subtle and none of our analytical estimations could handle all variations at the same time. Analytical solutions are rare when multiple scattering is included. Even the simplest case of a semi-infinite constant medium with isotropic scattering does not admit an analytical solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The distributions are clearly different from a simple constant Lambert term. The simple analytical model of Hanrahan and Krueger is recovered for low albedos and smooth surfaces.</p></div>

In Appendix B we prove that:</p><p>H " ¢ % 7 @9 BA ¢C D ¡ H ( § 4 ¡ ( § H " ¤£ % 7 @9 BA ¢C ¡ 0 ¢¡ 4 7 @9 BA ¢C ¡ H " B0 where ( § ¦¥ 7 @9 BA ¢C ¡ ! ¡ H .

We prefer this shadowing function over the one used by Cook and Torrance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> since it is consistent with the underlying model for the surface.</p><p>The BRDF and the BTDF are shown for different ratios of indices of refraction ¡ and roughness values S in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The top figure corresponds to a ratio ¡ 1 B which is that of skin. These plots correspond to the functions T 'Q , U WQ , T Q and U Q of our skin model. As mentioned above we have validated our derivation using a Monte Carlo simulation. Whether this provides a good model for rough surfaces will have to be settled by experiment. At least, Cook and Torrance reported good agreement with experiment for the function T DQ [4]. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">The Skin Shader</head><p>We have implemented our reflection model as a shader plugin in our animation software MAYA. The plugin is available for free on our company's web page 1 . The web page also provides more information on the parameters of our skin shader. Several of our customers have recently started to use our shader in production with good results.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows several examples of human heads rendered using our new skin shader. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>.(a) compares our model (right) to a Lambert shader (left) and the Hanrahan-Krueger (HK) model (center). Our model seems to be a blend between these two models, which is consistent with the plots in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Unfortunately, the comparison is necessarily very vague. Indeed, we manually tried to find a set of parameters for both the Lambert shader and the HK model which was as close as possible to our results. In particular, we had to "brighten up" the HK model since it assumes singlescattering. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>.(b) shows our model illuminated by different area light sources. Notice also that we texture mapped both the albedo and the roughness of the lips. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>.(c) is similar for a male head. Finally 6.(d) demonstrates another application of our shader (notice that the surfaces have been bump mapped).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This paper presented a novel analytical model for the reflection and transmission of light from a skin layer bounded by rough surfaces. The model includes the effects of multiple anisotropic scattering within the skin. To the best of our knowledge a model of this generality has not appeared before in the optics literature.</p><p>Our model currently lacks any form of experimental validation. The differences between our model and a simple Lambert shader are not as dramatic as we had expected. The difference is, however, noticeable. We hope to compare our model to the Cornell data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and possibly to other data sets from other related disciplines. Also we hope to find a better compression scheme for our computed data, most likely a simple analytical model with a few parameters which can be fit using a non-linear optimization technique. </p><formula xml:id="formula_26">1 ¢¡ £¡ ¥¤ §¦ ©£ £ £ § ¢ ¥ ¢! ¥" £# %$ &amp; ¢¡ ' )( ¥$</formula></div>
