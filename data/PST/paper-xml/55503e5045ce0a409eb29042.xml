<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract-This paper proposes a novel base station (BS) coordination approach for intercell interference mitigation in the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access based cellular networks. Specifically, we first propose a new performance metric for evaluating end user's quality of experience (QoE), which jointly considers spectrum efficiency, user fairness, and service satisfaction. Interference graph is applied here to capture and analyze the interactions between BSs. Then, a QoE-oriented resource allocation problem is formulated among BSs as a local cooperation game, where BSs are encouraged to cooperate with their peer nodes in the adjacent cells in user scheduling and power allocation. The existence of the joint-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) has been proved, in which no BS player would unilaterally change its own strategy in user scheduling or power allocation. Furthermore, the NE in the formulated game is proved to lead to the global optimality of the network utility. Accordingly, we design an iterative searching algorithm to obtain the global optimum (i.e., the best NE) with an arbitrarily high probability in a decentralized manner, in which only local information exchange is needed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both validate the convergence and optimality of the proposed algorithm with fairness improvement. Index Terms-OFDMA, inter-cell interference mitigation, QoE, BS cooperation, potential game, Nash equilibrium, decentralized algorithm, global optimality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I NTER-CELL interference is a fundamental problem which limits the performance improvement in the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based cellular networks with reuse of the spectral resource. Traditionally this problem is majorly addressed by carefully planning the spectral resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, including conventional frequency planning (Reuse-1 and Reuse-3), fractional frequency reuse, partial frequency reuse, and soft frequency reuse. However, these approaches reduce inter-cell interference at the cost of decreasing the spectral efficiency. Future network evolutions are envisioned to employ a full (or an aggressive) frequency reuse to meet the rapidly growing demand of broadband mobile access. Therefore, efficient interference mitigation techniques are urgently required.</p><p>Recently, BS cooperation has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate inter-cell interference. Since any change of resource allocation in a single cell will affect the performance of the nearby cells, joint resource allocation over a cluster of neighboring cells via BS coordination proves to be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These solutions usually require neighboring BSs coordinate their resource allocation for the joint network utility optimization, which usually result in high cost in backhaul communications with huge control overhead. This paper treats the coordination problem in an alternative way where user transmission strategies and resource allocation schemes, rather than data flows, are coordinated across the BSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>; hence, much less backhaul coordination bandwidth is needed. Most state-of-the-art work concentrates on the (weighted) sum-rate maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, while the achievable solutions are generally far from global optimum. Moreover, the existing solutions introduce unfairness to edge users <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, because edge users usually experience more path loss while the network manager tends to privilege the users closer to the BS with better channel conditions in the resource allocation. Most existing work addresses fairness issue only by using network-level criteria like max-min but neglects the specific requirements of individual users.</p><p>In this paper, we take spectrum efficiency, fairness and user's requirements into consideration jointly to improve QoE in the formulated optimization problem. QoE-driven techniques adaptively allocate the limited resources to enhance end user experience so that they reduce the waste of radio resources compared with other techniques adopting the objective metrics, e.g., sum-rate, which neglect individual users' satisfaction of services. For example, if the users with better channel conditions have been allocated with adequate resources, QoEdriven optimizer would then privilege users with poor channel conditions who could experience substantial improvement of satisfaction. Therefore, QoE-driven techniques will bring fairness while increasing efficiency. This paper adopts the mean opinion score (MOS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to be the utility metric, which is widely used to provide a generic measure of the user's QoE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Challenges and Contributions</head><p>In this paper, we employ BS cooperation to solve the QoEoriented resource allocation problem in the multicell OFDMA networks, which consists of user scheduling and power allocation as a joint optimization decision by BSs. Furthermore, in the aggressive frequency reuse deployment, the co-channel interference makes the resource allocation among cells coupled and correlated. Moreover, the non-convexity of the utility metric (i.e., MOS) makes the problem more complicated. In this case, centralized algorithms cannot guarantee the global optimality over the network given that the demand on backhaul signaling and computational resources grows rapidly with the number of cells, subchannels and end users. In practical systems, the interference sources to individual users usually come from a small number of neighboring cells (which makes it possible to limit the backhaul signaling and complexity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Therefore, how to design an efficient distributed algorithm to find the globally optimal solution with only local information exchange throws a great challenge.</p><p>We study this problem by applying game theory to analyze the distributed decisions made at individual BSs considering the mutual interference and coupling among their strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The main contributions of our work are summarized below:</p><p>• An interference graph is generated to capture and analyze the interaction between BSs. Then, based on the interference graph, the network sum-utility maximization problem is formulated as a local cooperation game, where each BS acts as a rational player. Furthermore, we prove it to be an exact potential game, whose best NE point coincides with the optimal solution with the sum-utility maximization. • We design a decentralized iterative algorithm to obtain the best NE (i.e., the global optimum) with an arbitrarily high probability, where only local information exchange is needed between neighboring BSs. The convergence, optimality and computational complexity are investigated. Moreover, the fairness improvement by adopting QoE as the optimization goal is theoretically analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Related Work</head><p>In recent years, resource allocation for cellular networks has stepped into the focus of extensive studies, because i) coordinated resource allocation brings significant performance improvement by effectively mitigating the inter-cell interference, ii) coordination across multiple cells poses a great challenge not only in implementation, but also in finding the optimal solutions, since the inter-cell interference leads to inherent nonconvexity in the problem structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>One promising way is to use heuristic-based algorithms to obtain satisfactory solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Another way is to decompose the original problem into multiple subproblems and solve them iteratively <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Besides, there are some discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> concentrating on respective studies (e.g., subchannel allocation, power control) due to the intractability of joint optimization.</p><p>Furthermore, many researchers have referred to game theory to seek for a satisfactory solution. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, potential game based subchannel allocation algorithms for interference minimization are proposed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, taking the inter-cell interference into account, the authors study the transmit power control in multicell OFDMA systems by using non-cooperative game. However, almost all consider a simplified system model and just concentrate on only one aspect (either power control or subchannel allocation). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, joint subchannel and power allocation is investigated by using game theory. The existence and uniqueness of equilibrium are theoretically proved. However, this work is decomposed into two subgames, in which the subchannel assignment and power control are performed iteratively. Therefore, the obtained solution is suboptimal. Buzzi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> use potential game to make a comprehensive analysis on the joint subchannel and power allocation in a very general system model, but only suboptimal solution is obtained as well. Moreover, the existing game theoretic approaches mainly make an investigation on the existence and uniqueness of the NE point, but pay less attention to the relationship between the NE and the global optimum.</p><p>In addition, it should be noted that the coordinated resource allocation in the literature mainly concentrates on QoS optimization, which does not consider the user's satisfaction of services. QoE has recently been under the spotlight in wireless networks. General wireless multimedia transmission schemes have been well studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, in which resource allocation and multimedia scheduling are the focus. Hassan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> investigate the QoE-driven resource allocation from the perspective of the interaction between the provider and the VoIP user, which is naturally formulated as a non-cooperative game. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the authors study the QoE-oriented multiuser resource allocation in the OFDMA systems. To our knowledge, most QoE-driven resource allocation work is limited in singlecell optimization. Sheen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> discuss the performance evaluation and optimization of a general relay-assisted multicell network and a genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. However, this work aims at the joint optimization of the system parameters, including relay's position, reuse pattern, path selection, etc., which is out of the scope of our work.</p><p>To sum up, QoE-oriented resource allocation in multicell networks has not been well studied, and the existing solutions are generally far from global optimum. Therefore, in this paper, we employ BS cooperation to improve the efficiency of the solution from a game theoretic perspective. Accordingly, a decentralized iterative algorithm is designed to achieve the global optimum with an arbitrarily high probability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Model</head><p>We consider an OFDMA-based cellular network which consists of a set of L BSs, denoted by L = {1, 2, . . . , l, . . . L}. We assume each cell is served by a BS and BSs communicate with the users in a single-hop fashion. We also assume BSs are temporally synchronized. BSs and users are equipped with one transmit and one receive antenna, respectively. N = {1, 2, . . . , n, . . . N} is the network user set. The set of users served by BS l ∈ L is denoted by N l , N l ⊆ N , and l N l = N . Each user is connected to only one base station that is selected based on long-term channel quality measurement. Thus, N l ∩ N l = ∅, for l = l . We consider the universal frequency reuse deployment in which every cell shares the whole bandwidth. The available spectrum is divided into K subchannels 1 and the index set of all subchannels is denoted by K = {1, 2, . . . , k, . . . K}. N = |N | and K = |K| are the cardinalities of N and K, respectively. In this paper we focus on the study of downlink communications from BSs to the users. Our analysis can be easily extended to the uplink discussion.</p><p>1) MAC and Physical Layer: In the network, the spectral resource slots are shared by all cells, leading to an interference and noise impaired system. Let s k l ∈ N l denote the user connected to base station l in spectral slot k. When perfect synchronization is assumed, the discrete-time baseband signal received by user s k l in slot k is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r s k l = H l,s k l x s k l useful data + L i=1,i =l H l,s k i x s k i intercell interference + Z s k l noise ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x s k l and H l,s k l are the transmitted complex symbol and the complex channel response from BS l to user s k l , respectively. Z s k l is the additional noise, which is modeled as a white Gaussian variable with power E|Z s k l</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">| 2 = σ 2 .</formula><p>Suppose user n is connected with BS l, i.e., n ∈ N l . Let δ k l,n be the spectral slot allocation indicator to denote whether slot k is allocated to the user n in cell l: δ k l,n = 1 if the slot is allocated to the user; otherwise, δ k l,n = 0. Then, the signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of user n within cell l in slot k, is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">γ k l,n = δ k l,n p k l G k l,n L i=1,i =l δ k l,n p k i G k i,n + σ 2 , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p k l is the transmit power of BS l in slot k, G k l,n = |H k l,n | 2</formula><p>is the channel power gain from BS l to user n in slot k. 1 We will use spectral slot and subchannel interchangeably in this paper. Without loss of generality, we assume that the bandwidth of each subchannel is less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel so that flat fading is considered in each subchannel.</p><p>The corresponding achievable information rate is given by the following Shannon's formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R k l,n = B K log 2 1 + γ k l,n Γ , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where Γ =ln(5BER)/1.5 is BER gap. Then, the aggregate rate of user</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">n is R l,n = k∈K n R k l,n</formula><p>, where K n is the set of slots occupied by user n.</p><p>2) Application Layer: MOS is used as a measure of the user's QoE for the services like video streaming, file download, and web browsing. The value of MOS is distributed between 1 and 4.5. MOS = 1 reflects an unacceptable application quality, and MOS = 4.5 corresponds to an excellent quality experienced by the user.</p><p>The considered generic application characteristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> resembles a bounded logarithmic relationship between perceived quality and data rate as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, described by the MOS as a function of the data rate,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">MOS l,n (R l,n ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 4.5, R l,n ≥ R 4.5 l,n , a log R l,n b , R 1.0 l,n &lt; R l,n &lt; R 4.5 l,n , 1, R l,n ≤ R 1.0 l,n ,<label>(4a)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">a = 3.5 log R 4.5 l,n /R 1.0 l,n , (<label>4b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">) b = R 1.0 l,n R 1.0 l,n R 4.5 l,n 1/3.5 , (<label>4c</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">) 0 ≤ R 1.0 l,n &lt; R 4.5 l,n , ∀n ∈ N l . (<label>4d</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>The semilogarithmic plot of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> visualizes the related parameters: the parameter a determines the slope of MOS l,n (R l,n ) while b shifts the curve along the X-axis. Each user's application characteristic can be parameterized by only two parameters, {R 1.0 l,n , R 4.5 l,n }, or alternatively {a, b}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem Formulation</head><p>Since the system is based on OFDMA, intra-cell multi-user access is orthogonal, while inter-cell multi-user access is simply superposed due to full reuse of spectrum. It is the superposition of the slots that results in severe co-channel interference, which majorly limits the system performance. Therefore, it is intuitive to decouple the optimization of resources in various spectral resource slots (i.e., frequency bands, or sub-channels), and we may study the user scheduling and power allocation which maximize the system performance in a particular slot <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We will suppress the slot index hereafter, concentrating in one arbitrary slot. In any given spectral resource slot shared by all cells, we denote the user that is granted access to the slot (i.e., scheduled) in cell l by s l ∈ N l .</p><p>Definition 1: A scheduling vector characterizes the set of users simultaneously scheduled across all cells in the same slot: s = (s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s l , . . . , s L ), where [s] l = s l . Noting that s l ∈ N l , the constraint set of scheduling vectors (i.e. the scheduling strategy space) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">S = N 1 ⊗ N 2 ⊗ • • • ⊗ N L , where ⊗ denotes the Cartesian product.</formula><p>Definition 2: A transmit power vector characterizes the transmit power values used by each BS to communicate with its respective scheduled user: p = (p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p l , . . . , p L ), where [p] l = p l . Note that in real practice, the cellular standards like the 3GPP LTE standard only support discrete power control<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> in the downlink. We assume each BS can use M ≥ 2 different power levels for transmission, namely {λ 1 P l,max , λ 2 P l,max , . . . , λ M P l,max }, where 0 = λ 1 &lt; λ 2 &lt; . . . &lt; λ M = 1. Then, the constraint set of transmit power vectors is given by P = {p|p l ∈ {λ 1 P l,max , λ 2 P l,max , . . . , λ M P l,max },∀l = 1, . . . , L}.</p><p>Base stations are coordinated to jointly determine the optimal scheduling vector and transmit power vector which maximize the system utility (i.e., MOS). From the system optimization point of view, the sum-utility optimal resource allocation problem can now be formalized simply as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(s opt , p opt ) = arg max s∈S,p∈P U 0 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where U 0 = l∈L MOS l = l∈L n∈N l ω l,n MOS l,n is the network utility function, ω l,n is the weight of the scheduled user in the lth cell.</p><p>Remark 1: The sum-MOS optimal joint user scheduling and power allocation problem for a multicell wireless network belongs to a class of combinatorial optimization problems; finding the globally optimal solution (s opt , p opt ) is NP-hard. Hence, standard optimization techniques cannot be applied directly and even centralized algorithms cannot guarantee the globally optimal solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. INTERFERENCE GAME FOR QOE-ORIENTED BS COORDINATION</head><p>In this section, we discuss on the distributed solution of the above problem (5) by using game theory. The ability to model individual, independent decision makers, whose strategies are interactional, makes game theory particularly attractive to analyze the performance of decentralized network/framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Interference Graph</head><p>In order to quantify the inter-cell interference, we employ the interference metric (IM) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">IM i l = 1 |N l | n∈N l G i,n G l,n ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where G i,n is the channel gain from BS i to user n ∈ N l , and |N l | is the number of elements in N l . Notice that the ratio G i,n /G l,n indicates the amount of interference caused by BS i to user n, and IM i l is simply calculated by averaging the ratio G i,n /G l,n over all users served by BS l.</p><p>The interference relationship is now characterized by a directional graph G d = (L, ε). The graph G d consists of the BS set L, and a set of edges ε ∈ L 2 . Denote each edge as an ordered pair (i, l), obviously, (i, l) ∈ ε. In cellular networks, the transmission is severely interfered with only by BSs located in a few surrounding cells, and the interference from the remote BSs is trivial. To capture the near-far effect, deciding the edge of the interference graph is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Only if the value of IM i l is larger than a predefined threshold IM 0 l , there is an edge from BS i to l, which means BS i causes non-ignorable interference to cell l. Moreover, since the mutual interference is not symmetrical (IM i l = IM l i ) in the cellular system, the produced interference graph is unilateral with directional edges, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Then for each BS l, the following two neighbor sets can be defined:</p><p>• the in-neighbor set It is worth noting that other metrics can also be used to decide the interference graph (e.g., simply based on the geographic location of BSs and users <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, or further considering the traffic load, etc.). However, there would be little variation in the following game model and the main conclusions. Since the optimal construction of the interference graph is not the focus of this work, we adopt the metric in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in order to perform convictive algorithm comparison.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">B in l : B in l = {i ∈ L : (i, l) ∈ ε}. • the out-neighbor set B out l : B out l = {j ∈ L : (l, j) ∈ ε}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Game Model With Local BS Cooperation</head><p>Based on the interference graph, the game is formally denoted by G = [L, {S l ⊗ P l } l∈L , G d , {U l } l∈L ], where L = {1, 2, . . . , L} is the set of players (i.e., BSs), S l ⊗ P l is the set of available joint power and channel allocation strategy for player l, and U l is the utility function of player l. To improve the efficiency of the game and obtain the globally optimal solution, the utility function of each player l is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">U l (p l , p D l , s l , s D l ) = MOS l p l , p B in l , s l , s B in l + i∈B out l MOS i p i , p B in i , s i , s B in i ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where D l represents the interacting neighbor set of player l, p D l ∈ P D l and s D l ∈ S D l denote the power allocation and user scheduling strategy profile of player l's interacting neighbors (excluding l), respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">P D l ≡ ⊗P i , S D l ≡ ⊗S i , ∀i ∈ D l ,</formula><p>are the sets of action profiles.

Then, the local cooperation game is expressed as follows:</p><p>(G) : max </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">p l ∈P l ,s l ∈S l U l (p l , p D l , s l , s D l ) , ∀l ∈ L.

Thus, according to the definition given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, G is an exact potential game with network utility U 0 serving as the potential function. Exact potential game is a special kind of game since it admits several promising properties, among which the most important one is that every exact potential game has at least one pure strategy NE point. Therefore, Theorem 1 is proved.</p><p>The players in the game focus on maximizing their individual utility functions, as specified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. This may result in inefficiency and dilemma, which is known as tragedy of commons <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Although Theorem 1 demonstrates that this game has at least one pure NE point, analyzing the achievable performance of NE points of a general exact potential game is interesting and important. Theorem 2: The globally optimal solution of the network sum-MOS maximization problem constitutes a pure strategy NE of G.</p><p>Proof: It is proved by D. Monderer and L. S.

Furthermore, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and the definition of network utility U 0 , we know that the potential function coincides with the network utility U 0 . Therefore, all Nash equilibria maximize the network utility U 0 either locally or globally, and the best NE serves as the global optimum of the network utility. Hence, Theorem 2 is proved.</p><p>According to Theorem 2, in order to achieve the global optimum, we only need to develop an effective algorithm to obtain the best NE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DECENTRALIZED ITERATIVE ALGORITHM FOR ACHIEVING GLOBALLY OPTIMAL SOLUTION</head><p>With the joint power allocation and user scheduling problem now formulated as an exact potential game, there are several learning algorithms available in the literature to achieve the pure strategy NE, e.g., best response dynamic <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, fictitious play <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and no-regret learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. However, all of them aim at achieving an equilibrium solution, and are easily trapped in an undesirable equilibrium. Recently, a γ-logit approach has attracted significant attention in potential game theory, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, due to its favorable property of equilibrium selection and exploring global optimum. In this section, we propose a γ-logit based decentralized iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal solution to the problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> with an arbitrarily high probability. The algorithm runs at the beginning of each scheduling interval and has multiple iterations in which the user scheduling and the transmit power are updated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Algorithm Description</head><p>Let p l (t), s l (t) be the transmit power level and the user assignment of BS l at iteration t, respectively, for l = 1, . . . , L and t ≥ 0. The proposed procedure is described in Algorithm 1 and the schematic diagram is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>γ-logit based decentralized iterative algorithm</head><p>Initialization: Set the iteration t = 0, and let each BS l, ∀l ∈ L, select the maximum power level P l,max .

Then, each selected BS computes its current utility value U l (t) by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">7</ref>) through the communication<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> with neighboring BSs. 2) Exploration: Each selected BS l ∈ C(t) randomly chooses a power level p ∈ {λ 1 P l,max , λ 2 P l,max , . . . , λ M P l,max } with equal probability 1/M . Then, based on the new transmit power levels, BS l as well as its neighbors independently decides its best user assignment ŝi (t) as<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> ŝi (t) = arg max</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">n∈N i ω i,n MOS i,n , ∀i ∈ B out l ∪ {l} , (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_44">)</formula><p>The BSs adhere to their selections in an estimation period and calculate their respective MOS value. Then, the selected BS l ∈ C(t) computes its exploring utility value Ûl (t) by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">7</ref>) through the communication with its neighboring BSs.</p><p>3) Strategy Updating: Each selected BS l updates its power level according to the following rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">Pr (p l (t + 1) = p) = exp{β Ûl (t)} Ψ Pr (p l (t + 1) = p l (t)) = exp{βU l (t)} Ψ , (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_46">)</formula><p>where Ψ = exp{β Ûl (t)} + exp{βU l (t)} and β is a positive parameter. Meanwhile, all the other BSs keep their selections unchanged, i.e., p i (t + 1) = p i (t), ∀i ∈ L \ C(t). Then, based on the updated power levels, each BS recomputes the best user assignment s i (t + 1) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. End loop until the stopping criterion is met.</p><p>In order to find the globally optimal solution, i) neighboring BSs cooperate to exchange information directly <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> and only local information is involved, ii) interacting neighbors are not allowed to simultaneously change the transmit power level in the proposed algorithm. In the player selection step of Algorithm 1, the selection of the non-interacting BSs set can be implemented through contention mechanisms over a common control channel or a priority-based method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The stop criterion can be one of the following: i) the maximum number of iterations is reached, ii) the variation of the network utility during a period is less than a predefined threshold.</p><p>The γ-logit based decentralized algorithm is inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, where the idea of probabilistic decision making is proposed and developed. The probabilistic decision making rule in step 3 is referred to as Boltzmann exploration strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and the parameter β is analogous to the concept of temperature in simulated annealing. We introduce such a probabilistic strategy selection into our algorithm for the coordinated resource allocation problem in order to escape from local optimal points and finally converge to the optimal NE (i.e., global optimum). In addition, the same resource allocation problem is also addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, while the designed algorithm there is essentially the best response (BR) in which each player explores its whole strategy space and selects the best strategy. It should be noted that the best response may easily get trapped at an undesirable NE <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>The basic requirement for the convergence of the existing logit algorithm is that only one player updates its action at one time <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. However, in a large-scale multi-cell network, the scheme of only one player's strategy updating would slow the convergence of the algorithm. To accelerate the convergence, we improve the algorithm by allowing multiple (non-neighboring) players to update their respective actions simultaneously. Secondly, in the typical logit algorithm, each active player's strategy updating is based on the exploration in the whole strategy space. Our problem is joint power allocation and user scheduling. Thus, the strategy space is twodimensional, and each active player should explore the action from the two-dimensional strategy space. In this case, the complexity is high, and the convergence speed slows down. To decrease the complexity and also accelerate the convergence, we modify the algorithm by decomposing the joint problem into two steps (i.e., reducing the scale of the explored strategy space) while keeping the optimality of the solution. The convergence of the proposed modified algorithm needs to be revisited, which will be proved in Subsection C.</p></div>

Computational Complexity Analysis</head><p>In each iteration, each selected BS needs a random number to choose a power level with a computational complexity of O(1), and then decides the best user assignment with a complexity of O(|N l |). As for the computation of the MOS value, it needs |B in l | + 1 additions and |B in l | + 5 multiplications (divisions) to first compute the information rate, and then two comparisons and no more than 2 multiplications and one logarithmic operation to calculate the MOS value. Then, it needs |B out l | -1 additions to compute the utility U l according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Thus, the total complexity for computing the utility is O(|B in l | • |B out l |).

In this case, the scale of the neighbor set will be larger, and more interfering BSs will be incorporated into the coordination to further improve the performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE I TRANSMITTED VIDEO STREAMS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Description and Parameters Setting</head><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we consider a 49-cell OFDMA network configuration, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. Each hexagonal cell has a radius of 500 meters, and each BS is located at the center of its serving cell, and adjacent BSs are separated by √ 3/2 km from each other. To investigate the case of severe inter-cell interference, 8 remote users (each with a separate video stream) are generated as a uniform distribution within the edge-region of each cell (at least 400 meters away from the BS). Parameters of the videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> and the weight of each user is set to be 1 for simplicity. The maximal transmit power of each BS is set to be 46 dBm, and is equally split across subchannels. The BER gap Γ is set to be 1. The total bandwidth B is divided into M = 16 subchannels similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the bandwidth of each subchannels is set to be 200 KHz.</p><formula xml:id="formula_83">G k l,n = |H k l,n |</formula><p>2 is the channel power gain from BS l to user n on subchannel k, which is expressed as G k l,n = (d l,n ) -θ ε k l,n , where d l,n is the distance between BS l and user n, θ is the path loss exponent and ε k l,n is the fading coefficient. Rayleigh fading model is considered in the simulation, and the channel gains are exponentially distributed with unit-mean. The pass loss exponent θ is set to be 3.7 and the noise power experienced at each receiver is assumed identical and has a power of -130 dBm.</p><p>In the proposed algorithm, the obtained solution is closer to optimum given a larger β, at the cost of convergence time <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. To achieve a tradeoff between optimality and convergence speed, we choose β = t/10 in the simulation, where t is the iteration step. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Convergence and Optimality</head><p>The convergence curve of the proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, and the convergence curve of the best response (BR) algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is presented for comparison. In order to capture the convergence behavior, the results are achieved by single simulation trial. Moreover, the globally optimal solution is plotted by exhaustive search to evaluate the optimality of our proposed algorithm. Because the global optimum cannot be found by existing computing techniques in large scale networks, this figure studies a 7-cell small network (cell 1-7 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). The number of power levels is set to be 4. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, the network utilities by the two algorithms are updated in each iteration and both greatly improved at the convergence time. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm can achieve the global optimum with an arbitrarily high probability, while the BR algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> only obtains a local optimum. It should be noted that the BR algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> converges faster than our proposed algorithm, since the probabilistic updating is employed in our algorithm for global optimum. Additionally, our algorithm shares the same amount of signaling exchange and communication overhead as the BR algorithm. The detailed signaling overhead analysis and comparison can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and the interested readers can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for further reading.</p><p>Next, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(a) and (b) present the power allocation and user scheduling strategy updating versus the number of iterations, respectively. The evolution of number of players selecting different power levels is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6(a)</ref>. It is seen that the number of players on different power levels remains unchanged in about 80 iterations, which further validates the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, the user scheduling strategy updating is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6(b)</ref>, where only 3 cells' strategies are shown. In fact, the other cells' strategy updating is quite similar, which is omitted for concision and brevity.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, we compare the proposed algorithm with stateof-the-art algorithms (best response (BR) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, fictitious play <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, no-regret learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>). The results are obtained by simulating 500 independent trials and then taking the average value. The stop criterion for each trial  is that the maximum number of iterations (200 iterations) is reached. It is noted that the average utility achieved by the proposed algorithm may not reach global optimum within finite number of iterations, as analyzed in Section IV-C. Among these 500 trials, the globally optimal solution was reached by the proposed algorithm for 69 trials within about 170 iterations, and in the remaining 431 trials the global optimum cannot be found within 200 iterations. However, the result at 200th iteration is close to the global, and the marginal gain decreases while the marginal cost increases significantly. Therefore, the result at the 200th iteration is a good approximation of the optimal one. Besides, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows that the average utilities achieved by different algorithms all increase with the number of iterations. In specific, the BR algorithm and the fictitious play converge fastest, the proposed algorithm converges relatively slower, and the convergence speed of the no-regret learning algorithm is slowest. However, all algorithms converge within 200 iterations. In terms of the achieved network utility, all the algorithms present good performance. In more details, the proposed algorithm is near-optimal, the BR algorithm and the fictitious play follow, while the performance of the no-regret algorithm is relatively worse. It is theoretically proved that the BR algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and the fictitious play <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> can converge to  NE in potential games, which is either globally or locally optimal solution of this problem. However, the no-regret learning proves to converge only to the correlated equilibrium (CE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, which does not show a clear relationship with the global/local optimum. Therefore, the no-regret algorithm presents relatively worse performance.</p><p>As analyzed in Section IV-C, there exists a tradeoff between performance and complexity (convergence speed). In order to get a clear understanding of the performance loss, we present in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> the network utility achieved by the proposed algorithm when different values of β are selected. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows that the larger β is, the closer to optimum the proposed algorithm can achieve. However, the smaller β is, BSs are more inclined towards uniformly playing all their actions, which yields lower performance gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Moreover, when β is small, the convergence curve fluctuates, since it may oscillate around several good solutions. Besides, we plot Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> to further evaluate how the selection of parameter β affects the achieved network utility. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, larger β yields higher network utility, but further increasing β beyond 140 only obtains marginal gains of network utility.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Network Utility</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm in terms of different power levels (M = 2, 4, 8). Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the normalized power levels are set to be {0, 1}, {0, 1/4, 1/2, 1} and {0, ( √ 2) i /8, i = 0, . . . , 6} for M = 2, 4, 8, respectively. As we can see from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>, increasing M from 2 to 4 brings significant performance gain, while further increasing the number of power levels beyond 4 only achieves marginal benefits. Moreover, the increase of the number of power levels makes the convergence of the algorithm slow down.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>, we study the performance of our proposed algorithm under different sizes of the in-neighbor set in the whole 49-cell network, and the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is also plotted for comparison. By properly selecting the interference threshold IM 0 l , the size of the in-neighbor set, |B in l |, ∀l, is set to be B, which is varied from 2 to 12 in the simulation. Increasing B is beneficial since a larger number of interfering BSs are coordinated; however, increasing B inevitably increases signaling overhead as well as computational complexity in each iteration of the distributed procedure. Furthermore, when B is larger  than 6, increasing B cannot bring substantial performance improvement. In practical implementation, we should make a tradeoff between performance and signaling overhead. Based on the simulation results, setting the size of the in-neighbor set to be 6 is appropriate in the studied large-scale network for good performance. Moreover, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> also shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithm (especially when B is larger than 6). Additionally, increasing the number of transmit power levels beyond 4 will not obtain significant benefits by both algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Fairness Evaluation</head><p>In this part, we perform the fairness comparison of the two different algorithms with different optimization goals. Since we focus on the fairness among users, users in a single cell are investigated. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> shows the evolution of Jain's fairness index (JFI) versus the number of available subchannels, K. The JFIs in terms of achievable rate and utility are presented. The JFI of utility is higher than that of rate, because the utility function reduces the gap between users' rates to minor difference of MOS values (1 to 4.5).</p><p>Secondly, the JFIs in both subfigures of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> get improved with the increasing number of subchannels due to the multichannel diversity gain, which is the advantage of OFDMA in frequency-selective channels. A user experiencing fading on one subchannel, can be scheduled on another when it meets a better channel, if there are enough subchannels.</p><p>Last but not least, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> further validates the claim in Theorem 5 that the proposed algorithm for sum-MOS maximization can achieve significant fairness improvement against the existing sum-rate optimal scheme, since sum-rate optimization tends to privilege users with better channel conditions, who are generally closer to the base-station. To better illustrate how the sum-MOS optimal scheme performs, the rate and utility achieved by each user are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>, where the users are sorted in descending order of their performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have investigated the multicell coordination among multiple BSs for interference mitigation in the QoEoriented resource allocation. A game-theoretic approach has been proposed in which the existence of the joint-strategy NE has been proved. Then, the globally optimal solution for the network sum-utility maximization has been obtained using a decentralized iterative algorithm with an arbitrarily high probability, where only local information exchange is involved. The proposed algorithm has been analyzed and proved to converge to the best NE (i.e., global optimum). Moreover, fairness among users has been improved with theoretical analysis. Simulation results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>For our future work, we will extend the presented model to the case where base stations have multiple antennas. It is also interesting and challenging to extend the model to the heterogeneous networks such as a mixture of macrocells and small cells. In addition, considering the negative impact to the environment caused by CO 2 emissions and the depletion of non-renewable energy resources, energy efficiency is another potential topic.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
