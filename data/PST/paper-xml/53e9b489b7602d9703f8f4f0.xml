<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>I N THIS PAPER, we examine the competition of two opposed memes across interconnected agents by extend the popular susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) compartmental model to construct a novel propagation scheme. We are inspired by the popularity of epidemic models spanning various disciplines. In fact, epidemic models already accurately describe various network spreading phenomena such as the spread of social information, computer viruses, fashion trends, religious beliefs, market penetration and product adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Throughout this work, we use the general term "meme" to represent the propagating datum, but, without loss of generality, we may easily substitute the term "computer virus," "flu," or "rumor."</p><p>In our scenario, we consider two memes spreading across a population of individuals. A meme's ability to jump from individual to individual is governed by a number of factors unique to the meme itself. Thus, at a network level, the world of each meme is unique. We capture the unique network views of each competing meme through a novel graph structure we Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">August 16, 2012</ref>; revised January 30, 2013. X. Wei and I.

Each meme propagates across a unique plane representing a unique connectivity between individuals in our system. A composite network C is a tuple of nodes N and two edge sets E 1 , E 2 , i.e, C = (N, E 1 , E 2 ), where E 1 ≡ E 2 . We further assume that each individual may "possess" a single meme at a time, a constraint we refer to as mutual exclusivity.</p><p>The following example can make this problem more concrete. Consider the 2011 Egyptian revolution, which according to reports was partly coordinated via Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. To counter such a Twitter campaign, a tech-savvy government could inject confusing and competing information using a malicious Facebook application that spreads to someone's friends. Then, which propagation will win? Hence a focal point of our paper is to predict the winner, by looking at the connectivity and the propagation behavior of its "memes." Naturally, another important question is what means one could use to influence the outcome of these competing information dissemination campaigns.</p><p>Interestingly, previous work has not focused on this problem. In fact, most previous efforts either studied a single epidemic on a single topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, or studied two pathogens, but on the same topology, and under the assumption that the two viruses appear one after the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. More recent work has studied the quarantining techniques in the case of computer viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, but it has not attempted to study the problem analytically or derive the 0733-8716/13/$31.00 c 2013 IEEE conditions that predict the outcome in the composite networks. We discuss previous work in more detail in §VII.</p><p>In our earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we provided a rigorous formulation of competing memes on composite networks using a modified susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) propagation mechanism. We also proposed a Non-Linear Dynamic System (NLDS)-based solution for the epidemic threshold, which determines the phase transition of the behavior of the system. This paper subsumes our previous work, and we briefly review the formulation and modeling of the problem for completeness. A key characteristic of our work is that it is applicable for any pair of topologies for the composite network. To validate our work, we use both synthetic composite networks with up to 50,000 of nodes, and a real composite network (specifically, mobile calls and text messages for an enterprise with 235 users for a given mobile carrier). In summary, our main contributions are:</p><p>1) We propose EigenPredictor, a method to predict which meme wins. The method relies on the insight from our analytical work mentioned above and uses multinomial logistic regression. A key strength of our method is that it can predict dominance by capturing the complex interplay of the two memes using just the first eigenvalues of appropriately defined system matrices for each meme. In extensive simulations with real and synthetic data, our method can predict the winner (dominating meme) with high accuracy, typically more than 95%. 2) We design and evaluate several suppression strategies based on the insights obtained from our analysis. We focus on two problems: (a) Unilateral Suppression, where we want to quench one meme while allowing the other to progress relatively unimpeded; and (b) Concurrent Suppression, in which we wish to eliminate both memes. Both suppression objectives are constrained by the number of allowed interventions, that is, the maximum number of nodes we can select to suppress the spread of the memes. 3) We evaluate the effect of cross-contamination between the layers of the composite network. In the crosscontamination scenarios, we allow the meme from one network to eventually "transform" into a meme on the other network. For example, think of a rumor propagating in Facebook being transformed into a rumor spread on twitter by an individual user. Cross-contamination adds a new dimension to the dynamic behavior of the competition, and this is arguably the first study that formulates and studies crossing-over.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present the model and problem definitions in Section II and describe the proofs for the threshold in Section III. We present the EigenPredictor in Section IV. We show how to manage propagation and the effect of cross-contamination in section V. We discuss future directions in Section VI. In Section VII we review related work, and Section VIII concludes our paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Our SI 1 I 2 S Propagation Model</head><p>We now present our meme propagation model for the competing memes; Table I explains our terminology. The propagation model is based on the popular "flu-like" SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We name our model SI 1 I 2 S (Susceptible -Infected 1 -Infected 2 -Susceptible). Each node in the graph can be in one of three states: Susceptible (healthy), I 1 (infected by M 1 ), or I 2 (infected by M 2 ). The state transitions are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref>.</p><p>Meme persistence: δ. If a node is in state I 1 (or I 2 ), it recovers on its own with probability δ 1 (or δ 2 ). This parameter captures the persistence of the meme in an inverse way: a high δ means low persistence. Note that we assume that a node can only be infected by one meme, it cannot be infected by the other.</p><p>Meme strength: β. A healthy node gets infected by neighbors that got infected, and the meme strength is captured by β 1 and β 2 . This potential infection is passed to a healthy neighbor in the absence of other interactions and we call this potential infection-in-isolation as an attack. In the following, we decide which infection succeeds (infects a susceptible node i) . Let C 1 be the number of attacks (each happening with probability β 1 independently) by node i's neighbors which are in state I 1 (infected by M 1 ); similarly, let C 2 be the number of neighbors infected by M 2 . Then, we have three possible cases for a node in the Susceptible state:</p><p>• node i remains in the Susceptible state if C 1 = 0 and C 2 = 0. • node i gets infected with M 1 with probability C1 C1+C2 .</p><p>• node i gets infected with M 2 with probability C2 C1+C2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem Definitions</head><p>Given the competing memes model described above, we now define the specific questions and problems that we address in this work. The input for all the problems is as follows: Basic Input: (1) a composite network's adjacency matrices A 1 and A 2 ; and (2) the competing memes model's parameters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">β 1 , δ 1 for M 1 and β 2 , δ 2 for M 2 .</formula><p>Given this basic input, we describe 4 problems, evenly divided into two broad categories: (1) Dominance and Extinction and (2) Meme Control and Suppression.</p><p>1) Dominance and Extinction: Our first two problems are motivated by the natural question of predicting the winner of the competition between the two memes. Problem 1: Epidemic Threshold. Given: The basic input. Find: A condition (threshold values for λ 1 and λ 2 ) under which the memes, either individually or collectively, die-out. This problem deals with the question of the epidemic threshold for our model, since under the threshold, neither meme survives. Problem 2: Meme Dominance. Given: The basic input. Find: Under the given set of parameters, which meme will dominate the system? Clearly, this question is more interesting in the case where one or both memes are above the epidemic threshold. Defining dominance. Intuitively, we say that a meme dominates over the other meme if it manages to capture more nodes. The definition hides several subtleties, which have to do with the asymptotic behavior of the system, namely what happens as time goes to infinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, as we are reliant on simulations, we are forced to adopt a more practical definition. First, we examine the behavior, after a sufficient warm-up period, when the system converges to some relatively stable state (with only small fluctuations of its infected nodes). We repeat our experiments 100 times and observe less than a 2% variance in the results. Assuming that we are beyond the warm-up period, we say that a meme prevails if it has infected at least θ% more network nodes than the other meme.</p><p>For the results presented here we used θ = 10, but we have also experimented with other θ values and observed similar qualitative results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Meme Control and Suppression:</head><p>The remaining problems involve our ability to control the outcome of the meme spread and competition. Problem 3: Unilateral Suppression. Given: The basic input, and a subset of k nodes. Find: The nodes to suppress, so that we maximize the chances that M 2 wins. Specifically, we want to find the best nodes to suppress meme M 1 , so that we favor M 2 . This problem is relevant in a market penetration of competing products, creating buzz in blogs, or a virus-versus-antivirus propagation problem in a computer or epidemiological setting. Problem 4: Concurrent Suppression. Given: The basic input, and subset of k nodes. Find: The best nodes to suppress that cause both memes to die-out. That is, we want to find the best set of nodes that reduce the spreading effectiveness of both memes. As an example of concurrent suppression, imagine the spread of two distinct, yet equally false rumors propagated through two distinct fringe pseudo-political groups that share memberships. Due to the potential damage such rumors may cause, both will be suppressed by preventing critical members from spreading the falsehoods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE EPIDEMIC THRESHOLD</head><p>In this section, We want to analytically determine the epidemic threshold (Problem 1). First, a discrete-time Non-Linear Dynamical System (NLDS), whose general form is p t+1 = g(p t ), is used to approximate the infection process. The NLDS gives the evolution of the system with time, as we explain below. First, the probability that node i is infected by neighbor node j with meme M 1 at time t is β 1 P 1 j (t-1). Then, the probability ζ 1 i (t) that node i does not receive the infection of M 1 from its neighbors (here, we assume the neighbors are independent) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ζ 1 i (t) = Π j∈i s neighbors (1 -β 1 P 1 j (t -1))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Thus, we have the probability that node i receives the infection of M 1 at time t from its neighbors is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 -ζ 1 i (t) = 1 -Π j∈i s neighbors (1 -β 1 P 1 j (t -1))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>With the same reasoning, we can derive the probability of that node i receives the infection of M 2 from its neighbors at time t is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 -ζ 2 i (t) = 1 -Π j∈i s neighbors (1 -β 2 P 2 j (t -1))<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Now, we have the probability that node i is infected by M 1 from its neighbors at time t is the probability that node i receives the infection of M 1 and does not receive infection of M 2 from its neighbors at time t (assuming that the β and δ values are all extremely small, or, equivalently, the time between state transitions is extremely small.) Thus, we get:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T 1 i (t) = (1 -ζ 1 i (t)) • ζ 2 i (t)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Using the same reasoning, we have the probability that the node is infected by M 2 at time t is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T 2 i (t) = (1 -ζ 2 i (t)) • ζ 1 i (t)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Hence the probability that node i is in state I 1 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P 1 i (t) = (1 -δ 1 ) • P 1 i (t -1) + T 1 i (t) • S i (t -1)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and the probability that it is in state I 2 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P 2 i (t) = (1 -δ 2 ) • P 2 i (t -1) + T 2 i (t) • S i (t -1)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and the probability that it is in state S (Susceptible) is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">S i (t) = (1-T 1 i (t)-T 2 i (t))S i (t-1)+δ 1 P 1 i (t-1)+δ 2 P 2 i (t-1)</formula><p>As mentioned before, for M 1 we define the vector P 1 (t) = (P 1 1 (t), P 1 2 (t), ..., P 1 N (t)) where P 1 i (t) is the probability that node i is infected by meme M 1 at time t. Similarly, for M 2 , we have P 2 (t) = (P 2 1 (t), P 2 2 (t), ..., P 2 N (t)) . Let V (t) = ( P 1 (t), P 2 (t)) be the concatenation of two vectors. We use the NLDS formulation to describe the whole infection process evolution as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">V (t) = f ( V (t -1)), with: f i ( V (t -1)) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ (1 -δ 1 )P 1 i (t -1)+ T 1 i (t)S i (t -1) if i ≤ N (1 -δ 2 )P 2 i (t -1)+ T 2 i (t)S i (t -1) if i &gt; N (8)</formula><p>Substituting T 1 i (t) , T 1 i (t) and S i (t -1) into equation 8, we find that f i ( V (t -1)) is equal to the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">= ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ (1 -δ 1 )P 1 i (t -1) + (1 -ζ 1 i (t))ζ 2 i (t) (1 -P 1 i (t -1) -P 2 i (t -1)) if i ≤ N (1 -δ 2 )P 2 i (t -1) + (1 -ζ 2 i (t))ζ 1 i (t) (1 -P 1 i (t -1) -P 2 i (t -1)) if i &gt; N</formula><p>We use the following theorem about the asymptotic stability of an NLDS at a fixed point:</p><p>Theorem 1 (Hirsch and Smale, 1974 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>): The system given by p t+1 = g(p t ) is asymptotically stable at an equilibrium point p * , if the eigenvalues of the Jacobian J = g(p * ) are less than 1 in absolute value, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">J k,l = [ g(p * )] k,l = ∂p k,t+1 ∂p l,t | pt=p *</formula><p>The fixed point we are interested in for analyzing the threshold is the point where no node is infected (all nodes are healthy), i.e., V * = 0. By using this, we have the following theorem: Theorem 2: The system is asymptotically stable at V * = 0 if the first eigenvalue of the system matrices for both memes as defined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, are less than 1, i.e., λ 1 &lt; 1 and λ 2 &lt; 1, where λ 1 is the largest eigenvalue of matrix S 1 = (1δ 1 )I + β 1 A 1 (and similarly for λ 2 ). Proof: We are interested in the stability of the fixed point V * = 0. Let the Jacobian at this point be ∇(f</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">) (a 2N x 2N matrix). Then [∇(f )] ij = ∂f i ( V (t -1)) ∂ V j (t -1)</formula><p>Next, we can write it into a block matrix composed of the system matrices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∇(f ) = S 1 S 3 S 4 S 2</formula><p>In order to find the first eigenvalue of ∇(f )| V f , we define X as 2N elements vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">X = X 1 X 2</formula><p>where X 1 and X 2 have N elements respectively. We then have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(f )| v f X = S 1 S 3 S 4 S 2 • X 1 X 2 = λ (f ) | v f X 1 X 2</formula><p>Doing the matrix multiplications, we get:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">S 1 X 1 + S 3 X 2 = λ (f ) | v f X 1 and S 4 X 1 + S 2 X 2 = λ (f ) | v f X 2 with S 1 = (1 -δ 1 )I + β 1 A 1 , S 2 = (1 -δ 2 )I + β 2 A 2</formula><p>and S 3 = S 4 = 0 (where I is the N x N identity matrix), as we show in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> and as discussed below. Hence, the Jacobian ∇(f ) is a block diagonal matrix and its eigenvalues are the same as the eigenvalues of S 1 and S 2 . So the largest eigenvalue of ∇(f ) can be either λ 1 or λ 2 .</p><p>IV. EIGENPREDICTOR: WHO WINS?</p><p>In this section, we determine which meme will prevail in the composite network, which we described as Problem 2. We showed in the previous section that when the system is below the threshold, both memes die-out. Hence, the use of the predictor is meaningful when the parameters are such that at least one of the memes is above threshold and Theorem 2 does not apply.</p><p>Due to the complexity of the problem, instead of an analytical solution, we present a predictive model, which we call EigenPredictor, which allows us to predict which meme will eventually prevail in the composite network. We also use simulations with synthetic and real data, which we describe below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulation Set-up and Datasets</head><p>A discrete-time simulation of our system is used to simulate the stochastic behavior on different synthetic and real composite networks.</p><p>1) Small-scale Data sets (N &lt; 1, 000): Real-world enterprise composite network (ENT). This dataset, which was caputured over the course of six months, represents the phone call and SMS text message communications in one enterprise. Each node is an employee (|N | = 235), the edges in E 1 correspond to SMS messages exchanged between employees, and edges in E 2 correspond to phone calls made between employees. In detail, of all users, 31% communicate via calls alone, 28% via SMS alone, and 41% via both calls and SMS. In addition to the SMS and phone communication data, ENT also provides a basic social structure among the company's employees. This social information forms the basis of our Social Hierarchy method, which we will describe in Section §V. Each identified employee is grouped into one of 5 anonymous job roles. Job roles are ordered by their importance, thus we can determine who are the "bosses" and who are the regular employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Synthetic composite networks. Two synthetic graphs with 1,000 nodes are created: an Erdős-Rényi graph and a scalefree graph; we use the Barabási-Albert model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Several different combinations of topologies have been experimented. Here, the reasons that we focus on these two are : (a)In order to show that our methods are not tailored to a particular family of graphs and (b) scale-free graphs are known to emerge in complex human and communication networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>2) Large-scale Data Sets (1, 000 &lt; N &lt; 50, 000): In order to further stress-test the accuracy of our framework, we also did experiments on synthetic social networks with 1, 000 &lt; N &lt; 50, 000 nodes that are generated by the forestFire, randomWalk, and nearestNeighbor graph generation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which are informed by real world measurements of social networks and provide graph structures that resemble such networks.</p><p>3) Simulation runs: We use a combination of Matlab and Python to conduct the experiments on real and synthetic composite networks. In each experiment, each meme infects a unique set of nodes Ini 1 and Ini 2 . Each set of nodes has the same size, and is selected uniformly at random from N . The set of nodes is subject to the constraint Ini 1 ∩ Ini 2 = ∅ (i.e., mutually exclusive). We run each simulation until it reaches a relatively stable state as we discussed in Section II. At which point, we determine the average number of nodes infected by M 1 and M 2 and report the outcome, which then gets averaged across 100 runs.</p><p>Accuracy. To measure the accuracy of our model, we compute, for each simulation, the percentage of runs where the outcome (as predicted by EigenPredictor) and the actual result (from the simulation) coincide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The EigenPredictor</head><p>We now describe our EigenPredictor method for predicting which meme prevails. At stable state, we have three possible outcomes, which we represent as follows. If the outcome is '1', it means that M 1 will eventually prevail in the composite networks; if the outcome is '2', it means that M 2 will prevail; for the case where the difference is less than θ, which here is 10%, the outcome is '3'. Note that we experimented with other θ values (5%, 10%, and 15%) and the results were qualitatively similar. To summarize, given the parameters of our system, i.e., A 1 , β 1 , δ 1 , A 2 , β 2 , δ 2 , EigenPredictor produces a numeric value (1, 2, or 3), with the following semantics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">EigenP redictor((A 1 , β 1 , δ 1 ), (A 2 , β 2 , δ 2 )) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1, if M 1 prevails 2, if M 2 prevails 3, if no clear winner (9)</formula><p>Since λ 1 is the first eigenvalue (in absolute value) of system matrix S 1 for M 1 , where S 1 = (1-δ 1 )I +β 1 A 1 (and similarly for λ 2 ), then λ 1 is a function of parameters A 1 , β 1 , δ 1 (and the same for λ 2 ). Therefore, equation 9 could be simplified and written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">EigenP redictor(λ 1 , λ 2 ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1, if M 1 prevails 2, if M 2 prevails 3, if no clear winner</formula><p>(10) We use our EigenPredictor in two scenarios: first, when λ 1 and/or λ 2 are below the threshold (Case 1); second, when both λ 1 and λ 2 are above the threshold (Case 2).</p><p>Case 1: At Least One Eigenvalue Below Threshold. From Section III, we know that if the system matrix's first eigenvalue of one meme is less than 1, the corresponding meme will die-out eventually. Therefore, in this scenario, we can predict which meme prevails eventually using the following three rules:</p><p>(i) if λ 1 &lt; 1 and λ 2 &gt; 1, then M 2 tends to prevail eventually in the composite networks;</p><p>(ii) if λ 1 &gt; 1 and λ 2 &lt; 1, then M 1 tends to prevail eventually in the composite networks;</p><p>(iii) if λ 1 &lt; 1 and λ 2 &lt; 1, then both memes will die out and none of them can be said to prevail.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(a)</ref>-(e) demonstrate the proposed rules on both synthetic and real composite networks. The infection starts by infecting 30 nodes for each meme in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> The outcomes of belowand above-threshold from these rules can be distinctly seen in these figures. These results show that, though simple, our proposed rules are very effective for predicting which meme tends to prevail eventually in the composite networks.</p><p>Case 2: Both Eigenvalues Above Threshold. This is the more interesting case in terms of competition: each meme in isolation would not die-out, so it is a "fight for dominance." We find again that the system eigenvalues play a critical role: the meme whose first eigenvalue is larger tends to prevail eventually in the composite networks.</p><p>Intuitively, the first system eigenvalues capture the likelihood of success for each meme. Recall that the system eigenvalue considers both the topology and the meme strength. Extensive experimental results, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(f), argue in favor of this observation: we plot the outcome of the competition for different pairs of the eigenvalues (λ 2 vs. λ 1 ); we see that above the diagonal M 2 prevails, and below the diagonal M 1 prevails, in other words, the meme with the largest system eigenvalue wins.</p><p>Our regression model. We verify the significance of λ 1 and λ 2 as determining factors using a rigorous regression model. In particular, we use a multinomial logistic regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to predict the outcome in the case where both eigenvalues are above the threshold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">log P r(Y = i|X = (λ 1 , λ 2 )) P r(Y = K|X = (λ 1 , λ 2 )) = α i0 +α i1 •λ 1 +α i2 •λ 2 (11)</formula><p>Here Y represents the outcome of this model (dependent variable), and X represents the input, i.e., the independent variables λ 1 and λ 2 ; α i =(α i0 , α i1 , α i2 ) is the coefficient vector of independent variables, where i=1,2. Therefore, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">P r(Y = i|X = (λ 1 , λ 2 )) = exp(αi0+αi1•λ1+αi2•λ2) 1+ K-1 i=1 exp(αi0+αi1•λ1+αi2•λ2) (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">) P r(Y = K|X = (λ 1 , λ 2 )) = 1 1+ K-1 i=1 exp(αi0+αi1•λ1+αi2•λ2) (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>where i=1,2 and K=3. The coefficients vectors α i computed by our regression model are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>; note that corresponding coefficients' values (e.g., α 10 and α 20 ) are not, as one might expect at first, equal in magnitude and of opposite signs, since the output range is 1-3.</p><p>To construct the ground truth, we ran system simulations (input: λ 1 and λ 2 ; output: which meme prevails) on both synthetic and real composite networks. The number of data points was 5,339 for synthetic composite networks and 6,844 data points for real composite networks (see Section IV-A for  a description of the datasets). Next, for each data point, we compare the outcome from the simulation with the outcome from the EigenPredictor (regression), and compute the accuracy of the predictor.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>, using only 5% of the dataset as training data (and 95% of the dataset for validation), our model achieves a prediction accuracy of 96.65%; when using 10% for training, the accuracy is 98.42%, with 95% confidence interval.</p><p>Stress-testing EigenPredictor: topology independence. In order to test the robustness of our model, we use a different training topology from the testing topology. Specifically, we use 5% and 10% of the data set from synthetic composite networks as training data to predict the data set from real composite networks. We achieve an accuracy of 95.05% and 98.28%, respectively, with a 95% confidence interval, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. These results indicate that EigenPredictor is very effective in practice.</p><p>We now present details on the statistical results and significance of our model: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref> shows the results of the logistic regression ( α 1 , α 2 , and |t|-values). To understand how well the independent variables λ 1 and λ 2 contribute to the model (i.e., explain the dependent variable Y ), note the |t|-values; since the |t|-values are much larger than 2.08 (which translates to p-values being much lower than &lt; 0.01), this indicates that our model is statistically significant at the 1% level. These results indicate that all features contribute to the prediction model, and the model has high predictive power.</p><p>Discussion. The significance of the multinomial logistic regression is two-fold: (a) we verify quantitatively that the λ 1 and λ 2 are statistically sufficient to determine the winning meme and (b) we develop a practical method to predict meme dominance under complex dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. MEME SUPPRESSION, CONTROL AND CROSS-CONTAMINATION</head><p>In this section, we first design and evaluate suppression methods based on two distinct strategies (described as problems 3 and 4 in §II-B2):</p><p>1) Unilateral Suppression. The goal of this strategy is to suppress one meme, while leaving the other unscathed, thus free to spread unimpeded. Using the five techniques described below, we intend to suppress M 1 by removing ability to spread the memes from a subset of carefully selected nodes. The intention of unilateral suppression is to reduce λ 1 to below λ 2 (i.e., λ 1 &lt; λ 2 ), thus affecting the outcome. 2) Concurrent Suppression. The goal of this strategy is to suppress the spread of both memes by removing a set  of nodes from both graphs in the composite network. Ultimately, we want to reduce λ 1 and λ 2 to below 1 (i.e., λ 1 , λ 2 &lt; 1), thus stopping the spread of both memes.</p><p>Given these two main strategies, we propose 5 methods, described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">IV</ref>, partially motivated by the methods used in single virus/disease propagation on a single network <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We evaluate each method's effect on </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Unilateral Suppression</head><p>As mentioned above, the objective of unilateral suppression is to reduce λ 1 to less than λ 2 , thus reversing the prediction of our EigenPredictor. That is, we seek to answer: What set of nodes should we suppress in order to reduce the spread of one meme, ultimately resulting in the dominance of the other, unsuppressed, meme? We present the results of using Unilateral Suppression on the enterprise data set in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>. Note that M 1 will eventually prevail in the composite network prior to applying any unilateral suppression strategies. Then, observe that the value of λ 1 decreases as nodes are removed from the system. At k = 10, λ 1 is reduced to below λ 2 (thus reversing the prediction of the EigenPredictor).</p><p>As expected, the two methods that rely on randomness (i.e., Random and Acquaintance) have the worst performance compared to the other methods. In contrast, Greedy performs better than the others, yet is the most expensive computationally. Max Degree performs surprisingly well, within 1% of Greedy at much lower computational cost.</p><p>Interestingly, when we remove nodes based on their social status (e.g., remove "bosses" before "managers," and so on), the method Social Hierarchy performs better than the random methods, yet not as well as the topologicallyinformed models, and eventually (at k = 20) crosses the value of λ 2 . Though not as effective, in situations where we lack topological information, we could potentially rely on easily observable social hierarchy information to inform our suppression process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Concurrent Suppression</head><p>Under the concurrent suppression scheme, the goal is to reduce the effective spreading power of two memes spreading through different modes of communication (i.e., edge sets E 1 , E 2 in a composite network). Simply put, we ask: What set of shared nodes should we inoculate in order to reduce the spread of both memes the most?</p><p>We present the results of our suppression methods in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. As before, we observe that Max Degree and Greedy reduce both λ 1 and λ 2 to below the epidemic threshold (indicate by the horizontal line at 1) at approximately k = 19.</p><p>Social Hierarchy provides mixed results. As indicated by the lower plotted line (representing the SMS portion of the enterprise network), Social Hierarchy is nearly as effective as Max Degree and Greedy. Yet, on the upper line (call graph of the enterprise network), the Social Hierarchy method is not as effective and does not reduce the spreading power to below the epidemic threshold. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Summary</head><p>In summary, we have designed and evaluated several techniques for unilateral and concurrent suppressions, which are based on randomness, topological information and social hierarchy. The results from both suppressions show that the topological properties-based method (i.e., Max Degree) is very effective in controlling meme propagation compared to other methods. Put another way, removing the highestconnected node is a very effective suppression strategy. In situations where we lack topological information, we could potentially rely on the explicit information of social hierarchy to design our suppression scheme (e.g., Social Hierarchy), though not as effective as the topological properties-based method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Cross-Contamination Experiments</head><p>Until this point, we have considered memes spreading on a composite network to be mutually exclusive, i.e., a meme will spread using only the edges associated with their own network. In this section, we evaluate the effect of cross-contamination across various synthetic graphs. We change the model slightly: we allow the meme from one network to eventually "transform" into a meme that can propagate on the edges of the other network. For example, consider a rumor propagating in Facebook being transformed into a rumor spread on twitter by an individual user. The user creates a new meme and releases it on twitter, which spreads the same information, but now this meme is spreading across twitter edges. Our simulation model emulates this exact scenario, by carefully following the propagation of these "cross-over" meme. To account for the new ability of a meme to jump composite network layers, each meme is assigned a cross-contamination parameter, denoted 0 &lt; X A→B , X B→A ≤ 1.0. Specifically, X A→B describes the ability of a meme propagating on composite network layer A to cross to layer B. X A→B is similarly defined.</p><p>In the shown scenarios, if simulated in isolation, each of the memes would propagate and capture the graph. While in competition, in each of these simulations, ultimately one meme dominates. We have established that the meme propagating with the largest eigenvalue will eventually dominate the graph in the absence of cross-over. However, the crossing over allows the meme with higher such likelihood to spill over and propagate on the other topology, thus giving an advantage to the meme with higher such likelihood.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a), we demonstrate the results of cross contamination on a composite network of 500 nodes. In this example, λ S,1 = 26.43, and λ S,2 = 13.24 with cross-contamination probabilities of X A→B = .15 and X B→A = 0.05. Observing that λ S,1 &gt; λ S2 , we see that meme #1 ultimately captures the greatest number of nodes. Interestingly, meme #2 does not completely die out, possible due to the ability of meme #2 to cross over to both layers of the composite network.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>(b), we show the average steady-state percentage of infected nodes versus the propagations strength of meme #2 (β 2 ). All other parameters are constant, in particular β 1 = 0.25, X A→B = 0.10, and X B→A = 0.10. We observe that meme #2 will eventually dominate the simulation as we increase β 2 . Due to space limitations, we cannot present a more extensive study of this case, despite having more results, while it would be interesting to study this problem analytically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this section, we discuss the limitations of our work and possible future directions.</p><p>Choice of epidemic model. The flu-like SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) epidemiological model is simple, yet illustrative, and has been extensively studied in past literature in a single-virus setting (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). Therefore, we chose to extend SIS in order to gain fundamental insights into the dynamics of competing memes. We leave the investigation of other epidemic models as future work.</p><p>Using real composite networks. Finding real data for any networked system or communication is non-trivial due to privacy concerns, infrastructure limitations, and measurement biases. Finding real data sets of composite networks is even more challenging. Obtaining the enterprise dataset used in this paper was instrumental in modeling and understanding how real composite network operate, but the dataset comes with dissemination restrictions. We believe that the research community could greatly benefit from the creation of an open repository of real composite networks.</p><p>Deeper exploration. Our paper is the first attempt to study, predict and manage competing epidemic propagations on composite networks. We leave further exploration, like finding the extent of foot-prints, proving performance bounds for inoculation policies and incorporating more elaborate interactions between the two networks as future work.   <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Example of Concurrent Suppression on the enterprise data set, using each method. The epidemic threshold is marked in each plot at 1. Again, both the Greedy and Max Degree methods drop λ 1 and λ 2 below the epidemic threshold.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. RELATED WORK</head><p>We now proceed to reviewing related work in the context of single-meme and multiple-meme propagation from epidemiol-ogy, communication networks, game theory, and data mining literature.</p><p>Single-meme propagation. Many works focus on single meme propagation on one single topology. Compartmental models like SIS, SIR, etc., have been well-studied in many epidemiological texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The evolution of blogs and the maximization of influence propagation are studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Information cascades models are proposed to study the meme propagation in word-of-mouth communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Richardson et al.</ref> proposed a meme propagation model to achieve optimal viral marketing plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Numerous studies exist on virus propagation on the Internet based on the basic epidemic models of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Virus propagation under special cases have been studied, e.g., in IPv6 Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. A fundamental question in epidemiology is the presence of a threshold, under which an epidemic is guaranteed not to happen. Pastor-Satorras et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed an epidemic threshold condition for random power law networks, which uses the "mean-field" approach. Ganesh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> provided epidemic threshold for the single-virus on single topology. Prakash et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> gave the epidemic threshold condition for almost all single-virus epidemic models on a single static network. Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> studied the well-known acquaintance immunization method and showed that it is much better than random methods. Tong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> provide a simple greedy (1 -1/e) approximation algorithm for immunizing nodes under the SIS model.</p><p>Multiple memes and interdependent networks. Newman <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> studied multiple viruses on a single, special random graph and provided the epidemic threshold for the case when the second virus propagates over the residual network after the propagation of the first virus has completed. This scenario is close to the dynamics of propagation of a single virus-one virus passed over the network, the second virus starts to pass over the residual network. Models for multiple cascades have been studied as extensions of the independent cascade model, where once a node is infected with a cascade, it never change its state <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Multiple viruses propagation on simple fair-play single network was investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The effects of cascades in inter-dependent networks (e.g., Internet router and power electricity networks) were investigated by Buldyrev et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, all of these works are completely different from our problem as we consider the more realistic and challenging scenario of competing memes propagating simultaneously on composite networks. In this paper, we have significantly extended our preliminary work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> by: (a) proposing and evaluating an effective prediction scheme, Eigenpredictor, (b) considering immunization strategies with various suppression techniques to affect the outcome of the propagation, and (c) evaluating the effect of cross-contamination across various graphs.</p><p>Game theory. Meier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> studied inoculation games in social networks, where each node selfishly decides whether or not to protect itself. The game between a virus and an alert over a network was investigated by Aspnes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Kostka et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> studied competing campaigns as a game-theoretical problem and showed that being the first player was not always advantageous. However, these works using game theory are different from our problem where we assume that all nodes are passive and follow the same propagation model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have designed an effective methodology, EigenPredictor, to predict which meme will eventually prevail. Our theoretical and experimental results show that EigenPredictor achieves very high accuracy (above 95%) on a wide variety of real and synthetic datasets. Given the outcomes predicted by our EigenPredictor, we have designed and evaluated various suppression schemes to alter the results of the competing memes on composite networks. Extensive experimental results have revealed the comparative effectiveness of suppression schemes. Finally, we formulate and provide an initial study of the effect of cross-contamination across the composite graphs, where a meme cross-over and starts propagating on the other network's topology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Competing</head><label></label><figDesc>Memes Propagation on Networks: A Network Science Perspective Xuetao Wei, Nicholas C. Valler, B. Aditya Prakash, Iulian Neamtiu, Michalis Faloutsos, and Christos Faloutsos Abstract-In this paper, we study the intertwined propagation of two competing "memes" (or data, rumors, etc.) in a composite network. Within the constraints of this scenario, we ask two key questions: (a) which meme will prevail? and (b) can one influence the outcome of the propagations? Our model is underpinned by two key concepts, a structural graph model (composite network) and a viral propagation model (SI1I2S). Using this framework, we formulate a non-linear dynamic system and perform an eigenvalue analysis to identify the tipping point of the epidemic behavior. Based on insights gained from this analysis, we demonstrate an effective and accurate prediction method to determine viral dominance, which we call the EigenPredictor. Next, using a combination of synthetic and real composite networks, we evaluate the effectiveness of various viral suppression techniques by either a) concurrently suppressing both memes or b) unilaterally suppressing a single meme while leaving the other relatively unaffected.
