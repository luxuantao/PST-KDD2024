<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Little is known about millimeter wave (mmWave) path loss in rural areas with tall antennas, yet, as shown here, surprisingly long distances (greater than 10 kilometers) can be achieved in clear weather with less than 1 watt of power. This paper studies past rural macrocell (RMa) propagation models and the current 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) RMa path loss models for frequencies from 0.5 GHz to 30 GHz adopted from the International Telecommunications Union -Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R). This paper demonstrates that 3GPP and ITU-R RMa path loss models were derived for frequencies below 6 GHz, yet are being asserted for use up to 30 GHz. Until this paper, there has not been published data to support mmWave RMa path loss models. Here, 73 GHz measurements in rural Virginia are used to develop a new RMa path loss model that is more accurate and easier to apply for varying transmitter antenna heights than the existing 3GPP/ITU-R RMa path loss models and may be used for frequencies from 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz. The measurement system used here is comparable to a wideband (800 MHz radio frequency (RF) bandwidth) channel sounder with 21.7 dBW EIRP. Comparisons between simulations of existing RMa models and measured data verify the path loss model given here, that uses a novel close-in free space reference distance with a height dependent path loss exponent (CIH model). This work shows the CIH model is accurate and stable, is frequency independent beyond the first meter of propagation, and effectively models the path loss dependency on base station height in rural channels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In 1991, at the dawn of the cellphone revolution, it was predicted that by 2020, wireless technology would be as universal as electrical power <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies and the use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies will make that prediction a reality and will offer the promise of multi-gigabit per second data transfers and vast new applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Many research groups have recently developed channel models for mmWave frequencies, including Mobile and Wireless Communications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty Information Society (METIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Millimetre-Wave Evolution for Backhaul and Access (MiWEBA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Millimetre-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for Fifth Generation Integrated Communications (mmMAGIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and IEEE 802.11ad <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the global standards body of the wireless industry, released its study on channel models for frequencies above 6 GHz in 3GPP TR 38.900 V14.2.0 (Release 14) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, which has been aligned with channel models for below 6 GHz such as 3GPP TR 36.873 (Release 12) or ITU-R M.2135 such that the models support comparisons from 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The 3GPP channel models that include path loss models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, were formed through contributions from academic and industrial partners from extensive measurement campaigns and ray-tracing simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Scenarios specified in 3GPP TR 38.900 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> include urban microcell (UMi), urban macrocell (UMa), and indoor hotspot (InH) for office and shopping mall <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Rural macrocell (RMa) is an additional scenario that is included in 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and METIS path loss models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, although it has not been thoroughly investigated for frequencies above 6 GHz. In fact, a search of all available literature and standards reveals only one very limited and unpublished measurement campaign at 24 GHz that was used to attempt to justify the 3GPP RMa path loss model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. The literature shows that the RMa path loss models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> were adopted from the International Telecommunications Union -Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R) M.2135 report <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, but are only specified for frequencies between 450 MHz and 6 GHz, and did not include any empirical confirmation for use above 6 GHz or at mmWave bands.</p><p>The FCC recently allocated 10.85 GHz of spectrum at frequencies above 24 GHz and proposes an additional 17.7 GHz of spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, ensuring that vast amounts of wireless bandwidth will be available for new systems and applications. As shown in this paper, the coverage range for the RMa scenario can be over 10 kilometers (km) in clear weather and offers remarkable promise for fiber replacement and backhaul networks, as well as for broadband services to homes and mobile users. Given the huge spectrum allocation, this motivates a more careful study for RMa path loss modeling than what has occurred to date.</p><p>In Section II we investigate the development and origins of the existing RMa path loss models in 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, and reveal an important mathematical inconsistency with the lineof-sight (LOS) model equation when used at frequencies above 9.1 GHz and at mmWave bands. This work also illuminates numerous questionable empirical correction factors used by ITU-R and 3GPP which make no physical sense for rural environments. Section III describes 73 GHz propagation measurements conducted in rural Riner and Christiansburg, Virginia for LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) environments. Section IV introduces a clear weather RMa multi-frequency close-in reference distance (CI) path loss model and a new RMa path loss model that consists of a close-in free space reference distance and incorporates the base station transmitter height (CIH). Section V discusses empirical model results and uses data and the existing LOS and NLOS 3GPP RMa path loss models to develop the CI and CIH RMa path loss models that are just as accurate, but which are much simpler to understand and implement and that may be used for frequencies from 0.5 GHz to over 100 GHz. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI, and derivations for determining optimized CIH path loss model parameters are provided in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. 3GPP RMA PATH LOSS MODELS</head><p>RMa path loss models are generally used for tall transmitter heights above 35 meters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, and are important for predicting the statistical behavior of received signal strength and interference in rural settings. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, large-scale path loss models are independent of frequency in outdoor macrocellular channels, except for the first meter of propagation loss which is a function of the square of the frequency. Besides the first meter of free space path loss (FSPL), rain and oxygen absorption are also frequency dependent across the mmWave bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. 3GPP RMa LOS Path Loss Model Origin</head><p>The existing 3GPP/ITU-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> RMa LOS path loss model is used to provide statistical modeling of path loss over distance for when there is a clear, unobstructed path between the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). The 3GPP RMa LOS path loss model consists of two sections separated by a breakpoint distance where the slope attenuation increases beyond the breakpoint distance, as given in (1) below <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>: where f c is the center frequency in GHz, d 3D is the threedimensional (3D) transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation distance in meters (m), h is the average building height in meters (an odd parameter to have for rural environments and for LOS), and d BP is the two-dimensional (2D) breakpoint distance along the flat earth in meters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> provides details on large-scale path loss modeling). It is worth noting that as the flat earth distance between the TX and RX becomes large (say more than 1 km), the difference between d 2D and d 3D becomes negligible for typical TX and RX heights. P L 1 [dB] is path loss in dB before the breakpoint distance with a Gaussian (in dB) shadow fading (SF) standard deviation σ SF = 4 dB about the distantdependent mean path loss in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> and P L 2 [dB] is path loss in dB after the breakpoint distance with SF standard deviation σ SF = 6 dB. The P L 2 [dB] equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> indicates a path loss exponent (PLE) of 4 after the breakpoint distance, as derived by Bullington for the asymptotic two-ray LOS ground bounce model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. The breakpoint in (1) is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>:  where f c is the center frequency in Hz, c is the speed of light in free space in meters per second, h BS is the base station height in meters, and h U T is the user terminal (UT) height in meters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P L 1 [dB] =</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">d BP = 2π • h BS • h U T • fc/c (2)</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> provides the default parameter values and applicability ranges for the 3GPP LOS and NLOS RMa path loss models as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</p><p>After a thorough review of standards documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we found that ITU-R 5D/88-E <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> is the source of the ITU-R M.2135 RMa LOS path loss model adopted in 3GPP TR 38.900 (Release 14) for frequencies from 0.5 GHz to 30 GHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The LOS model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, however, was based largely on a propagation measurement and modeling campaign conducted at 2.6 GHz in 2000 in a downtown metropolitan area of Tokyo (typical UMi) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. The measurements were performed with a 30 Megabit per second pseudorandom noise (PN) code at a center frequency of 2.6 GHz to obtain both path loss and time delay statistics. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> created elaborate correction factors for physical descriptors, such as average building height in order to develop empirical LOS path loss models for use in urban cellular system design in the low GHz range.</p><p>The RMa LOS path loss model equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) from ITU-R M.2135 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and 3GPP TR 38.900 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> is similar to the LOS path loss model provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, but is slightly different with an additional height correction factor: min(0.044h 1.72 , 14.77), that adjusts path loss for low building heights. A different formula is used for calculating path loss after the breakpoint distance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> compared to what appears in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Path loss after the breakpoint distance, given by P L 2 [dB] in (1), includes path loss up until the breakpoint distance (P L 1 (d BP )), and an attenuation rate of 40 dB per decade of distance beyond the breakpoint distance. In ITU-R 5D/88-E, the LOS path loss equation after the breakpoint distance includes the attenuation rate of 40 dB per decade of distance but also includes correction factors for transmitter height, mobile height, average building height, and street width, which were not adopted by ITU-R or 3GPP for RMa LOS path loss. There is also a noticeable discontinuity between path loss before and after the breakpoint distance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</p><p>The breakpoint distance was initially developed by Bullington <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> for far propagation distances (usually many kilometers), where the PLE transitions from free space (n = 2) to the asymptotic two-ray ground bounce model of n = 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. More recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> showed that the breakpoint distance  d BP = 2.85 km Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Two-ray ground bounce simulation at 2.6 GHz with a TX and RX height of 35 m and 1.5 m, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</p><p>model by Bullington is a good fit to microcellular channels, as well. A simulation of the two-ray ground bounce model compared to FSPL is provided in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for a center frequency of 2.6 GHz, a TX height of 35 m, a RX height of 1.5 m, and clearly shows that the log-distance path loss slope changes from n = 2 to n = 4 at the breakpoint distance (d BP ) near 2.85 km. When used at mmWave frequencies, the breakpoint distance becomes very large, on the order of tens of km (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>).</p><p>The precise RMa LOS path loss model in ITU-R M.2135 and 3GPP TR 38.900 was not given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, or any other published material that we could find, leaving us to conclude that the existing 3GPP RMa LOS path loss model was never fully confirmed for a rural environment, nor was it confirmed with propagation data above 6 GHz. For the rest of this paper, when the 3GPP RMa model is mentioned, we are referring to the 3GPP TR 38.900 (Release 14) standard for frequencies above 6 GHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. When the ITU-R model is mentioned, we are referring to ITU-R M.2135 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. 3GPP RMa LOS Path Loss Model Description</head><p>Upon inspection, (1) is a cumbersome equation without an intuitive physical meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This is clearly seen by observing the correction factor "min" (minimum) functions of average building height, that create an upper bound on path loss for large average building heights. The "min" correction factor terms are non-physical curve fitting adjustments. The use of average building height h is quite odd, considering that an RMa scenario does not have tall buildings. The breakpoint distance used in (1) and (2), however, does have some physical basis in representing the distance at which the PLE approaches the asymptote of n = 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. While (1) has not been fully explained in the literature, it is obvious that the first term -20 log 10 (40π •d 3D •f c /3) -is the theoretical FSPL (in dB) at distance d 3D as shown here <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">20 log 10 ( 4π • d 3D • fc × 10 9 3 × 10 8 ) = 20 log 10 ( 40π • d 3D • fc 3 )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>by Friis' free space transmission formula for f c in GHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</p><p>The breakpoint distance for RMa LOS path loss in (2) has a remarkable practical frequency limitation. This is easily seen by using the 3GPP default height parameter settings from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Using these default parameters, it is readily seen that the breakpoint distance exceeds the defined maximum  usable distance of the 3GPP RMa LOS path loss model <ref type="bibr">(10 km)</ref> for frequencies greater than or equal to 9.1 GHz, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>. Thus, the 3GPP RMa LOS path loss model must be assumed to be a single-slope model above 9.1 GHz (for distances within the applicable range) as given by P L 1 in (1). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref> displays the region (shaded) for various base station heights (h BS ) and frequency combinations where the 3GPP RMa LOS path loss model breakpoint distance exceeds the maximum 10 km propagation distance model limit. Surprisingly, the breakpoint distance portion of (1) is not usable above 32 GHz for any h BS base station height (mobile height of 1.5 m) defined in the 3GPP and ITU-R RMa models, leading us to conclude that the LOS breakpoint distance (2) is not appropriate for mmWave bands in RMa scenarios. Section IV introduces a more reliable, accurate, and robust single-slope CI path loss model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> that avoids the breakpoint issue highlighted here, and is much simpler to use than the 3GPP/ITU-R RMa path loss models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. While the ITU-R references the sub-6 GHz WINNER II channel model for RMa, it includes traditional LOS path loss models that were modified with COST231-Hata correction factors for curve fitting and that do not match 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. 3GPP RMa NLOS Path Loss Model Origin</head><p>The RMa NLOS path loss model in 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> is taken directly from ITU-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and originates from work by Sakagami and Kuboi <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. The empirical model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> was developed from measurements in metropolitan Tokyo in 1991 at 813 MHz and 1433 MHz in a square shaped area with a total length of 270 to 420 meters, and with measurement courses along circles with radii of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 km, for various measurement distances. Parameters selected for the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> include base station antenna height (h b0 ), base station antenna height above the mobile station (h b ), building height near the base station (H), average building height (&lt; H &gt;), height of buildings along the street (h s ), street width (W ), and street angle (θ), with all heights and distances in meters and θ in degrees. The street angle was defined as the angle between the line connecting the UT and the base station, and the street from where the measurement was performed (a maximum angle of 90 • induces 2.07 dB of additional path loss) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. Given that this work was for a dense urban environment (Tokyo) and at ultra high frequencies (UHF), many of these parameters do not apply to RMa path loss modeling, since it makes no physical sense to have correction factors for street width and building height in rural environments that do not have large buildings or urban canyons.</p><p>Using these physical parameters of the environment in downtown Tokyo, a multiple regression analysis was conducted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> to simultaneously solve for nine model coefficients. The coefficients that minimized the residual variance between the model and data were determined based on 1000 path loss data points and resulted in the following NLOS path loss model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P L Sakagami = 100 -7.1 log 10 (W ) + 0.023θ + 1.4 log 10 (hs) + 6.1 log 10 (&lt; H &gt;) -(24.37 -3.7(H/h b0 ) 2 ) log 10 (h b ) + (43.42 -3.1 log 10 (h b )) log 10 (d) + 20.4 log 10 (f ) (4)</formula><p>where f is the frequency in MHz and d is the distance from the base station in km. The model was extended from 450 MHz to 2200 MHz with an additional frequency extension term not shown here, but which is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</p><p>In the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, the extended version of the Sakagami model ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) replaces all of the building height terms with the median building height and substitutes the frequency term with 20 log 10 (f ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. An expansion to account for mobile heights above 1.5 m was adopted from the Okumura-Hata model <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> and is formulated as: P L Sakagami -a(h m ) where <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a(hm) = 3.2(log 10 (11.75hm)) 2 -4.97<label>(5)</label></formula><p>with h m as the mobile (UT) antenna height in meters. The equation in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) was used to curve fit path loss for frequencies above 400 MHz and for UT heights above 1.5 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. The combination of expansions and extensions on the Sakagami model explained above, is what appears in the final 3GPP and ITU-R RMa NLOS path loss model as shown here <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>: </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P L = max(P L RM a-LOS , P L RM a-N LOS ) P L RM a-N LOS =</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">-(3.2(log 10 (11.75h U T )) 2 -4.97) ; σ SF = 8 dB (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where W is the street width, h is the average building height (by combining all building height coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>), h BS is the base station height, h U T is the mobile UT height, and d 3D is the 3D T-R separation distance, where all distances and heights are in meters. Additionally, f c is the center frequency in GHz and the log-normal SF standard deviation is set to σ SF = 8 dB. Applicability ranges for the model are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> as extracted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The "max" (maximum) operator in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) acts as a strange mathematical patch and is used to solve a model artifact, where the model predicts much stronger power at close-in distances in NLOS (say within a few hundred meters) than what physics dictates for LOS environments. The patch is used to ensure that the estimated NLOS path loss is always greater than or equal to the equivalent LOS path loss at the same distance. This problem was shown to exist in many other 3GPP-style path loss models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, leading to the optional CI path loss models in 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. A footnote for <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> specifies the applicable frequency range as 0.8 GHz &lt; f c &lt; 30 GHz in 3GPP, although evidence suggests this is not valid, as is now explained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. 3GPP RMa NLOS Path Loss Model Description</head><p>Three differences between the extended Sakagami (4) and the eventual 3GPP ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) and ITU-R RMa NLOS path loss models are explained here. The first difference is the removal of the street angle term: 0.023θ. The second change is the modification of the first term from 100 in (4) to 161.04 in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) since the 3GPP model is in units of GHz rather than MHz (FSPL difference at 1 m between 1 MHz and 1 GHz is 60 dB). The additional 1.04 dB difference was not explained in the standards, and while it appears in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, it is not explained there or in the literature. The last difference is the addition of "-3" in (log 10 (d 3D ) -3), to account for the fact that d 3D is in meters as compared to km in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> (log 10 (1000) = 3).</p><p>The use of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) as a path loss model above 6 GHz for rural environments is highly questionable based on the fact that evidence shows measurements were made at frequencies only up to 1433 MHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. The measurement frequencies used to generate <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> are much lower than the specified maximum applicable frequency <ref type="bibr">(30 GHz)</ref>, since the original model is based on measurements at 813 and 1433 MHz, with an extension for up to 2200 MHz (although this extension is not included in the 3GPP or ITU-R model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>). It is worth noting that others in the literature have attempted to extend the Sakagami model based on measurements up to 8.45 GHz in urban environments, yet this introduced, even more, correction factors and evolutions of the Sakagami model, leading to even more complicated correction factors that can only be applied in urban environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. While physical parameters such as average building height and street width are sensible for urban areas, they are not used in any of the other 3GPP outdoor (e.g. UMi or UMa) path loss models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, so they surely do not make sense in a rural model. Even more concerning is that the NLOS path loss model in 3GPP and ITU-R is based on urban measurements, not the rural areas which are to be modeled <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, since the extended Sakagami path loss prediction formula is unsuitable for areas with extremely low average building height (i.e. rural and suburban areas). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, the authors conclude that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) is only applicable for average building heights greater than 5 m, so they added a new parameter to account for this based on occupancy ratio -the ratio between the occupancy area of buildings in a sampled area and the total sampled area <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>.</p><p>The only effort we could find to validate (6) above 6 GHz in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> was from a small measurement campaign at 24 GHz conducted over limited 2D T-R separation distances between 200 to 500 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, even though ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) is specified for 2D distances up to 5 km (and the original Sakagami model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> was valid up to 10 km). The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> indicates a reasonable match between the measurements and model between 200-500 m, but LOS and NLOS path loss data were combined together and best-fit indicators (e.g. RMSE) were not provided, leading one to question the comparison validity. The facts outlined here uncover the questionable origins of ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) and the little empirical evidence to support the 3GPP RMa NLOS path loss model above 6 GHz. While the WINNER II channel model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> included sub-6 GHz RMa path loss measurements, they were still limited according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> and resulted in modifications of the COST231-Hata path loss models that do not resemble or align with those found in 3GPP or ITU-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Given the fact that other 3GPP models suffered from errors that required mathematical corrections for relatively small T-R distances, leading to much higher losses for large T-R separation distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, we conducted a rural macrocell measurement and modeling study in clear weather at the 73 GHz mmWave band for LOS and NLOS conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This empirical data for RMa path loss above 6 GHz and in the mmWave bands makes it possible to generate a generic but reliable RMa path loss model for frequencies above 500 MHz and beyond 100 GHz that could be used by 3GPP, ITU-R, and others.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. 73 GHz Measurement Equipment</head><p>Path loss measurements were conducted in Riner and Christiansburg, Virginia, rural towns in southwest Virginia, USA, at the 73 GHz frequency band. The TX was positioned on a porch at Professor Rappaport's mountain home at a height of 110 m above the surrounding terrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A narrowband continuous wave (CW) signal was transmitted with a maximum RF power of 14.7 dBm (29 mW) using a rotatable 7 • azimuth and elevation half-power beamwidth (HPBW) horn antenna with 27 dBi of gain for a total effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 11.7 dBW -relatively low EIRP compared to currently deployed RMa cellular base stations. The transmitter used a 5.625 GHz CW tone that was mixed with a 67.875 GHz local oscillator (LO) signal <ref type="bibr">(22.</ref>625 GHz frequency multiplied x3 in an upconverter) as depicted in the TX schematic in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>An identical rotatable antenna with 27 dBi of gain and 7 • azimuth and elevation HPBW was used at the RX to capture the RF signal. The received 73.5 GHz signal was downconverted (with 29.9 dB of gain) with a 67.875 GHz LO (identical to the TX) to a 5.625 GHz intermediate-frequency (IF) and then amplified by a 35 dB low-noise amplifier (LNA) after which the IF signal entered a manual step attenuator to ensure linear operation when recording power levels with a Keysight E4407B ESA spectrum analyzer (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for RX schematic). Received power levels were recorded in zero-span mode on the spectrum analyzer, with a 15 kHz bandwidth setting, where occasional frequency tuning was performed as required due to oscillator drift. Local time and spatial averaging were used to obtain received power at each RX location, with a maximum measurable path loss of 190 dB.</p><p>The narrowband receiver used an intentionally insensitive receiver threshold in order to emulate the equivalent effect of a much wider bandwidth channel than the CW signal used during the measurement campaign. The detector was configured to ignore any power level below -58 dBm (such that weaker signals were treated as noise and an outage). This noise vs. bandwidth tradeoff applies for all radio transmissions, since the average received power over time (for CW) and over frequency (for wideband), results in identical average local power levels, independent of bandwidth <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. Thus, the 190 dB of measurement range used in this measurement system accurately predicts path loss for wideband signals, on the order of tens of MHz. This is evidenced by the fact that the total measurement range of the system is 190 dB, which is 10 dB greater than the wide bandwidth channel sounder used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> and which had an 800 MHz bandwidth with 180 dB of dynamic range to measure downtown Manhattan. Since both measurement systems employed 11.7 dBW of EIRP transmit power (still a very small transmission power compared to today's cellular), it is reasonable to add an additional 10 dB of EIRP transmit power for the sounder used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, yielding the observation that the measurement system used here for RMa path loss measurements is equivalent to using a wideband channel sounder with 800 Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: 73 GHz TX and RX measurement system diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>0733-8716 (c) 2016 IEEE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Measurement Locations and Methodology</head><p>The RMa measurements were made over a two-day period of clear weather using a receiver measurement van (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>), with the receiving antenna fixed on a tripod outside of the van at an average height between 1.6 m and 2 m above the ground along country roads and streets near rural homes and businesses. Measurements were made at 14 LOS and 17 NLOS locations where measurable signal was detected, while also inducing movement in space (a few mm to cm) to ensure there was no noticeable constructive or destructive interference. Five additional locations were tested but the signal was not detectable and resulted in outages. The 2D T-R separation distance for LOS locations ranged from 33 m (free space calibration distance) to 10.8 km, and from 3.4 km to 10.6 km for NLOS locations. The TX antenna on top of the mountain ridge and on the porch of the home (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>) was ∼110 meters above the surrounding countryside and was located approximately 31 m from the edge of the mountain drop off as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, and pictured in the northerly view from the TX in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. During the measurements, the TX antenna remained at a fixed downtilt of 2 • . The TX antenna azimuth pointing angle and RX antenna azimuth and elevation pointing angles were manually adjusted to simultaneously point in the direction that maximized received power at each RX location. To ensure measurement accuracy, the system was periodically calibrated at a distance of 33 meters to validate theoretical FSPL and was reproducible within 0.2 dB of theory over the two-day measurement campaign.</p><p>The TX and RX locations are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> via Google Earth imagery with lines that show the TX azimuth scanning window of ±10 • relative to true North, used to avoid diffraction from the mountain on the west side of the antenna (not shown), and the rising slope in the front yard of the mountain property on the east side of the TX antenna (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). RX locations where a few small trees blocked the LOS path were used as LOS locations. Two additional LOS locations (RX 31 and RX 32) measured during the campaign were just outside the TX azimuth angle window on the east side of the TX antenna (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> and green diamonds in Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9a</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9b</ref>), and thus were not used to derive the LOS path loss models due to diffraction loss from the sloping front yard (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NOVEL RMA PATH LOSS MODELS AND SIMULATIONS</head><p>We now present two simple alternative path loss models to the existing 3GPP/ITU-R RMa path loss models in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>), which can be used from 500 MHz to 100 GHz. The alternative models are based on the optional path loss models in 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and the CI models as found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Here, we propose a physically-based CI RMa large-scale path loss model using a 1 m free space reference distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref> and develop a new model with a base station height dependent path loss exponent (CIH). Both models have a solid physical basis, are proven to be accurate, reliable, to match measured data well, and are easy to understand and apply. Furthermore, models of this form have been shown to work well for all frequencies from 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz, specifically in the mmWave bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, and are already in use in 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. CI models have also proven to have excellent stability and accuracy when predicting path loss values for scenarios and distances outside the scope of the original measurements used to create the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Although measurements were conducted at a single frequency (73 GHz), evidence in the literature shows that measurement from 500 MHz to 73 GHz generate accurate path loss models that work well up to 100 GHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Therefore, we make the reasonable assumption that beyond the first meter of propagation, the path loss exponent may be frequency independent as this has been proven many times from measurements and models across many mmWave bands in UMi and UMa scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. CI Path Loss Model</head><p>CI path loss models have been used for decades for estimating path loss in a variety of scenarios and environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> and have recently been shown to represent outdoor channels over a vast range of mmWave frequencies with surprisingly good and robust accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. The simplest form of the model, with a 1 m free space reference distance (d 0 ), led to its adoption as an optional model for UMa, UMi, and InH scenarios in 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, based on numerous experiments at mmWaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Thus, it would also seem reasonable to consider a CI option for the RMa scenario. We show subsequently from the measured data that indeed the CI model offers a good fit for RMa, with a much simpler expression than (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>).</p><p>The general expression for the CI path loss model is: where d (usually 3D distance) is the T-R separation in m between the TX and RX, d 0 is the close-in free space reference distance in m, n represents the PLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, and f c is the frequency in GHz. Shadow fading is represented by the zeromean Gaussian random variable χ σ with standard deviation σ in dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. For large T-R separations (several km) such as in the RMa scenario, the distance d may be represented by the 2D or 3D distance, as the difference is minuscule. The first term after the equality sign in (7) models frequencydependent path loss up to the close-in reference distance d 0 = 1 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, and is equivalent to Friis' FSPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>: where f c is the center frequency in GHz, c is the speed of light in free space or air, 3 × 10 8 m/s, and 32.4 dB is the FSPL at 1 m at 1 GHz. Thus, ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is given by: Setting the free space reference distance d 0 = 1 m provides a standardized and universal modeling approach for path loss comparison with a single parameter, the PLE [13]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, and was approved as an optional model for UMa, UMi, and InH in 3GPP TR 38.900 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The CI model for RMa <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> requires only a single model parameter, n, also called PLE, to describe the distant-dependent average path loss over distance for a wide range of mmWave bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> [16], <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. The use of 1 m makes sense, because there are clearly no obstructions in the first meter of propagation from a transmitting antenna, it models the frequency dependency of propagation in outdoor channels over a vast span of frequencies, and has exhibited consistent accuracy and parameter stability across numerous scenarios, distances, and frequency ranges <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. CIH Path Loss Model</head><p>When considering the existing RMa path loss models in 3GPP and ITU-R (see ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>)), there are clearly terms such as building height and street width that do not make physical sense, yet there are others, such as TX and RX height above ground, which would be expected to impact path loss in rural environments. Since the current 3GPP/ITU-R RMa models considered TX heights as low as 10 m and as tall as 150 m, this parameter clearly has much greater range and physical significance than other model parameters (a simulation to follow shows this). The RX height in the rural scenario, as specified in 3GPP, ranges from only 1.5 m to 10 m, which is negligible when considering T-R separation distances of many kilometers, suggesting the TX height would be the single most significant physical parameter to include in a RMa path loss model, besides the close-in free space reference distance. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref> shows the effect of base station height (h BS ) on NLOS path loss for five 3D T-R separation distances (150 m, 500 m, 1 km, 2.5 km, and 5 km) using <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and the average decrease in path loss over all T-R distances, as a function of base station height. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref> are independent of frequency from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and show that by increasing the base station height from 10 m to 150 m, the path loss is effectively reduced by approximately 26 dB and 32 dB for T-R separation distances of 150 m and 5 km, respectively, with an average decrease of 29 dB over all T-R distances.</p><p>Here we extend the CI model to include various base station heights (CIH model), such that the model remains physically grounded to FSPL at a close-in distance but also models the PLE dependence on base station height. The CIH model was inspired by the CIF model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, which was shown to accurately model the frequency dependence of path loss in indoor environments. This model highlights the importance of the PLE in being able to model the physical effects in the environment, and encapsulates a fundamental physical basis of the frequency dependence due to Friis' equation at close-in distances (while avoiding the need for mathematical patches and ensuring remarkable accuracy when applied for values outside of the measurement set <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>). Work to date used an ad hoc, non-physical basis for modeling the impact of TX height <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. By incorporating the TX height as an adjustment to path loss, we postulated that it would be possible to model secondary path loss effects due to antenna height, just as the CIF model accounts for secondary frequency-dependent effects while retaining the physics of the primary frequency dependency of FSPL at closein distances.</p><p>The CIH model uses the same mathematical form as the CIF model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and is given here for d 0 = 1 m:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">PL CIH (fc, d, h BS )[dB] = FSPL(fc, 1 m)[dB] + 10n ( 1 + btx ( h BS -h B0 h B0</formula><p>)) log 10 (d) + χσ;</p><p>where d ≥ 1 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> where h BS is the RMa base station antenna height in meters, and h B0 is the default base station height or is taken as the average of all TX heights from a measurement set. The distance dependence of path loss is denoted by n (identical to the PLE from the CI model), and b tx is a model parameter that is optimized and which quantifies the linear base station height dependent PLE about the average base station height h B0 . An effective PLE (PLE ef f ) results from the scaling of n by b tx and the TX heights such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">PLE ef f = n • ( 1 + b tx ( hBS -hB0<label>hB0</label></formula><p>)) . The CIH model only requires two optimization parameters, the PLE n, and b tx :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">PL CIH (fc, d, h BS )[dB] = 32.4 + 20 log 10 (fc) + 10n ( 1 + btx ( h BS -h B0 h B0</formula><p>)) log 10 (d) + χσ;</p><p>where d ≥ 1 m, and h B0 = avg. BS height <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> As with the CIF model, the CIH model simplifies to the CI model when b tx = 0 (no dependence on base station height), or when h BS = h B0 .

Case one is for a fixed base station height and case two is for a range of base station heights.</p><p>1) Case One -Simulation For 3GPP Default Parameters: In case one, 50,000 random path loss samples (with 3GPP default parameters from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>) were generated from ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>), for the following frequencies: 1, 2, 6, 15, 28, 38, 60, 73, and 100 GHz, resulting in 450,000 samples each (50,000 samples × 9 frequencies) for LOS and NLOS. Frequencies below and above 6 GHz were used for the multi-frequency simulation and modeling since the overall frequency applicability range covers 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz for a majority of path loss models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The CI model ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) ensures a seamless path loss model for frequencies from 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz, without discontinuities as demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Each path loss sample was randomly generated for a 2D T-R separation distance ranging between 10 m and 10 km for LOS and between 10 m and 5 km in NLOS * , along with the corresponding SF values (in dB) from ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>). When simulating (1), path loss samples for frequencies above 9.1 GHz were generated from the singleslope portion of (1), based on the breakpoint distance (2) in LOS. From the simulated 3GPP path loss samples for each environment, CI models that best-fit the data were derived that resulted in the minimum root mean squared error (RMSE) between the model and the data. The CI models derived from simulated LOS (PL CI-3GPP LOS ) and NLOS (PL CI-3GPP NLOS ) path loss samples, were found to be: Both the LOS and NLOS CI models in ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) emphatically show that the complicated 3GPP/ITU-R RMa path loss models in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) can be reformulated into succinct and easy to understand equations with nearly identical performance in RMSE. The CI LOS model results in an RMSE of 5.9 dB, within the 4 to 6 dB SF specified for the 3GPP LOS model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In NLOS the CI model was found to result in an RMSE of 8.2 dB, very close to the 8 dB SF specified by the 3GPP NLOS model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. The distinguishing observation here is that the CI model offers a simple and seamless model for all frequencies from 500 MHz to beyond 100 GHz and has nearly identical performance in terms of shadowing, yet, does not use complicated and unreasonable correction factors. Additionally, the CI models in ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) exhibit the physics of free space transmission in the first meter of propagation, and show that RMa path loss can be modeled by a single parameter, the PLE, which is independent of frequency for all distances beyond the close-in distance of one meter. A notable aspect of the CI model in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is the 30.4 coefficient, which corresponds to a PLE n value of 3.04, which is equivalent to 10n = 10 × 3.04 = 30.4, or 30.4 dB of loss per decade increase in distance. * 2D distances were randomly generated per the limits defined in TR 38.900 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, from which 3D distances were calculated using antenna heights and trigonometry, for simulations.</p><p>2) Case Two -Simulation For 3GPP Default Parameters with Varying Base Station Heights: For case two, the LOS and NLOS 3GPP models in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) were simulated again, but in this case with samples for varying base station heights (h BS ) from 10 m to 150 m in 5 m increments, and across the frequencies previously specified, resulting in 13,050,000 samples each (50,000 samples × 9 frequencies × 29 base station heights) for LOS and NLOS. From these samples, the best CIH path loss models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> were derived to minimize the RMSE between the model and simulated data. In order to coincide with the 3GPP model simulations, h B0 was set to 35 m (3GPP default height from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">( h BS -35<label>35</label></formula><p>))</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">log 10 (d) + χσ NLOS ;</formula><p>where d ≥ 1 m, and σ NLOS = 8.7 dB</p><p>The LOS CIH path loss model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>, was the best fit model to the simulated LOS 3GPP data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, and shows that estimated path loss in LOS is slightly dependent on the base station height, as the value b tx = -0.006 shows a very slight decrease in the effective PLE (the coefficient before the log 10 (d) term in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>)) as the base station height is increased. This is also confirmed by the fact that ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) both have a PLE of 2.31. This lack of sensitivity to TX height stems from (1) not having an explicit correction factor for the TX height, although the breakpoint distance ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is a function of the TX height (h BS ). The SF of 5.6 dB in the LOS CIH model as compared to 5.9 dB from the CI model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>, indicates that the use of the CIH model (and the second parameter b tx ) reduces the model error by 0.3 dB. This shows that the CIH model fits the simulated data well and is reasonable to use for RMa path loss modeling since the SF in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is 4 to 6 dB.</p><p>For the NLOS CIH path loss model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref> best fit to the simulated data from (6), the dependence of base station height is more noticeable than LOS, with b tx = -0.06. From (15) it is clear that as the base station height increases from 10 m to 150 m, the effective PLE reduces from 3.2 to 2.5, or a 7 dB per decade of distance reduction in estimated path loss for base stations with 150 m heights compared to 10 m heights, which is a considerable contrast at long-range distances. The RMSE of the CIH model fit to the simulated data is 8.7 dB, similar to the 8.0 dB from 3GPP (6), thus indicating it is reasonable to use the simple CIH model to estimate NLOS RMa path loss for various base station heights.</p><p>The similar RMSE values for the CI and CIH models ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">15</ref>) when fit to simulated data versus the 3GPP RMa path loss models in (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>), show that the CI and CIH models are useful for accurately predicting RMa path loss in LOS and NLOS, and have much simpler forms and fewer parameters than 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The best-fit CI and CIH model parameters and corresponding equation numbers from the simulated data are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">II</ref>. It must be stressed that ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">15</ref>) are merely fit to simulated 3GPP data which have not been validated by extensive measurements above 6 GHz.

EMPIRICALLY-BASED RMA PATH LOSS MODELS</head><p>Path loss values at 73 GHz for LOS and NLOS were calculated from measurements described in Section III and were used as sample data to derive the best-fit model parameters for the CI and CIH path loss models (See Appendix A and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> for closed-form best-fit MMSE optimization approach).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Empirical CI Model Results</head><p>Measured path loss data in clear weather and the corresponding CI models are compared with FSPL in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9b</ref>. The measured path loss data versus log-distance is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9a</ref>, whereas Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9b</ref> is a "zoomed in" view of the measured path loss data. Local time and small-scale spatial averaging were used to record the received power levels at each location to mitigate small fluctuations in received power observed in the field that ranged from fractions of a dB about the mean power in LOS locations, and approximately 3-5 dB in NLOS locations (likely due to small-scale variations and foliage movement caused by wind). This allowed us to capture the mean path loss observed at each location. In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9b</ref>, blue circles represent the measured LOS path loss values, red crosses represent measured NLOS path loss data, and two green diamonds denote measured LOS data with partial diffraction from the right edge of the yard near the mountain top TX (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6 [1]</ref>).</p><p>The LOS CI PLE value calculated from the 73 GHz measured data is 2.16 and very close to FSPL (PLE of 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>). The distances (up to and beyond 10 km in clear weather) achieved are quite remarkable, especially given the close agreement with FSPL and the very small EIRP of 41.7 dBm. The green diamond LOS path loss values include diffraction loss and were not used for the CI LOS path loss model derivation, but are shown to indicate the impact of diffraction edges close to the transmitter (15-20 dB additional path loss over long distances, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>).</p><p>Measured data in RMa NLOS provided a CI PLE of 2.75, which is lower than the NLOS UMi and UMa mmWave PLEs reported in the literature (between 2.9 and 3.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>), and those defined in the optional 3GPP path loss models (3.0 for UMa and 3.19 for UMi). This indicates a slight improvement in received signal level over distance due to taller base station heights and the lack of building obstructions in RMa or rural microcell (RMi) scenarios. Tall rural cell sites are called "boomer cells", as they can increase coverage in a rural area beyond a typical 2-3 mile radius by using very tall transmission points.</p><p>The RMSE values for SF of 1.7 dB and 6.7 dB observed in LOS and NLOS, respectively, are both below the respective RMSE and SF values provided by 3GPP in (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) and from the CI models derived from simulated data in ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), which are greater than 4 dB in LOS and 8 dB or higher in NLOS. Additionally, the CI models from measurements have lower PLEs compared to the CI models derived from 3GPP   simulations, where in LOS the measured PLE is 2.16 and the 3GPP simulation resulted in a PLE of 2.31. Similarly, the NLOS PLE from measurements is 2.75, whereas the PLE from 3GPP simulations is 3.04. The higher PLEs in the models derived from 3GPP simulations could potentially lead to underestimating interference at large distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. The CI path loss models for the RMa LOS and NLOS scenarios, as found from the measured data, are provided here for 73.5 GHz, and are suitable replacements for the existing 3GPP/ITU-R RMa path loss models given in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>): Equations ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) are based on the 73 GHz measurement campaign reported here but may be assumed to be independent of frequency beyond the first meter of propagation, similar to previous UMa studies that showed the PLE is not a function of frequency beyond the first meter of propagation, in the CI model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. The identical CI path loss model form is used in 3GPP for the optional path loss models of UMi, UMa, and InH <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The LOS and NLOS RMa CI path loss models given here are also valid up to and beyond 10 km in clear weather, based on the measurement study settings. Rain attenuation has been shown to have a significantly negative impact on mmWave propagation -73 GHz experiences 10 dB of attenuation loss per 1 km of distance for heavy rainfall <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Note that ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) have smaller standard deviations than the existing 3GPP RMa LOS path loss models for frequencies from 0.5 GHz to 30 GHz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Empirical CIH Model Results</head><p>Path loss data from multiple TX (base station) heights can be used to derive the optimal CIH path loss model parameters by using the closed-form solution equations provided in Appendix A. Since path loss data from the measurements described in Section III were obtained for only a single transmitter height (110 m), we must rely on the TX height dependence in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref> from the 3GPP NLOS CIH model derived from simulations, and relate that to b tx in the CIH empirical model. We used the LOS and NLOS CI model n parameters in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) to solve for b tx . Thus, b tx is used to model the PLE (n) dependency of base station height as a mixture between the simulated 3GPP model data and our measurements at 73 GHz. For example, to solve for b tx in this case with limited empirical data, we set n CI (derived from measurements) from the CI model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">n CIH ( 1 + b tx ( hBS -hB0<label>hB0</label></formula><p>)) from the CIH model (simulations) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>, such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">n CI = n CIH ( 1 + btx ( h BS -h B0 h B0 ))<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Solving for b tx results in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">btx = ( h B0 h BS -h B0 ) • ( n CI n CIH -1 )<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where in this case, h BS = 110 meters and h B0 = 35 meters. Thus, to solve for the NLOS CIH model parameter b tx , n CI = 2.75 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref> and n CIH = 3.07 from (15) are used: By setting h BS = 110 m, the path loss models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref> revert to the RMa LOS and NLOS CI path loss models in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>   data in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">15</ref>) such that the base station height influences the PLE. Negative b tx values reveal that the effective PLE decreases as the TX height increases and this intuitively makes sense since higher base stations would result in fewer obstructions compared to transmitters closer to the ground.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">II</ref> provides the empirical CI and CIH RMa path loss model parameters in LOS and NLOS, for comparison with the simulated RMa path loss model parameters.</p><p>The effect of base station height on RMa path loss with the CIH model is evident in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> where the effective RMa LOS PLE reduces from 2.4 to about 2.1 when the base station height ranges from 10 m to 150 m. Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> also shows that the effective RMa NLOS PLE reduces from 3.2 with a base station height of 10 m, to just under 2.6 with a TX height of 150 m. This implies a reduction of 3 dB and 6 dB path loss per decade of distance in LOS and NLOS, respectively. For RMa mmWave propagation, this difference can have an appreciable significance in weather events, where 25 mm/hr rainfall can result in 10 dB loss per km at 73 GHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">11</ref> shows the decrease in path loss for various T-R separation distances and the average decrease over all T-R distances, as a function of TX height (similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref> for ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>)) for the CIH NLOS path loss model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>. This shows that for large T-R separation distances (5 km), path loss can be reduced by up to 22 dB for a TX height of 150 m compared to 10 m. Note that 3GPP path loss models have been shown to overestimate path loss at large distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref> the CIH model from 3GPP simulations predicts on average, 29 dB less path loss for a TX height of 150 m compared to 10 m. On the other hand, the CIH model that includes empirical 73 GHz data, on average predicts 17 dB less path loss for a TX height of 150 m compared to 10 m. This difference in decrease of path loss could result in overestimating interference and coverage when using the 3GPP NLOS RMa path loss model compared to the CIH NLOS path loss model. It is evident that the CIH models in ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) preserve the PLE dependency of base station heights in the RMa scenario, are accurate and reliable, and are much simpler and easier to use than the complicated models in 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper provided an in-depth study on the existing 3GPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> RMa LOS and NLOS path loss models for frequencies from 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz and found that no substantial empirical evidence exists to date for adoption of this model from ITU-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Given that no work existed in the literature, this paper describes field measurements conducted in rural Virginia and developed new RMa path loss models that have been verified by field data and are shown to be more accurate as well as much easier to use and understand, based on the fundamental physics of radio propagation, and include a height dependent PLE since the TX height can have a considerable effect on RMa path loss.</p><p>The LOS CI path loss model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref> derived from simulated path loss samples resulted in a RMSE of 5.9 dB, a good match with the 3GPP LOS model in (1) which specified a SF of 4 to 6 dB. Similarly, the NLOS CI model in (13) that was derived from simulating the 3GPP NLOS RMa path loss model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, resulted in a RMSE of 8.2 dB compared to the SF of 8 dB specified in 3GPP/ITU-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. The similar performance in LOS and NLOS CI models optimized from simulated data suggests that a model grounded in the true physics of free space propagation could be used as an optional model in 3GPP for RMa path loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>It was also shown that the CIH model could effectively model RMa path loss in LOS and NLOS environments for a large range of base station heights. When optimized to fit simulated 3GPP data from ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) across an array of transmitter heights, the optimized CIH models in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">15</ref>) had comparable performance with RMSE values of 5.6 dB and 8.7 dB for LOS and NLOS, respectively, compared to 4 to 6 dB and 8 dB SF values for the 3GPP models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The CIH model's effective scaling of PLE by the transmitter height -a reasonable physical correction factor -is, therefore an accurate and sufficient option for RMa path loss modeling from 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz.</p><p>The CI model parameters were optimized from real-world measurement data at mmWave frequencies, taken in clear weather and in a rural setting with a TX height of ∼110 m and RX heights from 1.6 m to 2 m. The derived CI models from measurements resulted in a LOS PLE = 2.16 (σ = 1.7 dB) and a NLOS PLE = 2.75 (σ = 6.7 dB), indicating how models with one parameter can faithfully estimate path loss in a much simpler form than 3GPP-style models. The solid physical basis of the CI path loss model is an important feature for modeling true free space propagation in the first meter, compared to the 3GPP models that contain numerous and odd correction factors. Thus, the two CI models for RMa path loss in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) may be used for frequencies from 500 MHz and up to at least 100 GHz. It is noteworthy that the narrowband CW measurement system used here is equivalent to a wideband channel sounder with 21.7 dBW EIRP of RF transmit power over 800 MHz of bandwidth and with 190 dB of dynamic range (10 dB greater than in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>), which is still a relatively small transmit power compared to today's cellular base stations.</p><p>The RMa measurements were also used to derive the optimal parameters for the CIH model since TX height has historically been proven to have a large impact on path loss. Since the measurements consisted of a single base station height (110 m), we used the simulated CIH models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref> along with measured data to derive the optimal CIH model parameters. Doing so ensured that for the conditions of our measurement campaign (h BS = 110 m, and f c = 73 GHz), the CIH models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref> revert to the CI models in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>. It is obvious from the derived CIH path loss models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) that the effective PLE reduces as the base station height increases (b tx = -0.03 in LOS; b tx = -0.049 in NLOS), where the average decrease in path loss across all T-R distances when considering a base station height of 150 m compared to 10 m, is 17 dB. The closed-form solution equations to derive optimal CIH model parameters are provided in Appendix A so that others may create similar models for RMa path loss.</p><p>This paper investigated the questionable use of the current 3GPP/ITU-R RMa path loss models for frequencies above 6 GHz. Empirically-based CI and CIH path loss models were proposed in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>, that can be considered for adoption in 3GPP and ITU-R for frequencies above 500 MHz and beyond 100 GHz for the RMa scenario. The models herein are validated with real-world mmWave measurements above 6 GHz at the 73 GHz mmWave band, and have the same mathematical form as the optional UMa, UMi, and InH path loss models already in 3GPP, and are proven to offer superior prediction accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> when applied to new frequencies, distances, or use cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. It is suitable to extrapolate the CI and CIH models for 0.5 GHz to 100 GHz from 73 GHz measurements since many measurements and models across various scenarios and mmWave bands have shown that propagation is independent of frequency beyond the first meter of propagation. However, more measurements for other heights and different frequencies above 6 GHz and in the mmWave bands are needed to further confirm the accuracy of the CI and CIH RMa path loss models presented herein.</p></div>
