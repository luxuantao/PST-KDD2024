<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The overwhelming acceptance of short message service (SMS) by GSM subscribers in Europe, the intriguing success of i-mode in Japan, and, especially, the ongoing implementation of new mobile network technologies (GPRS and UMTS architectures) have opened the perspective of the mobile network's transformation from a voice-only network to an integrated network infrastructure offering voice and data services. Certainly, wireless data services are still in an embryonic stage of development, with mobile messaging emerging as the "killer application." However, industry observers predict that the growth of mobile services will be powered by the distribution of useful or fun content. The "mobile," they argue, has special value in that is able to offer personalized content and target very specific vertical markets [20].</p><p>In light of the spectacular fall of Vivendi, the vision of the mobile network as a distribution channel for personalized interactive content delivered directly to wireless devices has been somewhat toned down. People now speak very carefully about the perspectives of mobile commerce, and the emphasis is rather now on something technologically simple that uses the mobile network as a complementary distribution channel for delivering old-fashioned commercial information and interactive promotional advertising. It is called mobile marketing; it is based on mobile messaging (today on SMS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> tomorrow on MMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> ), and it promises the advent of a new marketing channel, interconnected with the Internet and television, and complementary to traditional marketing channels. According to a recent study by Forrester Research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> marketers agree that SMS marketing has interesting properties: high-speed message delivery, interactivity, great customer reach, and a response rate five times higher than direct mail. Product makers and service providers are experimenting with mobile marketing, and are eager to integrate the new medium into their business operations as a tool to foster and maintain strong relationships with their prospects. Not without caution: Given the very personal nature of a mobile device, numerous industry observers refer to permission-based marketing as the appropriate context for mobile marketing. The concept of permission marketing is the idea that people will give their permission to allow the marketer to educate them on its products. Permission marketing, Godin argues, encourages consumers to participate in long-term, interactive marketing campaigns in which they are rewarded in some way for paying attention to increasingly relevant messages [9]. By establishing interactive relationships with its customers, a company may, over time, secure repeat business and increasing levels of expenditure [5].</p><p>Mobile marketing test-drives are proliferating around the world, with the United Kingdom as the laboratory of innovation. Powerful brand names are involved: McDonalds, Procter &amp; Gamble, Nestle, Wella, RTL, and Channel 5. New companies are activated. Technologies and business models are assessed through experimental campaigns and user-attitude studies in the context of a continuous market assessment process [1].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mobile Marketing: Morphology and Infrastructure</head><p>The McDonald's restaurant chain increased store traffic and built a customer database of mobile numbers with an effective 10-week mobile marketing campaign that motivated 220,000 customers to become subscribers to a McSMS service. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> They mostly belonged to the "elusive and fickle" youth market segment. The case illustrates that mobile, as a communication tool, can become an effective marketing tool with which firms and consumers can exchange information, interact, and establish a relationship.</p><p>Communicating with SMS is, first, a vibrant social phenomenon, part of daily life for millions of people. Once a "cult" experience for Europe's teenagers and students, SMS "texting" is now rapidly taking hold among adults 35 and over, according to the latest Mobinet study of 2,400 mobile phone users in six countries conducted by A.T. Kearney and Cambridge's Business School. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The numbers are impressive. Mobile users in all European countries send more than 25 messages per month, on average. Morgan Stanley estimates that 600 billion text messages were sent worldwide during 2002, and forecasts a high growth rate for SMS messaging volumes in the next two years [21]. Operators in Scandinavian countries generate up to 9-10 percent of their revenues from SMS messaging, with profit margins that approach 80 percent [20]. Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04: 22 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="24">April 2015</head><p>Person-to-person usage dominates the current messaging volume (at almost 90 percent), but business use of SMS messaging is suddenly increasing. Application driven messaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> is now the fastest-growing component of SMS growth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Paul Collins, A.T. Kearney principal and leader of the Mobinet study, tells his audience not to ignore the SMS opportunity: "If you regard SMS as more than just a messaging route but as a commercial opportunity, then this trend presents significant opportunities for mobile providers, retailers and marketers." <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Marketing, entertainment (games are now transferred over SMS; e.g., "The Millionaire"), and information goods commerce (ring tones and icons), are the first sectors to express a strong interest in exploring the SMS opportunity.</p><p>Marketing and promotional advertising are the areas in which SMS can most obviously be useful to a wide range of companies. The mobile is an extremely personal channel: Mobile phones are tied to one specific individual, and mobile users carry them all the time, wherever they go. This provides advertisers with the opportunity to reach their prospects when and where it is most appropriate for the effectiveness of the marketing campaign, while offering easy targeting and accountability and, potentially, high interactivity. On the other hand, SMS allows service users to send and receive only a single short message that can be up to 160 characters in length. The short length and poor configuration of an SMS message (the text can consist of words or numbers or an alphanumeric combination allowing for the transmission of rudimentary graphics), by definition, limit the exposure opportunities of the medium. According to a recent Forrester Research study, marketers and early adopters, in fact, show concerns about the limitations of the 160-character limit. However, they also cite the high speed of message delivery, relatively low cost, great reach and response rate, and possibility for interactivity as the medium's top advantages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Technically speaking, to complete an operation of sending, receiving, and processing large volumes of SMS messages, one requires the use of an SMS Gateway. SMS is a store-and-forward service, meaning that short messages are not sent directly from sender to recipient, but through an SMS center (SMSC), an active element of the mobile operators network (connecting with the network's routing information devices though the signaling channel). A third party (i.e., a specialized mobile services provider or a business company) can interconnect to an operator's SMSC (through an SMS Gateway) and send (to its customers, owners of a mobile handset), receive, and process SMS messages, thus offering the SMS gateway to client applications (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The technical conditions of the interconnection vary slightly from one operator to another, depending on the SMSC technology used (Nokia, Ericsson, CMG, Logica, Sema, etc.). Different interconnection rates also apply across mobile networks. As a result, prices for mobile terminated SMS processing may vary considerably across countries and operators. Moreover, the network operator and the third party usually make nontransparent arrangements as regards the sharing of the revenues generated from such business traffic (with the operator taking almost in all cases more than half of the generated revenues).</p><p>Because mobile marketing incorporates time and location sensitivity, the possibility of campaign customization and repeated marketer-consumer in-Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 teraction, and relationship marketing, it may evolve into a very rich marketing channel. Undoubtedly, over time, its nature and form will not be textual but visual. As 2.5 and 3G technologies are progressively implemented, the mobile industry will move from text messages to picture messages, enhanced messaging (text messages plus sound, animation, picture, text-formatting enhancements), and multimedia messaging (in multiple rich media formats, video, audio plus text, etc.).</p><p>EMS (enhanced messaging system) and MMS (multimedia messaging system) are the key technologies underlying these new applications (and the innovative service that will emerge). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> MMS now drives messaging innovations throughout Europe. Morgan Stanley forecasts a modest MMS uptake with about 3 percent of the mobile installed base being transferred to MMS by 2003 [21], but according to many industry observers its impact, although slow, will be strong: The advent of MMS or any other rich media wireless messaging protocol will drastically increase the sophistication of mobile marketing techniques and allow new groups of marketers to jump on the bandwagon. 11</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MT</head><p>More specifically, in their entry steps, key mobile marketing industry players seem to be guided by certain premises. Advertisers and brand names are motivated by the need to understand the perceived advantages of mobile marketing relative to traditional marketing channels. Mobile marketing companies, the emerging intermediaries for mobile marketing, want to multiply trials and experiments as a strategy to stimulate the diffusion of mobile marketing among marketers. By collecting market information (through probing and experimentation) and then interpreting it internally and acting accordingly, mobile marketing companies are progressively creating the necessary organizational routines (i.e., the repetitive patterns of activity that make an organization effective and reinforce its position in the competition) [22]. Some distinctive cases of mobile marketing are presented below. Although the cases do not offer generic conclusions, they highlight the marketing objectives, processes, and obtained results of mobile marketing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Channel 5</head><p>Channel 5 wanted to drive viewing shares to specific Sunday 9:00 P.M. blockbuster films (one of its prime audience zones) and on that basis to conduct a "loyalty exercise" by building an interactive dialogue with its viewers. In February and March 2001, Channel 5, working together with Flytxt, a mobile marketing company in the United Kingdom, executed a C5 Movie Bonanza, a customer acquisition and retention mobile marketing campaign. Channel 5 viewers were motivated with prizes ranging from £1,000 (€1,600) to £20,000 (€32,000) to answer a series of questions and quizzes about the Movie Bonanza films (through SMS messages or by using the Web or calling an IVR number). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> The Movie Bonanza competition was advertised in a series of TV trailers, during which viewers were encouraged to opt-in by sending an SMS message to Channel 5; that is, to explicitly give consent to receive film-related information and SMS reminders ahead of time. At the end of each film, registered users could take part in the competition by answering an SMS message from Channel 5 asking a question about the film they were watching.</p><p>In spite of the fact that there was no campaign-focus on targeted groups, 13 the new marketing channel proved to be successful in motivating customer participation. The campaign generated more than 99,000 registrations. Nearly 90 percent of the SMS subscribers were registered within 15 minutes after viewing a trailer. Up to 80 percent of the participants text-messaged their replies to the question, and 90 percent of this group sent their replies immediately after the movie. By giving viewers a fun incentive to watch the films, the campaign created a loyal audience for the 9:00 P.M. movies and left behind a customer database of C5 viewers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> In addition, Channel 5 collected direct feedback from viewers and established a close and regular relationship with them through interactive dialogues. Later in the year (October 2001), Channel Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 5 obtained similar results when it designed a Movie Bonanza II competition for the Tuesday 6:00 P.M. film zone, based on the database it had created during the Movie Bonanza I campaign.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smash Hits Magazine</head><p>Smash Hits is a well-known youth music magazine in England. In November 2000, it launched an interactive text-messaging campaign as part of a "strengthen-market position" strategy within its target market. The campaign, enabled by Flytxt, had several aims. First, it would use the mobile medium as a marketing tool to initiate interactive dialogues with existing readers and thereby enhance brand awareness and brand value (customer-retention strategy). Second, it would increase circulation by promoting a text-messaging club for teenagers as part of its database acquisition strategy (customeracquisition strategy).</p><p>Smash Hits launched a variety of mechanisms for interactive dialogues. Readers who had signed up for the campaign (by sending an SMS message or through IVR or by using the Web) received content messages, magazine reminders, and "relationship messages" (interactive games, votes, feedback, the possibility of having their replies published in the magazine, etc.) that prompted them to reply and continue the dialogue. Next, Smash Hits targeted its member base with special promotional offerings. To create a database for potential new customers, Flytxt designed an appealing strategy for teenagers involving easily opened subscriptions to a text-messaging club that provided its members with the latest news about pop groups, gossip, and similar topics. The subscription was initiated through an SMS message sent to a Smash Hits number that teenagers could find in the magazine or on flyers at Smash Hits events or viral Smash Hits "Business Cards."</p><p>As reported by Flytxt, the campaign had the following results:</p><p>• increased magazine subscriptions • additional revenue from promotions • easy creation of potential-customers database with addresses and profiles (at the Smash Hits concerts more than 20 percent of the teenagers subscribed to the Smash Hits Club).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ZagMe</head><p>In 2000-2001, ZagMe, a wireless content provider in the United Kingdom, conducted a mobile marketing trial at the two largest shopping centers in the London area. People were asked to register when they visited the mall. Location-identification technology was not used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> To receive offers from local shops, consumers participating in the service only had to provide mobile phone numbers. However, if they wished to opt in for the more targeted service, they had to enter a personal profile specifying the types of offers they wanted to receive. Participants were empowered to activate the service only if they were Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 willing to receive promotions and were also able to state how many alerts they wished to receive.</p><p>Retailers working with the service provided ZagMe with store promotions on a regular schedule, and these were then forwarded to the appropriate audience of shoppers. Top Shop, Pizza Hut, Reebok, Lush, and All Sports were among the many retailers that signed up. Note that discount offers via ZagMe rarely exceeded the retailers' standard profit margins. The promotions usually aimed to drive consumers to shops with special offers that would expire after a certain period.</p><p>Adeptra, the company that provided the infrastructure for the ZagMe service, reports that ZagMe has reached 50,000 registered users, including a relatively large proportion of teenagers. The obtained conversion rates were at about 10 percent, and consumers between 25 and 34 years of age spent the most after taking up the offers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>McDonald's</head><p>In 2001, McDonald's conducted a large mobile marketing campaign with 12snap, a large mobile marketing and entertainment company in the United Kingdom and Italy. The campaign had three specific objectives:</p><p>• raise brand-name awareness in youth markets.</p><p>• increase traffic and sales by promoting specific McDonald's products. • build a McDonald's customer database of mobile numbers.</p><p>The campaign was launched through in-store flyers. Customers were encouraged to opt in by sending an SMS message to McSMS. They were then entertained with mobile prizes and competitions, interactive quizzes, and tactical time-sensitive SMS promotions. The trade press reports that the campaign used a combination of cell broadcasting and SMS, and thus was able to push entertaining sound files and text messages to the customers. McDonald's generated more than 220,000 responses in 10 weeks, and more than 500,000 subscribers by the end of the year. 12snap reported a response rate close to 30 percent. In 2002, McDonald's confirmed its commitment to mobile marketing with a new campaign sponsoring a popular music group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ministry of Sound</head><p>In 2000, Ministry of Sound, a London-based entertainment complex for young people, recruited the Aerodeon mobile marketing company to run a mobile marketing campaign for the launch of a new Ministry of Sound product, "S'Move" music nights. The campaign was initiated with an SMS registration process that invited customers to send a message to a phone number displayed on promotional material. Prospects who replied to the promotional messages received a text ticket (a sort of redemption coupon) that allowed Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 them to jump the queue and benefit from a free entry if they brought four persons. The campaign's main results are listed below: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> • The level of response for the first two messages was 15 percent (this exceeded the target set beforehand; the response to the texted vouchers also exceeded expectations). • All told, 84 percent of the text tickets issued were redeemed at the door.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>United Kingdom Department of Health</head><p>The U.K. Department of Health decided to test and use mobile marketing as a medium for stop-smoking campaigns among the young population. Flytxt was commissioned to create an SMS campaign scenario that could speak to a youthful audience. The campaign was launched on September 31, 2001 with the intention of driving young people to watch Smokescreen short films. Young people were motivated to participate in the SMS campaign through advertisements in teen magazines and text messages to the opt-in database of Smokescreen's exclusive broadcast partner (TV Trouble). Campaign participants could win a number of prizes, including an annual cinema pass and "first class" access to Smokescreen film news. The SMS campaign, which was part of a broader Tobacco Education Campaign, was intended to give the audience something to think about and to capture the thoughts of teenagers about the culture of smoking. Thanks to the SMS operation, according to Flytxt, the Department of Health was able to make a difference among teenagers in their awareness and perception of smoking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness Indicators for Mobile Marketing Campaigns</head><p>Looking at the process of mobile marketing from the inside, one observes that three conclusions from the experimental cases capture the attention of marketers: (1) the relatively high response rates, (2) the relatively low costs, and</p><p>(3) the positive indications, although still uncertain, of the effectiveness of mobile marketing campaigns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High Response Rates</head><p>The rates of response from correctly targeted mobile marketing campaigns, as reported in the trade press, averaged between 10 and 20 percent and in some cases were as high as 30 percent (responses are easily accountable and recyclable in interactive marketing campaigns). Forrester Research evaluates the response rate to SMS ads and campaigns at 11 percent, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> which is probably five times higher than that of direct mail (1-2 percent), and much more important than the response rates in e-mail marketing (5 percent), trade shows (1.4 percent), and printed advertising (0.15-0.60 percent). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relatively Low Cost</head><p>Forrester Research evaluates the cost of an average SMS campaign at €24,000. This budget is, of course, far from typical broadcasting advertising expenses, but comparisons with media suitable for mass communication (e.g., television, radio, print) have no real value. The low cost/high response rate of an SMS marketing campaign, which is well suited to targeted marketing, makes it easy to operate as part of an integrative marketing plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Positive Indications of Effectiveness</head><p>The results outlined below, as reported in various publications of the trade press, demonstrate the effectiveness of mobile marketing:</p><p>1. Brand name recall rates for mobile marketing are quite high, ranging from 46 to 64 percent. 2. In text-to-win campaigns with winners receiving SMS discount coupons (free gifts or special offers used to draw mobile users to chain stores and outlets, an emerging business model for mobile marketing), marketers report high rates of redemption of the issued coupons at the store (up to 80 percent). 3. Cadbury Schweppes, the United Kingdom-based FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) giant, ran a "text-to-win" campaign with 12snap. According to Cadbury Schweppes, SMS texting gave its sales a push and made a substantial contribution to its 12 percent rise in pre-tax profits in 2001. 4. SMS campaigns are successful with younger segments of the market, a difficult audience to approach through traditional marketing channels. The campaigns are especially effective in generating continuous dialogue with customers and supporting interactive marketing.</p><p>These impressive early results will have to be reconsidered in the light of the increase in spam-SMS, since spam may significantly damage the effectiveness of commercial SMS messages. One may also wonder whether the current high response rates will continue when the mobile marketing hype wears off.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mobile Marketing Channel: Complementary, Direct, and Permission-Based</head><p>The mobile marketing channel has several essential characteristics.</p><p>• The mobile marketing channel should be understood as a complement to other marketing channels. In most cases, a traditional medium is needed (television, press, Web sites, flyers, etc.) to broadcast the "invitation" to participate in a mobile marketing campaign (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). On the other side, mobile marketing enhances the potential of traditional marketing channels, because it: (1) enables Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 mechanisms for rapid and effective appreciation of prospects' reactions (SMS advertising response rate, loyalty in reply, conversion to purchase statistics, etc.), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) collects customer behavior data (including time-and location-sensitive information) and builds databases for next-step direct marketing activities [14].</p><p>• The central principle of mobile marketing is prospect-initiated communication followed by the possibility of an active two-way exchange. Thus a mobile marketing campaign can successfully target prospects if it discovers the interested consumers and avoids irritating the others. The only way to proceed is by asking permission, and the mobile offers companies novel opportunities to get such permission and develop interactive relationships with their customers. Permission is the tool that makes loyalty and frequency work [9, 15]. However, permission marketing requires a complex management marketing strategy, and the competencies for continuously acquiring broader permission are not trivial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Taxonomy and Process of a Mobile Marketing Campaign</head><p>Depending on the type of permission given by the customer, there are four models for a mobile marketing campaign, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Model 1, the one-off push, can be characterized as relationship generation/maintenance. Internet consumers, to give an example, provide Buongiorno, a leading European company in direct digital marketing, with detailed information about their preferences and interests and sign up to receive SMS promotional alerts and special offerings from advertisers working with Buongiorno. In other cases, where brand names directly transact with their customers, the custom-  ers can respond to SMS based text-to-win or promotional quizzes (or "receive a logo/ring tone" campaigns) used to build brand awareness. The level of permission intensity in this campaign model is relatively low (breadth strategy for customer acquisition) in the sense that the marketer seeks to develop a relationship with a large number of targeted consumers.</p><p>Model 2, the one-off pull, is similar to a retail promotion, with marketers focusing on a smaller set of customers (depth strategy for customer acquisition/retention purposes) who give (high-intensity) permission to receive SMS coupons and special personalized offerings during a certain period, and their buying behavior (including responses to the firm's part marketing promotions) are monitored and analyzed.</p><p>Model 3, the continued dialogue, can be described as loyalty creation/maintenance in the sense that marketers create conditions for interacting with the customers on a continuous basis (depth strategy for customer retention). This strategy is often implemented through SMS membership clubs, a tool for sustaining stable demand and sales flows over time [17].</p><p>Model 4, fund-raising, is a simple mechanism that encourages mobile users to donate to a charity (breadth strategy). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> To implement these models, the marketer must be able to manage an iterative marketing campaign with "structured dialogues" and promotional messages in which consumers are encouraged to become participants. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows, the campaign process has four essential steps: design, development, execution, and tracking/analysis/reporting (post-campaign analysis and reporting), and involves an ongoing process, cycling among goals, marketing strategies, and service modules (i.e., text-to-win questions, polls, quizzes).</p><p>The engine implementing the service modules of a marketing campaign is called, in industry jargon, a mobile engine or platform, and it connects to the rest of the infrastructure (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Resources and Complementary Assets in Mobile Marketing Markets</head><p>The mechanics of the mobile marketing campaign, as described above, give an insight into the identity of the key players in the emerging industry, including several technology/content providers. The discussion in this section will explain how key resources and competencies for effective mobile marketing campaigns are split across organizational boundaries. It will then consider the competitive potential of the emerging mobile marketing company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Industry Value Chain</head><p>The value chain of the emerging industry exemplifies the fact that a variety of competencies and resources (creative, technical, marketing, campaign management) are necessary to deliver the final product (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>The stages of value chain are discussed briefly below. Mobile marketing companies (MMCs) are the initiators of mobile market-Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 ing operations. They want to establish a clear and defendable position in the industry as a new breed of e-intermediaries: technically skilled, venture capital-funded, and B2B-oriented. They are working to establish well-defined industry standards (clean SMS campaigns, easily managed through a Web interface, well-understood metrics of effectiveness), and are focused on targeting specific segments of the market while progressively augmenting the width of their offerings. Flytxt, 12snap, Aerodeon, Puca, and Buongiorno are among the most famous European pioneers in the industry.</p><p>Most of the mobile marketing customers at present are brand names, mainly in FMCG industries, music and film distributors, radio-television and press groups, or government agencies (B2B market).</p><p>Mobile operators contribute to the industry value chain with their network infrastructures, yet they can use their access advantage to provide mobile marketing services to mobile consumers, perhaps in partnership with application providers or advertisers. This downward move could be a consequence of operators' over-investment in 3G licenses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competitive Position of Mobile Marketing Companies</head><p>Mobile marketing companies have generated revenue streams, attracted venture capital, and now are carefully expanding across European countries. But the future of these companies, still uncertain, will be shaped by the organizational capabilities (i.e., resources and competences) they develop, and fundamentally depends on the appropriation of gains from the mobile marketing innovation. Essentially, the issue pertains to the performance of these innovative companies in the face of competition from established advertising agencies that possess complementary assets critical to the commercialization of mobile marketing services. Putting it another way, can mobile marketing companies remain independent and intelligently use various forms of alliances for their own sake to effectively capture niche markets, or should they fall, sooner or later, into the "hierarchies" of the large advertising conglomerates? The discussion that follows draws conclusions from the competition between new entrants vs. incumbents in knowledge-based industries that benefit from technology change, and from cases where new entrants succeeded in surviving and growing within competition-buffered market niches (biopharmaceuticals, Internet advertising, film industry). Finally, it explores various theoretical paths along which such an issue might be pursued. 21</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What We Know from the Literature</head><p>In the theory of technological innovation, there is no simple response to the question of the competition between new entrants and incumbent enterprises in the face of technological change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Small innovative companies with breakthrough technologies, superior and customizable products based on these technologies, and flexible organization, have obvious advantages over established firms when entering new or newly reorganized industries. In many cases, new entrants lead in developing and adopting technologies that shape the future of the industry. Nevertheless, in other cases, incumbents, not only succeed in avoiding failure, but also are able to learn from radical technological change and to prosper by appropriating its potential. Empirical studies are available that demonstrate both perspectives, new entrants displacing incumbents and large firms dominating the "creative destruction" process. But in general, as Teece argues, when incumbent firms possess critical complementary assets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> new entrants with no such assets, or unable to contract for them, may be at a disadvantage, despite the technological performance of their products [27, 28]. In this regard, Rothaermel found that in the biopharmaceutical industry, new biotechnology firms struggling to survive (because they lack capital and the necessary complementary downstream value-chain activities to commercialize their drug discoveries) contract for Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 complementary assets with traditional pharmaceutical firms through extensive interfirm cooperation [25]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Teece lays out a framework for identifying when the complementary assets of the incumbents provide them with an advantage [27, 28]. Under a regime of weak appropriability (a weak appropriability regime is a situation where an innovation can easily spill over to competitors), the probability that new entrants will profit from the innovation depends on how tightly incumbent firms hold the complementary assets (it is implied that prior commercialization activities have enabled established firms to build such complementary assets). If they are better positioned with respect to critical complementary assets, incumbents can in fact outperform new entrants. Christensen and Rosenbloom clarify the situation by explaining that incumbents are likely to lead their industries in innovations that address needs within their value network, which is defined as "the context within which a firm identifies and responds to customer needs, procures input and reacts to the competitor" [3]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> On the contrary, incumbents may lag in the development of innovations that address customers' needs as defined in emerging value networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competitive Potential of Mobile Marketing Companies</head><p>The theories discussed in the preceding section make it easier to evaluate the competitive potential advantage of mobile marketing companies (MMCs). Three criteria will be employed.</p><p>• The industry's appropriability regime. Mobile marketing innovation is weakly appropriable, as can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>, where the portfolio of resources and competencies needed for mobile marketing services is compared against current organizational boundaries. The large distribution of key resources and competences among various players explains why mobile marketing services are typically offered under a cooperative arrangement of some sort. MMCs are poised to provide an innovative service, but in order to deliver their products to the customer (brand names, etc.), they may require use of (1) mobile operators and/or WASP infrastructures, and (2) advertising agency distribution channels. • The nature of complementary assets. Complementary assets that are necessary to commercialize mobile marketing services are quite tightly held. Traditional advertising companies have developed, and carefully protect, long-term relationships with large accounts and governments. Similarly they protect their advantage across all media, including the Internet and mobile portals. The new mobile marketing companies lack the necessary complementary downstream activities (i.e., strong contacts with the market) to approach large accounts, and they lack the capital to finance them. • The degree to which mobile marketing addresses the well-understood needs of typical customers of advertising services within the value network in which traditional advertising companies are positioned. Mobile marketing belongs to a new generation of adver-Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 tising services that build on the concept of targeted marketing, but it can be used efficiently only in conjunction with other marketing channels. From this point of view, traditional advertising agencies are able to integrate the mobile marketing channel in their existing value networks, despite the difficulties they might then experience in dealing with increasingly proliferating media (cable TV, Web/digital media, mobile), each with its own peculiarities and advertising business models. However, the mobile channel, as well as other new marketing channels where technological expertise is increasingly important (direct marketing, database marketing, etc.), may also create the conditions for the formation of emerging value networks around specialized advertising services. Kotler is very explicit on this prospect:</p><p>A study of top management and marketing executives in large consumer companies indicated that over 70 percent favored the concept of Integrated Marketing Campaign (IMC). Several large advertising agencies-Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Young &amp; Rubicam, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi-acquired major agencies specializing in sales promotion, public relations, and direct marketing in order to provide one-stop shopping. But to their disappointment, most clients have not bought their integrated marketing communications package, preferring to put together the specialized agencies by themselves [13, p. 568]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Given the combination of weak appropriability, complementary assets tightly held by traditional advertising companies, and a certain ambivalence about the capacity of established value networks to address new customer needs, the theoretical framework presented in this article would predict that the owner of the complementary assets (i.e., the established advertising agencies) will determine who is more likely to benefit from the innovation. Obviously, new entrants have a need to cooperate with incumbent advertising firms in order to approach (business) customers, and develop mobile marketing campaigns for them. Such arrangements are typified by the cooperation of 12snap with Triangle (one of the leading marketing/advertising agencies in the United Kingdom) to serve the mobile marketing needs of the confectionary</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resource or competence</head><p>Location (who has it) giant Cadbury, and by the collaboration of Flytxt with the Curio advertising company to promote Twentieth Century-Fox films in the United Kingdom. Through the mechanism of interfirm agreements, incumbents aspire to absorb mobile marketing resources from the partnering mobile marketing company, then use them, in collaboration with upstream players in the value chain (WASPs or mobile operators moving downstream), to enter the mobile marketing business themselves. Because of the environmental uncertainty about the outlook for mobile marketing, incumbents, in these early days, seem to prefer cooperative arrangements of this kind, which also offer them the possibility of progressively reducing the procedural uncertainty they face in this regard [6]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> However, little by little, this mechanism may later lead to the integration of the new entrants within the organizational boundaries of the large advertising conglomerates.</p><p>Nonetheless, the traditional slowness of advertising companies in adopting new technologies, together with the possibility of a new value network emerging, may open a window of opportunity for survival for some of the emerging mobile marketing companies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strategies for Exploring the Window of Opportunity</head><p>Tripsas's viewpoint will be adopted to evaluate the commercial performance of new entrants vs. incumbents within this window of opportunity [29]. She argues that the battle between new entrants and incumbents is driven by the balance and interaction of three factors: investment, technological performance (closely related to product quality), and appropriability through specialized complementary assets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> With reference to the typesetting industry, she provides empirical support for the following arguments: (1) incumbents may not be reluctant to invest in new technologies, but as their approach to new product development is shaped by their prior experience, the products they develop are consistently inferior to those of new entrants; (2) despite this mediocre product performance, incumbents did not suffer in the market, because complementary assets buffer incumbents from the effects of "creative destruction." <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> This multiple-perspectives view can be extended with a stylized fact from the biopharmaceutical industry [25]. Incumbents use interfirm cooperation as a cost-effective way to respond to ongoing change, since they consider the cost of exploration (i.e., the cost of investing in the beginning of a new technology cycle) to be higher than the cost of exploitation through cooperation with the innovators in the later stages of the innovation path. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> It is argued here that the balance and interaction between investment, technological performance, and appropriability through specialized complementary assets, and interfirm cooperation, will define the expected competition outcome in the mobile marketing industry. Established advertising agencies will probably be reluctant to quickly invest substantial amounts in the new technology (again because the cost of exploration seems larger than the cost of exploitation). Actually, most of them have slowly become aware of the Internet as a marketing vehicle and have considerably delayed investing the necessary resources [18]. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> This gives an attacker opportunity to emerging mo-Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 bile marketing companies that can capitalize on the initial industry's high growth rates. How can this translate into an attacker advantage? How can it be sustained when advertising agencies progressively begin mobile marketing efforts within their organizations (either by acquiring new entrants or by building specialized-in-mobile marketing internal divisions) or contract with mobile marketing companies (interfirm cooperation)?</p><p>At the outset, new entrants need to focus on technological performance, consolidating their mobile marketing technologies and mobile marketing campaign process skills into competencies that empower them to develop products superior to those of established advertising agencies. The innovation of mobile marketing challenges the product performance of established firms in the sense that it introduces requirements for campaign performance management capabilities that are not systematically necessary in traditional advertising and marketing campaigns (as occurred before similar innovations, such as database and Internet marketing). These capabilities include design and execution of "customer dialogues for mobile users" campaigns, post-campaign analysis, and reporting that uses specialized marketing campaign management (MCM) software and project management. Mobile marketing companies should perceive and pursue such opportunities created by the introduction of a new generation of technology (i.e., mobile messaging as a marketing/advertising platform). They should especially invest in the execution and high-performance management of mobile marketing campaigns with the expectation that early investments and learning-by-doing will allow them to (1) build resource position barriers toward other newcomers, competitors from the same industry, or diversifying firms from the Internet advertising sector with competencies in digital/interactive marketing [12] 32 and (2) obtain technological performance superior to what the incumbents will develop when entering the industry-in other words, develop technical expertise to counterbalance the natural advantage of incumbents on the creative aspect of an advertising campaign. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> Second, mobile marketing companies should be aware that even if they perform well in terms of product quality, the solid value of the complementary assets of established advertising agencies (sales network/customer relationships, brand name) can be expected to buffer them against the effects of developing new technological capability slower than new entrants. In other words, the specialized complementary assets of the incumbents retain their value, despite the erosion of innovative technology, in the execution and monitoring of a marketing campaign. However, as theory predicts [3], the emergence of a new value network because of the formation of a new buyer segment may create an opportunity for new entrants to build their own specialized complementary assets, as can a new buyer habitude (in occurrence, marketing managers in large companies seem to oppose more and more advertising agencies on their one-stop shopping strategies and turn digital marketing campaigns over to specialized companies) [13]. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> With strong technological performance and by progressively building specialized complementary assets of this nature, entrants can create resources that are imperfectly imitable, imperfectly substitutable, and imperfectly tradable, and therefore underpin sustainable competitive advantage.</p><p>Where, then, does a strategic commitment based on technological perfor-Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 mance and progressive build-up of specialized complementary assets come from? Essentially, the discussion so far has concerned the conditions that must be met for a new entrant with relevant innovative technologies to enjoy successful entry, survival, and sustainable competitive advantage in a service industry where incumbents hold complementary assets and innovation does not affect their value, but emerging new value networks may be formed as a result of technological change. Successful entry strategy in such an industry may be envisioned as an interplay between functional specialization and market interpretation.</p><p>Functional specialization [26] to obtain technological performance has two dimensions: (1) the deepening of knowledge in embedding creative outputs in mobile applications (i.e., interactive dialogues), and (2) the provision of a functionally coherent set of services that have wide application in the industry, cutting across customers (brands, advertising agencies, interactive marketing companies, sales promotion companies, government agencies, etc.) and product categories (e.g., permission advertising, marketing for sales promotion, marketing for building loyalty, fundraising marketing).</p><p>Market interpretation or intermediation [2, 23], as an approach to building specialized complementary assets, implies the acquisition of the capacity to translate mobile marketing into a form that transparently fits into the customer's ongoing perception of advertising and marketing. For these purposes, it is useful for new entrants to develop an iterative product development approach that can incorporate demand requirements while familiarizing the customer with the technology dimension of a mobile marketing campaign. In fact, a careful reading of public material from the Flytxt and 12snap Web sites shows that both companies use similar standardized interpretative cognitive schemes in working with their customers. The scheme consists of three steps: (1) define the customer's objectives, (2) create a few technology-enabled contingent dialogues that implement these objectives in the context of a mobile marketing campaign, and (3) test campaign effectiveness by using appropriate benchmarks. In such a context, where the customer begins a conversation with the marketer and the technology, new entrants can easily build a distinguished position and outperform their larger rivals. Another point at which interpretation can be seen as a favorable condition for new entrants is the complexity of the interaction between brands, advertising agencies, and technologies and infrastructure providers. Mobile marketing companies hold a central position in these networks of relationships between firms belonging to different ecologies-they are the only players who possess communication channels with all the others and, as a result, who can act as intermediaries between the different firms.</p><p>The movie industry provides an example of successfully positioned new entrants that possess the two characteristics of functional specialization and position as an interpreter within a network of firms. In a recent article criticizing the efficiency of conglomerates in the media sector, the Economist reports that Hollywood studios have allowed autonomous boutiques to flourish within their conglomerate structure, designed to nurture a more creative, less formulaic spirit. A pattern has characterized creative industries throughout their short history as massentertainment media. The record industry has for years been built on Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04: 22 24 April 2015  this model: small independent labels (such as Island Records), which are better at spotting new artists, are bought by the big guys (in its case Polygram, now part of Universal), which then begin the search for small independents again. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> At the end of the story, for small innovative companies, surviving inside or outside a conglomerate may have limited significance in a world where large corporations progressively disaggregate in smaller, more autonomous units, thus seeking an optimal mix of hierarchical and market elements [30].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>If mobile marketing is to be an effective and lucrative industry, it has to deliver relevant, requested, and interactive content to the customer. End-user privacy must be respected, and therefore permission marketing for opt-in, with clear opt-out instructions, is the efficient way to proceed. Public policy should encourage industry self-regulation bodies to define standards for privacy and consumer protection, and avoid direct implication in these early stages of experimentation with an innovative marketing channel that is not yet clearly understood.</p><p>To a certain degree, the rate of diffusion of mobile marketing services depends on the growth of the few mobile marketing companies, early entrants in this industry, that push ahead by harnessing the potential of this new marketing channel. They will soon face increased competition from established players. The winners will need to move quickly to establish complementary assets to produce and deliver their innovative products and services, and cultivate new value networks. 20. Text-messaging charitable campaigns have recently started in Europe based on premium-priced SMS numbers. The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC) reports the success of a recent campaign "into which the public response surpassed all expectations in terms of the volume of the donations and their value."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NOTES</head><p>21. The framework developed here to analyze the competitive position of mobile marketing companies is based on [7, 10, 27, 28]. For a genuine application of these theories in a context very different from the one that inspired the present methodology, see [8].</p><p>22. For a complete overview of the literature on the relative performance of new entrants and incumbents in the face of creative destruction, see in particular [11, 25,  29].</p><p>23. The complementary assets are related activities, like marketing and distribution channel resources, but also complementary technologies needed to commercialize the innovation [24].</p><p>24. As Rothaermel [25] and Hill and Rothaermel [11] point out, these interfirm agreements allow participants to focus on their comparative advantages, but mostly enhance the absorptive capacity of the incumbents [16] and consequently help the established firms better appropriate the benefits of the innovation.</p><p>25. Christensen and Rosenbloom also explain that the value network essentially defines the nested commercial network of producers and markets through which the various key-resources linked to an innovative product are made and sold to the integrators at the next-higher level of the product value chain [3].</p><p>26. Kotler continues: "Why the resistance? Large companies employ several communication specialists to work with their brand managers. Each communication specialist knows little about the other communication tools. Furthermore, the specialists usually have favorite outside agencies and oppose turning their responsibilities over to one super-agency. They argue that the company should choose the best specialist agency for each purpose, not second-and third-rate agencies just because they belong to a super-agency. They believe that the ad agency will still put most of the advertiser's money into the advertising budget" [13].</p><p>27. Neoclassical economics attributes uncertainty to a lack of information. Dosi and Egidi call this type of uncertainty "substantive," and introduce the notion of "procedural uncertainty," which reflects the gap between the complexity of an innovative situation and the agents' competence in processing information and in understanding, and progressively controlling, the situation [6].</p><p>28. The kind of complementary assets is directly linked to the innovation in question.</p><p>29. Incumbents certainly suffer commercial consequences from creative destruction when the innovation diminishes the value of specialized complementary assets.</p><p>Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 30. The same strategy seems to have been followed by established advertising agencies when they competed with new Internet advertising start-ups, in the early days of the Internet-and certainly before the 2001 sudden Internet drawback [19].</p><p>31. Later, of course, when the Internet became popular, many of the major advertising agencies, including Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Leo Burnet Co., Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Grey Advertising, Omnicom, and McCann-Erickson, developed Internet/digital marketing operations within their own organizations (through acquisitions, with Omnicom being the most typical case, or by building divisions of their own dedicated to Internet/digital marketing/advertising) [19].</p><p>32. For the time being, the slow start-up of the mobile marketing industry in the United States buffers European mobile marketing companies against competition from U.S. firms with strong experience in digital interactive marketing and diversified advertising in mobile marketing. Over the last few years, companies like ModemMedia, PoppeTyson, Razorfish, and Agency.com have been successfully offering digital advertising services to brands establishing a Web presence.</p><p>33. Generally speaking, it is difficult for traditional advertising agencies to manage the complex requirements of a digital marketing campaign for both new technical skills and integrative capacities between the creative and the execution part of a campaign.</p><p>34.

It was conceived as part of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) digital standard. 2. Multimedia Message System (MMS) is a new standard that makes it possible to send multimedia messages that combine text, sounds, images, and video to MMS-capable handsets, and to receive them over the air. 3. See Forrester Research press release; "Plan, don't spam, Forrester warns Europe's SMS marketers," January 25, 2002 (www.forrester.com/ER/Press/ Downloaded by [Nanyang Technological University] at 04:22 24 April 2015 10.

See also "Snap happy: Can multimedia messaging live up to the mobile industry's hype?" Economist, April 27, 2002. 12. Interactive Voice Response numbers (090-like numbers). 13. The targeted segment was a generic audience, 16-34 years old. 14. It is worth noting that according to Flytxt reporting, 20 percent of SMS subscribers entered the competition for more than five movies, whereas the large majority of IVR users only played once. 15. Shoppers could also sign up for the service via the ZagMe Web site or by calling ZagMe phones. 16. See Aerodeon Press Release, June 20, 2000 (www.aerodeon.com/press/ pr29jun00.html). 17.
