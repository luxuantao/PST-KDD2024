New method to minimise the preventive maintenance cost of series-parallel systems. Reliab Eng Syst Saf 2003;82:247-55]. They use genetic algorithm to minimize preventive maintenance cost problem for the series-parallel systems. We propose to improve their results developing a new method based on another technique, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The resolution consists in determining the solution vector of system component inspection periods, T P . Those calculations were applied within the programming tool Matlab.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The availability and reliability are good evaluations of a system performance. Their values depend on the system structure as well as on the component availability and reliability. These values decrease as the component ages increase, i.e. their serving times are influenced by their interactions with each others, applied maintenance policy and their environments. The approach proposed in this article considers mainly the maintenance policy influence. The other influences can be taken into account with the developed method (see Section 3.5). Among the different types of maintenance policy, we suggest to study the preventive maintenance (PM), widely applied in large systems such as transport systems, production systems, etc.</p><p>Preventive maintenance consists of a set of technical, administrative and management actions to decrease the component ages in order to improve the availability (and the reliability) of a system (reduction of probability failure or the degradation level of a system's component).</p><p>These actions can be characterized by their effects on the component age: the component becomes 'as good as new', the component age is reduced, or the state of the component is lightly affected only to ensure its necessary operating conditions, the component remaining appears to be 'as bad as old'.</p><p>PM policy has been the subject of many studies in recent years. Those studies take into consideration several criterions like cost, economic life, risk or a combination of the above stated criteria. Ushakov <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> tried to optimize preliminary planned PM considering binary-state system reliability. <ref type="bibr">Barrow</ref> and Hunter <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> demonstrated that the cost of scheduled replacement is lower than the unscheduled one. Legat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> determined the optimal interval for preventive maintenance/replacement using either an agebased or a diagnostic based renewal strategy. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> represented an algorithm of decision making about replacement scheduling of a system's main component by pursuing a maximal system profit. Bris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> tried to optimize for each component of a system, the maintenance policy minimizing the cost function, with respect to the availability constraint (A(t)RA 0 , A 0 being a fixed lower limit) on a given mission time T M . They have calculated T 0 and T p , with T 0 being the first inspection time vector and T P , the vector of system component inspection periods. T 0 was generated based on the time dependent Birnbaum importance factor (definition see in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, for example). Genetic algorithm (GA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> was used to calculate this last vector.</p><p>GA are used more often to optimize system reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> and in maintenance strategy. A genetic algorithm was used in Levitin and Lisnianski <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to calculate replacement policies leading to minimal cost plan of PM actions during multi-state system lifetime. Tsai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> used GA to decide optimal activities-combination which maximizes system unit cost life.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a new meta-heuristic to solve the problem of T P calculation treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Algorithms based on ant colony optimization (ACO) replace the GA in their search for best calculation of T P . A comparison is established between results obtained by those algorithms via cost and time evaluation.</p><p>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a population-based general search technique for the solution of difficult combinatorial problems. This method is inspired by the pheromone trail laying behavior of real ant colonies. Ant Colony Optimization takes elements from real ant behavior to solve more complex problems than those solved by real ants <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. In ACO, artificial ants are stochastic solution of construction procedures. They build probabilistically solutions by taking into account (artificial) pheromone trails which change dynamically at run time to reflect the agents acquired search experience. Solution construction is biased by pheromone trails which change at run-time, heuristic information on the problem instance and the ants private memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. ACO was initially used for the resolution of traveling salesman problem TSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Lately, ACO algorithms have become interesting for problems which cannot be easily solved by classical techniques. Gravel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have demonstrated their performance by finding solution for real industrial scheduling problem. They were applied to problems with a very short path where costs change dynamically as for example in telecommunication networks routing problems. Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> used an ant colony metaheuristic optimization method to solve the redundancy allocation problem (RAP), a comparison between GA and ACO performance was established. And recently, Nahas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> used ant system to optimize the reliability of a series system with multiple choices and budget constraints. Simulations, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, have shown that the proposed ant system is efficient with respect to the quality of solutions and the computing time.</p><p>In this proposed research, ACO are used as a technique to optimize the determination of preventive maintenance periods leading to maintenance cost minimization of series-parallel systems. Once applied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, this technique gives interesting results. This introduction is followed by four sections which present successively detailed explanations of the ACO algorithms (course of the solution, stop and evaluation criteria choice of the starting point, transition and updating rules), results and a conclusion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The studied preventive maintenance problem</head><p>Optimizing preventive maintenance policy has been the subject of many previous papers (for details see Section a random number uniformly distributed in [0,1] q 0 a parameter (0!q 0 !1) T M mission time T 0 Z(T 0 (1),T 0 (2),..T 0 (N)) the first inspection time vector T P Z(T P (1),T P (2),.,T P (N)) solution vector of system component inspection periods T k p the T P vector associated to the kth ant tour t 0 the initial value of deposed pheromone W ij the cost value of the ant tour of which the arc (i,j) forms a part W * the value of the best (lowest) cost obtained constraints. A solving method was proposed by Bris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. They have used GA to approximate the 'optimal' vector T P . The PM inspection cost for an element is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C PM Z P K kZ1 P E k iZ1</formula><p>n eði;kÞ Cðeði; kÞÞ where C(e(i,k)) is the constant cost of one inspection of the ith component in kth parallel subsystem (K parallel subsystems, with each, E k parallel components), and n e(i,k) the following integer part of the fraction</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">n eði;kÞ Z 1 C</formula><p>T M ðeði; kÞÞ K T 0 ðeði; kÞÞ T P ðeði; kÞÞ :</p><p>Based on the concept of ACO, three algorithms have been proposed to replace GAs developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Those algorithms are AS1, AS2 (inspired from Ant System) and ACS1 (inspired from Ant Colony System ACS). All those three methods are explicitly explained (their common points, their differences, etc.) in the following sections. All results obtained from the application of those algorithms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have been compared to the one obtained by GAs via cost and via time evaluation. Note that GA is used only for the comparison, interesting readers can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for further information about GA's parameter setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Course of the resolution</head><p>Each component has a list of possible intervention times Those times are randomly generated in an interval [LB,UB] according to a uniform distribution (LB is the lower bound and UB the upper bound) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Each time is a potential solution e.g. a potential intervention time. The number of generated times is independent of component's number. It is related to the problem constraints, e.g. for A 0 Z0.5, 10 generated elements would be sufficient. For A 0 Z0.8 this number will notably increase.</p><p>Each ant k builds a solution to solve this problem while moving from a list to another one so as to all visit them. Each time that an ant moves from a list to the following one, it will sweep the latter to seek best time corresponding for the concerned component. Selected time is put in a taboo list so that the other ants do not choose it any more thus making it possible to diversify research in the possible solutions space. During an iteration t, each ant kZ1.m carries out a tour T k p ðtÞ. This tour is a vector of possible times to make preventive maintenance to the system's components. The number of this vector elements is the number of the elements which we seek to determine the intervention dates, in our case, it is 11. Each T k p ðtÞ tour is a candidate vector to be the best vector T P found by this method (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). During this tour, the choice of next intervention's time j to visit, as from current time i, depends on several criteria: 1 Time j was or was not already visited The ants have an individual memory (or taboo lists) of times obtained during the tour. The visited times are put in a taboo list so no other ant, in the same iteration, could choose it defining thus the whole times in the list J k i . At the beginning of each iteration J k i , taboo lists are reset to zero. 2 It is preferable that the intervention's time is as far as possible Consequently, we have associated to each two consecutive lists, a matrix P(i,j) (visibility matrix) which is composed of random coefficients between 0 and 1, sampled in ascending order so that larger coefficients are associated to remote times. quantity of pheromone t ij (t) is associated to the way connecting times i and j This dynamic information represents the acquired desirability and influences the choice of j as a destination of i. Indeed, it is modified at the end of each iteration to reflect the experiment of the ants (quality of obtained solution) during their turn e.g. it is modified inversely proportional to T k p cost value, so that ant tours which give high costs become less desirable in the next iterations.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, a little example is given considering one iteration, two ants and five components. Each ant visits all the component lists and picks a time from each one so it constructs its own T k p . In the shown example, first ant has chosen time 3 (in arbitrary unit) as an intervention time for the first component, time 5 as an intervention time for the second component, etc. and 4 as an intervention time for the fifth component. Since each chosen time by the first ant is put in a taboo list, the second ant will obligatory choose other times thus we obtain two different ant tours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Stop and evaluation criteria</head><p>All the tours, possible solutions, built by the ants are evaluated The evaluation criterion takes account of feasibility, the cost and the availability of each turn. The evaluation criteria is taken as it is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The stop criterion does not depend only on iteration number, but still on the solution's amelioration rate. If this solution, after a given number of iterations, is not improving for N consecutive times, the resolution stops.</p><p>In spite of the great common base of the three proposed methods, they are different by the search strategy, which influences the quality of the found solution and the processing time. In the following paragraphs, these differences will be treated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Choice of the starting point</head><p>For AS1 algorithm, the m ants start from the same point This point is arbitrarily selected from the first list, then each ant built, as previously indicated, a tour, e.g. a solution. For AS2 algorithm, all ants start from the first element of the first component list. Once a solution is obtained, the search for another solution, e.g. another iteration is launched again. In this case, all ants start from the next time which is in the same list. In the last algorithm, ACS1, the m ants start from m arbitrary and different points to build their tours.These points belong to the first component list (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Transition and pheromone updating rules</head><p>Proposed algorithms work as follows Each ant generates a complete tour by choosing the intervention times according to a probabilistic state transition rule: ants prefer to move to times which are connected by edges with a high amount of pheromone and high visibility values. Pheromone updating rules (global updating rule, for AS1, AS2 and ACS1, local updating rule for ACS1) are applied: a fraction of the pheromone evaporates on all edges, and then each ant deposits an amount of pheromone on edges. The value of this amount is in proportion to how little the cost of its tour was (in other words, edges belonging to good tours receive greater amount of pheromone). The process is then iterated.</p><p>Pheromone updating is intended to allocate a greater amount of pheromone to tours leading to minimal costs. In a sense, this is similar to a reinforcement learning scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> in which better solutions get a higher reinforcement (as happens, e.g. in genetic algorithms under proportional selection). The pheromone updating formula characterizes both the addition of new pheromone deposited by ants on the visited edges, and pheromone evaporation. Pheromone placed on the edges plays the role of a distributed long term memory: this memory is not stored locally within the individual ants, but is distributed on the edges of the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This allows an indirect form of communication called stigmergy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. The interested reader will find a full Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1.">AS1 and AS2</head><p>AS1 and AS2 share the same transition rule. The probability that ant k moves from time i to time j is given by: p k ði; jÞ Z ½tði; jÞ a ½Pði; jÞ b Þ P</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u2J k i ½tði; uÞ a ½Pði; uÞ b if j 2J k i 0 if not 8 &lt; : 9 = ;<label>(1)</label></formula><p>a and b are two parameters that rule the contribution of information provided by pheromones and those provided by the visibility matrix. In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>) we multiply the pheromone on edge (i,j) by the corresponding visibility value P(i,j). In this way we favour the choice of edges which have important visibility value and which have a greater amount of pheromone.</p><p>The global updating rule is implemented as follows. Once all ants have built their tours, pheromone is updated on all edges according to: </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t ij ) ð1 K rÞt ij C Dt ij C e Dt e ij (2) Dt ij Z Q=W ij Dt e ij Z Q=W Ã if</formula><p>a and b are two parameters that rules the contribution of information provided by pheromones and those provided by the visibility matrix.</p><p>J Zarg max u2J k i p k ði;uÞ; p k ði;uÞ given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>). This state transition rule favours transitions towards remote times connected by edges with a large amount of pheromone. The parameter q 0 determines the relative importance of exploitation versus exploration: every time an ant at time i has to choose a time j to move to, it samples a random number q. If q%q0 then the best edge (according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>)) is chosen (exploitation, visibility matrix is dominant), otherwise an edge is chosen according to Eq. (1) (biased exploration, pheromone matrix is dominant).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2.1.">ACS1 global updating rule.</head><p>Only best ant (the ant which built the best tour) is authorized to deposit pheromone.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Algorithms formulation</head><p>Above passages describe rules and concepts used in the proposed algorithms. In the following we will formulate those latter in order to more clarify their technique. AS1 is formulated as follows:</p><p>Step 1. Initialize parameters. AS2 has the same steps of AS1. Each iteration of AS2 is a complete AS1. At the beginning of each iteration, all ants start from the next intervention time in the same component list. The number of AS2 iterations is the same as the one of generated times in the first component list.</p><p>ACS1 has many differences regarding transition rules, pheromone updating rule and starting point. It is formulated as follows:</p><p>Step 1. Initialize parameters.</p><p>Step 2. Each ant k is positioned on a different starting point.</p><p>Those points belong to the first component list: list (c); cZ1. Step 3. Set cZcC1; each ant applies the state transition rule (3) to choose the next time to move to. This time belongs to list (c).</p><p>Step 4. Apply pheromone local updating rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><p>Step 4. If c! total number of components return to step 3. else continue. Step 5. Evaluate ant tours.</p><p>Step 6. Apply pheromone global updating rule (4).</p><p>Step 7. If a stopping condition is met then stops. Else clear the taboo list and go to Step 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Case study</head><p>The methods mentioned and explained above were applied at the same system adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). We should note here that the calculated maintenance policy respects the availability constraint such as A(t)RA 0 (A 0 represents the availability constraint-lower limit), for all t, 0!t%T M , and a given mission time T M .</p><p>The calculations are made for two mission time: 25 and 50 years. For the mission time of 50 years two A 0 values were taking in consideration: 0.8 and 0.9. In 25 years case, calculations were made for A 0 Z0.8. The process of solution's evaluation is taken as it is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A comparison between GA and ACO algorithms is made via found cost and time taken to find this possible solution. Two parameters have been calculated to express the gain made by AC algorithms compared to GA: † GAPt: expresses the relative time gain due to AS1, AS2 and ACS1 against GA. † GAPc: expresses the relative solution improvement due to AS1, AS2 and ACS1 against GA via cost.</p><p>We have the following gap notations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">GAPtðGA; AS1Þ Z t GA K t AS1 t GA ; GAPtðGA; AS2Þ Z t GA K t AS2 t GA ; GAPtðGA; ACS1Þ Z t GA K t ACS1 t GA ; GAPcðGA; AS1Þ Z C GA K C AS1 C GA ; GAPcðGA; AS2Þ Z C GA K C AS2 C GA ; and GAPcðGA; ACS1Þ Z C GA K C ACS1 C GA :</formula><p>With:</p><p>t GA , t AS1 , t AS2 , t ACS1 : the processing times to find the solution, for GA, AS1, AS2, and ACS1, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">ACO parameter setting</head><p>A lot of parameters need to be set to have a good performance of ACO algorithms. This problem was the subject of extensive studies and experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. However, those studies were oriented to adapt those parameters to the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Our adopted approach was connected to the TSP so we can take advantage of previous studies. In the TSP problem, a decisive factor in choosing parameter values is the number of cities to be visited. In the current study, to determine the different parameters, we establish the following approach:</p><p>To determine Approach</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of ants, number of elitist ants</head><p>Number of generated times in the component listwnumber of cities t ij , r, a C ,q 0 ,Q, t 0 Number of componentswnumber of cities This approach was not made arbitrary. We have tried to make our problem, by the proposed approach, looks like the travelling salesman problem. In the latter the ants search between the cities for the best solution. In ours, we search among generated times for the 'best' intervention timing to preventively maintain a given component. It appears reasonably to take the number of generated elements as a reference to determine the number of ants and elitist ants.</p><p>The parameters t ij , r, a C , q 0 , Q, t 0 are used to update the pheromones on the arcs (edges). They depend indirectly of the number of those edges. The number of arcs does not depend on the generated times but on the number of system's components. It is appropriate, as we have considered, referring to the number of components in this parameter setting.</p><p>In spite of that this approach has proved its effectiveness, further studies are occurring to establish more precise parameter setting process (see Section 3.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Calculations for the mission time T M Z50 years and availability limit A 0 Z0.8</head><p>The obtained solutions are given below: (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>) All algorithms have produced solutions with equal PM costs for this given mission time. However, the processing time for those algorithms is different. AS1 and ACS1 were pretty faster than GA; GAPt (GA, AS1)Z0.49 and GAPt (GA, ACS1)Z0.70. We should note here that AS2 was the slowest algorithm; GAPt (GA, AS2)ZK7.12. The large iteration number could be the reason of this slow time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.3.</head><p>Calculations for the mission time T M Z25 years and availability limit A 0 Z0.9</p><p>For this case, the obtained solutions are: (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) The components 1, 5, and 7 are not maintained.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Conclusion</head><p>We must note that: † The ACO algorithm parameters: number of ants, number of generated time in lists, value of e, etc. is not constant. They change their value when the availability constraints change. Many experiments have been done and only parameters which have good yields were adopted. † The simulation of those three methods ends either after a given number of iteration or after a successive number of trials that gives, approximately, the same results. † Different availability and reliability levels for different given mission time were presented in order to establish coherent comparison between the efficiency of different algorithms. One can notice that when the constraint of availability becomes higher, e.g. the acceptable solutions number becomes fewer; there were a difference between the ACO proposed algorithms and GA. This difference was not only in processing time needed to find the solution but in the quality of this latter too (quality means cost value). † The three ACO algorithms have different results via processing time. We can notice that in some conditions AS1 is faster than ACS1, in other conditions we obtained an opposite result. We could not, till now, confirm decisively which one of AS1 and ACS1 is the best performing algorithm. Consequently, this problem is an important subject of current studies: which algorithm of those two should be used in specific cases? AS2 was used to widen the research process of an optimal solution. The large processing time of AS2 could be explained by the large number of iterations used in the research process. In spite of that AS2 have shown a weak performance (via computing time) compared to the other algorithms, its strategy of widen research could be very useful when studying more complex systems under hard constraints (larger exploration of the solution space with local optimums).</p><p>Note that the cost of inspection of a basic component is constant in the course of mission time, then the decision parameters in determining cost value are inspection times T P . It is clear that the above cost function supports the choice of far inspection times. The visibility matrix, by giving larger coefficients to remote times, supports this choice too. Above reasons explain the fact that the second inspection occurs to the end of the mission time. However, we must say that the search of far inspection times is limited by the entire system availability (reliability) constraint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion and perspective</head><p>In this paper, we try to elaborate a new effective technique to assess quasi-optimal maintenance periods. Three algorithms have replaced genetic algorithms in their search with good results. Subsequently, we point out that ant colony algorithms were very performing compared to genetic algorithms at least for the studied system under the same conditions as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Moreover, obtained results encourage us to study larger and more complex systems using ACO (other reliability properties, system structures, cost functions). This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that similar effects have been obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> which established a comparison between GA and ACO performances.</p><p>Metaheuristics are non typical, thus the critical issue in ACO algorithms (it is the case in most of metaheuristic algorithms) is the 'proper' parameters' determination which must be fixed before running those algorithms. A 'proper' determination of those leads to a reasonable solution. A more precise determination of those parameters could be the subject of further studies. Also, discretizing the range of possible values instead of randomly generating times in interval (LB,UB) according to a uniform distribution seems to be interesting to test.</p><p>In this paper we establish a comparison between a classic genetic algorithm and the proposed ant colony algorithms. It seems interesting to establish this same comparison between a more evolved genetic algorithm e.g hybrid GAs not only with ant colony algorithms but with local research algorithms too.</p><p>Finaly, an hybrid algorithm formed by a genetic algorithm and ant colony algorithms would be interesting to test. In this case, genetic algorithms should determine colony's initial parameters, the latter seeks intervention dates to make out the preventive maintenance or vice versa.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
