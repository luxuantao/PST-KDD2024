<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Internet of Things is a platform where every day devices become smarter, every day processing become intelligent, and every day communication become informative. While the Internet of Things is still seeking its own shape, its effects have already stared in making incredible strides as a universal solution media for the connected scenario. Architecture specific study does always pave the conformation of related field. The lack of overall architectural knowledge is presently resisting the researchers to get through the scope of Internet of Things centric approaches. This literature surveys Internet of Things oriented architectures that are capable enough to improve the understanding of related tool, technology, and methodology to facilitate developer's requirements. Directly or indirectly, the presented architectures propose to solve real-life problems by building and deployment of powerful Internet of Things notions. Further, research challenges have been investigated to incorporate the lacuna inside the current trends of architectures to motivate the academics and industries get involved into seeking the possible way outs to apt the exact power of Internet of Things. A main contribution of this survey paper is that it summarizes the current state-of-the-art of Internet of Things architectures in various domains systematically.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the stringent connectedness between digital and physical world <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. Various researchers have described IoT in multitude forms:</p><p>-"a dynamic global network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocols where physical and virtual 'Things' have identities, physical attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated into the information network" <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[132]</ref>.</p><p>-"3A concept: anytime, anywhere and any media, resulting into sustained ratio between radio and man around 1:1" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</p><p>-''Things having identities and virtual personalities operating in smart spaces using intelligent interfaces to connect and communicate within social, environmental, and user contexts" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. The semantic meaning of ''Internet of Things" is presented as ''a world -wide network of interconnected objects uniquely addressable, based on standard communication protocols". We will consider the definition provided by the ITU:</p><p>-"A global infrastructure for the information society enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on, existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication technologies" <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[142]</ref>. As per Gartner [1], 25 billion devices will be connected to the internet by 2020 and those connections will facilitate the used data to analyze, preplan, manage, and make intelligent decisions autonomously. The US National Intelligence Council (NIC) has embarked IoT as one of the six ''Disruptive Civil Technologies" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. In this context, we can see that service several sectors, such as: transportation, smart city, smart domotics, smart health, e-governance, assisted living, e-education, retail, logistics, agriculture, automation, industrial manufacturing, and business/process management etc., are already getting benefited from various architectural forms of IoT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. IoT architecture may be treated as a system which can be physical, virtual, or a hybrid of the two, consisting of a collection of numerous active physical things, sensors, actuators, cloud services, specific IoT protocols, communication layers, users, developers, and enterprise layer. Particular architectures do act as a pivot component of IoT specific infrastructure while facilitating the systematic approach towards dissimilar components resulting solutions to related issues. A well defined form of IoT architecture is currently available for knowledge purpose:</p><p>-"a dynamic global network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocols where physical and virtual 'Things' have identities, physical attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated into the information network" <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[132]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. IoT device components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">IoT functional blocks</head><p>An IoT system is comprised of a number of functional blocks to facilitate various utilities to the system such as, sensing, identification, actuation, communication, and management ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. presents these functional blocks as described below.</p><p>• Device: An IoT system is based on devices that provide sensing, actuation, control, and monitoring activities. IoT devices can exchange data with other connected devices and application, or collect data from other devices and process the data either locally or send the data to centralized servers or cloud based applications back-ends for processing the data, or perform some tasks locally and other tasks within IoT infrastructure based on temporal and space constraints (i.e. memory, processing capabilities, communication latencies, and speeds, and deadlines). An IoT device may consist of several interfaces for communications to other devices, both wired and wireless. These include (i) I/O interfaces for sensors, (ii) interfaces for Internet connectivity, (iii) memory and storage interfaces, and (iv) audio/video interfaces. IoT devices can also be of varied types, for instance, wearable sensors, smart watches, LED lights, automobiles and industrial machines. Almost all IoT devices generate data in some form of the other which when processed by data analytics systems generate leads to useful information to guide further actions locally or remotely, For instance, sensor data generated by a soil moisture monitoring device in a garden, when processed can help in determining the optimum watering schedules.</p><p>• Communication: The communication block performs the communication between devices and remote servers. IoT communication protocols generally work in data link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer.</p><p>• Services: An IoT system serves various types of functions such as services for device modeling, device control, data publishing, data analytics, and device discovery.</p><p>• Management: Management block provides different functions to govern an IoT system to seek the underlying governance of IoT system.</p><p>• Security: Security functional block secures the IoT system by providing functions such as, authentication, authorization, privacy, message integrity, content integrity, and data security.</p><p>• Application: Application layer is the most important in terms of users as it acts as an interface that provides necessary modules to control, and monitor various aspects of the IoT system. Applications allow users to visualize, and analyze the system status at present stage of action, some times prediction of futuristic prospects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Utilities of IoT</head><p>IoT may be characterized as the holder of key utility factors as given below <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>.</p><p>(1) Dynamic and self adapting: IoT devices and systems should have the capability to dynamically adapt with the changing contexts and take actions based on their operating conditions, user's context, or sensed environment. For example, consider a surveillance system comprising of a number of surveillance cameras. The surveillance cameras can adapt their modes (to normal or infra-red night modes) based on whether it is day or night. Cameras could switch from lower resolution to higher resolution modes when any motion is detected and alert nearby cameras to do the same. In this example, the surveillance system is adapting itself based on the context and changing (e.q., dynamic) conditions.</p><p>(2) Self-configuring: IoT devices may have self-configuring capability, allowing a large number of devices to work together to provide certain functionality (such as weather monitoring). These devices have the ability to configure. Them selves (in association with IoT infrastructure), setup the networking, and fetch latest software upgrades with minimal manual or user intervention. (3) Interoperable communication protocols: IoT devices may support a number of interoperable communication protocols and can communicate with other devices and also with the infrastructure.</p><p>(4) Unique identity: Each of IoT device has a unique identity and unique identifier (such as IP address or URI). IoT systems may have intelligent interfaces which adapt based on the context, allow communicating with users and environmental contexts. IoT device interfaces allow users to query the devices, monitor their status, and control them remotely, in association with the control, configuration and management infrastructure.</p><p>(5) Integrated into information network: IoT devices are usually integrated into the information network that allows them to communicate and exchange data with other devices and systems. IoT devices can be dynamically discovered in the network, by other devices and/or network, and have the capability to describe themselves (and their characteristics) to other devices or user applications. For example, a weather monitoring node can describe its monitoring capabilities to another connected node so that they can communicate and exchange data. Integration into the information network helps in making IoT systems "smarter" due to the collective intelligence of the individual devices in collaboration with the infrastructure. Thus, the data from a large number of concerned weather monitoring IoT nodes can be aggregated and analyzed to predict the weather.</p><p>(6) Context-awareness: Based on the sensed information about the physical and environmental parameters, the sensor nodes gain knowledge about the surrounding context. The decisions that the sensor nodes take thereafter are context-aware ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[56]</ref>). ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) Intelligent decision making capability: IoT multi-hop in nature. In a large area, this feature enhances the energy efficiency of the overall network, and hence, the network lifetime increases. Using this feature, multiple sensor nodes collaborate among themselves, and collectively take the final decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">IoT Supported Technologies</head><p>This section discusses various IoT technologies such as, hardware platforms, and wireless communication technologies used in different agricultural applications. Different IoT cloud service providers that are being popularly used in current market are also studied. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Hard Ware Platforms</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the existing hardware platforms classified according to key parameters such as: Processor, GPU, Operating Voltage, Clock Speed, Bus Width, System Memory, Flash Memory, EEPROM, Communication Supported, Development Environments, Programming Language, and I/O Connectivity. The comparative study shows how these platforms are encouraging the growth of IoT by utilizing constraint behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Wireless Communication Standards</head><p>Communication Protocols form the backbone of IoT systems and enable network connectivity and coupling to applications. Communication protocols allow devices to exchange data over the network. The protocols define the data exchange formats, data encoding, addressing schemes for devices and routing of packets from source to destination. Other functions of the protocols include sequence control, flow control, and retransmission of lost packets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Cloud solutions</head><p>IoT cloud solutions pave the facilities like real time data capture, visualization, data analytics, decision making, and device management related tasks through remote cloud servers while implying "pay-as-you-go" notion. Various cloud service providers are gradually becoming popular in the several application domains such as agriculture. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> presents comparative study between agriculture specific IoT cloud service providers as a case study. Following sub section describes how IoT clouds may be placed appropriately according to their applicability in several domains of importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7">Application Domains</head><p>IoT cloud platforms are designed to be meant for particular application specific domains such as, application development, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data management, analytics, deployment, monitoring, visualization, and finally research purpose (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). It is obvious that there are many more platforms currently present in the market, most popular 26 of these are chosen. Further, based on applicability and suitability preferences in several domains the IoT cloud platforms have been revisited. 10 different domains are selected based on which most of IoT cloud platforms are currently evolving into the IT market. Management wise few technological sectors are envisioned where these platforms do best fit into such as: Device, System, Heterogeneity, Data, Deployment, and Monitoring. Similarly, Analytics, Research and Visualization fields are chosen where rest of the platforms may be accommodated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8">Contributions</head><p>The exponential growth of low cost mobile devices and MEMS technology have pushed up the growth of IoT and allied technologies in a multitude form. It is expected that actual representation of IoT is going to blink around 2025. The graphical notion representing the growth is devised by International Telecommunication Union (ITU) on its meeting held in March, 2015 in Geneva. The full fledged exploration of wearable technology, cognitive computing, and artificial intelligence seem to come very later on the graph, presented in this occasion. Available architectures explore multiple opportunities to seek the advantageous part of IoT while encouraging the developer and user groups to get application specific solutions. But, the central issue of these architectures is the lack of full interoperability of interconnected things in abstraction level. This leads to invoke many proclaimed problems, such as: degraded smartness of high degree, less adaptability, limited anonymity, poor behavior of the system, reduced trust, privacy, and security. IoT architectures do pose several network oriented problems due to its limitation of homogeneity approach. Several institutions, standardization bodies, and researchers are currently engaged with the development of bringing uniformity in the architectures to fulfill the required technological needs. This paper presents a precise picture of the present state-of-the-art in the IoT architectures based on 129 research papers selected for this purpose. More specifically, this article:</p><p>educates the reader with a state-of-the-art description of domain specific IoT architectures; presents the trends in several sectors of practices; identifies research problems that researchers shall face in near future; provides future directions.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents domain specific state-of-the-art in IoT. Section 3 presents the open research issues associated to IoT architectures and futuristic road map showing Io&lt;*&gt; (Internet of *) concept, on which researchers should focus more in near future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Survey on Domain Specific IoT Architectures</head><p>This section prescribes the works done so far by the scientists around the globe <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref>. Various domain specific architectures based on the broad areas, such as: RFID <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref>, service oriented architecture, wireless sensor network, supply chain management, industry, healthcare, smart city, logistics, connected living, big data, cloud computing, social computing, and security are described in this section. The selection of theses domains depends upon current scenario of IoT applicability. It is has been tried to incorporate as much directions into this article, but due to the size constraints, present limitations have been made. The key methodology behind the survey depends on few factors of importance where earlier mentioned domains are deeply investigated based on their respective sub domains. This survey is performed to evaluate a number of segregated sub domains to gain and provide significant knowledge on the following: architectural structure, applicability, associativity, deployability, and incorporation measure. A precise, concrete and concise conclusion is made at the end of this article based on the surveyed perception. The overall method behind the survey describes how IoT is applied to the sub domains using particular architectures. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> presents the domain tree showing all its leaves as sub domains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IoT Domain Tree</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">RFID EPC</head><p>The term "IoT" was initially proposed to refer to uniquely identifiable interoperable connected objects with Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[133]</ref>. Later on researchers did relate IoT with other technologies, such as: sensors, actuators, GPS devices, and mobile devices. The "thing" oriented approach of the IoT is in fact attributed by the Auto-ID Labs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> in early 2000's where IoT has got its original shape. Since its inception, Auto-ID along with EPCglobal <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> targeted to architect the actual model of the IoT. These institutions have normally focused their works on the development of the Electronic Product Code™ (EPC) to necessitate and support the wide spread usage of RFID tags in modern trading network. Industry driven standard such as the EPCglobal Network™ is the outcome of this business. The primary purpose of this kind of industry standard is mainly to get well designed so as to have improvement over the object visibility particularly the location and status aware objects. This is obviously not only the single button of the shirt but from a larger point of view, IoT should not be an infrastructure where an EPC system shall persist just containing RFIDs as the only devices; these are only the tip of the burg, the complete story lies far away! uID Unique / Universal / Ubiquitous IDentifier (uID) architecture is another alternative in IoT, the central idea of which is just the incorporation and development of middleware aware <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[130]</ref> deliverables. As per my intervention, the RFID based item traceability as well as addressability is not the notion of the IoT, further it should pave more stringent tasks in case of different objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NFC and Other Technologies</head><p>As per <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, it has been perceived that the RFID still holds the driving force for IoT. Due to low cost and small size, RFID has dominated the marketing strategy since its origin. However, the authors state that huge pool of heterogeneous devices and network protocols will soon cover up the IoT. As of them, Near Field Communications (NFC), Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN), Wireless Identification and Sensing Platforms (WISP), and RFID together will show a new horizon towards IoT. A United Nations (UN) report has recently informed the fact that mankind is approaching towards a new decade of RFID enabled ubiquitous systems where human being shall be dwarfed by internet oriented objects as they are going to be the majority in number <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. Appropriate IoT based modelling may solve the situation by storing and communicating in valuable ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. In this context, RFID readers and tags <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> shall consist of new holistic system where each tag may be characterized by a unique identity. These forms of tags are appropriate for monitoring of cattle in far house and for personification of man. RFID reader broadcasts a signal into its periphery that activates the nearby tags to reply using its unique key. Real-time information passing may help in implementation of rigorous stratification between objects of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[55]</ref>. RFID tag acts as an ID of concern device where it is attached in form of an adhesive sticker <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. Smaller versions of RFID tags are being currently produced by many manufacturers. Hitachi has developed the smallest version of RFID tag as: 0.15mm x 0.15mm x 7.5µm in dimension recently.</p><p>Beyond RFID Consortium of CASAGRAS has envisaged the concept of IoT to go beyond the concept of RFID in future. As per their published report, things could benefit human being if they are submerged with networks while allowing communicating with other digital devices in the world. CASAGRAS consortium strongly believes in two statements: (a) IoT connects physical and/or virtual objects, and (b) proliferation of IoT into traditional networking systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. At this point, I apprehend their thought about IoT which shall become an institution which shall perform autonomous services by capturing data from interoperable and transparent networking media. Authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[52]</ref> propose to integrate NFC around the posters or panels, which provide valuable information about the description, cost, and schedule about transportation system to induce digital marker with help of mobile phones by knowing the facts, such as: ticket availability, seat availability, real-time stoppage information etc. RFID enablement is a keen component of IoT invasion. Which is seconded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[57]</ref>, that presents RFID based EPC network enabled Representational State Transferful (RESTful) i.e., software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems, IoT platform architecture to validate the usage of REST in IoT domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Service Oriented Architecture</head><p>Service oriented architecture (SOA) is an approach which is used to create architecture based on the use of system services. The inbuilt SoA approach is currently being invoked in IoT domain, utilizing the concept of middleware i.e., a software layer superimposed between application and technology layer which hides the unnecessary pertinent details from the developed hence reducing the time of product development, helping the design workflow be simpler to ease the process of marketing the commercial outcomes in short time duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RFID Involvement</head><p>Researchers have developed an RFID-SN i.e., RFID enabled Sensor Network, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref> comprising of RFID tag, reader, and computer system for understanding system behavior. Fosstrak one has developed a novel RFID related application based on SoA management <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref>. Scientists have proposed an EPC network <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref> configured RFID reader based system by catering multiple data related services on its application layer e.g., aggregation, filtering, lookup and directory service, tag identifier management, and privacy, utilizing the SoA paradigm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Middleware Enablement</head><p>A RFID based 3 layered middleware architecture relies on three associative functionalities such as: tag association, the place association, and the antenna association with user <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref>. A holistic IoT architecture is proposed that consists of heterogeneous devices, Embedded Internet Systems (EIS), standard communication protocols, and SoA paradigm which utilizes the CoAP protocol and standard services by enabling the exchange of sensor data with an IoT based cloud and a private cloud, while disseminating web based human-machine interface for configuration, monitoring and visualization of structured sensor data <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[74]</ref>. The INOX platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[95]</ref> advocates similar approach which consists of three layers, such as: (a) Service layer -supports and contains the services using APIs, (b) Platform layer -contains necessary management and orchestration to deploy services and the virtualization technologies enriching hardware layer; and (c) Hardware layer -contains of sensors and smart objects. Article <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref> advocates to reuse inbuilt techniques while composing of hardware and software together at the time of implementing a SoA in the concern setup. A common linkage between the SoA and a middleware has been proposed with an integrated architectural approach, leveraging the advantages of the SoA through enhancement of device functionality, communications, and integrated services <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>. An SoA based 5 layered IoT-middleware architecture is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref>, where objects do lie at the bottom and the object abstraction, service management (provides services like: dynamic discovery, status monitoring, and service configuration of the objects. Semantic <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> operations such as: QoS, lock, police and context management are also performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>), service composition and application layers are placed just consecutive above of each other. Furthermore a domotic infrastructure which is based on SoA oriented IoT, is developed in the literature where sensor and actuator based automatic energy consumption logic has been implied. In this perspective, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> have used two advanced computer languages, such as: Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) (defined as: business processes that interact with external entities through Web Service operations (Web Service Definition Language (WSDL)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref>) and Jolie (target application, specific set of objects or limited geographical scenario) to implement the SoA enabled middleware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Wireless Sensor Network</head><p>Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[137]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[138]</ref> is one of the keen parts of IoT system. It consists of a finite number of sensor nodes (mote) mastered by a special purpose node (sink) by employing multi layered protocols organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. Primarily energy efficiency, scalability, reliability, and robustness etc. parameters are sought when designing a WSN powered system. Systems Mostly used WSN systems do incorporate IEEE 802.15.4 protocol for provisioning Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) for communication purpose <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>. The top layers of inbuilt protocol stacks do necessitate IPv6 addressing facility to enhance the controlling ability of vast number of nodes, while increasing the size of the payload in transmitted packets along with maximized lazy time (sleep) of nodes. It has already been demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref>, that implements embedded TCP/IP stacks into the objects e.g., TinyTCP, mIP, and IwIP, which in turn transmits information to a remote server through proxy like interface by employing web sockets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environment Monitoring</head><p>The e-SENSE project <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref> has employed a WSN by a 3 layered logical approach to provide intelligent support to the user group by application, middleware, and connective measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[139]</ref>. UbiSec&amp;Sens [48] is another example of WSN based supportive system which is similar to the e-SENSE but security layer is added as extra on top of it. Functional design and implementation of a complete WSN platform can be used for monitoring of long-term environmental monitoring based IoT applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[58]</ref>. The objectives of this design satisfy numerous parameters, such as: cheap structure, enablement of pool of sensors, fast deployment, longevity of device, less maintenance, and high Quality of Service. WSN based application has been devised on agriculture and forestry where IoT plays a key role <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[72]</ref>. An architectural design across the middleware, hardware, and network layer results in a unique WSN platform -"Sprouts", which is versatile, open source, and multistandard in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[73]</ref>.

Similar comprehension is seen through an open service framework for the Internet of Things which facilitates the IoT-related mass market by establishing a global IoT ecosystem with use of IoT devices and software <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[111]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[112]</ref> has designed an architecture of social network of intelligent objects-Social Internet of Things (SIoT), where objects establish social relationships among each other by enabling the capability of discovery, selection, and particular services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Societal Data Service</head><p>An open community-oriented platform has been investigated to support Sensor Data-as-a-Service (SDaaS) featuring interoperability and reusability of heterogeneous sensor data and data services <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[119]</ref>. The concept behind virtual sensors and virtual devices are also identified to stream data continuously or discretely by scalable and context aware reconfigurable sensor data and services. A three layer architectural model for IoT is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>). It consists of: (a) the sensing layer, which is devoted to the data acquisition and node collaboration in short range and local networks; (b) the network layer, which is aimed at transferring data across different networks; and (c) the application layer, where the IoT applications are deployed together with the middleware functionalities. The Component Sub-layer includes the important tools to implement the core functionality of the SIoT system. The ID management is aimed at assigning an ID used to universally identify all the possible categories of objects. The profiling is targeted at configuring manual and semi-automatic information about the objects. The Owner Control (OC) module enables the definition of the activities that can be performed by the object. The relationship management (RM) is a key module since the objects do not have the intelligence of humans in selecting the friendships. Main task of this component is to allow objects to begin, update, and terminate their relationships with other objects. The Service Discovery (SD) is aimed at finding objects that can provide the required service in the same way humans seek for friendships and for any information in the social networking services. The service composition (SC) module enables the interaction between objects. The main potential in deploying SIoT is its capability to foster such an information retrieval. Leveraging on the object relationships, the service discovery procedure finds the desired service, which is then activated by means of this component. The Trustworthiness Management (TM) component is aimed at understanding how the information provided by other members shall be processed. Reliability is built on the basis of the behavior of the object and is strictly related to the relationship management module. Trustworthiness can be estimated by using notions wellknown in the literature which are crucial in social networks.

IoT is not out of its scope. In this section a few relevant works are presented to cope up with architectural issues in IoT based security.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Object Security</head><p>Vucinic et al. propose an architecture that leverages the security concepts both from content-centric and traditional connection-oriented approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[145]</ref>. It relies on secure channels established by means of (D)TLS for key exchange, without inclusion of the "state" among communicating entities. Object-based Security Architecture (OSCAR) supports facilities such as: caching and multicast, and does not affect the radio duty-cycling operation of constrained objects while providing a mechanism to protect from replay attacks by coupling DTLS scheme with the CoAP. Authors evaluate OSCAR in two cases: (a) 802.15.4 Low Power enabled Lossy Networks (LLN), and (b) Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication for two different hardware platforms and MAC layers on a real test bed using the Cooja emulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[176]</ref>. The architecture has been evaluated under a smart city paradigm. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>End-to-End Security</head><p>An End-to-End two way authentication security architecture for the IoT, using the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol has been evaluated <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[146]</ref>. The proposed security architecture (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>) is based on the most widely used public key cryptography technique (RSA), and works on top of standard low power communication stacks. Internet is connected by IPv6 in the near future, and parts of it run the 6LoWPAN. The transport layer in 6LoWPAN is UDP which can be considered unreliable; the routing layer is RPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[177]</ref>, or Hydro <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[180]</ref>. Hydro is used for routing, because of its similarity to RPL and its availability as part of the TinyOS 2.x <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[178]</ref> distribution. IEEE 802.15.4 is used for the physical and MAC layer. Based on this protocol stack DTLS is chosen as the key security protocol. This places it in the application layer on top of the UDP transport layer. The prescribed architecture elaborates the underlying data and communication flow between subscriber, gateway, access control server, and internet enabled certificate authority.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cyber-Physical-Social Security</head><p>A cyber-physical-social based security architecture (IPM) is proposed to deal with Information, Physical, and Management security perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[147]</ref>. The IPM architecture is empowered by the Unit IoT and Ubiquitous IoT (U2IoT) architecture. U2IoT acts as the core of IPM provisioning three key supports, such as: establishing information security model to describe </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hierarchical Security</head><p>Authors propose hierarchical security architecture to protect against inherent openness, heterogeneity, and terminal vulnerability. The proposed architecture aims to improve the efficiency, reliability, and controllability of the entire security system. Authors investigate several types of attacks and threats that may diffuse the architecture. To oppose the vulnerability, a coarse-grained security cell is designed that along with a refined secure subject that protects the IoT enabled system in form of information, data, control, and behavior. The 3-layered architecture devises a vertical division that narrows down the complexity of the cross-layer security interaction, and the transverse division based on data flow while clearing the processing logic of the security mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[148]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multimedia Traffic Security</head><p>An efficient Media-aware Traffic Security Architecture (MTSA) is proposed that facilitates various multimedia applications in the Internet of Things <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[149]</ref>. MTSA sacrifices unconditional secrecy to facilitate a normalized multimedia security solution for all genres of sensors in IoT. In particular, MTSA employs a visual secrecy measure which degrades proportionally to the number of shares in a possession of an eavesdropper. MTSA is enabled with perceived multimedia distortion <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[150]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[151]</ref> techniques. The MTSA reduces the complexity of multimedia computations and decreases the size of the shares (see Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref>). MTSA is inherited from a context-aware multimedia service based security framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[152]</ref>. Light Wight Security A recent article presents comprehensive and lightweight security architecture to secure the IoT throughout the lifecycle of a device -"HIMMO". HIMMO relies on the lightweight scheme as its building block. It is not only efficient resource-wise, but also enables advanced IoT protocols and deployments. HIMMO based security architecture can be easily integrated in existing communication protocols such as IEEE 802.15.4, or OMA LWM2M while providing a number of advantages such as: performance and operation. HIMMO is featured by a few advancements such as: full collusion resistance, device and back-end authentication and verification, pair-wise key agreement, support for multiple TTPs and key escrow, or protection against DoS attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[153]</ref>. Defense A novel architectural approach-IoTNetWar (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12</ref>) has been proposed of inculcating advanced network based technologies into the defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[186]</ref>. This is a 4-layered (i.e. Physical Sensing Layer, Gateway Communication Layer, C4ISR Management Layer, and Application Layer) invasion designed to assimilate IoT based integrated military communication, intellectual intelligence, and C4ISR command under one roof. C4ISR Layer is the most crucial of all that specifically monitors the interactions between defense head quarter its data centre through voice collaborative support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.10.">Observation</head><p>In earlier sub sections, several domain specific IoT based architectural works have been discussed. While reviewing different areas of implementations, it is found that smart city related practices are dominant over other segments. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref> illustrates the graphical representation of the rate of practice versus domains of IoT architectures. On the basis of 130 research papers included in this survey, the graph has been plotted; where RFID and health related architectural studies are getting equally popular around at 11%. SoA based architectural research is gradually coming forwards faster than RFID and health sectors, making its mark at 12.5%. WSN being a common area of practice has secured 13.3% among all. As mentioned in earlier section, smart city and related applications are gaining popularity in recent days. The result shows that 16.5% of overall research has been performed collectively towards the development for in smart society only. Indeed the smart society approach touches the highest point on the plot. Cloud computing based research and practices seem to be just beyond of WSN i.e., 14%. SCM and industrial approaches are subsequently marking its position in IoT specific world. SCM secures 8.6% on the graph. Security and privacy issues are very important by its own virtue; hence researchers are coming up with novel architectural concepts to facilitate the IoT. 7% investigations are made on its behalf. Social computing based research is still at nascent stage. Very few and specific explorations have been made on this ground. It has attained only 4.7%. The graphical representation of current trends in IoT based architectural research shows that more facilitation to be incurred in several domains, such as: e-learning, defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[170]</ref>, rural management, and robotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[169]</ref> are yet to be touched (not shown on the graph). Table <ref type="table">4</ref> combines all discussed architectures in earlier section as a tabular form. The representation of this table conglomerates different types of architectural frameworks as per their sub-domain. This will help the researchers to go into the depth of what is described in this paper as the sub-domains or domains as a whole, that need to be searched and paved in future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Open research issues and Future Direction</head><p>Although the architectures described in earlier section make IoT concept practically feasible, a large research effort is still required in this direction. This section reviews technical problems associated with current IoT architectures. Later on, a novel concept Io&lt;*&gt; or (Internet of *) is presented so as to meet all necessary parts that are missing in existing architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Technical Challenges</head><p>It is broadly accepted that the IoT technologies and applications are still in their infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[134]</ref>. There are still many research challenges for industrial use such as technology, standardization, security and privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[135]</ref>. Future efforts are needed to address these challenges and examine the characteristics of different industries to ensure a good fit of IoT devices in the human centric environments. A sufficient understanding of industrial characteristics and requirements on factors such as cost, security, privacy, and risk are indeed required before the IoT will be widely accepted and deployed in all the domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. Let discuss a few problems in this regard:</p><p>(i) Design of Service oriented Architecture (SoA) for IoT is a big challenge where service-based objects may face problems from performance and cost related issues. SoA needs to handle a large number of devices connected to the system which phrases scalability issues. At this moment, challenges like: data transfer, processing, and management become a matter of burden over-headed by service provisioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[120]</ref>. (ii) IoT is a very complicated heterogeneous network platform. This, in turn enhances the complexity among various types devices through various communication technologies showing the rude behavior of network to be fraudulent, delayed, and non-standardized. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[121]</ref> has clearly pointed out the management of connected objects by facilitating through collaborative work between different things e.g., hardware components and/or software services, and the administering them after providing addressing, identification, and optimization at the architectural and protocol levels is a serious research challenge. (iii) If we look from the viewpoint of network services, it seems clear that there is always a lack of a Service Description Language (SDL). Otherwise, would make the service development, deployment, and resource integration difficult by extending the product dissemination time causing loss in market. Hence, a commonly accepted SDL should be constructed so as the powerful service discovery methods and object naming services be implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[120]</ref>. Novel SDL may be developed to cope up wit product dissemination after validating the requite SDL specific architecture. (iv) As of now, IoT is degenerated on a traditional network oriented ICT environment. It is always affected by whatever connected to it. Here, a need of unified information infrastructure is to be sought. Huge number of connected devices shall produce real-time data flow which must be governed by high band width frequency path. Hence, a uniform architectural base to be created to cater the infrastructure needs sophistically. (v) The originated data may be too much large in size that current database management system may not handle in real-time manner. Proper solutions need to be idealized. IoT based data would be generated in a rapid speed. The collected data at receivers end shall be stored in efficient way which current RAID technology is incapable of. Here, an IoT based data service centric architecture need to be revised to handle this problem. (vi) Different devices attached to the IoT will put down data of variety in type, size and formation. These variations should be occupied with the futuristic technology which may involve multi-varied architectural notion for its ideal indentation.</p><p>Researcher should come forward with novel Big IoT Data specific design where data can efficiently handled. (vii) Data is a raw fact that generally does not conform to non-relevant handouts. Here in case of IoT, data play the massive role in decision making. The value of data is only achievable after filtering process is performed on the pool of data. This meaningful information can only be obtained by orientation of mining, analysis, and understand it. Big data problem is sufficient for handling similar regression. Relevant architectural framework is in evident that can hale data mining, analytics, and hence decision making services. Big Data approach could be aggregated herewith. (viii) In addition, industries must seek the challenges of hardware software coexistence around IoT. Variety of devices combined with variety of communication protocols through TCP/IP or advanced software stacks would surely manipulate web services which shall be deployed by various middleware solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[122]</ref>. Particular architecture leveraging the facilitation of heterogeneous protocols shall be devised. (ix) The IoT is envisaged to include an incredibly high number of nodes. All the attached devices and data shall be retrievable; here in such context, the unique identity is a must for efficient point-to-point network configuration.IPv4 protocol identifies each node through a 4-byte address. As it is well known that the availability of IPv4 numbered addresses are decreasing rapidly by reaching zero in next few years, new addressing policies shall be countered where IPv6 is a strong contender. This is an area where utmost care is needed to pursue device naming and identification capability, where appropriateness of architectural proficiency is a must. (x) Standardization is another clot which may precisely be operated for growth of IoT. Standardization in IoT signifies to lower down the initial barriers for the service providers and active users, improvising the interoperability issues between different applications or systems and to perceive better competition among the developed products or services in the application level. Security standards, communication standards and identification standards need to be evolved with the spread of IoT technologies while designing emerging technologies at a horizontal equivalence. In addition, fellow researchers shall document industry-specific guidelines and specify required architectural standards for efficient implementation of IoT. (xi) From the viewpoint of service, lack of a commonly accepted service description language makes the service development and integration of resources of physical objects into value-added services difficult. The developed services could be incompatible with different communication and implementation environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[135]</ref>. In addition, powerful service discovery methods and object naming services need to be developed to spread the IoT technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[136]</ref>. Scientists should pave novel architectures to cater with these difficulties. (xii) The widespread applicability of IoT and associated technologies shall largely depend on the network cum information security and data privacy protection. Being highly complex and heterogeneous in nature, IoT always faces severe security and privacy threats. Deployment, mobility, and complexity are the main challenges that restrict IoT to be damn safe <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[123]</ref>. As per <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[123]</ref>[124] <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[125]</ref>, privacy protection in IoT environment is more vulnerable than in traditional ICT network due to the large number of presences of attack vectors on IoT entities. Say for an example, IoT based health care monitoring system will collect patient's data (e.g., heart rate, pulse, body temperature, respiration etc.) and later on send the information directly to the doctor's office or hospital via network. As the time of data transfer over the network, if patient's data is stolen or misplaced serious risk may arise which can cause even death to the user. In such situation, it is noticed that most of the architectures do not include privacy, and security aspects into the respective concept which is drawback that needs to be clarified. Though, existing network security technologies enable IoT to get protected from such threats, more work still needs to be considered. A reliable, effective and powerful security protection mechanism for IoT is on the top most priority at the moment. Authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[126]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Direction Towards Io&lt;*&gt;</head><p>This section prescribes typical application specific approaches, which is absent in the aforementioned review work or have not been touched at all by the research communities. The Io&lt;*&gt; refers to Internet of Any architecture (where, '*' is normally assumed to be 'all' in computing). Architectures are continuously gaining importance and soon it will hold the underneath foundation of IoT. From a viewpoint of an architect/developer, the first and foremost job while designing a novel philosophy, far ahead of implementing in practice, is to establish a fundamental model which shows the layered components and how they are connected to each other. Research should be made possible to elaborate new thing based framework to complement the following particulars such as: mining, sports, tourism, governance, social, robotics, automation, and defense. As IoT is still in its nascent stage, we should be motivated to Io&lt;*&gt; where any architecture could be well suited. Smart healthcare, domotics, transportation, environment and agriculture are currently being sought in terms of IoT. Academics are constantly in the process to successfully cope up with the necessary platforms to solve these problems in near future. Io&lt;*&gt; concept shall revolutionize the way we see through the IoT technologies by combing the untouched areas with the cumulated ones. This shall hold the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal crisscross among all the core components of the IoT to the generalized applications. Io&lt;*&gt; is completely a hypothetical concept that must be tracked on. Analog, digital, and hybrid objects shall be the 'things' part. Not only solid but also liquid, semi-liquid, and crystallized type of materials may be the part of it. Integrated chips (IC), system on lab, lab on chip, FPGA, ASIC, and flexible electronics elements shall miniaturize the distance between digital and pure digital mechanism. Standard OSI network model is to be revisited for advanced layer based Io&lt;*&gt;. All the network protocols shall appropriately be utilized on its layers. 6LowPAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, CoAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[154]</ref>, MQTT <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[155]</ref>, websockets <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[156]</ref>, XMPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[157]</ref>, SOAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[158]</ref>, RESTful [159], and IPv6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[160]</ref> are to be integrated in a novel way where scripted web based pages would talk to the &lt;*&gt; portion by leveraging NoSQL <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[161]</ref>, SPARQL <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[162]</ref>,Graph database <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[163]</ref>, parallel database [164], Hadoop <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[165]</ref>, Hbase <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[166]</ref>, RDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[167]</ref>, OWL <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[168]</ref> oriented set ups. On top of it, data analytics, risk analysis, graphical visualization, resource management, service coordinator, task manager, APP based Plug-in enabler, API moderator, storage monitor, and predictive analyzer shall be mounted to improvise Io&lt;*&gt;-as-a-Service (Io&lt;*&gt;aaS). Unlimited applications to be roofed up the layer to mitigate the user experience to a new height. Smart transportation, logistics, assisted driving, mobile ticketing, environment monitoring, augmented maps, health track, data collection, identification and sensing, comfortable home, smart plant, intelligent museum, social networking, theft monitoring, loss apprehension, historical queries, smart taxi, smart city, governance, and enhanced game environment etc. shall be cherished by human being. Mining sites are to be covered up by Io&lt;*&gt;; besides, sports, travel and tourism, and defence mechanisms are to be connected by. AES, 3-DES, RSA, and SHA-3 algorithms need to be revised to get fitted into the resource constrained &lt;*&gt;. Multimedia may be lid onto Io&lt;*&gt; by apprehending streaming algorithms where as discrete messages be appended after payloads of transmitted packets. "Sensor Model Language" (SensorML) shall be revisited to provide a robust and semantically-tied means of defining processes and processing components, associated with the pre-measurement and postmeasurement transformation of observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[127]</ref>. The main objective of SensorML will be to enable the interoperability by using ontologies and semantic mediation. This could be done at the syntactic level and semantic level consecutively; resulting sensors and processes be better understood, utilized, and shared by machines, in complex workflows, and between intelligent sensor web nodes respectively. As of now most of the digital and hybrid devices of traditional network come along contemporary "Operating Systems" (OS). Very few OS are released in market for IoT invasion. IoT operating systems such as Contiki-OS <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[179]</ref>, RIOT-OS are the most prevalent versions available in the market, though they lack in hardware interoperability and semantic means. In this perspective, more work shall be carried to develop new variants of universal IoT-OS. Actuator layer may be another valuable part of Io&lt;*&gt; which has never been seen in any literature till date. In relation to the sensor, actuators are going to increase in exponential rate. The need of a central monitoring and controlling environment is required, Io&lt;*&gt; shall occupy the gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>The Internet has proved its existence in our lives, from interactions at a virtual level to social relationships. The IoT has added a new potential into internet by enabling communications between objects and human, making a smarter and intelligent planet. This has led the vision of ''anytime, anywhere, anyway, anything" communications practically in true sense.</p><p>To this end, it is observed that the IoT should be considered as the core part of the existing internet relying on its future direction, which is obvious to be exceptionally different from the current phase of internet what we see and use in our lives. Hence, the architectural concept comes in the picture. Architecture is a framework of technology enabled things to interconnect and interact with similar or dissimilar objects by imposing human to be a layer on it. In fact, it is clear that the current IoT paradigm, which is supportive towards M2M communications, is now getting limited by a number of factors. New formulations are inevitable for sustenance of IoT which is a strong notation for the researcher to come up with. From the above survey, it is found that publish/subscribe based IoT is flourishing now a days and being successively used in many applications. In this perspective, it should be understood that people are solemnizing their thoughts in terms of vertical silos of architectures. If this trend continues for next few years, it is mandatory that IoT may not achieve its goal related to flexibility, interoperability, concurrency, scalability, and addressability issues. Crowed sourcing may be incorporated into the architectural conciseness. Defense, military, intelligence services, robotics etc. fields do still undercover by IoT. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.Application domains of IoT cloud platforms.</figDesc></figure>

Vertical silos must be coincided with the horizontal perspective for affective measures of the IoT. In this article, firstly the background and definition of IoT are given. Secondly, thorough discussions on fundamentals behind IoT architectures are elaborated. Next, several key domains where IoT based research works are currently going on are visited. Afterwards, detailed analyses of the research challenges are mentioned. Resulting graph attains the state-of-the-art research based motives on the aforementioned domains. A novel concept-"Io&lt;*&gt;" is also proposed that is based on various theoretical nomenclature and external inputs. Different from other IoT survey papers, a main contribution of this paper is that it focuses on area specific architectures of IoT applications and highlights the challenges and possible research opportunities for future IoT researchers who would work in architectural as well as in IoT as a whole.</figDesc><table /></figure>
