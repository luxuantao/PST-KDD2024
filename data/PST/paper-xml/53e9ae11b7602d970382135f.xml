<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract-This paper proposes the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm to solve economic dispatch (ED) problems from power systems area. The RDPSO is inspired by the free electron model in metal conductors placed in an external electric field, and it employs a novel set of evolution equations that can enhance the global search ability of the algorithm. Many nonlinear characteristics of a power generator, such as the ramp rate limits, prohibited operating zones and nonsmooth cost functions are considered when the proposed method is used in practice for optimizing the generators' operation. The performance of the RDPSO method is evaluated on three different power systems, and compared with that of other optimization methods in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and convergence performance. The experimental results show that the RDPSO method performs better in solving the ED problems than any other tested optimization techniques.</p><p>Index Terms-Constrained nonlinear optimization, computational intelligence, economic dispatch problem, particle swarm optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>O PTIMIZATION techniques are employed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a given industrial system and to ultimately achieve the optimal goal of the system. They are widely used in industrial fields, and particularly in the energy industry, which all the other major industries, including manufacturing, transportation, and telecommunications, greatly depend on <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>As traditional major users of optimization technologies, the energy industries face a number of hot-button issues, such as the climate change, grid utilization and reliability, market restructuring, and so forth <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Optimization techniques help energy companies address these issues by enabling them to make better and faster decisions. Economic dispatch (ED) is one of the most important problems for energy companies. For example, it arises when we have to schedule the hourly production of thermal power stations for periods up to about a week in advance. Its objective is to minimize the total short-term cost of operating the generators in order to serve the forecasted customer loads by properly dividing the total load demand among the available generators <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The constraints represent the requirement to serve the hourly customer loads, various reserve requirements, minimum uptimes and downtimes for generators, and the ramping limits for generators, many of which are nonlinear in nature.</p><p>Traditionally, the ED problem can be solved by various mathematical programming methods, including the lambda-iteration method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> the base point and participation factors method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the interior point method <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the gradient method <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and the dynamical programming method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, these deterministic numerical methods either do not work effectively for nonsmooth and nonconvex cost functions or suffer from the "curse of dimensionality". In order to effectively address the issues of the nonlinear characteristics of practical power systems, a wide variety of population-based random search and other computational intelligence methods have been employed to solve the ED problems. These methods include genetic algorithms (GA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, particle swarm optimization (PSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, differential evolution (DE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, evolutionary programming (EP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, tabu search (TS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, neural networks (NN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, ant colony search algorithm (ACSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, artificial immune systems (AIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the honey bee colony algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the firefly algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, hybrid methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, to name only a few.</p><p>In this paper, a novel variant of the PSO algorithm, called the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO), is proposed and applied to solve ED problems. The RDPSO is inspired by the free electron model in metal conductors in an external electric field <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and its motivation is to improve the search ability of the PSO algorithm by fundamentally modifying the update equation of the particle's velocity, instead of by revising the algorithm based on the original equation, which most likely increases the complexity and computational cost of the algorithm. The RDPSO is easy to implement and it has a stable performance, as will be shown by our experimental results. Therefore, although this paper focuses on ED problems, the proposed RDPSO method, like other PSO variants and other random search algorithms, may be used as a promising generic optimization tool for various optimization problems in industrial fields.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the ED problem. The proposed RDPSO algorithm is presented in Section III. Section IV addresses the application of the RDPSO to solving ED problems. Section V provides and discusses the experimental results on three power systems. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE ECONOMIC DISPATCH PROBLEM</head><p>The ED problem can be reduced to an optimization problem whose objective is to determine the power output level of online generators that result in the lowest total fuel cost of all the generators over a period of time, while satisfying various nonlinear constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Objective Function of the ED Problem</head><p>The objective function of an ED problem is given by Minimize <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is the cost function of the th generating unit (in /h), is the real output of the th generating units (in MW), and is the total number of generators in the power system. The cost function of each generating unit is related to the actual power injected into the system, and is typically modeled by a smooth quadratic function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where and are the cost coefficients of the th generating unit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Constraints for the ED Problem</head><p>In this work, we consider the following constraints for the ED problem.</p><p>1) Power Balance Constraint: The constraint for power balance is expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> which means that the total system generation includes the load demand of the system and the transmission losses. That is, while the total generation cost is being minimized, the total generation should be equal to the total system demand (in MW) plus the transmission network loss (in MW). is generally approximated by the Kron's loss formula, which represents the losses as a function of the output level of the system generating units <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where denote the indexes of the generating units, and are known as the loss coefficients or -coefficients. It can be seen that is an matrix.</p><p>2) Generation Limits: The generation limit is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> which requires that the power generation of each unit varies between its minimum and maximum production limits, which are directly related to the design of the generator.</p><p>3) Ramp Rate Limits: In the actual operating process of the generating unit, the operating range of all on-line units is restricted by their ramp rate limits. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the inequality constraints due to the ramp limits are: i) if power generation increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> ii) if power generation decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where (in MW) is the previous output power, (in MW/h) is the up-ramp limit of the th generator; and (in MW/h) is the down-ramp limit of the th generator. 4) Prohibited Operating Zones: Due to the steam valve operating (i.e., vibrating) in a shaft bearing, the system contains some prohibited operating zones. In the actual power system, the load demand of a power system must avoid the prohibited zones. Thus, if the constraint in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is taken into account, the feasible operating zones of the th generating unit can be described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where and are the lower and upper bound of the th prohibited zone of the th generating unit, and is the number of prohibited zones of the th generating unit.</p></div>

The Formulation of the ED Problem</head><p>Combining ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) with (5) results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Thus, considering the feasible operating zones in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, we can formulate the ED problem as the following: Minimize <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(11)<label>(12)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE RANDOM DRIFT PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The PSO Algorithm</head><p>The PSO algorithm was proposed originally by Kennedy and Eberhart as a population-based optimization technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Unlike other evolutionary algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, it was motivated by the social behavior of bird flocks or fish schooling. In the last decade, PSO has gained increasing popularity due to its effectiveness in performing difficult optimization tasks at a cheap computational cost. There has been a large amount of work done on improving the PSO algorithm through empirical simulations. The main variations of PSO are the PSO with inertia weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and the one with constriction factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which laid the foundation for further enhancement of PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Hybrid methods which incorporate the PSO with other search techniques have also been shown to effectively improve the performance of the PSO in accomplishing optimization tasks, including in ED problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>In the PSO algorithm with particles, each particle represents a potential solution of a given problem in an -dimensional space and has three vectors at the th iteration: its current position , its velocity and its personal best (pbest) position , which, if a minimization problem is to be solved, is updated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> The global best (gbest) position of the whole swarm is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where is the population size. At each iteration, the particle's position is updated according to the following equations:</p><p>(15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> for and . The parameter is the inertia weight, first introduced by Shi and Eberhart to balance the global and local search of the particle <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>; and are known as the acceleration coefficients, which both are generally recommended to be set to 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The parameters and are the sequences of two different random numbers distributed uniformly on (0, 1), i.e., . Generally, is restricted within the interval .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The RDPSO Algorithm</head><p>The trajectory analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proved that the convergence of the PSO algorithm may be achieved if each particle converges to its local focus, defined by the coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where with regard to the random numbers and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Since the acceleration coefficients and are generally set to be equal, is a sequence of uniformly distributed random numbers on (0, 1). The particle's directional movement toward is similar to the drift motion of an electron in a metal conductor placed in an external electric field. However, according to the free electron model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, besides the drift motion caused by the electric field, the electron is also in thermal motion, which appears to be a random movement. The overall effect of the electron's movement is that the electron careens towards the location of the minimum potential energy. It is obvious that the movement of the electron is analogous to the process of finding the minimum solution of the problem, if the electron's position is considered as a candidate solution and the potential energy function as the objective function.</p><p>Inspired by the above facts, we assume that the particle in the RDPSO behaves like an electron moving in a metal conductor placed in an external electric field. Therefore, the movement of the particle is the superposition of the thermal motion and the drift motion towards . Accordingly, the velocity of the particle can be represented by , where and represent the velocities of the thermal motion and the drift motion toward , respectively. Here, we adopt the following expressions for and :</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, is a random number with a standard normal distribution, and is the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution, whose value is determined adaptively by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where and is called the mean best position. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. In ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, and are two positive real numbers called the thermal coefficient and the drift coefficient, respectively. It is obvious that the velocity of thermal motion follows the Maxwell velocity distribution law. It can also be seen from ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) that the effect of the drift velocity leads the particle to make a movement toward at each iteration. With the above specifications, we have the following update equation for the particle in the RDPSO:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(21) (22)</formula><p>The procedure of the RDPSO algorithm is outlined below:</p><p>Step 0: Initialize the current position of each particle, and set its personal best position to be its current position;</p><p>Step 1: Set ;</p><p>Step 2: While the termination condition is not met, perform the following steps;</p><p>Step </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SOLVING ED PROBLEMS BY THE RDPSO</head><p>Before employing the RDPSO algorithm to an ED problem, the following specifications must be made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Representation of the Individual Particle</head><p>The output of a generating unit represents a component of the particle's current position vector, and thus each particle represents a candidate solution to the given ED problem. If there are units that must be operated to provide power to loads, then the current position of the th particle can be given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> where is the population size, is index of the generating unit, and is the generation power output of the th generating unit in the th particle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Objective Function and Constraints Handling</head><p>The equality constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> can be handled by adding a penalty term to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The objective function becomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> where , known as the penalty coefficient, is a positive real number increasing with the iteration number , and is the absolute value of a mathematical expression. The penalty term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> is the measure of violation of the equality constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. When the constrained ED problem is solved by population-based search methods, such as the RDPSO, if the equality constraint is violated, the measure of violation is nonzero and the penalty term works by adding a large number to the objective function value given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Thus, the candidate solution violating the equality constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> has a large objective function value given by ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) and has better chance to be discarded. On the other hand, when the equality constraint is not violated, the measure of violation is zero so that the penalty term is also zero no matter how large the penalty coefficient is. Without the penalty term, the solution not violating the equality constraints has a relatively small objective function value and, thus, is more likely to be maintained and recorded.</p><p>During the process of searching the optimal solutions of the constrained optimization problem, increases with the iteration number from a small initial value to a large final one. The purpose here is to exert a weak penalty to solutions violating the equality constraint during the early stage of the search, so that these solutions may have a good chance to be maintained in order to diversify the population and thus make the algorithm search globally. During the later stage of the search process, the penalty coefficient becomes so large that a slight violation of the constraint will incur a large penalty to the solutions. This can guarantee that the algorithm converges to the solution satisfying the equality constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> as far as possible.</p><p>In order to make each particle of the population satisfy the inequality constraints described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, before estimating the objective function value of the particle's position by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, the generation power outputs represented by the particle's position must fall into the feasible intervals given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. If the position is within the feasible intervals, it satisfies the constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, and then is evaluated by the objective function described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>; otherwise, the objective function value of the particle's position is penalized with a very large positive constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In order to show how to use the RDPSO to solve ED problems and to verify the effectiveness of the RDPSO, three practical power systems were employed to test the algorithm. In these systems, the ramp rate limits and the prohibited zones of the units were taken into account in the practical application. Other optimization methods were also examined on the three systems for a thorough performance comparison, including the binary-coded GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the PSO with inertia weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the DE <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the ant colony search algorithm (ACSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the artificial immune system (AIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the honey bee colony optimization (BCO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the firefly algorithm (FA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the standard PSO (SPSO) with constriction and inertia weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the chaotic PSO (CPSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the anti-predatory PSO (APSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, the hybrid gradient descent PSO (HGPSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the hybrid PSO with mutation (HPSOM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and the hybrid PSO with wavelet mutation (HPSOWM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. A Hopfield neural network (NN) was also tested for performance comparison purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. For each system, all the tested methods used the same objective function <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. In order to execute a roulette selection, a fitness value was defined for the GA by , where is the largest objective function value among the population at a certain iteration (or generation) during the search process of the GA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Three Power Systems</head><p>System 1: This system consists of six thermal units, 26 buses, and 46 transmission lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The load demand is 1263 MW. The characteristics of the six thermal units are given in Tables I and II. In normal operation of the system, the loss coefficients with the 100-Mva base capacity are as listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>. This system is a small-scale one, with dimensionality 6 for its ED problem. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>, there are 12 prohibited zones, which yield 13 inequality constraints according    to inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Among all the three tested systems, the ED problem of this one is the easiest to be solved. System 2: This is a system with 15 thermal units whose characteristics are given in Tables IV and V <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The load demand of the system is 2630 MW. The loss coefficient matrix is not listed because of space limitation. The system is a medium-scale one and the dimensionality of its ED problem is 15. It is shown in Table V that generating units 2, 5, 6, and 12 have a total of 11 prohibited zones. Thus, there are 12 inequality constraints describe by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> for its ED problem. Compared to System 1, the ED problem of this system is relatively harder to be optimized.</p><p>System 3: This system contains 40 units in the real Taipower system, that is a large-scale and mixed generating system, where local coal-fired, oil-fired, gas-fired, diesel and combined cycles are all presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The load demand of the system is 8550 MW. Due to space limitations, the parameters of the units and loss coefficients are not listed. The dimensionality of the ED problem for this system is 40. In the ED problem for this system, there are no prohibited zones for each generating unit so that there are less inequality constraints for the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which, however, does not significantly reduce the difficulty of the problem. The large size and multifuel options of this system make its ED problem the hardest one among all the three systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental Configuration</head><p>For each of the three systems, the number of objective function evaluations for which each population-based optimization algorithm is executed was set to be 20 000. Two groups of experiments were performed for each method on each system, one group with population size and maximum number of generations , and the other with and . On each example system, 100 independent runs were performed by each algorithm, with given values of and . The penalty coefficient in the objective function in (24) was set as , where is the number of generations. The other experiment configurations were set as follows: the parameters of the GA were set as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, that is, the crossover probability , and the mutation probability ; the DE algorithm used a constant mutation factor of and a crossover rate of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; for the PSO with inertia weight (denoted as PSO), the inertia weight decreased linearly from 0.9 to 0.4 on the course of the search, the acceleration coefficients , and as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>; for the RDPSO, the thermal coefficient decreased from 0.9 to 0.3 on the course of the search, and the drift coefficient . The algorithmic parameters of the ACSA, BCO, AIS, and FA were set as those in the corresponding papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The parameter configurations for other PSO variants, namely, the SPSO, CPSO, APSO, HGPSO, HPSOM, and HPSOWM were the same as those recommended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The parameter of the Hopfield NN was set as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>

The CPSO algorithm was shown to be the second best method for this system in terms of mean costs, under both experimental configurations. When and , the worst performing population-based optimization algorithm was the APSO, with the mean cost obtained over 100 runs being 15473.3164/h. For this system, the Hopfield NN generated the worst result.

Table VII lists the solution vector corresponding to the best solution, with the minimum cost of 15442.7575/h found by 100 trial runs of the RDPSO with and . To justify the satisfaction of the equality constraint in (3) or <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, we add the power loss (12.3598 MW) to the load demand (1263 MW), and the summation is 1275.3598 MW. By comparing the summation with the total power output (1275.3565 MW), we can find that the equality constraint, namely, the constraint for power balance is well satisfied.

It can be seen that when and , the HP-SOWM was the second performing, with the mean cost out of the 100 runs being 32805.7185/h. When and , the second best method was the HPSOM, of which the mean cost was 32811.3701/h. The worst performing population-based optimization methods in each of the two experimental configurations were the BCO (with mean cost 33113. 0149/h) and the GA (with mean cost 33188.5443/h), respectively. Besides, the result obtained by the Hopfield NN was the worst for this system.</p><p>The best solution for this system in both groups of experiments was obtained by the RDPSO algorithm with the minimum cost being 32652.3357/h, out of the 100 runs of the algorithm, when and . The corresponding best solution of the vector and the resulting total generation cost of 32652.3357/h are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">X</ref>. It can be seen from Table X that the difference between the available load (2655.3650 MW-25.3696 MW) and the load demand (2630 MW) is 0.0046, which justifies the satisfaction of the equality constraint for power balance in (3) or <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows that the RDPSO method also had better convergence properties than any other tested algorithm on this problem, providing the faster convergence speed and the best final mean fitness value. Table XI lists the statistical results of the unpaired -test between the mean costs generated by the RDPSO and all the other methods. It can be observed that, for this system, the outperformance of the RDPSO algorithm over any of its competitors is extremely significant under both experimental settings.</p><p>The results for the ED problem of System 3 achieved by each of the tested optimization approaches are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">XII</ref>, from which we can see that the RDPSO was also the winner among all the tested algorithms in both groups of experiments. When and , the second best performing method was the HPSOM which generated the mean cost of 131614.7211/h out of the 100 runs of the algorithm on the ED problem. The HGPSO performed the worst among all the PSO variants in this group of experiments. However, among all the tested optimization algorithms under this parameter configuration, the GA has the worst performance on the ED problem in terms of mean costs. When and , the second best performing algorithm was also the HPSOM with the mean cost being 130234.1694/h. The performance of the HGPSO showed the worst performance among all the PSO variants. Comparing all the tested population-based optimization methods under this parameter setting, the GA also showed the worst performance. Again, the Hopfield NN yielded the worst result for this system.</p><p>It also shows in Table XII that the best solution of the ED problem of this system is obtained by the RDPSO algorithm with and . Due to space limitation in this paper, we only record in Table XIII the best results obtained for the total power output and the system transmission loss when the minimum total cost is 128864.4525/h. To justify the satisfaction of the equality constraints in (3) or <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, we compare the left side of (3), i.e., the total power output (8623.5391 MW), with the right side of (3), namely the summation (8623.5403 MW) of the power loss (73.5403 MW) and the load demand (8550 MW), which satisfies well the equality constraint. Moreover, the RDPSO also had the best conver-  gence properties for the fitness value on this ED problem, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Table XIV lists the statistical results of the unpaired -test between the mean costs obtained by the RDPSO and all the other methods. For this system, the RDPSO algorithm showed better performance than the other methods, in terms of statistical significance, in both groups of experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed the RDPSO algorithm to solve ED problems. The RDPSO was inspired by the free electron model in metal conductors placed in an external electric field. It simulates the thermal motion and drift motion of the electron in the conductor, which together lead the electron to a location of minimum potential energy. Thus, the particle in the RDPSO has both thermal velocity and drift velocity, which reflect the global search and local search, respectively.</p><p>The RDPSO algorithm, along with other optimization techniques, including the GA, DE, some PSO variants and a Hopfield neural network, were tested on the ED problems of three power systems, with the nonlinear characteristics of the generators taken into consideration. In order to provide the solutions' satisfying equality constraint, some strategies were employed to handle the constraints.</p><p>The simulation results on the three case studies revealed that, with the given parameter configuration, the RDPSO yielded higher-quality solutions and better convergence properties than its competitors. Besides, the performance of the RDPSO showed to be more robust, as evident from the relatively lower standard deviation of the system costs obtained on 100 runs of the algorithm. These facts demonstrated that the proposed RDPSO method is a promising tool for solving ED problems and other optimization problems in industrial fields.
