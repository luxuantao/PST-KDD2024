<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper puts forth an infrastructure-free cooperative relative localization (RL) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in global positioning system (GPS)-denied environments. Instead of estimating relative coordinates with vision-based methods, an onboard ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging and communication (RCM) network is adopted to both sense the inter-UAV distance and exchange information for RL estimation in 2-D spaces. Without any external infrastructures prepositioned, each agent cooperatively performs a consensus-based fusion, which fuses the obtained direct and indirect RL estimates, to generate the relative positions to its neighbors in real time despite the fact that some UAVs may not have direct range measurements to their neighbors. The proposed RL estimation is then applied to formation control. Extensive simulations and real-world flight tests corroborate the merits of the developed RL algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>F ORMATION control of multi-UAV systems has been a popular research topic in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> due to its extensive applications, such as surveillance, forest monitoring, and assistance in disaster areas. However, to realize real-life flights, relative positions between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a prerequisite for most formation control methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Moreover, UAVs for formation applications should be designed to be as efficient as possible. This means that payload, sensing, and computational capabilities are limited. Therefore, how to simultaneously achieve relative position estimates with fewer resources and perform flight formation is a worthy research topic.</p><p>One simple method to obtain relative positions is to construct a communication network in which each UAV knows its own global position in a shared frame and communicates it with others. The UAVs can infer a relative estimate based on the shared data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Formation experimental results using global positions, particularly those involving quadcopter UAVs, already exist in both simulation and actual flight, but agents here must depend on some external infrastructure for positioning. Examples include global positioning system (GPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; motion tracking systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>; and radio-based positioning with anchors such as ultra-wideband (UWB) networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, infrastructure dependence is disadvantageous. GPS is unreliable in cluttered urban environments, and the aforementioned alternatives require carefully setting up the operation area and have limited range. In addition, the accuracy of the infrastructures (e.g., positions of anchors and camera calibration) seriously affects the positioning accuracy. Especially, in some unknown environments such as forests, it is difficult to set up such infrastructures. Therefore, these infrastructure-dependent positioning systems are unsuitable for exploration tasks in an unknown environment. Even in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, where the formation is distance-based and, thus, intended for use with interagent range measurements without infrastructure, the experiment reported was still GPS dependent.</p><p>On the other hand, infrastructure-independent examples also exist, but are deficient in some ways. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a visionbased method was presented using onboard markers for relative localization (RL). Although promising, it is inherently restricted by limited view angles, occlusion and lighting, and heavy computations. The simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method is able to provide position information by generating an environmental map onboard during flight, and obtain relative positions by sharing the position estimates through communication networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, it still cannot be applied in some real-life environments, such as open areas, featureless hallways, an indoor environment with slanted walls, and forests with leaves and branches of tress. If the mission does not need to build a map, then mapping is a resourceintensive process to be discouraged. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, a Bluetooth-based RL method was proposed and intended for collision avoidance, but experimental results show its restrictions in flight duration and test area. A convex optimization-based RL was formulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, the method has high computational complexity and requires centralized implementation. Source localization with sampled range measurements was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, where all mobile agents cooperatively estimate their relative positions to a static source with an unknown position. However, it is still an infrastructure-dependent method and no practical tests were conducted to validate their approach. An integrated RL and leader-follower formation control in continuous time was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Numerical simulations were carried out but there is no discussion on the influence of measurement noises. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, simultaneous velocity and relative position estimation with application to formation control was studied, but it requires that each agent must conduct a combined linear and circular motion during the entire formation period. Accurate angular velocity required in the circular motion makes it impractical for applications in a real platform. All of these observations motivate us to investigate an integrated system of RL and formation control, which should be practical and efficient for real-world applications.</p><p>In this paper, we present an infrastructure-free cooperative RL algorithm and demonstrate its application in formation control. The algorithm is validated by both simulations and experiments on a group of three quadcopters. The RL method uses only onboard sensors and interagent range measurements leveraging the same onboard UWB technology as reported in some previous works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which can achieve submeter accuracy. The centimeter level of ranging accuracy within the radius of 150 m, and light weight, small size, and low power consumption make UWB a reliable and feasible ranging technique that can be applied for UAV. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which only discussed the problem of direct RL to a static UAV, this paper aims to localize each UAV relative to its neighbors. A consensus-based fusion scheme is proposed to fuse direct and indirect estimates which provides a more robust RL estimate in the presence of measurement noises and packet dropouts. The proposed RL estimation algorithm is then applied to formation control. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the system here is complete, integrating RL estimates with a suitable formation controller. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) A cooperative RL strategy that is independent of infrastructures using only onboard sensors and interagent ranging: The RL estimation error is shown to be bounded under bounded measurement noises. Simulations and real-world tests are in accordance with the theoretical finding. 2) A consensus-based RL fusion to enhance robustness to measurement dropouts: The boundedness of the fused RL estimation error is analyzed, and experimental results showcase the efficacy of the developed approach. 3) Distributed formation flights using RL estimates:</p><p>Numerical simulations and real-world formation flights of quadcopter UAVs demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete system, which integrates RL into formation control, by utilizing a customized UWB ranging and communication (RCM) network. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II introduces the problem formulation and graph theory. Section III proposes a cooperative RL method and consensus-based RL fusion estimation, followed by a UWB network-based RL initialization strategy. Section IV discusses a discrete-time formation control algorithm by using the RL estimates. Simulations and flight experiments are conducted in Sections V and VI, respectively. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Section VII.</p><p>Notation: Throughout this paper, N, R, R + , C, and Z + represent the set of natural, real, positive real, complex, and positive integer numbers, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem of Interest</head><p>Consider a team of N UAVs (labeled consecutively from 1 to N) working collaboratively to localize themselves with respect to their neighbors. Meanwhile, each UAV employs these relative estimates to jointly perform formation.</p><p>Let N i be the UAVi's neighbor set, in which UAVi is able to obtain distance d ij from UAVj if j ∈ N i . That is, when performing a formation, neighboring UAVj is actually within an area with a perceiving radius d, that is, d ij ≤ d. Leveraging the obtained sensing information, UAVi aims to estimate the relative position of UAVj,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">χ ij i,k , at t = t i,k , k ∈ N in UAVi's own frame F M</formula><p>i as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">1(c</ref>). Then, based on the relative position estimates of its neighbors, each UAV generates a corresponding formation control command. In this paper, two scenarios are considered: 1) UAVi is able to sense UAVj and conduct direct RL estimation, that is, UAVj is a primary node for UAVi and 2) UAVi is only able to range and communicate with UAVr which is a neighbor of UAVj, but fails to sense UAVj directly, and UAVj herein serves as a secondary node.</p><p>Suppose each UAVi has an inertial frame F I i and a moving frame F M i , for i = 1, . . . , N. The moving frame F M i , whose orientation is the same as that of F I i , is attached to its body.</p><p>This can be satisfied if the UAVs carry compasses. In F I i , UAVi is able to access its own velocity v i . Moreover, we assume that each UAVi is equipped with an onboard UWB module, which can measure the range d ij k to UAVj and obtain its corresponding change rate </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ḋij k at t = t k , k ∈ N in F M i . In this paper, the 2-D case is considered. Consequently, it follows that d ij k = d ji k = χ ij k and χ ij k = ν ij k , where χ ij k = (x j,k -x i,k , y j,k -y i,k ) and ν ij k = v j,k -v i,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Graph Theory</head><p>If each UAV is regarded as a node, then its coupling topology can be described by a graph. Let G = (V, E) denote a directed graph called a sensing graph which consists of a node set V = {1, 2, . . . , N} and arc set E ⊆ V × V. A directed edge (j, i) ∈ E means that UAVi can measure its distance and the derivative of its distance to UAVj. To study the RL problem (e.g., estimate the relative positions to UAVj), we are also concerned with another weighted digraph graph G j = (V j , E j , A j ), which is composed of a set of nodes V j = V\{j}, a directed edge set E j ⊆ V j × V j , and a weighted adjacency matrix 1) . V j is the set of N -1 nodes excluding j, and if r ∈ N i \{j}, there is an edge (i, r) ∈ E j . Moreover, ∀i, r ∈ V j , κ I ii = 0, κ I ir &gt; 0 if (i, r) ∈ E j , and κ I ir = 0 otherwise. Furthermore, we also associate the N-UAV system with an undirected graph Ḡ = {V, Ē} called a communication graph, which is the corresponding undirected graph of G. For an undirected edge (j, i) ∈ Ē, UAVi and UAVj can exchange velocity and data packets mutually.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A j = [κ I ir ] ∈ R (N-1)×(N-</formula><p>Denote L j as the Laplacian matrix of G j , whose diagonal elements l ii = r∈N i \{j} κ I ir and for i = r, there holds l ir = -κ I ir . For Ḡ, if there is a path in G from every UAVi in Ḡ to UAVj, and we say that UAVj is globally reachable in G, which is much weaker than strong connectedness (every node is reachable from every other node). Define B j ∈ R (N-<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>)×(N-1) to be a j adjacency matrix associated with G with diagonal elements κ D ij for i ∈ V j , where κ D ij &gt; 0 if UAVj is a neighbor of UAVi, that is, UAVi has a direct distance measurement of UAVj and κ D ij = 0 otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. COOPERATIVE RL ESTIMATION</head><p>In this section, a cooperative RL estimator based on the UWB RCM network is presented. To enhance the robustness, a consensus-based RL fusion estimation method is also introduced. Finally, an RL initialization strategy for real implementations is given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Persistent Excitation-Based RL Estimation 1) Incorporating Local Measurements:</head><p>Suppose each UAVi is able to measure the relative distance d ij k to its neighbor j at sampling time instant t i,k . Meanwhile, UAVi will transmit certain information, including v i,k , and local RL estimates χij i,k , etc., to its neighbors (e.g., UAVj) by encoding the data packet into one ranging request command. For the listener's side, although UAVj can acquire its own velocity v j,t continuously, v j,k is actually sampled for calculation at t = t j,k once UAVi's information is received. A time-synchronization signal has been entrained in our UWB RCM<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> protocol for each cycle; thus, without consideration of the transmission time, we assume t i,k = t j,k . Since j ∈ N i , UAVi can receive UAVj's information as well. Assume that all of the clocks have been synchronized, based on the obtained information on UAVi, we aim to design an estimator for each UAVi in a team to localize the relative position</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">χ ij i,k in its own frame F M i at t = t i,k , j ∈ N i , k ∈ N.</formula><p>Since the orientations of reference frames</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F M i and F M j for i = j are consistent, it follows that χ ij k+1 = χ ij k + Tν ij k and χ ij i,k = -χ ji j,k . Taking the derivative of both sides of d ij 2 t = ||χ ij t || 2 with respect to time in the continuous-time version, we can get d ij t ḋij t = ν ij t •χ ij t . By discretizing it, one obtains d ij k ḋij k = ν ij k • χ ij k .</formula><p>By taking the sensor noises into consideration, the RL estimation on UAVi at t = t i,k is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">χ ij i,k+1 = χij i,k + T ν ij i,k + k + γ T ν ij i,k + k × d ij k + d k ḋij k + ḋ k -ν ij i,k + k χ ij i,k<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where k , d k , and ḋ k are the measurement noises of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ν ij i,k , d ij k</formula><p>, and ḋij k , respectively, at time k; γ ∈ R + is a tunable constant gain; and T is the sampling period. It will be shown later that the RL estimation error is bounded in the noise-contaminated case.</p><p>2) RL Error Analysis With Corrupted Noise: The distance measurement sensor adopted herein (i.e., UWB) is able to achieve centimeter-level measurement accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Compared with the larger errors (tens of centimeters per second) in velocity estimation (i.e., Px4Flow) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we simply assume that d k and ḋ k are equal to 0 in (1). To proceed, suppose there exists a constant δ &gt; 0 such that k ≤ δ.</p><p>For i = 1, . . . , N, we let</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">χij i = χ ij i -χ ij i .

Next, we will introduce a consensusbased RL fusion method to fuse the direct and indirect RL estimates to improve the robustness of RL estimation in noise-contaminated scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Consensus-Based RL Fusion Estimation</head><p>If UAVj is both a primary node and secondary node for UAVi, that is, UAVj is not only the neighbor of UAVi but also a neighbor of UAVr and r ∈ N i , then χ ij can be estimated indirectly.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. APPLICATION TO FORMATION CONTROL</head><p>Combining interagent RL with distributed formation control is still challenging for practical applications especially in the presence of noise. Based on global position information, Deghat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed a continuous-time algorithm for a double-integrator model. However, this continuous-time version cannot be implemented directly since range measurements between agents are discrete. Thus, in this section, a discrete-time formation control law involving RL estimates and measurement noises is proposed as follows by discretizing the aforementioned continuous-time algorithm:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">p i,k+1 = p i,k + Tv i,k v i,k+1 = v i,k + γ 1 T j∈N i ν ij i,k + γ 2 T j∈N i (d ij k 2 -d * 2 ij )π ij i,k<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where T is the sampling period, γ 1 and γ 2 are small positive constants, and ν ij i,k and π ij i,k are relative velocity measurements and fused RL estimates obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><p>By combining the RL algorithm developed in the last section and the formation control algorithm ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">9</ref>), an integrated cooperative RL and formation control algorithm is proposed in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATIONS</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the cooperative RL strategy with six mobile UAVs in consideration of the sudden change in trajectory, and then apply the estimates to multi-UAV formation control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Cooperative RL Simulation Results</head><p>1) Configuration: Six mobile UAVs are labeled as 1, 2, . . . , 6, respectively. The sensing graph of the six UAVs is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_31">χ ij i,k+1 ← (1)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">π ij i,k+1 ← (5)</formula><p>Calculate the control command ← (9)</p><p>Send command to flight control board indirect RL estimates to UAV1 through UAV4 and UAV5, and UAV5 has two indirect RL estimates to UAV1 through UAV3 and UAV4.

In the first simulation, we let all of the UAVs TABLE I STATISTICS OF RL ERRORS WITH δ = 0.5 m/s, γ = 0.5 (UNIT: m) take different continuous motions as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(a), which include both linear and nonlinear motions. In the second simulation, UAV4 suffers from a sudden deviation of velocity at t = 100 s, while others remain the same as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(d)</ref>.</p><p>In this section, the positions of all UAVs relative to UAV1 are discussed and demonstrated since each UAV is able to reach UAV1 as shown in the sensing graph of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Velocity noise is bounded with δ = 0.5 m/s, and d and ḋ are considered as well with a bound of 0.05 m. Choose T = 0.05 s (20 Hz), <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_34">γ = 0.5, κ D ij = [α ij /(|N i | + 1 + α ij )],</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">κ I ij = [1/(|N i | + 1 + α ij )],</formula><p>where |N i | is the cardinality of N i , and α ij = 1 if UAVi has a direct measurement of UAVj, and α ij = 0 otherwise. Accordingly, the conditions of Theorems 1 and 2 are satisfied. Since each UAV conducts the RL estimation from itself to UAV1 and performs the RL fusion in its own frame, for the sake of brevity, here, we denote π i1 i by π i1 and its corresponding real RL is χ i1 . The evolution curves of the estimation errors ||π i1 -χ i1 || for the first and second simulation are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(b) and (e), respectively, and the RL estimation errors are bounded with 0.4 m in both cases. It is worth noting that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(e), the fused estimates π 31 , π 51 , and π 61 fluctuate slightly in the presence of a significant variation of π 41 at t = 100 s, and this demonstrates that our proposed cooperative RL method is robust to unexpected maneuverings. The statistics of the errors are shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> which reveals that the mean estimation errors of these two cases fall into the same magnitude and the errors in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(e) are slightly larger than those in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(b) due to the jerk of UAV4. Although the variances of the errors in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(e) are an order of magnitude larger than those in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(b), it is still acceptable since they are in centimeter-level.</p><p>On the other hand, in the presence of noises and data loss, the fused estimator averages the impact of noises and data dropouts. To some extent, additional information in indirect estimation helps speed up convergence rate of the RL estimation. For example, see the evolutions of direct, indirect, and fused estimation error of χ 31 in the presence of noises and data dropouts in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(f)</ref>. Obviously, the simulation result with fusion converges faster than the direct estimation no matter in the beginning or when the data transmission recovers.</p><p>3) Direct RL Estimation χ and the Influence of and γ : To show the influence of different velocity noises on the accuracy of the RL estimation, bounded by δ = 0.1-0.7 m/s are demonstrated. Other configurations are the same as the second simulation. For a given γ , without loss of generality, the evolutions of χ 53 -χ 53 under different conditions of δ are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a) and their statistical results of the estimation  errors are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. It can be seen that regardless of γ = 0.1 or 0.5, the mean and variance values of the errors become larger with the increase of δ, which is consistent with Theorem 1.</p><p>On the other hand, for given δ, γ should be chosen to satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. The trajectories of χ 53 -χ 53 and its upper bound with γ = 0.5 and 0.1 are exhibited in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(b</ref>) and (c), respectively. The statistics of RL errors are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. It can be seen that under the same δ, a smaller γ can help to reduce the estimation errors but decelerate convergence speed while a larger γ is reversed. Therefore, a dynamic γ can be adopted, which means at the beginning of RL, a larger γ can be chosen to speed up the convergence of RL, then reduce γ to narrow the RL error. A time window of 3 s is chosen for Assumption 1, that is, m = 3/T. If μ is obtained at the end of flight, then it should be fixed and c will be a constant. In this simulation, we adopt m latest measurements to dynamically calculate μ with the increase of time step k. Thus, the upper bound curve is wavy but the peak value can be chosen for reference such as 0.6 m in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(c</ref>). To summarize, the relationship among δ, γ , and c can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Next, we will combine the proposed cooperative RL with UWB-based formation control. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>: Note that the method introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> only considered the direct RL without fusion. The 2-norm of the direct RL estimation errors of χ34 , χ54 , χ 53 , and χ64 are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(c</ref>). The sensing graph and configurations are the same as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(a)</ref>. In these two cases, χ 34 , χ 54 , χ 53 , and χ 64 share the same initial positions of <ref type="bibr">[-4, 1]</ref> , <ref type="bibr">[17, -5]</ref> , <ref type="bibr">[23, -11]</ref> , and <ref type="bibr">[-4, 3]</ref> . It can be seen that based on the proposed method, all direct RL estimation errors are bounded by 0.5 m at 20 s. However, the errors using the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> can be up to 8 m, which are much larger than the results of the proposed method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Combining Cooperative RL and Distributed Formation Control</head><p>Consider a three-UAV team where each UAV is able to measure the distance to the other two UAVs. The control goal is to form two triangular formations with velocity consensus. In the simulation, we set γ 1 = 1 and γ 2 = 1.4 × 10 noiseless case in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(a) (without measurement noises and using true relative positions), the significant difference in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(b) is the flight trajectories, which are affected by the measurement noises. The desired formations are achieved at 11 and 15 s, respectively, and the inter-UAV distances are maintained at 30 m as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7(c</ref>). Both of these two cases achieve velocity consensus as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7(d)</ref>, and the fluctuating relative velocity between 0 and 20 s indicates the change of formation. The performances demonstrate that the proposed RL algorithm is able to support multiple UAVs to achieve formation in the presence of measurement noises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. FLIGHT TESTS</head><p>In this section, we present extensive flight experimental evaluations to demonstrate our proposed simultaneous cooperative RL and distributed formation control system. At first the performance of cooperative RL is evaluated in terms of average absolute error in comparison with the ground truth provided by VICON <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> (a motion capture system with milimeter-level positioning accuracy).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Configuration</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> illustrates the hardware configuration and signal flow of the UWB-based RL system. UWB modules PulsON 440 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref>are installed on three quadcopters. Due to the large bandwidth (from 3.1 to 5.3 GHz), UWB is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight effects, and provides a reliable long distance ranging with an accuracy of 10 cm. Algorithms, sensing, and communication are executed on a credit-card-sized mobilelevel Raspberry Pi2. The quadcopter is equipped with Pixhawk and Px4Flow 7 for flight control and onboard velocity estimation. Note that other equivalent velocity or displacement sensing systems can be adopted as well. Moreover, highprecision velocity measurements can help to improve the RL accuracy.</p><p>The UWB module on each quadcopter actively sends ranging requests to neighboring UAVs for distance measuring and communication based on the two-way time-of-flight (TWToF) ranging method. A customized UWB RCM network protocol will be introduced in Section VI-B. In this network, an instant distance estimate obtained by UAVi will be calibrated first through linear regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Then, the corrected range measurement together with the received information go through Algorithm 1. The output of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">9</ref>) is an acceleration command which will be sent to the low-level control board, Pixhawk. In the control board, this acceleration command will be transformed into attitude command and further into pulse-width modulating (PWM) signals to control motors for UAV flight as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. All the processes above are controlled by Raspberry Pi2 and XBee only receives each UAV's global position and velocity from VICON as ground truth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Ultra-Wideband Ranging and Communication Network Configuration</head><p>A contention-free time division multiple access (TDMA) time-slotted network is used to coordinate communication and range measurements. Each node transmits its previous range and velocity of range measurement provided by UWB firmware, together with its current velocity, RL and height estimate as data packet embedded in the range request packet. All nodes can overhear this data and provide it to the processor. An example of slot map with three nodes identified as 200-202 (i.e., UAV0-2) is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>. Each slot supports  a TWToF range conversation with associated data package. On completion of slot 3, the process will repeat from slot 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Experimental Evaluations of RL Estimation</head><p>To verify our proposed RL system, onboard tests were carried out on three simultaneous moving UAV platforms  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE III TDMA SLOTMAP CONFIGURATION FOR THREE UAVS</head><p>In order to cover as distinct situations as possible, 13 tests were conducted with different speeds and trajectories, including Static, Circle, Triangle, Line, random Walk, and NTU letters. Since the RL performances of these three UAVs are similar, without losing generality, here we show the average absolute RL estimation errors of UAV2 as an example in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>, where 2S1C_2 means that two UAVs are static and one UAV moves in a circle in the second time. The statistical results illustrate that the mean of our proposed RL estimation error along one axis is around 0.2 m in the presence of measurement noises.  conducted distributively, the RL estimation errors generated on each UAV have the same magnitude with slight differences. Without loss of generality, the evolution curves of RL trajectories and estimation errors on UAV1 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10(b)</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Quadcopters Formation Flight</head><p>In this section, we implemented the proposed distributed formation control utilizing cooperative RL on quadcopters with the same configuration as described in Section VI-A, and conducted a series of real-world flight tests in a grass field at Nanyang Technological University and an abandoned basketball court near Science Center Singapore. These outdoor experiments also demonstrate the robustness of the systems against wind disturbances. In both these fields, an equilateral triangle formation of three UAVs was achieved successfully. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">8</ref>There are three UAVs involved in the experiments, which comprise of one leader (UAV1) and two followers (UAV0 and 2). The control of these UAVs are set in a global coordinate frame with x-axis align with magnetic East and y-axis with magnetic North. Initially, all three UAVs are placed on the ground, roughly following a predefined configuration for consistency purpose. In particular, we assign UAV0 as a launching origin and place UAV1 along the East direction with respect to UAV0 in order to keep the flight control coordinate and the RL coordinate system consistent. Meanwhile, UAV2 can be put arbitrarily in North zone. Upon power-startup, the UWB modules will measure the distances and start communication, and the Raspberry Pi2 will then derive initialization configuration and start estimating relative positions. With estimated relative positions, control outputs can be calculated accordingly. Second, when onboard control outputs are available for all UAVs, the pilots would then manually takeoff and ascend the UAVs to 1.5 m altitude, with respect to the terrain. This altitude is chosen to minimize ground aerodynamic disturance while maintaining good visual contact for the optical flow velocity estimator. When the target altitude is reached, two pilots would then switch their UAVs from manual flight mode to formation flight mode, where the UAV would automatically control its velocity to satisfy formation requirements. One pilot, controlling the leader UAV1, would then manually fly the UAV in predefined trajectories to test the behavior of follower UAVs. If the follower UAVs could automatically maintain the predefined formation against unknown movements from leader UAV, the experiment is considered successful. A flight video snapshot is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>, where three UAVs reach the desired formation of an equilateral triangle with side length of 3 m and maintain the formation with the movements of the leader UAV. Online inter-UAV distance measurements and the relative bearing evolutions (generated by RL estimates) in the period of formation forming, are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>(a) and (b), where three different background colors, respectively, show the launching, formation keeping, and landing phase. After a period of adjustment, the desired formation is achieved and kept from 56 to 257 s with the inter-UAV distance of 3 m and relative azimuth angle of 60 • .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposed a combined distributed cooperative RL and distance-based formation control scheme for UAV swarms without infrastructures, global positions, and computing for pattern detecting. Based on the capability of the designed UWB RCM network, each UAV is able to estimate the relative positions of its neighbors by utilizing our proposed consensusbased RL fusion scheme. These RL estimates combined with the inter-UAV distances and relative velocity estimates are directly fed into a discrete-time distributed formation control law to achieve formation flights. Extensive flight experiments validated the effectiveness of our proposed system. The cooperative RL and formation control with applications to mobile vehicles in some switching topology case can be investigated in the future.</p></div>
