<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recently, some work has been concerned with the problem of controlling robot manipulators by integrating into the control loop nonlinear observers in order to estimate the joint velocities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. The reason for doing this is due to the closed-loop limitations imposed by the measured velocity noise when joint velocities are obtained by sensors such as tachometers and by the impossibility of obtaining a good velocity estimate by simple techniques such as position interpolation, in particular for low velocities. Besides the practical interest that the idea represents, the problem of controlling nonlinear systems via estimated state feedback has its own relevance, and hence merits a certain degree of attention.</p><p>The problem of designing nonlinear observers using full nonlinear model dynamics of a revolute robot manipulator was first treated by Canudas-de-Wit and Slotine <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. They proposed to use the so-called "sliding observers," in which some of the physical robot properties are explicitly exploited to show exponential convergence of the observation error vector. Sliding observers are a transposition of the switching controllers to the problem of state observation in nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Sliding control design consists of defining a switching surface in the phase plane which is rendered attractive by the action of the switching terms. The dynamics on the switching surface is determined by Filippov's solution concept; see <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, which indicates that the system dynamic behavior within the switching surface can be formally described as an average combination of the dynamics of each side of the discontinuous surface. The interest in such controllers lies in the fact that they possess good robustness properties vis-a-vis to model uncertainties, i.e., the trajectories lying on the switching surface are unaffected under process gain variations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, for a survey of robustness on nonlinear state feedback) and hence control and observer design can be performed with little knowledge about the system model parameters. Their main drawback is that sliding controllers generate chattering motion on the switching surface. Chattering is unsuitable because it adds an important amount of high-frequency components to the control law which has discontinuities; see Fig. l(a). However, sliding control theory applied to the problem of state estimation does not necessarily imply that the control law, which depends on the estimated state vector, contains dominant components of infinite high frequency. Indeed, as shown by <ref type="bibr">Fig. l(b)</ref>, the observer dynamic equations with a discontinuous righthand side act as a low-pass filter reducing the amplitude of the high-frequency components. Chattering thus appears at the estimation level rather as a numerical problem than as a physical drawback in the control law.</p><p>The work developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, [SI, <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> assumes that the robot parameters are exactly known. Extension to the case model parameter inaccuracies is treated in <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, which proposes a robust control scheme following the ideas of <ref type="bibr">Leitmann [lo]</ref> on the uncertain linear systems and their application to robotics [ 131.</p><p>As in these related works, asymptotic stability is obtained provided that the control law contains discontinuities; the idea is sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure">l(c</ref>). Although chattering can be reduced by replacing the discontinuous switching function by a kind of saturation nonlinear control, asymptotic stability is lost and substituted by uniformly ultimate stability (UUS), or practical stability (the tracking error does not tend to zero but to a closed region around it, in finite time). As another alternative, high-gain smooth control design was suggested by <ref type="bibr">Nicosia and Tornambk [8]</ref>. Their approach also yields UUS, since perfect tracking is not ensured unless infinite gains are used.</p><p>This note presents a new approach for designing robust controllers via state-space feedback. The robot model parameters are assumed to be unknown and velocity measurements are assumed not to be available. State observation and parameter adaptation are performed simultaneously. The adaptation law, the observer gains, and the control law are designed on the reduced order manifold which results from the invariance of the switching surface. With respect to the previous work of Canudas-de-Wit and Fixot [5], the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system resulting from the approach presented in this note is not conditioned by a particular type of inertia matrix variation. On the other hand, the introduction of an adaptation loop may also be motivated by a reduction of chattering at a control law level since the control law only depends on the estimated state and parameter vectors and hence contains no terms proportional to discontinuities (although the adaptation law and the observer dynamics have discontinuities on the right-hand side of the respective differential equations); see <ref type="bibr">Fig. l(d)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>The dynamic model of a rigid robot having n revolute joints resulting from the Lagrange equations is expressed as where q, q, q, vectors of 9" represent the link displacements, velocities, and accelerations, respectively. H ( q ) is the n X n definite positive inertia matrix. C(q, q)q represents the Coriolis and centripetal forces. T g ( q ) is the gravity vector and T is the applied motor torques.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This work can also be understood as a particular control design of nonlinear systems where adaptation and observation are performed simultaneously while asymptotically stability is obtained. We believe that these results are possible due to the switching terms introduced in the observer's gains and on the adaptation law, which allow the reduced order error dynamics to be asymptotically stabilized. A fundamental distinction between this technique and any other approach based on high-gain control is that although the control contains high-frequency components, its magnitude remains within the input bounds. High-gain controllers may require infinitely large input signals in order to theoretically approach the zero-error state of equilibrium.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Manuscript receivedSeptember 28, 1990; revised May 31, 1991.
