<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Search results returned by search engines need to be diversified in order to satisfy different information needs of different users. Several supervised learning models have been proposed for diversifying search results in recent years. Most of the existing supervised methods greedily compare each candidate document with the selected document sequence and select the next local optimal document. However, the information utility of each candidate document is not independent with each other, and research has shown that the selection of a candidate document will affect the utilities of other candidate documents. As a result, the local optimal document rankings will not lead to the global optimal rankings. In this paper, we propose a new supervised diversification framework to address this issue. Based on a self-attention encoder-decoder structure, the model can take the whole candidate document sequence as input, and simultaneously leverage both the novelty and the subtopic coverage of the candidate documents. We call this framework Diversity Encoder with Self-Attention (DESA). Comparing with existing supervised methods, this framework can model the interactions between all candidate documents and return their diversification scores based on the whole candidate document sequence. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods. These results confirm the effectiveness of modeling all the candidate documents for the overall novelty and subtopic coverage globally, instead of comparing every single candidate document with the selected sequence document selection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Research shows that most queries issued by users are short <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and these queries could be ambiguous or vague. For example, a user who issues the query "Java" may expect a result about "Java island", while another user with the same query may want information about "JAVA programming language". Even for a same user, she may also want diversified results which cover different aspects of the information she is looking for (for example, seeking for different cooking methods for "roast beef"). Search result diversification is proposed to solve the above problem by returning a diversified document list that can satisfy different information needs.</p><p>Existing search result diversification models can be divided into supervised and unsupervised models depending on whether supervised learning approaches are used. Most of the traditional approaches to search result diversification are unsupervised and they are based on handcrafted features and functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. While in recent years, more and more researchers tried to use machine learning methods in search result diversification in order to learn an optimized ranking function automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. To generate diversified results, these methods either explicitly model subtopic coverage of the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> (i.e., explicit approaches), or directly reduce result redundancy by comparing document-document similarity regardless the use of subtopics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (i.e., implicit approaches).</p><p>To simplify the problem and accelerate the online ranking, existing methods usually formalize the diverse ranking process as the greedy document sequential selection. Those methods compare each of the candidate document with the selected document sequence and select the best candidate document which can provide the maximum additional information utility for the current selected document sequence. However, researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> have already proved that this greedy document selection mechanism may not lead to the global optimal rankings. This is because the previous methods only model the interaction between every single candidate document and the selected document sequence, ignoring the candidate document's interactions with other candidate documents. While the information utilities of all the candidate documents are not independent, when a candidate document is selected, the utilities of other documents will be affected. As a result, the sequential selection of every locally optimal document may not lead to a global optimal document ranking. This problem may be even more serious when the selected sequence is short or empty in the early stage of ranking. For example, assuming there are three candidate documents ùëë 1 , ùëë 2 , ùëë 3 , with ùëë 1 covering the subtopic ùëû 1 , ùëë 2 covering ùëû 2 , ùëû 3 and ùëë 3 covering ùëû 1 , and the three documents has got similar relevance scores to the given query. A greedy selection based model may select ùëë 1 for the first ranking position. Since the selected sequence is empty, any of the candidate documents can be seen as a "diversified document" after the empty selected sequence. However, the diverse ranking task aims to satisfy more user intents at former position, in the view of intent-based diversification metrics e.g. ùõº‚àínDCG, ùëë 2 may be a better selection comparing with ùëë 1 . In order to achieve the global optimal ranking, the model has to search all the ranking space, which is an NP-hard problem. Feng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed the M2DIV model with Monte-Caro Tree Search (MCTS) in order to explore a larger ranking space and raise the probability of selecting the global optimal document ranking. However, as a deep reinforced learning model with MCTS, the M2DIV is difficult to train since MCTS is so time consuming that the M2DIV propose another raw policy without MCTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in adaption to some online ranking tasks.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a new search result diversification framework to address the issues above. This framework can model all the candidate documents as a whole sequence, and leverage both the novelty and the subtopic coverage of every candidate document simultaneously. More specifically, we use a self-attention based encoder-decoder structure to model the interactions between candidate documents and subtopics. We call this framework Diversity Encoder with Self-Attention (DESA). The self-attention network has been widely used in order to learn the context-aware representations of words. Comparing with CNN and RNN, the self-attention network allows every item in the whole sequence to interact directly with each other simultaneously, and it can learn the long-range dependency well. In the task of search result diversification, we use the self-attention network to build an encoder-decoder framework for modeling the candidate document sequence and the subtopics. The encoder component can learn the document interactions globally in the whole candidate document sequence, indicating the novelty of every candidate document. And the decoder component can learn the matching distributions between the documents and the subtopics. Instead of comparing every single candidate document with the selected document sequence, the framework will model the whole candidate document sequence and jointly return the ranking scores of all the candidate documents in the ranking task. It doesn't depend on the greedy document selection process. We also give a theoretical analysis of how self-attention mechanism works in the task of search result diversification. Since self-attention network is suitable for parallel computing, the proposed DESA model is easy to train. Experimental results with the TREC Web Track data show that the model outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised or supervised diversification models significantly.</p><p>The contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:</p><p>(1) We propose a framework which can take the whole candidate document sequence as input and model the interactions between all the candidate documents for measuring their information utilities globally. Comparing with the greedy sequential selection approaches, this framework will get a higher probability of achieving the global optimal ranking.</p><p>(2) More specifically, we use a self-attention based encoderdecoder structure and model both the novelty and the subtopic coverage of the candidate documents.</p><p>(3) We theoretically analyze why self-attention is suitable to the search result diversification task.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 Implicit and Explicit Diversification Models</head><p>Existing search result diversification models can be divided into implicit and explicit ones depending on modeling the user intents (represented as subtopics) explicitly. The implicit ranking model calculates the similarity between every candidate document and the previous selected documents, and assume that the more dissimilar the candidate document is to the selected documents, the more diversified it will be. The most typical implicit model is the MMR (Max Margin Relevance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Score MMR = ùúÜscore(ùëë ùëñ , ùëû) ‚àí (1 ‚àí ùúÜ)max ùëë ùëó ‚ààùëÜ sim(ùëë ùëñ , ùëë ùëó ),</formula><p>where score(ùëë ùëñ , ùëû) is relevance score of the current document candidate ùëë ùëñ and the given query ùëû, sim(ùëë ùëñ , ùëë ùëó ) is the similarity between ùëë ùëñ and the selected document ùëë ùëó in the selected set ùëÜ. In the view of the MMR model, the less similar the candidate document is with the selected documents, the more diversified it will be. The final ranking score of the candidate document is the linear combination of the relevance score and the novelty score. Inheriting the spirit of MMR, researchers have also proposed supervised methods, such as SVM-DIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, R-LTR <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>), PAMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and PAMM-NTN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), for learning a better document similarity function automatically. The explicit approaches model the underlying user intents of the issued query, those intents are represented as subtopics. In the view of explicit diverse ranking, comparing with the selected document sequence, a diversified candidate document should cover as many new subtopics under the given query which has not been covered by the selected document as possible. Nowadays both unsupervised and supervised explicit approaches are proposed e.g. xQuAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, PM2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, HxQuAD/HPM2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and DSSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Those existing approaches used greedy document sequential selection. They compare every single candidate document with the selected document sequence, and choose the locally optimal document one-by-one to fill in the document ranking list. Since the information utilities of the candidate documents are not independent, this strategy may not lead to global optimal rankings. Based on the reinforced learning approach MDP-DIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Feng <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed the M2DIV model with the Monte-Caro Tree Search (MCTS) to search a larger ranking space and minimize the gap between the local optimal and global optimal rankings. However, M2DIV is difficult to train since MCTS is time consuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and M2DIV only models the document novelty, ignoring the subtopic coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Self-Attention in Information Retrieval</head><p>The self-attention mechanism is a kind of attention mechanism modeling each position in a sequence and compute the representation for each hidden state of the sequence. Recently, the models fully based on self-attention mechanism (denoted as self-attention  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) task, have achieved great successes on many NLP tasks. Researchers have used self-attention networks, e.g. GPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and ERNIE <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, as alternatives to RNNs and CNNs in many NLP tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> have tried to use the self-attention network in the information retrieval tasks. There are no self-attention based models designed for the search result diversification task.</p><p>In this paper, we propose using self-attention to model the interactions of candidate documents and subtopics for search result diversification tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE DIVERSIFICATION FRAMEWORK</head><p>In this section, we will first describe the overall structure of the selfattention based diversification framework DESA, then introduce the details of each component and the optimization process. We also propose a theoretical analysis to explain why self-attention is suitable to the search result diversification task. Finally, we compare DESA with existing models and discuss their relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem Formulation</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the notations and their descriptions used in this paper. Given a query ùëû, we have ùëò subtopics I representing different user intents, and ùëû ùëñ is the ùëñ‚àíth subtopic (ùëñ ‚àà [1, ùëò] and ùëû ùëñ ‚àà I). Suppose D is a list of candidate documents for ùëû, the target of search result diversification is to return a new ranked document list R based on initial ad-hoc rank list D, where diverse documents covering different subtopics are ranked higher in R and redundant documents are ranked lower.</p><p>Different from the ad-hoc retrieval task which is solely designed for returning relevant documents, search result diversification needs to consider both the relevance of each single document and the similarity between them. As introduced in Section 1, most existing diversification models used the greedy selection approach: they iteratively select the next best document by evaluating the relevance of each remaining document and its novelty bring to the results based on the list of documents which are already selected in those early iterations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">DESA: the Overall Framework</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we show the overall structure of our proposed DESA framework. Different from existing approaches which greedily select the next best documents and sequentially generate R, DESA calculates all diverse ranking scores for each candidate document simultaneously, then sorts the documents based on the scores and gets the diverse ranking list directly. i.e., DESA directly gets a list of ranking scores S ùê∑ by: S ùê∑ = DESA(D, ùëû, I).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">)<label>1</label></formula><p>DESA takes the whole candidate document sequence as input and models the interactions between all the candidate documents for measuring their information utilities globally. Comparing with the greedy sequential selection approaches, this framework will get a higher probability of achieving the global optimal ranking. More specifically, we use an encoder-decoder structure based on self attention to model the relationship between each document in D and each subtopic ùëû ùëñ ‚àà I. The encoder component takes the whole candidate document sequence D as input, and returns the representations of all the documents simultaneously. After interacting with every other candidate document, the document representations can indicate the novelty or dissimilarity of a document. Then the decoder component takes both document sequence and subtopics as input, returning the decoded document representations indicating the subtopic coverage of the documents. Finally, those representations will be used by a learning-to-rank function to judge the diverse ranking scores of the documents. Key components of the framework are briefly introduced as follows.</p><p>(1) Document Representations. Suppose ùëë ùë° is the ùë°-th document in D, ùíÖ ùë° is the initial distributed representation of the document ùëë ùë° . In order to avoid overfitting, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and use unsupervised methods doc2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to generate the initial document representations instead of building the optimized document representations automatically.</p><p>(2) Self-attention Encoder. The self-attention encoder in the framework of DESA takes ùë´ as input and returns the representations ùëØ enc ùë´ of the whole document sequence. The encoder also takes the embeddings of subtopics ùë∞ as input and returns the representations ùëØ enc ùë∞ for all the subtopic. i.e., we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ùëØ enc ùê∑ = SelfAttnEnc(ùë´), ùëØ enc ùêº = SelfAttnEnc(ùë∞ ),</formula><p>where the self-attention encoder is denoted as SelfAttnEnc, which will be introduced in the next section.</p><p>(3) Self-attention Decoder. The decoder will take the encoded representation of document sequence ùëØ enc ùê∑ and subtopics ùëØ enc ùêº as an input, and return the decoded representations ùëØ dec ùê∑ for all the documents. These decoded representations model the subtopic coverage of the documents. This step can be described as the following Full Paper Track CIKM '20, October 19-23, 2020, Virtual Event, Ireland equations, and the decoder is denoted as SelfAttnDec:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ùëØ dec ùê∑ = SelfAttnDec(ùëØ enc ùê∑ , ùëØ enc ùêº ), ùíâ enc ùë° = ùëØ enc ùë´ [index(t)], ùíâ dec ùë° = ùëØ dec ùë´ [index(t)],</formula><p>where ùëñùëõùëëùëíùë• (ùë°) is the operation of getting the vector at index ùë°. For the ùë°‚àíth document, the encoded and decoded representations ùíâ enc ùë° and ùíâ dec ùë° are used to get the document's ranking score. (4) Subtopic Document Ranking. We use learning-to-rank to learn the relevance score of the ùëñ-th subtopic ùë† ùëû ùëñ through the subtopic relevance features ùíô ùëû ùëñ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ùë† ùëû ùëñ = ùíô ùëá ùëû ùëñ ùíò ùëü (ùëñ ‚àà [1, ùëò]).</formula><p>Here ùíò ùëü is a learnable parameter. We use the same relevance features as the previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for ùíô ùëû and ùíô ùëû ùëñ , including BM25, TF-IDF, language model scores, Page Rank, the numbers of incoming links and outgoing links, et al. More details about these features can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and we omit the details due to space limitation. In the future, we plan to explore more neural-based features.</p><p>(5) The Final Ranking. The summarized document feature vectors ùíó ùëá ùëë ùë° ,ùëû,ùëû ùëñ are concatenated by the following components: the query relevance features ùíô ùëû , the encoded document representation ùíâ enc ùë° and decoded document representation ùíâ dec ùíï , and the relevance scores of all the ùëò subtopics [ùë† ùëû 1 , . . . , ùë† ùëû ùëò ]. Note that we use the same set of ranking features for query ùëû with those used for subtopics as introduced in step (4). Given the document feature vectors ùíó ùëá ùëë ùë° ,ùëû,ùëû ùëñ , we use learning-to-rank to train the final ranking models. The ranking model then returns the ranking score ùë† ùë° ‚àà S ùê∑ for the ùë°‚àíth document ùëë ùë° . We then generate the diversified ranking list R by sorting all the candidate documents with their ranking scores in S ùê∑ . Recall that different from those greedy sequential selection based models, DESA doesn't depend on the sequential selection process. This is similar to some ad-hoc ranking models such as SetRank <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>This process is formulated as the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ùíó ùëë ùë° ,ùëû,ùëû ùëñ = [ùíô ùëû ; ùíâ enc ùë° ; ùíâ dec ùíï ; ùë† ùëû 1 , . . . , ùë† ùëû ùëò ],<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">ùë† ùë° = ùíó ùëá ùëë ùë° ,ùëû,ùëû ùëñ ùíò ùë£ .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ùíò ùë£ is a learnable parameter, [; ] means the concatenation.</p><p>In the remaining part of this section, we will introduce the components in details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Self-Attention Encoder Component</head><p>The whole self-attention encoder component denoted as SelfAttnEnc takes all the candidate document embeddings as a whole document sequence ùë´, and returns all the document representations as a whole matrix denoted as ùëØ enc ùë´ in parallel. The representations will indicate the novelty of each document comparing with other candidate documents. In this section we will introduce the implementation of self-attention encoder in details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.3.1</head><p>The Attention Function. In the search result diversification task, the vector representations of documents are used as input to the self-attention layer. Different from RNN, self-attention network will not model the sequence information explicitly, so the standard  Transformer structure also includes an optional component of positional encoding to incorporate the sequence information. Here we deploy an optional learnable position embeddings for capturing the sequence information of the documents and concatenate them with the document embeddings.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">‚Ñé ùë° ùëëùëíùëê ] ùêª ùê∑ ùëíùëõùëê = [‚Ñé 1 ùëíùëõùëê , ‚Ä¶ , ‚Ñé ùëõ ùëíùëõùëê ‡µß ùêª ùêº ùëíùëõùëê = [‚Ñé ùëû1 ùëíùëõùëê , ‚Ä¶ , ‚Ñé ùëûùëò ùëíùëõùëê ‡µß ùêª ùê∑ ùëëùëíùëê = [‚Ñé 1 ùëëùëíùëê , ‚Ä¶ , ‚Ñé ùëõ ùëëùëíùëê ] ‚Ñé ùë° ùëíùëõùëê = ùêª ùê∑ ùëíùëõùëê [ùëñùëõùëëùëíùë•(ùë°) ‡µß ‚Ñé ùë° ùëëùëíùëê = ùêª ùê∑ ùëëùëíùëê [ùëñùëõùëëùëíùë•(ùë°)</formula><p>We use the multi-layer encoder block of the Transformer to implement DESA's self-attention component, based on the scaled dot-product attention function denoted as Attn follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Attn(ùíí, ùë≤, ùëΩ ) = Softmax( ùííùë≤ ùëá ‚àö ùëë )ùëΩ .

In search result diversification tasks, the model will take the sequence of document representations ùë´ as an input, and the query matrix can be defined as ùíí = ùë´.</p></div>

Following by some previous work e.g. SetRank <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we use the multi-head strategy in order to learn multiple aspects of different documents.

This representation can indicate the novelty of a document, and the learning-to-rank function can take this representations to judge if a candidate document is novel or redundant comparing with other candidate documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">The Self-Attention Decoder Component</head><p>As we described in Section 3.2, the encoder can also take the subtopics as inputs, and return the encoded representation of the subtopics. This is because the subtopic embeddings we used are actually the document embeddings. We use the subtopic embeddings released by Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> based on doc2vec. The subtopic embeddings is produced from the pseudo documents of those corresponding subqueries: retrieve top Z documents with traditional IR model (e.g. BM25) first, and then concatenate these documents together to produce the pseudo documents. Those embeddings of the pseudo documents will be used as the embeddings of the subtopics.</p><p>The encoded subtopic representations are important to the decoder, since these representations include the attention distributions of the subtopics. In diverse ranking tasks, the available subtopics are mined from the query and they are usually more than the actual user intents. Comparing with the user intents, the subtopics may still contain redundancy and mislead the diversification model. And the encoded subtopic representations include the encoder attention distributions of the subtopics, these distributions can be used to leverage the subtopics' potential redundancy and minimize the misleading effect.</p><p>The decoder structure will take the representation of documents as query matrix, and subtopics as key and value matrix, returning the ùëØ dec representation matrix for the documents with the multihead attention function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ùëØ dec = SelfAttnDec(ùëØ enc ùê∑ , ùëØ enc ùêº ),<label>(10)</label></formula><p>SelfAttnDec(ùëØ enc ùê∑ , ùëØ enc ùêº ) = MultiHead(ùëØ enc ùê∑ , ùëØ enc ùêº , ùëØ enc ùêº ). (11) The output of the decoder ùíâ dec ùë° will be the subtopic representation of the document ùëë ùë° , this representation models the subtopics coverage of document ùëë ùë° . The rest part of the decoder component is just the same as the encoder component, including feed-forward network, ReLU activation function and layer normalization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Training and Optimization</head><p>In this section we will introduce the training and optimization process of DESA in details. As we described above, DESA will take the document sequence and subtopics as input, and return the ranking scores of all those documents in the given document sequence. In the training phase, the score of a ranking ùëü is calculated by summing up all the scores of documents in ùëü :</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ùë† ùëü = |ùëü | ùëñ=1 ùë† ùëñ .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>3.5.1 The list-pairwise sampling. Since the dataset of search result diversification task is limited, we inherit the list-pairwise sampling approach from Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in order to get enough training samples. We are using pairs of training samples (ùê∂, ùëë 1 , ùëë 1 ) with common context ùê∂, appending document pair ùëë 1 and ùëë 2 to generate the document sequence pair ùëü 1 and ùëü 2 , and the metric(e.g. ùõº-nDCG) of positive document ranking sequence ùëÄ (ùëü 1 ) should be better than the negative ranking sequence ùëÄ (ùëü 2 ). The sampling process is described as follows: first the contexts ùê∂ with different lengths are obtained from both ideal rankings and random sampled rankings, then the rest of the candidate documents are traversed, sampling a pair of document (ùëë 1 , ùëë 2 ) when [ùê∂, ùëë 1 ] and [ùê∂, ùëë 2 ] are leading to different metrics. When using the listpairwise samples, the original loss function can be defined as a binary classification log-loss formation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ùêøùëúùë†ùë† = ùëû ‚ààùëÑ ùë† ‚ààùëÜ ùëû |ŒîùëÄ |[ùë¶ ùë† log(ùëÉ (ùëü 1 , ùëü 2 )) + (1 ‚àí ùë¶ ùë† ) log(1 ‚àí ùëÉ (ùëü 1 , ùëü 2 ))]<label>(13</label></formula><p>) where ùë† is a pair of samples and ùëÜ ùëû is all the sample pairs of query ùëû, ùëÑ is the set of all the queries, ùë¶ ùë† = 1 for positive and 0 for negative, ùëÉ (ùëü 1 , ùëü 2 ) = ùúé (ùë† ùëü 1 ‚àíùë† ùëü 2 ) for the probability of being positive. ŒîùëÄ = ùëÄ (ùëü 1 )‚àíùëÄ (ùëü 2 ) represents the weights of this sample, meaning that if the metric gap between the positive and negative rankings is larger, the sample will be more important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.5.2</head><p>The sequence mask for training. In the training phase, both the positive and the negative samples are the ground truth rankings, not the candidate document sequence. So the self-attention components are modified with a sequence mask used in the original Transformer decoder structure. Similar as the behavior of the users, the diverse ranking task is a top-down process and the evaluation metrics of the document at position ùëñ should not be affected by the Full Paper Track CIKM '20, October 19-23, 2020, Virtual Event, Ireland document at position ùëó ( ùëó &gt; ùëñ). The sequence mask will prevent the unexpected self-attention interactions and make sure every document will only interact with itself and those documents at former positions. The scores of documents at former position will not be affected by the documents at latter position. Notice that the sequence mask will only take effect in the training phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.5.3</head><p>The context-based pairwise loss function. As we described in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>), the scores of a ranking ùëü is the sum of all the document ranking scores in the sequence. For the sampling pair</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ùëü 1 = [ùê∂, ùëë 1 ] and ùëü 2 = [ùê∂, ùëë 2 ] we've got ùë† ùëü 1 = ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ 1 ùë† ùëñ + ùë† ùëë 1 and ùë† ùëü 2 = ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ 2 ùë† ùëñ + ùë† ùëë 2 .</formula><p>Here ùê∂ 1 = ùê∂ 2 = ùê∂. As we described above, ignoring the effect of dropout layers, the sequence mask in training phase will strictly ensure that ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ 1 ùë† ùëñ = ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ 2 ùë† ùëñ . So we've got:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ùë† ùëü 1 ‚àí ùë† ùëü 2 = ùë† ùëë 1 ‚àí ùë† ùëë 2 , ùëÉ (ùëü 1 , ùëü 2 ) = ùëÉ (ùëë 1 , ùëë 2 ). (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>Denoting the binary classification log-loss function as ùêøùëúùëîùêøùëúùë†ùë†, Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">13</ref>) can be simplified as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">ùêøùëúùë†ùë† = ùëû ‚ààùëÑ [ùê∂,(ùëë 1 ,ùëë 2 ) ] ‚ààùëÜ ùëû |ŒîùëÄ |LogLoss(P(d 1 , d 2 )).<label>(15)</label></formula><p>This is the definition of the context-based pairwise function. For search result diversification task, the scores of ùëë 1 and ùëë 2 depends on the context ùê∂, but since the metrics of the context documents should not be affected by the latter documents, the ranking scores of ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ ùë† ùëñ will not affect the loss function. This means that the contextbased pairwise loss function is actually defined in the form of a pairwise loss function for the document pair (ùëë 1 , ùëë 2 ). The target of the model optimization is to maximize the distance between positive document ùëë 1 and negative document ùëë 2 . When the model is being trained, the goal of optimization is to improve the model's ability of indicating if a single document in the candidate sequence is novel and covers more subtopics than the other candidate documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">The Ranking Process with Self-Attention</head><p>As we described above, research shows that the diversity ranking is NP-hard and for most of the previous models, greedy sequential selection is a common solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Those models will compare every candidate document with the selected sequence and select the best candidate document one-by-one appending it into the selected sequence. For our self-attention based framework, when the ranking process starts, the model will take a non-diversified initial ranking sequence as input, and jointly return the diversified ranking scores of all those documents. Similar as some other selfattention based ad-hoc ranking approach e.g. SetRank <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the model can return the ranking list with sorting all the candidate documents with their ranking scores. Different from the greedy document sequential selection models, DESA doesn't depend on the selected document sequnece.</p><p>With globally measuring all the candidate documents, DESA will outperform the previous models especially at former ranking positions. We will take the example in Section 1 to explain. Assuming there are three candidate documents ùëë 1 , ùëë 2 , ùëë 3 , with ùëë 1 covering the subtopic ùëû 1 , ùëë 2 covering ùëû 2 , ùëû 3 and ùëë 3 covering ùëû 1 , and the three documents has got similar relevance scores to the given query. Comparing with the greedy document selection models, DESA will return a higher ranking scores for ùëë 2 . since ùëë 2 is novel and covers more subtopics comparing with ùëë 1 and ùëë 3 . Then the ùëë 2 will be put on a former ranking position. This process indicates the advantage of DESA, because the goal of search result diversification is to satisfy more user intents at former ranking positions, and promoting the documents covering more subtopics to the former ranking positions will be more suitable to improve the user experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Theoretical Analysis</head><p>In this section we will analyze the effect of self-attention in the encoder-decoder structure of DESA. Here we will describe why self-attention is suitable in the diverse ranking task in details. For simplicity, we will first focus on a single-layer self-attention function in the encoder component and ignore those assist strategies e.g. positional embedding, multi-head attention or layer normalization.</p><p>The self-attention interaction of the document sequence D is calculated in parallel as a whole matrix, and the attention score can be written as the following equation focusing on the ùë°-th document ùëë ùë° represented as ùëû ùë° , discarding the scalar factor ‚àö ùëë:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Score Attn (ùíí ùíï , ùë≤ ) = Softmax(ùíí ùíï ùë≤ ùëá ). (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>As we described above, for self-attention, it can be approximated that ùíí = ùë≤ = ùëΩ = ùë´, and ùíí ùíï ‚âà ùíÖ ùíï . The ùíí ùíï ùë≤ ùëá in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">16</ref>) can be seen as the dot product scores between the ùë°-th document and each document in the sequence including itself. With the softmax function, those scores will be converted into weights. Since the dot product of two documents can represent the similarity score between the two documents, those weights model the similarity distribution between ùëë ùë° and every document in the sequence. The self-attention output of ùëë ùë° is defined as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">‚Ñé ùë° = Softmax([ùë† 1 , . . . , ùë† ùëõ ]) ùëá ùëΩ = [ùë§ 1 , . . . , ùë§ ùëõ ]ùëΩ = ùëä ùëá ùë° ùëΩ .</formula><p>Here ùëõ is the length of document sequence, ùë† ùëñ is the dot product between document ùëë ùë° and ùëë ùëñ , and ùë§ ùëñ is the similarity weight converted from ùë† ùëñ . Section 3.5.1 shows the details of list-pairwise sampling for training. With shared selected context document sequence ùê∂ , positive and negative document pair ùëë pos , ùëë neg , the positive and negative samples can be written as [ùê∂, ùëë p ] and [ùê∂, ùëë n ]. Due to the property of softmax function, ùëõ ùëñ=1 ùë§ ùëñ = 1, for the weights distribution of document ùëë ùë° , the equation can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ ùë§ ùëñ + ùë§ ùë° = 1.</formula><p>In the view of MMR, comparing with the context ùê∂, the positive document ùëë pos should be a novel document, which means that ùëë pos should be dissimilar with the documents in the context ùê∂. The dot product scores of ùëë pos with other documents ùëë ùëñ (ùëñ ‚àà ùê∂) should be significantly smaller than the scores of ùëë pos with itself, indicating ùë† pos &gt;&gt; ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ ùë† ùëñ (ùëñ ‚àà ùê∂). After the softmax function, it has got ùë§ pos &gt;&gt; ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ ùë§ ùëñ (ùëñ ‚àà ùê∂). For the negative document ùëë neg , since it's a redundant document, the dot product scores with the context documents will be close to the score with itself, and ùë§ neg &gt;&gt; ùëñ ‚ààùê∂ ùë§ ùëñ (ùëñ ‚àà ùê∂) is no longer valid. As a result, a positive document will gain an attention distribution concentrated to the document itself, while a negative document will gain an average distribution. This is identical to the spirit of MMR, since a novel document should be dissimilar with the other documents, and its similarity scores with other documents should be much smaller than the score with itself.</p><p>With the context-based pairwise optimization, the attention distribution distance gap the positive and negative documents will get bigger, and the learning-to-rank function of the model will be trained to return a ranking score of ùëë pos higher than ùëë neg . With more self-attention layers, the distribution distance between the positive and negative samples will be expanded and the learningto-rank function will be more effective to judge the novelty of a candidate document.</p><p>This analysis mainly depends on the self-attention encoder, and the principle of the decoder component is similar as the encoder:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">ùíâ dec ùë° = Attn(ùíâ enc ùë° , ùëØ enc ùêº , ùëØ enc ùêº ) = [ùë§ dec 1 , . . . , ùë§ dec ùëõ ]ùëØ enc ùêº = (ùëä dec ùë° ) ùëá ùëØ enc ùêº .</formula><p>Here the ùë§ dec ùëñ is the attention weights between document ùëë ùë° and subtopic ùëû ùëñ . Similar as the encoder attention distribution, the decoder attention distribution of ùíâ dec ùë° will be focusing on the subtopics relevant to ùëë ùë° , and the irrelevant subtopics will be ignored with lower attention weights. The decoder attention distributions of positive and negative documents will be similar as the encoder attention. For the positive document the attention distribution will be concentrated to the relevant subtopics, and for the negative document, the distribution will be average since none of the subtopics are relevant to the document. The decoder takes the encoded output representations of documents ùëØ ùëíùëõùëê D and subtopics ùëØ ùëíùëõùëê I as input, and a redundant document will also be affected by its encoder attention distribution, letting its decoder attention distribution more average than the decoder attention distribution for its original representation. This effect is also valid for subtopics. With a subtopic ùëû ùëñ with redundant encoder attention, since ùíâ enc ùëû ùëñ = (ùëæ ùëíùëõùëê ùëû ùëñ ) ùëá ùë∞ , its corresponding decoder attention weights ùë§ dec ùëñ will also be affected and weakened through the average distribution of ùëæ enc ùëû ùëñ . Taking ùíâ dec ùë° as input, the learning-to-rank function will be able to model the subtopic coverage of ùíÖ ùë° together with the relevance scores of subtopics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8">Discussion</head><p>DESA is inspired by several existing models in IR based on selfattention e.g. SetRank <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. And the implicit implementation of DESA with no subtopics can be seen as an adaption of SetRank for search result diversification task. While the properties of diverse ranking task is significantly different from ad-hoc ranking task, and the training dataset of diverse ranking task is very limited. Comparing with SetRank, DESA has got the following differences:</p><p>(1) SetRank is not designed for search result diversification task, it's Transformer encoder structure will be unable to take the subtopics into consideration. While DESA is using a full encoderdecoder structure, and it can leverage both the document novelty and subtopic coverage.</p><p>(2) DESA takes the preliminary representations of the document sequence as input, instead of the relevance features used in Se-tRank. The self-attention networks in DESA only focus on learning the representations of the documents to indicate if a document is novel and covers more subtopics, and the framework deals with the relevance features separately.</p><p>(3) SetRank is using the attention rank loss function as a listwise function, focusing on measuring the attention distribution of the whole ranking list. And DESA is using context-based pairwise function as a pairwise function, the attention distributions stand for the similarity distribution and subtopic satisfaction distribution of every single document.</p></div>

We compare DESA with the undiversified baseline and those previous implicit/explicit supervised models, the detail settings of DESA will be described below. We use 5-fold cross validation to turn the parameters in all experiments with the widely used metrics ùõº-nDCG@20. The settings of the baseline models are described as follows:</p><p>Lemur.

The baseline settings of the self-attention component include the following items: the initial document/subtopic embedding in 100 dimensions projected into 256 dimensions as the input of the self-attention network, the ùëë FF = 400 in the feed-forward network and the head number ùêª = 8 for multihead attention operation. We test the effect of different encoder layer numbers ùêø enc from 1 to 3 with decoder layer numbers ùêø dec =1, and the effect of ùêø dec =1 and ùêø dec =2 with encoder layer number ùêø enc =1 or ùêø enc =2. The effects of different settings are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. As we can see, different settings of the self-attention component may slightly influence the effect of the whole DESA framework. In our experiment, we find that the total number of self-attention layer ùêø should be strictly limited in order to prevent over-fitting and ensure the performance. In the diverse ranking task, ùêø enc =2,ùêø dec =1 will lead to the best performance. Since the dataset is limited, more self-attention layers will cause more computational cost and may lead to overfitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Effects of Subtopic Settings</head><p>In DESA, the decoder component takes the subtopics as the key and value matrices and returns the decoded document representations indicating the coverage of the subtopics. Here we conduct several experiments to check the effect of different decoder settings. The encoder-only framework can be seen as a simple adaption of SetRank to the diverse ranking task, so we proposed two settings in order to show the effect of the decoder components. The two settings are denoted as:"No Subtopics" and "Relevance Scores". The "No Subtopics" indicates the framework with encoder and query relevance features only, none of the subtopic information is used in ranking task. This framework can be seen as a simple adaption of SetRank to the diverse ranking task. Another expansion of the SetRank adaption is denoted as "Relevance Scores", where the relevance scores of the subtopics ùë† ùëû ùëñ (ùëñ ‚àà [1, ùëò]) are included, and neither decoder component nor subtopic embeddings are used in the framework. These two adaptions use the optimized settings of ùêª = 8 and ùêø = ùêø enc = 3. We also propose two settings to check the effect of the encoded subtopic representations in the decoder component. The "Encoded Subtopics" denotes using the encoded subtopic representations ùëØ enc ùêº produced by the encoder component, and "Original Subtopics" denotes using the original subtopic embeddings after projection. Their hyperparameter settings are ùêª = 8 and ùêø enc = 2, ùêø dec = 1.</p><p>The experiment result shows that the full encoder-decoder structure of DESA outperforms the simple adaption of SetRank. The structure of SetRank is not designed for search result diversification task, and it can't take fully use of the subtopic embeddings. The results have prove the effectiveness of the full encoder-decoder structure specialized for explicit search resuld diversification. Comparing with the simple adaption of SetRank, the decoder component in DESA can measure the attention distribution of every document for the satisfaction of subtopics, leveraging both novelty and subtopic coverage together.</p><p>Besides the SetRank adaptions, the outperforming result of "Encoded Subtopics" proves that the encoded representation of the subtopics can be used to reduce the latent redundancy of the subtopics. As we described in Section 4.1.1, the average subtopic number is 9.48 among all the queries, however, the actual user intent numbers are only 3 to 8, which are smaller than the subtopic numbers in diverse ranking task. This result indicates that the subtopics used in ranking process may still contain redundancy and mislead the diversification model.</p><p>We can take the query #1 "obama family tree" in the TREC WebTrack dataset as an example. There are 10 subtopics based on Google query suggestions, while there are only 3 actual user Table <ref type="table">4</ref>: Metrics improvement per ranking position. "Total Imp." denotes the total improvement of DESA on all the 200 queries, "Avg Imp." denotes the average improvement per position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>ERR-IA ùõº-nDCG @5 @10 @20 @5 @10 @20 .118</p><p>intents in the TREC official subtopic annotations. And there are two subtopics ùëû 1 for "obama family tree pictures" and ùëû 2 for "obama family tree photos" in the query suggestions. While both ùëû 1 and ùëû 2 are corresponding to the same user intent, the redundant subtopics may mislead the model to select a document which covers the "different" subtopics and increase the actual redundancy.</p><p>Comparing with original subtopic embeddings, the encoded subtopic representations can integrate the subtopics' encoder attention distribution into the decoder attention. Similar as the document's attention distribution, the subtopic's attention distribution can also indicate the redundancy of a subtopic, and the decoder attention of the redundant subtopic will also be affected. As a result, the decoder attention will be adjusted to reduce the negative effect of the latent subtopic redundancy to the diverse ranking task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Analysis of Former Ranking Position</head><p>As we described in Section 3.6, theoretically our proposed DESA framework will perform better than the greedy document sequential selection based model at former ranking positions. Here we analyze the effect of DESA at different ranking positions. We compare DESA with DSSA, the state-of-the-art greedy document sequential selection based model. In this experiment we use the ERR-IA and ùõº-nDCG metrics computed on top 5, top 10 and top 20 results of a document ranking list to analyse the effect of DESA at former ranking positions. Results are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. We calculate the total metric improvement of DESA comparing with DSSA. For simplicity of calculation we use the metrics sum of all the 200 queries instead of the mean metrics, denoted as Total Imp. And we calculate the average metrics improvement per position to measure the improvement of DESA at different ranking position ranges, this value is denoted as Avg Imp. For example, the ERR-IA@5 of DESA and DSSA (doc2vec) is 0.343 and 0.328, the total improvement of ERR-IA@5 is calculated as (0.343 ‚àí 0.328) √ó 200 ‚âà 2.98, and the average improvement of ERR-IA@5 is 2.98 √∑ 5 ‚âà 0.597.</p><p>From this table it can be seen that the average metrics improvement numbers per position of short ranking lists are larger than the numbers of longer ranking lists. The experimental results are identical to the analysis in Section 3.6, indicating that in the early stage of ranking, the sequential selection based models may fail to select the globally best candidate document after a short or empty selected sequence. DESA can measure all the candidate documents </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we propose a self-attention based supervised diversification framework leveraging both document novelty and subtopic coverage. Instead of greedy document sequential selection, this framework can model all the candidate documents globally and sort those documents jointly with their ranking scores to generate the ranking list. Comparing with the previous works of search result diversification, this is the first time to model all the candidate documents simultaneously and select the best candidate document globally without greedy sequential selection. The experimental results show that modeling the candidate document interaction between each other can significantly minimize the gap between the local and global optimal rankings. In this work our model is focusing on the candidate document sequence, ignoring the selected document sequence. Simultaneously modeling every document's interaction with both the other candidate documents and the selected document sequence may be a potential future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The Overall Structure of DESA.
