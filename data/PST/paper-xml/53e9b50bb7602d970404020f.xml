<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this study is to formulate an analysis model which can express the security grades of software vulnerability and serve as a basis for evaluating danger level of information program or filtering hazardous weaknesses of the system and improve it to counter the threat of different danger factors. Through the utilization of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), we will organize the crossover factors of the software blind spots and build an evaluation framework. First of all, via the fuzzy Delphi method the aspects and relative determinants affecting security will be filtered out. Then we will identify the value equation of each factor and settle down the fuzzy synthetic decision making model of software vulnerability. Thanks to this model we will be able to analyze the various degrees to which the vulnerability is affecting the security and this information will serve as a basis for future ameliorations of the system itself. The higher the security score obtained therefore imply securer system. Beside this, this study also propose an improvement from the traditional fuzzy synthetic decision making model for measuring the fuzziness between enhancement and independence of various aspects and criteria. Furthermore taking into consideration the subjectivity of human in reality and constructing the fuzzy integral decision making model. Through case study, we show that the evaluation model in question is practical and can be applied on the new software vulnerabilities and measure their degree of penetration. The fuzzy integral decision making emphasize through formulation the multiply-add effect between different factors influencing information security.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Thanks to the widespread of internet usage and development of various systems software the users gained a lot of benefits, along with it modern enterprises and corporates also rely more on information technology. However it also leads to the augmentation of virtual attacks, increasing the importance of information security <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson and Moore, 2006)</ref>. The previous empirical research demonstrate that disclosure of software weakness will severely impact the market value of an organization, the stock market for example is constantly under the threat of information security incidents, the internet-based industries are also more than others facing this challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hovav and D'Arcy, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cavusoglu et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Telang and Wattal, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goel and Shawky, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gordon et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yayla and Hu, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ransbotham et al., 2012)</ref>. As a summary, within the actual business environment, the importance of information security is strongly enhanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gordon and Loeb, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The threat discussed above will not only lead to information security breach or damage to the system itself, to the extreme it would probably paralyze the entire network. Taking as an example the attacks through drive-by-downloads, it is one of the nightmare users are facing today. In general, the offensive actions through internet rely on special programs or target misconfigurations and non-patched vulnerabilities of basic applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arora et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wang et al., 2010b)</ref>. Citing an example here, in April 2011, the Japanese Sony PSN (PlayStation Network) was cracked by hackers, more than 70 million users data such as name, address even credit card information were retrieved from the Sony system <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Milian, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>During recent years, the so-called "zero-day attack" frequency increased dramatically, the vulnerability frequency of applications has also surpassed the vulnerability of operating systems <ref type="bibr">(SANS Institute, 2009)</ref>. In reality, there is usually not enough time to deploy or update a new patch to cover the blind spot of the application or system, exposing the user under the invasion of internet hackers.</p><p>This study propose a novel approach to software vulnerability evaluation and prioritization from the point of view of information security healthcare, and help controllers of informative system to fulfill the healthy status of their system. Information security healthcare includes three main domains: (1) health check (verifying the security status of the system), (2) behavior check (the status of information storage and retrieval in the system), (3) user-specific policies check (verifying the policies implied by the user himself). Through these three points, achieve the protection of system security configuration and provide security monitoring or strategies or protection from Trojan virus and malware code, therefore maintain a secure usage of the system and its content <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Martin, 2008)</ref>. Nevertheless, this paper focuses on the health check of vulnerability, so we would not emphasize too many other details here.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are to build an analysis model which can reflect the hidden threats of informative system and be used for evaluating the security degree the system in question is actually. Via the fuzzy sets theory and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) we define an evaluation framework, and filter the factors influencing security through the fuzzy Delphi method <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Weck et al., 1997)</ref>. Then according to the relative grades of these factors in reality we set up their relative equation and therefore we are able to make an overall synthetic analysis of the different degrees of influence of each factor on software vulnerability. Improvement can then be made based on the results of above analysis. Moreover, we propose in this study improvement for grading the enhancing effect and independence status between different evaluation factors in fuzzy synthetic decision making model. Taking into account the subjectivity of human in real world and formulating the fuzzy integral decision making model, through which we will be able to evaluate the security degree of software and plan actions to improve.</p><p>Within the study, through the process of two stages questionnaire analysis toward experts and via the fuzzy Delphi method we filter out two influential metrics: the "base metric" and the "temporal metric" plus nine evaluating criteria: access vector, attack complexity, authentication instances, confidentiality impact, integrity impact, availability impact, exploitability tools and techniques, remediation level, and report confidence. We also decide at the same time the fuzzy weight of each criterion. Afterward with the application of performance appraisal values and fuzzy statistics methods we are then able to construct the membership function of each criterion and through fuzzy synthetic decision making and fuzzy integral decision making model we then evaluate the security status of the software.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses about the related works of information security healthcare, scoring system and the software vulnerability evaluation. Section 3 proposes the evaluation model of software vulnerability. Section 4 is about implementation of the model. Section 5 contains case study. And the conclusion is declared in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related works</head><p>In this section we categorize the related works in three parts, first the historical of information security healthcare studies, then discussion about scoring system and related works, finally the related works of software vulnerability evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Information security healthcare</head><p>In the previous studies and research the general deterrence theory (GDT) has been widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Forcht, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Martin, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Parker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Straub, 1990)</ref>. In this study we categorize this research in this domain as a defensive point of view of information security, including defense in depth (DiD), intrusion detection/protection, access control, network attack and defense strategy, survivability, resource allocation, and etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Liu et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ryu and Rhee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wang et al., 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crampton, 2011)</ref>. However, this actual study starts from the point of view of the protection motivation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rogers, 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rogers, , 1983) )</ref> and is toward the domain of information security healthcare, meaning discussing about information security health status. In informative systems, misconfiguration and nonpatch of vulnerabilities may occur. Before any data is saved in the computer device, through trusted network connect (TNC) scanning the user can check if it is appropriate or not to download the data in question, this process has already become the de facto standard of information security healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Stiemerling et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trusted Computing Group, 2009</ref>). Taking as an example Microsoft network access protection (NAP) and statement of health (SOH), to guarantee the healthy status of the computer device, its antivirus update, operating system update, firewall settings must be conform with the SOH criteria set by the controller <ref type="bibr">(Microsoft, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In the previous studies of information security healthcare, the starting point was the national vulnerability database (NVD), then moving to the national checklist program (NCP), finally including the realization of the security content automation protocol (SCAP) (The White <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">House, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">House, , 2000a</ref><ref type="bibr">House, , b, 2002;;</ref><ref type="bibr">NIST, 2010a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Quinn et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Waltermire et al., 2011</ref>). Taking as an example the control protocols of the information security management system (ISMS), in the special publication 800-53 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), regarding its configuration management the office of management and budget (OMB) declared obligatory the federal desktop core configuration (FDCC) since 2007 through the notes M-07-11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Johnson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">NIST, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">NIST, , 2010c))</ref>.</p><p>NVD and NCP both rely on storing the information into database to provide better information security healthcare, and adding into this knowledge repository the counter-process against attacks on misconfigurations or non-patch of vulnerabilities <ref type="bibr">(Quinn et al., 2011)</ref>. Provide through SCAP the evaluation of system vulnerability and information security monitoring then supply the involved team with appropriate information security policy at the right timing. All these are to avoid that information security threat sources have the opportunity to illegal access, destroy, divulge or falsify information and affect in a negative way system users or operators. If the above threats are to happen, pernicious events may occur or damage to the informative properties will for sure impact the system and its users. Therefore, the basic process of information security healthcare would be as follow: starting from the vulnerability patch or the information itself, suggesting appropriate actions and policies to assure the security and safety of the information system, so that the organization can provide continuous commercial services <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Straub and Welke, 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Scoring systems</head><p>CVSS (common vulnerability scoring system) is the industry standard to "evaluate the different security levels of computer information security vulnerability" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mell et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mell et al., , 2007;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Scarfone and Mell, 2009)</ref> and is also the ranking used in the NVD (NIST, 2010a), it provides a grading system for system vulnerability evaluation, describes the weaknesses of the system through standardization and quantitative qualification. It can help governments or corporates build up a complete policy for computer information security by clarifying the relationship between different vulnerability levels and the appropriate protocol toward each of them so that the team in charge can follow.</p><p>Via open architecture, CVSS not only explains its evaluation logic and process but also includes various factors such as: vulnerability bulletin providers, software application vendors, vulnerability scanning and management, security and risk management, and user organizations in the equation, providing in the end a grading system for the system vulnerability. After the information security team apply the grading system of weaknesses and include in the formula the actual environment of the computer information system, they can retrieve the analysis result and allocate their limited resources according to the priority of different system weaknesses.</p><p>In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Houmb et al. (2010)</ref> proposed the quantifying security risk level, in it he proceeds to risk control and measurement based on CVSS evaluation results of frequency and impact. On the other side, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu and Zhang (2011)</ref> also proposed the vulnerability rating and scoring system (VRSS). They both developed afterward AHP to improve the system vulnerability grading of VRSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Liu et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Security evaluation factor of software vulnerability</head><p>In this study we organized the related works from enumerations catalogs regarding software vulnerability evaluation, the main categories would be as follow: common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), common weakness enumeration (CWE), common attack pattern enumeration and classification (CAPEC), common configuration enumeration (CCE), common platform enumeration (CPE), SANS top-20, open web application security project's (OWASP) top ten, web application security consortium's (WASC) threat classification, CWE/SANS top 25 most dangerous programming errors and etc. Enumerations catalog the fundamental entities and concepts in information assurance, cyber-security and software assurance that need to be shared across the different disciplines and functions of these practices. CVE enumeration enables all kinds of measurement by providing unique identifiers for publicly known vulnerabilities in software <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Martin, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Through this study, taking the different influencing factors pointed out in the related works of CVSS as reference, we can summarize them into three main categories and fourteen evaluation criteria. The main categories are base, temporal and environmental metric, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Base metric involves the criteria such as access vector, attack complexity, authentication instances, confidentiality impact, integrity impact, and availability impact. In temporal metric, on the other hand we discuss about exploitability tools and techniques, remediation level, and report confidence. While in environmental metric, collateral damage potential, target distribution, confidentiality requirement, integrity requirement, and availability requirement are the main subjects. The details are explained in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Software vulnerability evaluation methods</head><p>Usually when evaluating the software vulnerability, we rely on various fuzziness terms such as "very secure", "securer" or "not secure" this easily leads to an imprecise definition if using only the binary logistic. Therefore, in this study we use the more appropriate "membership function" and "grade of membership" from the fuzzy set theory, and based on their concept we clarify the definition of vulnerability level of various software weaknesses. Beside this, we apply the fuzzy synthetic decision making along with the fuzzy measures to elaborate the experience model of experts' evaluation toward information security recognition. The details are explained as below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Model logic and structure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Model logic</head><p>When analyzing the vulnerability of software, we usually face two extreme situations to improve its security: the first one is to deny any kind of data storage in the involved system. Obviously this will prevent any kind of attack and from the information security incidents point of view this is named "perfect security" and owns the higher level of security. The second situation being that a break-in program is already implanted in the system, leading to a "totally insecure" status. To be brief, the first situation described above would be ranked level 1 (perfect security) while the second one would be ranked level 0 (totally insecure). While most of the time, the case occurs in between.</p><p>Taking into consideration the objectivity of the vulnerability of software, it is possible to describe the real security status with an objective number, located between 0 and 1 and will be directly related to the factors influencing the result of software vulnerability. This number will change along with time, being a function of time.</p><p>The information security issue is quite complex and full of uncertainty since it is affected by various vulnerabilities or threats and also the indefinite nature of the influence between factors in the eye of the evaluator, making the alternative nature and relation between all the elements in the equation reflect fuzziness, leading to the fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (FMCDM) issue. This study use a simulation based on fuzzy statistics to handle the fuzziness of semantic factors and build up the quality rules of the equation. To summarize, in this study we rely on the experience of experts to construct a fuzzy synthetic decision making model, providing each grade rule its own analysis model, so that we can understand in a more detailed way the vulnerability of the software in question. Thanks to this model we will be able to run a fuzzy integral decision making analysis for each graded category and evaluate with precision the potential risks of software vulnerability and take action according to its priority level.</p></div>

While the filter of all these points and rules uses the fuzzy Delphi method to pick out the appropriate factors. The hierarchy structure of the analysis is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>

After this thanks to the concept of fuzzy statistics we can obtain a simulation of the function membership between criteria and start constructing the fuzzy synthetic decision making model. The first part of formulation procedure is mainly about a whole evaluation of the effect level on various factors on software vulnerability, give a number to each evaluated target, symbolizing its grade, it is the fuzzy synthetic decision making model. However, in this model, we can see that the subjectivity of given grade cannot fulfill the usual additive nature concept, this issue is occurring when we apply the evaluation model from experts subjectivity to grade the vulnerability of software. Therefore in the second part of this study we will refer to the fuzzy grading evaluation concept of Choquet to formulate the fuzzy integral decision making model and improve the traditional evaluation process, the main goal being that we can get even closer to the reality and also its actual software vulnerability. The fuzzy synthetic decision making and the fuzzy integral decision making models formulation are explained in details as follow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Fuzzy synthetic decision making</head><p>The main purpose of this fuzzy synthetic decision making model is to make a complete analysis of the factors affecting the targeted  subject and assign to each of them a real number symbolizing the average result of the evaluation. Regarding the fact that software vulnerability is influenced by various factors and also by different criteria and analysis equation, though the fuzzy synthetic decision making we can obtain a more precise grading of software vulnerability, detailed calculation process and explanation as below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Definition of evaluation criteria set and evaluation grade set</head><p>Evaluated vulnerabilities set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X = {x i }, i = 1, . . ., I.

However the factors having an impact on vulnerability are diversified and difficult to analyze, therefore during this study we first gathered the factors mentioned in works related to software vulnerability <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Martin, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">MITRE, 2010a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr">OWASP, 2010)</ref> and collected experts' opinions through a two-step questionnaire.</p><p>In the first questionnaire we find out the relation between the evaluation criteria of software vulnerability. Then via the second questionnaire we obtain the grading by importance of these evaluation criteria. The main three steps are explained as below.</p><p>Step 1: Define the set of influencing factors The main target: software vulnerability level. Therefore, the set of influencing factors are the one having an impact on software vulnerability, as shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Step 2: Collect experts' opinion The main target: software vulnerability level. After gathering the factors set, require the experts opinion about their grading, so that we can assign different weight to each individual factor in the set.</p><p>Step 3: Apply the fuzzy Delphi method and filter the evaluation criterion i. Construct the triangular fuzzy function according to the result of questionnaires.</p><p>Organize the result of questionnaires and build up the triangular fuzzy function following the Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>). </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ÑA = (L A , M A , U A ) (1) 1.0 Grade ofMembership 0 M A L A U A x</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">L A = Min(x Ap ), p = 1, . . ., N<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">M A = (x A1 , x A2 , . . ., x An ) 1/N (3) U A = Max(x Ap ), i = 1, . . ., N<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here, x Ap is the opinion of the pst expert on the factor A. L A is the lowest level the experts graded to factor A. M A is the experts grading average on factor A. U A is the maximum level the experts graded to A.

After the above classification we can obtain the triangular function of the influencing factors as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>.</p><p>ii. Filter the evaluation criterion Using the triangular fuzzy function calculated in the previous step to filter the evaluation criterion. In this function, the biggest and smallest grades are extreme examples while the average can represent the opinion of most of the experts. Therefore in this study we take the average of each influencing factor in the triangular fuzzy number M A as membership level, to represent the common opinion of the experts toward it. In the end, according to the research target quality (S) we filter the appropriate evaluation criterion. As M A S, accepting the influencing factor A as evaluation criterion. In the equation, M A is the common agreement of experts regarding influencing factor A.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Define the performance appraisal membership function of each evaluation criterion</head><p>One main issue we face before evaluating the evaluation criterion membership function of vulnerability is how to calculate the vulnerability level of the criterion. Due to the fact that the evaluated vulnerability is facing future uncertainty, we must use fuzzy numbers to describe the possible range. In this study, through questionnaire we filtered experts experience and organized the result with the following concept and turned the result of questionnaire into fuzzy membership function, built the fuzzy membership function of the qualitative criterion as the basis of vulnerability evaluation. Then we inserted in the obtained membership function the real performance appraisal of the criterion waiting to be evaluated so that we finally deduced the vulnerability membership function of each different evaluation criterion.</p><p>Calculate from</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Y k × Z = {(y k , z h )|y k ∈ Y k , z h ∈ Z} one of the fuzzy set B ki ∼ = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ B ki ∼ (y k1 , z 1 ), . . ., B ki ∼ (y k1 , z h ) . . .

Evaluation of criterion (a) Concept Taking the access vector as an example, according to the traditional classification, we may find the main security categories: high, physical isolation, medium, Intranet, low, wireless. Obviously we could make it more precise or appropriate, therefore when classifying an access vector security level as high, medium and low we call this membership. The higher the membership the stronger the relationship with that level and it could express correctly the change between levels, as an example: in a random access vector, if it is sure that the security level is high, its membership with "high" security is 1.0, the membership with "medium" or "low" security level is 0. On the other hand, if the security level of the access vector is "medium-high", its membership with "high" security is decreasing from 1.0, while the membership with "medium" security is increasing from 0, and the membership with "low" security is 0.</p><p>(b) From verbal data to equation When formulating the membership function through questionnaires, we turned the results of the survey into membership levels so that we can formulate membership function. The process principle is obtained via the fuzzy statistics concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buckley, 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Buckley, , 2004) )</ref> as in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>). In here, B k ∼ (y kj , z h ) is defined as the security level of the second evaluation criterion y kj = (k = 1, 2, . . ., K ; j = 1, 2, . . ., M k ) in different situation level h within the level z h . y kj is the situation level of the second level evaluation criterion in security level h. Taking here the formulation of the membership function of the "access vector" as example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Access vector (x p = Expert p) = N j=1 pj (Access vector of security level : Good) N B k ∼ (y kj , z h ) = N j=1 kj (y kj ∈ z h ) N (9)</formula><p>Then we use the Eq. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) to turn the result of questionnaires into the membership frequency table of security grades within the security levels: poor, fair, moderate, good and excellent. The "good" security status is in Table 2, serving as a basis for formulating the membership function of security levels. In N 1 + N 2 + . . . + N R = N of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, N is the amount of experts targeted by the questionnaire. N r (r = 1, 2, . . ., R) is the amount of experts who choose the "good" security level for level r.</p><p>ii. Formulation of discrete membership function The discrete membership functions are finite sets. The quality benchmark of security level evaluation criterion must first be obtained via the questionnaires to experts, where they will express their opinion toward various influencing factors and their respective performance appraisal level. Then we change the questionnaires result into numbers. Therefore we can only build the performance appraisal level of quality criterion as independent variable. The dependent variable is the discrete membership function of the dependent variable. To calculate the membership function of each quality benchmark with different security level, in this study we rely on the fuzzy statistics way, applying Eq. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and classifying the result of questionnaire into the membership frequency table of security levels such as poor, fair, moderate, good, excellent. "Good" security level shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.

To represent in a more accurate way the specificities of real human society, in this study we apply the independent "fuzzy measure" which does not need additive nature to calculate the importance of evaluation criterion. Because fuzzy integral model is independent and do not need supposition attribute, we can apply the non-linear status. Even if from an objective point of view, each attribute is independent from each other, however from the subjective point of view of evaluators this is not always the case, therefore it is more appropriate to apply the fuzzy integral model on the evaluation. As a result we apply the fuzzy integral decision making model to evaluate the software vulnerability of different security levels and formulate the software vulnerability evaluation formula.</p><p>In this study we use the fuzzy integral of multiply-add model from Choquet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Choquet, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Murofushi and Sugeno, 1989)</ref>, only via his calculation model can we retrieve the unique possible answer.</p><p>In the previous fuzzy synthetic decision making process, we already defined the evaluation criterion and weight.

We set up ten different level of evaluation benchmark, from 1 to 10 points, the higher the score the greater the importance.

In this study the subjects were from the same population and the experts' opinions mean was calculated, supposing that the evaluation result of evaluation criterion formed a triangular fuzzy function.

From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> we can note the geometric mean of the fourteen evaluation criterion. In general, importance level more than 70% means "important".

In AHP, to turn the written data into fuzzy numbers, this study relied on the most common by-pair comparison regulation: 1-9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen and Hwang, 1992)</ref>. Due to the fact that pairwise comparison matrix is reciprocal, only one comparison between two attributes is sufficient when designing the questionnaires in this stage. In other words, if there are n attributes, we need to do n(n − 1)/2 times comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Evaluating the relative weight of evaluation criterion</head><p>During the second stage of questionnaire survey, we can classify the weight of the influencing metrics as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Due to the fact that in this study we divided the information security into five security levels, beside the lowest, highest and geometric mean, we added the square root of the multiply geometric mean by minimum and square root of the multiply geometric mean by maximum. The preference repartition of the weight of the evaluation criterion is as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. We can obtain about each evaluation criterion the mean, the geometric mean, the highest and lowest grade etc.. . . from experts' opinion. Then calculate the coefficient of variation from the individual arithmetic average and standard deviation ratio, helping us to retrieve the preference repartition of the evaluation criterion. In this study, to also assure a correct and logic evaluation process, the grading of evaluation criterion did not fulfill the consistency ratio (CR &lt; 0.1), which we did not include into the equation of analysis.</p><p>From the preference repartition of the evaluation criterion (as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>), we can realize that taking the arithmetic average into account, the most weighted criterion in Base metric category is access vector (0.2756), while the opposite is the integrity impact (0.0940). In the temporal metric category, the most weighted criterion is exploitability tools and techniques (0.4582), while the opposite is remediation level (0.2071). If we analyze from the geometric mean point of view, the situation is the same. On the other hand, if we cut in from the perspective of the coefficient of variation and range, we can obtain the relative difference and absolute difference. From the coefficient of variation perspective, the biggest difference of opinion appears on availability impact (0.4094) while the lowest difference of opinion is on integrity impact (0.1094).</p><p>From the range point of view, the criterion on which the experts have the biggest divergence is report confidence (0.3267) and the smallest divergence is on integrity impact (0.0270). Due to the fact that different experts might have different knowledge and perception, the evaluation result of the same subject may of course have different results.</p><p>From the above analysis we can realize that the traditional AHP rely on the arithmetic average concept to solve the problem. But this will only reflect one of the possible ranges of the weight, not the entire situation. Therefore, to represent in a better way the subjective judgment and its divergence in the real world, in this study we apply the fuzzy number concept from the fuzzy sets theory, taking the biggest, smallest and average grade of experts on evaluation criterion to obtain the fuzzy weight of these criteria and interpret it through TFN. From the relative weight of different perspectives in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and the relative weight of different criteria in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>, we can calculate the fuzzy weight of the evaluation criteria as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>.</p><p>Taking here the evaluation criterion C 11 (access vector) as an example, the TFN for the overall weight of the criterion (0.1395, 0.1712, 0.2101, 0.2677, 0.2677) and the range of its weight can be resumed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>.

The importance assigned by experts on different metrics are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">16</ref>. We can see that the experts' opinions fulfill the consistency examination and do not have additive nature. The common opinion of the experts (average) being:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">ω 1 = g ({x 1 }) = 0.40, ω 2 = g ({x 2 }) = 0.18, ω 3 = g ({x 1 , x 2 }) = 1.00.</formula><p>On the basis of the above, when evaluating an information security status from the perspective of base and temporal metric, it does not show an additive nature. Moreover, the subjective opinion did not absolutely have an additive nature either. For example, vulnerability A base metric risk score (weight 0.5) 60 points, temporal metric (weight 0.3) 60 points, the calculation gives 60 × 0.5 + 60 × 0.3 = 48 points. Vulnerability B base metric risk score (weight 0.5) 90 points, temporal metric (weight 0.3) 20 points, the calculation gives 90 × 0.5 + 20 × 0.3 = 51 points. From the additive point of view vulnerability A is securer, however from the fuzzy measure point of view (supposing that = 1.333 fulfill the multiplicative nature), The importance level of A, B are respectively g(A) = 0.5, g(B) = 0.5, g(A, B) = 1), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>. The risk score of vulnerability A will then be h A dg = 60 × 1.0 = 60, and for vulnerability B it will be h B dg = 20 × 1.0 + (90 − 20) × 0.5 = 55. As a result, the risk level of vulnerability A is higher.</p></div>

Confirm the set for vulnerability evaluation: <ref type="bibr">-2008</ref><ref type="bibr">-1611</ref><ref type="bibr">, CVE-2009</ref><ref type="bibr">-1126</ref><ref type="bibr">, CVE-2009-</ref> Step 2: Define the weight of each evaluation criterion. Obtain the overall evaluation weight of metric weight and criterion relative weight from Section 4.2.2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">X = {CVE</formula><p>Step 3: Define the security membership function of different evaluation criteria. First collect experts' opinions in verbal way then convert the result into membership grade. Obtain the security membership function from Section 4.3.</p><p>For example, the calculation of security membership function for CVE-2008-1611 is as shown in Table <ref type="table">18</ref>.</p><p>Step 4: Run the fuzzy synthetic decision making model, following explanation in Section 3.2.4. Multiply the individual security membership grade with the fuzzy weight of information security level evaluation criterion from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. Taking the "access vector" as an example, the result is as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">19</ref>. Step 5: Defuzzication, following the indications in Section 3.2.5. In this study we apply [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] t . Taking the access vector as an example, the results are as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">19</ref>. r 11 = [0.1348, 0.0057, 0, 0, 0] • [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] t = 0.0014</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Fuzzy integral decision making</head><p>Through the fuzzy synthetic decision making model we obtained the representative data about the vulnerability of base and temporal metrics, which we can use in the fuzzy integral decision making model, the main steps as below:</p><p>Step 1: Under each evaluation criterion, apply the fuzzy synthetic decision making model and take out the fuzzy nature to obtain the score of the evaluated vulnerability in the two metrics. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">20</ref>.</p><p>Step 2: Calculate the importance level g(H n ). From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">16</ref> we know that: g(H Base ) = 0.40, g(H Temporal ) = 0.18</p><p>Step 3: Fuzzy integral decision making of vulnerability level.   Step 4: Classify the vulnerabilities according to their level, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">20</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>In the related research, CVSS and improved VRSS both apply base metric to calculate the vulnerability scores. However, through this actual study, we realize that even when taking only base metric for fuzzy synthetic decision making, the grading order obtained is similar to the previous research result, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">20</ref>. Moreover, this actual research included several influential factors and thanks to the common point of view of experts in the field, filter out the adequate evaluating criteria. On the other hand, the numbers obtained in previous risk evaluation symbolize the risks: the bigger the amount the greater the risk, while in this research the numbers obtained are security grades, the higher or the bigger the amount the higher is the security status.</p><p>The results show through fuzzy synthetic decision making that evaluation values can be used as basis for security improvement prioritization and that they can also be used to evaluate the security degree of new published software. The evaluation process of fuzzy synthetic decision making can also be applied before the software vulnerability level has been disclosed by official authority, to evaluate security level and serve as reference for improvement procedure. Meaning that relying on different evaluation criteria and their membership function we can realize the extent to which each factor will influence information security. The closer the membership function is to one, the securer it is.</p><p>However in this study we apply the fuzzy synthetic decision making model to handle the various influencing factors of software vulnerability and have a complete evaluation. After this through the fuzzy integral decision making model, we take into consideration the issue of multiply-add nature of security level between different influencing metrics. To improve the fuzzy synthetic decision making model we suppose the existence of independence and additive nature between different evaluation metrics and evaluation criterion. Then via the fuzzy integral evaluation with non-additive concept, we obtain the overall evaluation result of the software vulnerability in different security levels of each metric. The main goal of this step is to include the subjectivity of human from the real world in the equation. The result of this study shows that from the experts' point of view, the influencing factors of software vulnerability level from different metrics did not fulfill an additive nature. They rather turned out to have a multiplicative effect.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.
