<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The notion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is envisioned to improve the quality of modern life. IoT solutions have significantly changed various perspectives of today's life in many forms through different standards. It has engaged various fields including industry, healthcare, homes, automotive, sport, entertainment, and many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This is obtained via the large-scale deployment of Sensor Nodes (SN) or smart devices with the ability of sensing and reporting. However, this engagement raises serious issues since a lot of traffic needs to get through the network. As such, different classes of network traffic; for example, those generated from voice, financial transaction, driverless cars, SNs, and others are critical for their counterpart sectors and need to get through quickly or be filtered due to security concerns. As such, the requirements for various applications in IoT are rapidly being increased that result in the demand for more accurate classification of network traffic.</p><p>Network traffic classification has been a topic of interest from the early stage of the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. It began by presenting port-based approaches by which the network traffic is classified based on the used ports, to the sophisticated statistical and behavioural approaches where the network traffic is deeply analysed in a fine-grained manner by employing machine/deep learning approaches. Due to the strength of classification of network traffic as the first step to identify and classify unknown network classes, it has been the main interest of Internet Service Providers (ISP) in order to manage the overall performance of their network <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, one of the most primary aspects of the Internet that specifically benefits from the traffic classification of network, is security. This is because the security policies can be enforced after analysing the network traffic (i.e. filtering or blocking) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Due to the importance of security and privacy for different parties (i.e. providers and endusers), network traffic classification has received the most attentions in IoT. However, besides security aspects, classification of network traffic offers many solutions for other domains such as wireless communication, healthcare, and smart home.</p><p>Although the majority of efforts in network traffic classification have been published in IP networks, it has recently been discussed in a broader domain that provides solutions to address various angles of the Internet of Things (IoT). This broadness is due to the wide integration of various objects such as sensors and nodes that engage IoT to deal with numerous issues. Motivated by the fact that IoT traffic is different from other types of network traffic that follows a stable pattern and a predictable network behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we present a comprehensive review of the existing issues and solutions in IoT that have been addressed by network traffic classification.</p><p>Over the last decade, there are plenty of survey papers that have been conducted for reviewing the existing solutions and applications for IoT. There are also a number of review papers that identify new challenges from different perspectives. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> presents a comprehensive survey of the Internet of Things paradigm and enabling technologies followed by an analysis of the major research issues on IoT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> surveys relevant protocols and application issues in IoT. It also discusses recent technologies such as big data analytics and cloud and fog computing related to IoT. Security threats and vulnerabilities in IoT were reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It was followed by proposing a taxonomy of the current security threats in the contexts of application, architecture, and communication in IoT. Besides IoT, several attempts were conducted to review network traffic classification issues and challenges. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> provides a review of the literature on the classification and detection solutions in peer-to-peer traffic. It also provides a detailed analysis of network traffic monitoring techniques.</p><p>Another traffic classification review with the focus on payload approach was published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposing a taxonomy by reviewing the literature on classification methods based on packet payload and feature from encrypted traffics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> presents a systematic survey of machine learning solutions in network traffic classification at the IP level, followed by a discussion of a set of challenges, issues, and directions. The paper also presents an overview of the studies that aimed to improve the QoS at the operator network level.</p><p>However, despite the profound views in IoT and network traffic classification in the existing surveys, no published work has shown the importance of traffic classification in IoT. In this paper, the main focus is dedicated to the traffic features of IoT devices and different patterns such as machine type communication (MTC) and Human type Communication (HTC). This is because, IoT generates traffic different from traffic generated by other individual devices, such as smartphones, routers or tablets <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Besides, traffic of the IoT network follows a stable pattern and the generated network traffic being very predictable which is different from the traffic in ISPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Although these facts have triggered most of the recent works to offer various solutions in IoT traffic classification, no survey paper has been conducted to review classification techniques for IoT network traffic. Thus, in this paper, we provide a generic view of the published works pertaining to different solutions that have been addressed by network traffic classification in IoT. This paper aims to shed light on the roadmap of the IoT network traffic classification. It also proposes possible future directions by providing a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art network traffic classification in various fields of IoT in terms of application deployments, such as smart environment, and the healthcare system. We also investigate security aspects, in particular; authentication, device recognition/identification, and anomaly detection. The main goal of this paper is to expose different issues raised in IoT that have been addressed with traffic classification.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• We provide a comprehensive review of the network traffic classification methods in the IoT environment. To the best of our knowledge, this attempt is one of the first survey papers that focus solely on the classification of IoT network traffic. • We explain the differences between network traffic in ordinary networks and IoT followed by its driven traffic known as MTC. • We introduce the enabling technologies by classifying the existing literature and devising a taxonomy of current network traffic classification within the IoT context. • We outline applications of Traffic classification in IoT by reviewing real-world use cases and products.</p><p>• Finally, we highlight several important research issues and challenges from both the theoretical and practical viewpoints. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 justifies motivation for IoT traffic classification and its characteristics. Section 3 draws an overview of the traffic classification in ordinary networks and a roadmap to IoT-based traffic classification. The section is followed by providing IoT application features and the difference between IoT traffic features and traffic in the conventional network. Section 4 describes the threats and vulnerabilities identified by IoT traffic and the importance of IoT traffic classification in vulnerability identification. Section 5 provides a comprehensive taxonomy of existing issues and solutions in IoT traffic classification and patterns. Section 6 describes the real-world use cases and commercial products. Section 7 illustrates the available datasets being used for IoT studies. Section 8 offers open issues, challenges, and future directions. Finally, Section 9 concludes the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Motivation (IoT traffic pattern)</head><p>IoT consists of numerous connected devices. It offers benefits for various specific sectors; from people-centric solutions to healthcare systems where it addresses the needs of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to safety-centric resolution for minimizing dangers using automatic emergency notification and disaster recovery situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Also, the notion of the Internet of things can be inferred from the functionalities of Sensor Nodes (SN) to serve a specific reason. For example, SNs that are interconnected in the factories monitoring pollution and chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. There are also various concepts as a foundation of IoT traffic, such as machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, Smart device communication, machine-oriented communication, machinetype communication (MTC) and ubiquitous sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. All of these concepts imply a form of communication in which machines communicate with one another without any human interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. IoT is also referred to as the Internet of Smart Objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> that interconnects objects with the capabilities of naming, addressing, sensing, communication, and computation that is accessed by the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Similarly, smart environments emerge from the concept of IoT where homes, enterprises, campuses, and cities utilize smart devices with the ability of self-governed communication to monitor and control their environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. These devices are rapidly being grown on a large scale with a huge diversity and ceaselessly operating all together to deliver a particular requirement such as Quality of Service (QoS). The huge diversity of IoT devices' types (including thermostat, camera, sensors, smart bulb, Implantable/wearable IoT devices, etc) results in the total number of IoT devices to reach about 75 billion in 2030 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>However, an undeniable fact is that this bulk number of devices are coupled with rigid challenges. For example, from privacy and data leakage point of view; security breaches in the interconnected IoT devices enable the exposure of sensitive information such as unprotected video streaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, unauthorized voice recordings, emails, and passwords <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Moreover, poorly designed devices allow the execution of freewill commands and re-configuring the device firmware <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Indeed, given a broad utilization of IoT devices, such malicious manipulations impose deep implications on the security and the strength of the entire Internet. The cyber-attack launched by the IoT-specific malware Mirai <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, provides a clear example of the severity caused by instrumenting the exploited IoT devices and further propagating a larger scale DDoS attack via those compromised devices (bots) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. As it was reported, in October 2016, Mirai botnet compromised more than 600,000 connected objects around the globe <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Furthermore, identifying the type of the connected device to a network helps to perform security policies as well as ensuring accurate functionality of the device <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. For example, identifying a security camera made by a recognized manufacturer facilitates the organizations with enforcing filtering rules to refrain the device from perform nothing except what it is supposed to do.</p><p>The above issues have been widely discussed in many research papers using different solutions. The solutions vary from IoT-based network traffic classification using different machine learning (ML) methods for device recognition and IoTbased device activity detection by using network traffic characteristics. Besides security and vulnerability, other sectors (i.e. the power consumption of sensor nodes, the intervention of the frequencies in IoT healthcare devices, and smart home) benefit from IoT traffic classification. IoT traffic classification is a practical solution based on differentiating networks in different layers of IoT networks such as the application-layer policies.</p><p>Anyhow, an essential factor for designing and optimizing an IoT traffic classification is a deep understanding of its traffic. In fact, the rise of new traffic patterns and a massive deployment of SNs have motivated a high number of novel researches to propose different solutions to address the requirements of various applications. For instance, a traffic classification based on features extracted on the packet level traces can be applied for high accuracy of up to 99% for detection of MTC traffic within the IP packet stream of a mobile operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. MTC <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> also known as machine-tomachine (M2M) communication represents the form of data communication between end devices or devices and servers in which human intervention is unnecessary in them <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This type of communication plays a crucial role in fields such as communication technology (ICT) and IoT. However, IoT traffic comprises both MTC and human type communication (HTC) from traffic and understanding the behaviour and differences is essential for the building block of the future network application design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">IoT traffic characteristics and differences</head><p>In general, MTC generates a distinct traffic pattern that has some dissimilarities in comparison to the traffic generated by other types of devices whose traffic characteristics are well known; for example, smartphones, routers or tablets <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>As a point of fact, the behaviour of MTC is characterized by the type of service and the design of software running on them (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, Email). This behaviour strongly impacts the signalling and payload traffic that are represented as Control Plane (C-plane) and User plane (U-plane) respectively.</p><p>In a network, the physical nodes such as SN generate the MTC traffic in the data gathering layer and send it throughout the network from the perception layer. Then, the data transmission layer also known as the network layer, streams traffic flow to the packet data network in the network layer. The research works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> reported the following items as the main comparisons of the characteristics of MTC and HTC traffic: • In MTC traffic, the number of transmitted packages is less than the traffic generated by HTC, • The period of time between the data transfer is longer in MTC traffic (long duty-cycle traffic patterns),</p><p>• MTC has a similar statistical characteristic in the traffic patterns of a device, • Domination of outgoing traffic in MTC,</p><p>• MTC traffic is dependent on events and the traffic is periodic, • MTC has more aggregated traffic in MTC (combined traffic from multiple sources specific to network nodes such as a gateway).</p><p>A significant characteristic of the MTC is that the generated traffic is more homogeneous in comparison with the HTC traffic which is more heterogeneous in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This is due to the number of devices that reflect the same functions in MTC as opposed to HTC that has numerous applications running with different functionalities and many accessible servers. Findings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> indicate that devices in MTC communicate averagely with less than 10 servers within a period of 24 hours. As opposed, the average number of device communication with servers in HTC is over 500 in the same period. In addition, in terms of the protocol used, MTC majorly uses specific application-layer protocols. Thus, a simple examination of the most frequently used destination port number reveals a similarity in the signatures generated by different devices. Observation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> shows that one of the most popular protocols used in IoT devises is the DNS one. In the dataset from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, it has been observed that IoT devices mostly use the domain names of their vendors or service providers for DNS queries even though, they constantly repeat the same queries. Therefore, only a limited number of domains is used in IoT devices. For instance, the periodic time of DNS requests for Belkin Wemo motion sensor, Samsung SmartThings, and Amazon Echo are 5, 10 and 30 minutes respectively. Moreover, the number of DNS requests issued by these devices within a period of 24 hours is 5, 3, and 7 respectively. However, this number is more than 300 domain names in the same period for non-IoT devices such as laptops <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The analysis from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> shows that the port number of 123 in UPD which is known as NTP protocol emerges from 2% of total packets destined to the internet from IoT devices. Also, a similar pattern in the use of NTP, as well as a constant occurrence in time synchronization from many IoT devices was observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the traffic behavior of MTC and HTC.</p><p>Traffic patterns and characteristics in MTC are categorized into three groups such as Periodic Update (PU), Event-Driven (ED), and Payload Exchange (PE).</p><p>• PU is a pattern of traffic as a result of transmitting the update values of the terminal devices to a central one (i.e. IoT concentrator) <ref type="bibr">[28] [29]</ref>. Each transmission comprises a constant amount of data with regular time intervals. However, this form of transport lacks a real-time nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. • ED represents the pattern of traffic caused by an actuator when it triggers an event. An example of a trigger is a measured value (i.e. smart thermostat) or a command from a sensor that is transmitted to a central unit (i.e. IoT concentrator). Also, ED has a real-time nature and provides a data sending time period which has a variable manner. However, the time period for sending data may be constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> in some specific cases. For example, when there is a need to configure a device software update. • PE is the traffic pattern from the transmission of large quantities of data between end IoT devices and servers. This pattern is generated as a consequence of the two previous traffic patterns (PD and EU). The main characteristic of this pattern is the dominance of outbound traffic. This dominance can show a constant intensity when the data transmission is telemetry or via images/videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. From the literature, it is understood that IoT traffic behavior and its characteristics comprise a combination of MTC and HTC on a massive scale. Besides that, MTC was the primary communication at the time of IoT emergence. Limited applications (i.e. metering applications) for small sensor nodes were the main foundation of IoT in the past. The characteristics of devices and applications were mainly restricted to limited sessions with a few bytes of data. However, newly, the characteristics of the traffic generated by different MTC have been completely revived as a result of the new revolutionary applications and IoT devices (i.e. automotive, video surveillance, and etc). Nowadays, MTC may expose different traffic patterns and characteristics; for example, an M2M device may generate similar traffic to a router, or smartphone <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, traffic is stable and remains predictable in terms of shape and volume. Traditionally, network traffic classification models employed in the IP networks and ISPs for network management applications such as traffic engineering, load balancing, and security. These applications provide general solutions to address the needs of the network. However, with the emergence of IoT, applications are getting more sophisticated and their requirements are increased as well. Therefore, accurate traffic classification techniques are highly required for different and specific purposes in IoT different from those in traditional networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Overview of network traffic classification</head><p>Network traffic classification is an essential prerequisite for various network applications such as security, monitoring, accounting etc. It is also important for long-term provisioning of the resources in a network by predicting future demands based on analysing the network traffic. In addition, many network services such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, status reports, and Quality of Service systems benefit from a successful classification of network traffic.</p><p>The concept of network traffic classification was first emerged to discover applications, services, and their popularity trends in networks. Understanding this information provides network operators with precious information to improve their services and deliver user needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Furthermore, successful classification of network traffic can assist to recognize disruptive applications or anomalies that change the running behaviour of network traffic. These anomalies or applications can cause the normal functions of the network to break down <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Worms and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are examples of malicious network activities that cause anomalies and change network traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Therefore, identifying anomalies in network traffic is a crucial task for network operators and end-users that can help the security of data as well as the availability of services. Moreover, identifying the applications being used by the end-users may be of interest to ISPs from the accounting and charging perspectives.</p><p>Traditionally, traffic classification is accomplished using traffic analysis techniques known as traffic monitoring such as port-based approach. However, with the prevalence employment of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, traffic classification has reported as a more efficient way of analysing by using statistical and behavioural models as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> depicts the roadmap of traffic classification concepts from the historical perspective to date. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Port-based classification</head><p>Port-based classification is the most common technique that associates port numbers to applications, i.e. an application is mapped to a known port number <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. It is based on inspecting the packet header followed by matching the inspections with the TCP or UDP port number of an application registered on the Internet. The classification is based on associating a well-known port number to a given traffic type, i.e. web traffic is associated with TCP port 80. As this approach only checks the header of the packets, it only requires access to the packet's header. The main advantage of this technique is being fast as it applies calculations with a light complexity. Upgrading port-based classification methods for common services (i.e DNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>, FTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>, Email <ref type="bibr">(25, 110, etc.)</ref>) is quite simple and extendable by using extending their database with new application-port pairs. Also, port-based classification techniques can be simply implemented.</p><p>However, there are issues that impose accuracy and reliability concerns raised from port-based techniques that come from several reasons. Some modern applications run with unregistered port numbers (non-standard ports) or pick a random port number; for example, peer to peer (P2P) applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Application developers have become more sophisticated to avoid their applications from being detected by the system. The advancement in network technology allowed an application to use non-standard and dynamic allocation of port numbers which make the port-based classification ineffective. In such cases, the classifier causes an increase in the false-negative results. Even worse, in order to get through firewalls and bypassing restrictions of operation system access control, some applications hide behind well-known ports. For instance, non-legitimate applications employ HTTP traffic carried over TCP port 80. Therefore, applications become undetectable which cause the classifier result in an increment in the false positive rate of classifiers. Also, encryption of the IP layer in the packet header makes the port-based techniques infeasible to detect the information because of the obfuscation that is created in TCP or UDP port number. Also, applications can be integrated into a dynamically allocated port number. For example, traffic with TCP port 80 can be generated by any application but classified as Web traffic. As a result, the portbased technique becomes ineffective in such situations. Besides that, the emergence of tunnelling protocol techniques has also made the port-based method less convincing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> showed that port-based classification only managed to achieve an accuracy of 30% to 70%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Payload-based classification</head><p>To overcome the shortcomings and reliability of port-based classification, a payload-based classification model was proposed based on the inspection of not only the headers of packets but also by using their contents as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The technique is also sometimes called packet-based, and sometimes known as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. This method inspects the contents of packets to identify the type of traffic. Then, it matches the inspected contents with a deterministic set of stored signatures (pattern). For most types of traffic such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, this method is a highperformance model that results in highly accurate classification outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Many open source and commercial tools have adopted payload inspection in their products. An example is the Linux kernel firewall <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Also, Intrusion Detection Systems widely use payload-based classifiers as a primary step to identifying malicious network activity. The study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> reported that the rates of false-positive and false-negative results can be decreased by using the payload-based classification to 5% in most study cases.</p><p>Despite the reliability that reported, payload-based classification comes with several disadvantages or weaknesses. Similar to the port-based technique, the payload-based classification is unable to inspect the encrypted packet contents or if the traffic employs encapsulation. Therefore, evaluating a packet with encrypted content becomes unfeasible with this approach and a lot of network traffic remains unclassified <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As an instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the authors demonstrated the performance of multiple open-source DPI solutions such as OpenDPI <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, nDPI <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, Hippie <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and Libprotoident <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. OpenDPI, nDPI, and Hippie managed to classify HTTP, SIP and Oscar protocol with 100% accuracy. The impressive accuracy is because unencrypted traffic was involved. Besides that, the protocols were classified based on typical protocol patterns like GET, PUT, HTTP, and SIP. In addition, the payload-based classification techniques are usually unsuccessful to Traffic Classification</p></div>

Furthermore, one of the most important issues in a network is the privacy of policies and regulations. However, the content of packets in the payload-based approach is thoroughly inspected using a payload-based method which causes a breach of privacy policies and regulations. Moreover, the complexity of this technique is high which causes a high computational cost. This imposes more loads on the classification device in the network due to multiple access requirements from the device to the packet content. Though payload-based classification overcomes the shortcomings of the port-based method, it is still ineffective for a network with a high-speed rate of traffic that comprises a large number of flows.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> depicts the roadmap of traffic classification concepts from the historical perspective to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Statistical classification</head><p>The statistical classification applies flow-level measurement in the network to identify the statistical characteristics of traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. This technique is also known as rationale-based classification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The duration of the packet, packet interarrival time, packet lengths, and traffic flow idle time are some examples of statistical characteristics of traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The measured characteristics can distinguish different applications from each other as they are unique for each specific type of application.</p><p>In this model, the classifier applies data mining approaches from ML algorithms because dealing with different traffic patterns from large datasets imposes a high complexity cost and load. ML algorithms are considered as lightweight and less computationally expensive due to their independence from DPI. As the statistical classifier is based on flow-level information, its effectiveness highly depends on the features extracted from the flow. These techniques overcome the deficiency from the payload-based techniques since they avoid inspection of the packet contents. This feature allows the statistical classification to analyse encrypted traffic without any difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Behavioural classification</head><p>This technique analyzes the traffic and identifies the type of applications by monitoring all the network traffic that is received by hosts (endpoints). For example, analyzing the traffic to identify the number of communicated hosts, the number of ports, and the transport layer protocol.</p><p>Behavioral classification is basically referred to as analyzing the pattern of traffic. The pattern represents traffic shape, volume, pick load, and etc. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> illustrates that to distinguish the type of application running on a host, several researchers such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> used heuristic information such as the number of distinct ports that were contacted or transport layer protocols to analyze the patterns of network traffic. Also, it was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> that behavioral traffic classification can exploit other information for analysis. They employed a graphical visualization technique to analyze the connections between end points. The result from the visualization exposes that client-server applications are very different compared to those of P2P applications. ML algorithm was also exploited and integrated with a set of metrics by another group of researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> to classify specific applications in the network. A promising result with a lower computational cost is demonstrated by using the behavioral classification technique. However, findings are limited to the researches that considered only the condition of end-host <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> or end point <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IoT traffic threats and vulnerabilities</head><p>Due to the several important metrics (i.e. scale, diversity of data flows, and attack's traffic), data traffic in IoT is reported to be more complex in comparison with other scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. (i) scale: due to the existence of a high number of users and devices in IoT, the scale of generated data traffic is much larger, (ii) data flows: there are a wide variety of available services that cause the scale of generated traffic flows grow much larger, (iii) attacks: more complicated malware traffic emerges since employing recent camouflage techniques enables malware to be hidden and live longer. These implications impose huge challenges on traffic classification in such a scenario. In this section, a brief overview of intrusions and detection methods are presented to provide a basic understanding of security issues and solutions that are reviewed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Traditional network security</head><p>As a security point of view, the majority of smart devices are unable to protect themselves by host-based security solutions such as anti-malware. This shortcoming is due to the limitation of physical resources such as limited power and computational resources. Also, there are many standard security breaches (i.e. reusing code snippets, weak encryption keys, lack of security-by-design) that are neglected to be implemented in IoT solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a traditional network security solution emerged in the 1980s to protect systems against malicious activities. IDS is still accepted as a widely valid protecting system by utilizing ML/AI techniques that are reported as promising approaches in recent works <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref>. An IDS is usually installed on a strategic point of the network to help to detect the threats as well as to report all events/activities in a network.</p><p>According to [56], intrusion detection systems fall into two classes such as Host-Based IDS (HIDS), and Network-Based IDS (NIDS). HIDS is installed as a software package on the end-host to monitor/analyse the activities of applications and files in the system. On the contrary, NIDS focuses on network traffic to detect any abnormality in the network traffic.</p><p>Basically, IoT devices pose a poor degree of security. One of the main solutions that protect IoT devices from incoming attacks is network-based security solutions. For a number of reasons, identifying and filtering normal traffic generated by IoT devices from the malicious one has become a weakness of the traditional network security solutions, such as network intrusion detection/prevention systems (NIDS/NIPS) and firewalls; (i) IoT devices have grown on a bulk scale with an intensive heterogeneity. It is quite difficult to collect and recognize the signatures from all device activities and network interactions. Besides, new firmware releases may significantly affect the generated signature from IoT devices and their behavior. This exacerbates the identification and filtering of malicious by NIDS/NIPS. (ii) Traditional NIDS/NIPS and firewalls are costly in terms of deployment and maintenance. This cost is too high for the networks of smart home or a laboratory. (iii) in the big environments with a massive network scale, the process and analysis of network traffic data may cause the NIDS/NIPS systems to be overwhelmed.</p><p>The fact is that threats to the IoT paradigm are on the rise and patterns within recorded data can be analyzed to help predict threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, there is still a big space for research and development by which the shortcomings of the traditional NIDS/NIPS are addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Intruder</head><p>Based on [56], intruder types are categorized into two groups:</p><p>1) External Intruders -as the name implies, this type of intruder stays beyond the boundary of the network. As they lack permission in the network, they look for vulnerabilities to enter the network to perform intrusions. External intruders penetrate the network using malware or similar malicious application to obtain access.</p><p>2) Internal Intruders -Unlike external intruders, this group has access to the network by their own privileges. Internal intruders use different attacks such as physically or remotely hacking into the computer system to change or remove the contents of data, stealing the confidential data and misusing private information.</p><p>IoT threats are classified into four types [56] as follows: 1) Denial of Service (DoS): This attack crashes or occupies resources in a network by sending useless or unwanted traffic.</p><p>2) Malware: Attackers use executable code to prevent or stop devices from their normal function in the network. They may access sensitive information, or obtain unauthorized control of the devices. The attacker can benefit from the firmware's breaches or deficiencies on the devices by gaining/disrupting the control of IoT devices and environments by running their software.</p><p>3) Data breaches: Data breach is a security incident in which sensitive, confidential or protected data is accessed or disclosed in an unauthorized manner from the network. This attack is performed by spoofing the ARP packet to reveal the communication between sides in the network. 4) Weakening Perimeters: IoT networks are vulnerable to security attacks. This is because a pervasive security solution has been neglected is now being presented in the devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Intrusion patterns:</head><p>Intrusion detection systems have been intended to effectively diagnose and identify threats. The intrusions result in two detection patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref> as follows:</p><p>• Misuse intrusion -It is based on matching the network traffic of the intruder. This model is able to detect all the threats if they are known to the system. • Anomaly intrusion-This intrusion detection system is based on the behavior of network traffic. The behavior of the network traffic is constantly monitored and archived then the changes can be identified by verifying them with their past history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Intrusion Detection Techniques</head><p>There are various kinds of intrusion detection methods based on patterns of intrusion <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref>.</p><p>• Statistical analysis: This model of analysis presents trends of data and compares them to a predetermined set of baseline criteria. It compares the normal behavior of data to the deviations over time. This approach is used in the Anomaly detection system (ADS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>. • Evolutionary algorithm: In this approach, an application path is produced by which it gives ordinary behavioral models. This application classifies the created models depend on the conditions such as ordinary behavior, error conditions and attempted intrusion [56]. • Protocol verification: This technique checks and matches all the protocol fields and their behavior with primary standards. Accordingly, a suspicious category is created from the data that was unmatched with the primary standards. However, the generated false positive outcomes from unspecified protocols is a drawback of this technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>. • Rule-Based: This is also known as the state transition analysis technique. In this technique, data is compared to the signatures. Attacks are detected in the final state of a finite state machine that evaluates packets <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>. • Artificial Neural Network (ANN): ANN is employed to provide a learning process by which patterns in the system are recognized. Basically, ANN uses neurons to evaluate a complex hypothesis. Therefore, an ANN with more neurons can process more complex hypotheses. Also, a feedback process applies to estimate the error in the hidden nodes by the gradient descents. More information about the gradient of the cost function is found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Taxonomy of existing solutions in IoT traffic classification and patterns</head><p>Due to the major differences between the traffic features of IoT devices and the traffic generated by other devices, various angles of IoT traffic classification along with different solutions have recently been proposed. In this section, we expose various perspectives of IoT that have been addressed by using traffic classification techniques. We reviewed studies in IoT that that have applied a specific or a general IoT data sources (i.e. testbed, device, and dataset) on their methodologies. This section majorly focuses on presenting the applicability of traffic classification to demonstrate the extendibility and possibility of employing traffic classification in the IoT domain regardless of a detailed review of their methodises. We refer the extendibility and possibility of employing traffic classification in the IoT, to the technologies that are enabled by employing traffic classification in IoT. We also tabulate the enabling technology, methodology, data set, testbed, and performance for each of the studies. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the issues that have been studied by traffic classification in the IoT domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Anomaly detection in IoT</head><p>As mentioned earlier, traffic anomalies can be detected by using statistical analysis with ML which is based on matching the signature of the behaviour of running data with its normal form captured and modelled in the past. Many pieces of researches have been done based on different objectives such as accuracy, complexity, speed, etc. However, despite a large number of research efforts that applied specific machine learning algorithms for network traffic classification, recent work has highlighted limitations and particularities of individual algorithms that make them more suitable to specific types of traffic or scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62]</ref>. As such, an important topic in this area is how to combine individual algorithms in order to obtain more robust traffic classification metrics. In this line, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref> presents a comparative analysis among metalearning approaches and individual classifiers to classify network traffic. It investigates and evaluates a range of metalearning techniques, including Voting, Stacking, Bagging and Boosting. It then proposes a new experimental analysis of different meta-learning techniques also known as ensemble learners and comparing them with their base classifiers when used individually. Finally, considering the emerging popularity of Neural Networks, it analyses this scenario using the Multi-layer Perceptron classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Detection and classification of the attacks</head><p>Detecting DDoS/DoS attacks have been an important network security task since these attacks emerged. To detect DDoS/DoS attacks in IoT, a study in <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref> classifies normal and threat patterns using a neural network-based approach. The finding obtained from the proposed method showed over 99% accuracy in a simulated IoT network. In the same line, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref> presented several classification models for the detection of attacks in IoT devices that use the MQTT protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>. A dataset comprising attack records of an IoT system was used to feed an IDS. Three machine learning algorithms were performed to classify three different attacks (DoS, Man in the middle, Intrusion). The study applied three datasets, one for each attack and thereafter; datasets are put together to build a multiclass dataset.</p><p>To discover abnormal activities of IoT devices, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref> proposed an architecture that integrates machine learning algorithms coupled with distributed parallel computing for processing of a big data volume. The proposed method uses the concept of parallel computing to perform a training and testing stage of the generated model from machine learning algorithms on several computing nodes for maximizing the speed. To implement this concept, a virtual machine (VM) was used that implements HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), the YARN resource manager tools and Spark of Hadoop.</p><p>The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref> presents AdaBoost, an ensemble intrusion detection technique with the aim of malicious events mitigation. To identify a malicious botnet activity, the ensemble learning algorithm in AdaBoost exploits statistical features of the network flows with the potential analysis of MQTT, HTTP and DNS protocols. The proposed method employs three main components such as a feature set, feature selection and ensemble method to accomplish its aim. Also, it applies three machine learning techniques namely, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network for its classifier.</p><p>The study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref> presented a hybrid intrusion detection system by using deep learning techniques for distinguishing normal events from the intrusive ones (Flooding, Impersonation, and Injection). The study focused on finding a trade-off between latency and accuracy. It proposed a deep auto-encoded dense neural network (DNN) framework that maintains high accuracy while minimizing the latency. In the proposed model the autoencoder provides a compressed and less noisy representation of the input space using an unsupervised pre-training model on the data. It also employs a supervised classifier in the final dense neural network intrusion detection scenario. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Detection of botnet in IoT</head><p>In 2016, the biggest DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack was performed by the IoT malware Mirai. This widely publicized attack disrupted some dominant services of the Internet such as Amazon, Twitter, and Netflix by targeting the DNS (Domain Name Service) servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>. IoT devices such as IP cameras and DVR recorders were compromised by this malware by which more attacks were generated via the infected devices. Consequently, building an army of bots (botnet) to participate in the DDoS attack was developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>. As a matter of fact, IoT devices are usually designed and produced without any security solution such as firewall. Even if the network-level firewalls (protecting computers in a LAN/WAN/intranet) are employed, the security is not fully ensured. This is because some traffic and protocols such as TELNET traffic are in most cases seen as legitimate and firewalls are neutral for these possible security holes. The research work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref> proposed an algorithm in a large scale networks to detect Mirai-like IoT malware bots. The proposed method analyses the signature of the network traffic generated by the IoT devices that are compromised by the Mirai malware. The research work categorizes the IoT devices into two groups of devices that are vulnerable and invulnerable to attacks. Then an optimization function is applied for vulnerable and invulnerable devices. The proposed method further denotes a sampling frequency and assigns the frequencies to IoT devices for monitoring purposes to detect any possible infection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Real-time IoT Device Activity Detection</head><p>In the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> a prediction model, named as IoTguard was proposed to identify malicious and benign device behaviors. IoTguard is a self-adaptive classification scheme that employs a semi-supervised learning approach. It uses the network traffic generated by devices as well as the data extracted from network logs that are generated by access-points (AP) and gateways. To identify patterns of the network, the proposed work combines all the data from different kinds of traffic generated by the device. Because of the unavailability of class labels for most of the network logs, this approach implements an unsupervised learning model by which it learns from the various patterns observed in network traffic. The paper presents a method that extracts, analyzes and reduces the features of network data to perform clustering. Several algorithms such as fuzzy C-Mean clustering and fuzzy interpolation were employed to the classification scheme to identify the degree of maliciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> Summary of characteristics and features of IoT anomaly detection solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">IoT Devices Auto-discovery/Identification/classification (Network Management)</head><p>IoT devices have become very attractive targets for malicious attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>. They present a major risk for IT infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>. They can also be utilized to collect personal information of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>, hijacking a car on the highway <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>, or spying on company operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>. Also, attackers can exploit passive network traffic analysis to perform some malicious activities such as DDoS. Even when the traffic is encrypted, it still is an easy task for an attacker to employ network analysis from the captured network traffic to identify the connected IoT device and gaining their access control in the network. Also, malware can benefit from device fingerprinting by passively network traffic analysis to identify vulnerable devices. Even detection of malware becomes more difficult for intrusion detection system if attackers use passive detection methods to identify vulnerable devices to infect. This is because the discovery of vulnerable devices passively minimizes the signature of the malware in the network. Another concern caused by using IoT devices is privacy issues. For example, in the case of smart home, different techniques can reveal the current situation of the devices and further by analyzing these situations, current information of the house can be inferred which leads to potential privacy breaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>A simple way to secure IoT devices and preventing malicious attacks is to isolate the IoT devices so that the network devices become inaccessible from outsiders. However, complete isolation of IoT devices is an impossible practice in the networks. Another way to ensure security and avoid malicious attacks in IoT devices is by employing efficient discovery tools to manage IoT devices on the networks. This technique is also known as device recognition/identification by using network traffic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref>. It is a practical solution to prevent attacks within a network and monitoring their generated traffic to detect any unwanted task. A good example is the generated traffic by a smart plug or a smart bulb. We would expect a smart plug or a smart bulb to switch things on or off instead of watching videos from YouTube. Therefore, the traffic can be monitored to detect any abnormalities.</p><p>A simple way to identify devices is to monitor MAC address and DHCP negotiation in the traffic. However, identifying/discovering IoT device using MAC address or DHCP are challenged by several factors: (a) the Network Interface Card (NIC) of IoT devices are usually supplied by a third-party company. As a result, the Organization Unique Identifier (OUI) of the NIC may be different from the IoT vendor and is unable to convey any information about the IoT device; (b) MAC addresses can be faked by other devices; (c) many IoT devices neglect assigning the Host Name (HN) in their DHCP requests <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref>; indeed from the study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref>, it was reported that HNs are hidden in about half the IoT devices; (d) it can be even meaningless when the HNs are set in the IoT device; (e) user may change the HNs of their devices. Therefore, Identifying/discovering IoT devices by using MAC address and DHCP negotiation is an unreliable solution on a large scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref>.</p><p>To discover IoT devices in a network and monitor the boundary of Intranet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref> presented an auto-discovery IoT device protocol in real-time using two-stage architecture. (1) scanning suspicious IP segments with a stateless TCP SYN scan model for the discovery of live hosts and zero-copy TCP stack to achieve a faster data processing rate; (2) Identifying each IoT device on various protocols using the PI-AC algorithm that guarantees the accuracy and coverage of IoT device detection. The proposed method managed to complete a single port scan on 131072 IPs within 16.33s while multi-port scans took 534.62s. In terms of pattern matching, the PI-AC algorithm is able to achieve a total of 50,000 patterns matching in 185.92s.</p><p>In the same line <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref> proposed a machine learning-based method to identify IoT device in the network. The objective was to identify if traffic flow is related to a PC, a smartphone or a specific (known) IoT device. The proposed method is able to differentiate IoT devices from non-IoT ones. Also, it is capable of recognizing the device model (i.e. smart TV, IP camera) in a network using network behaviour modelling. A set of classifiers based on machine learning algorithms were deployed in a multi-stage process by which traffic flows generated by a particular device can be classified by their IP address.</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref> proposed a method to identify unknown IoT devices and distinguish IoT from non-IoT ones. In this technique, the behaviour of a device is modelled using its generated traffic. The method employs a deep LSTM-Autoencoder network to model the TCP features of each device and clusters all the features using Bayesian hyper-parameter tuning framework. The proposed method reported a high accuracy in matching devices to their labelled counterparts.</p><p>To identify IoT devices and the generated traffic flows by the devices, another work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref> employs two techniques for analyzing the network traffic, namely packet inspection, and statistical classification. An evaluation is proposed through the use of random forest learning for devices identification and traffic classification. The paper also demonstrated that device identification is feasible by using network traffic classification with automatic learning algorithms.</p><p>IOT SENTINEL <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">80]</ref> proposed and implemented a framework to identify the type of IoT devices (a combination of device model and software version). The framework is also able to enforce a set of policies for constraining the communications of vulnerable devices. IOT SENTINEL identifies device-types using a machine learning-based classification model via device signature in the network traffic. It monitors the action of devices in network communication during the setup process.</p><p>The proposed method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> analyses the network traffic to identify IoT devices. It analyses the raw network traffic to extract bidirectional flows. A set of features such as the size of the first N sent and received packets, along with the interarrival time model the bidirectional flows in this method. The research work trains and tests various machine learning algorithms to accomplish network traffic classification.</p><p>In a similar line, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref> developed a machine learning framework that classifies IoT devices. A classification technique was performed based on several traffic features such as activity cycles, signalling patterns, communication protocols, and cipher suites. Also, a framework employs classification based on machine learning in a multi-stage scenario that uniquely recognizes IoT devices with more than 99% accuracy. The proposed method evaluated trade-offs between costs, speed, and accuracy of the classifier in a real-time manner.</p><p>Similarly, to identify new and unrecognized devices in the network, the study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref> proposed an automatic classification method that exploits the features of the generated traffic by IoT devices. The method uses the rich information carried by the traffic flows of IoT networks to define the specifications of different devices. It extracts a set of distinguishing characteristics from raw network traffic flows, and then it offers an LSTM-CNN cascade model from the extracted features to automatically specify the semantic type of a device. A real-world IoT dataset was used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Findings from the experiments reported that the proposed method is capable of delivering a satisfactory level of performance in identifying devices.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> Summary of characteristics and features of device discovery solution in IoT.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verifying and Monitoring IoT Device Behaviour</head><p>Attackers inside or outside a network can benefit from IoT devices that are remotely connected through mediums such as the Internet. Also, they can take advantage of TCP/UDP ports that are exposed in the devices within a home or enterprise. They use these features to reflects/amplify their attacks to penetrate a network.</p><p>These security concerns have motivated domestic and international organizations to build standards for the Internet community to provide secure IoT devices and services and for regulatory agencies such as the US FCC to enforce security regulations to control their use. An IETF proposal called "Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD)" <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[82]</ref> defines an official scaffold to obtain the behavior of the device's run-time, as well as an ability to evaluate it concretely. This framework calls the manufacturer of IoT devices to provide the characteristic/behavioral profile of the devices so that the behavior and characteristics of the device from the time of installation in a network can be expected. For instance, only DNS and DHCP protocols may be used in a network by an IP camera or; it is expected to communicate only with NTP servers and a particular cloud-based controller. These specifications vary for each IoT devices from different manufacturers. Understanding IoT device specification can help to reduce the risks of attacks by giving the network administrator an ability to configure running/operational devices with a predefined set of Access Control List (ACL). Howsoever, considering the fact that the majority of IoT devices generate a distinctive traffic as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, several benefits are achieved using MUD such as (a) the behavior of IoT device is captured concisely, (b) the behavior is verified formally for adoption with standard regulations; (c) the behavior is evaluated at run-time versus abnormal behavior that may imply an attack is being occurred. Therefore, an efficient security foundation is achieved by the MUD proposal that allows IoT devices to be automatically configured based on the network policy. Thus, ensuring devices to perform their predetermined tasks.</p><p>In this line, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">84]</ref> proposed and developed a framework to generate MUD profiles for IoT devices based on the characteristics and behaviour of the traffic traces of the device. In this framework, two modules are proposed in which it; (a) captures and tracks all TCP/UDP flows to/from the device, and (b) generates a MUD profile from the captured flow characteristics. The framework then officially conforms IoT device MUD profiles using the MUDdy tool.

The complication is raised by the massive number of heterogeneous connected devices. In such a scenario, classifying and identifying the services used by heterogeneous devices is a crucial practice to network management systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">93]</ref>. As a necessary component in a network management system, Network Traffic Classifier (NTC) allows discovering the services/applications such as HTTP, SIP, etc being used in a network. NTC employs classification methods to network flows to extract important information from the flows' features. These features may help to improve QoS requirements as well as other network management components.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, flow statistics-based methods employs the extracted information from packet headers such as bytes transmitted, packets inter-arrival times, TCP window size, etc. ML techniques are usually applied to statisticsbased methods for prediction of services. In the line of deploying NTC in IoT, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94]</ref> proposed a supervised deep learning model based on flow statistics of the network. It uses the statistics from packet headers during the flow lifetime and generates a time-series of feature vectors. Thereafter, a model can identify the associated service/application to a flow. The classifier in this work relies on the combination of two deep learning models namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">User Authentication Model for IoT Networks</head><p>One of the most basic building block components of all the security goals is authentication which is known for validating the claimed identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[95]</ref>. It is the first step in which other security classes are built. Moreover, other security aspects can be negatively compromised without authorizing the user who claims to be the right one <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[95]</ref>. This is because the user's end-device such as smartphones or tablets may be lost or stolen. In such a case, the retrieved information from the device may be used to penetrate the network and impact the other aspects of the IoT network. Also, configuring authentication may be neglected by many users in the first place. Even an enabled authentication mechanism provided as a default package in the user's end-device may not be utilized by the users. Therefore, verification of the right users is the most necessary steps not only at the beginning where the request of access is made but also during the access session.</p><p>In this line, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref> employs the classification of network traffic during app access of end-user devices. The method classifies every single event and builds a classification model based on learning the users' previous access patterns of the events. Accordingly, the generated traffic from the applications on the end-user devices is monitored by the machine learning classification model during both access requests and the access session to identify any abnormalities in the patterns.</p></div>

However, a crucial issue in IoT is the power saving of the devices as they have a limited energy capacity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[97]</ref>, it is reported that the radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting and backscatter communication is a promising technique to allow a low-power communication in a massive M2M communication is built on top of H2H communication. A promising solution for enabling battery-free communication is through deploying Ambient Backscatter (AB) and Bistatic Scatter (BS) communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[98]</ref>. These two components can be the only source of energy by utilizing ambient and dedicated RF signals.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of research works that aims to reduce energy consumption and battery-saving of sensor nodes using optimization of transmission range and multipath routing. However, using network traffic classification, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[99]</ref> proposed a traffic-aware AB communication method to reduce the consumed energy in the network to facilitate the harvesting/transmission opportunities for AB communication. The method applies a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) machine-learning algorithm to classify traffic applications. Also, a stochastic geometrical analysis was employed to optimize the traffic pattern selection criterion. For an accurate classification of traffic patterns, the proposed method considers three features of network traffic such as packet length, packet interatrial time, and variance in packet length. Using the above steps, the proposed method obtained an optimized way of communication that minimizes energy consumption in a cellular network comprising Primary Users (PU) and Secondary Users (SU).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Smart city traffic classification in IoT</head><p>With the emergence of the smart city paradigm, a massive scale of IoT devices is being deployed <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[100]</ref> in an unexpected fashion as well as a sharp growth of the interactive data traffic in the networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[101]</ref>. Smart city comprises interconnected IoT and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices such as smart devices, sensors, and actuators which havw gained wide popularity recently because of the quality of services that they provide to people <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[102]</ref>. As one of the top four challenges in the near future, IoT/IIoT devices are seen as a potential source of serious problems that are able to generate various implications on every aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[103]</ref>. In such a large domain, the analysis of this bulk data is a crucial task <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[104]</ref> for many aspects of smart cities from a security point of view to monitoring factories and infrastructures for preventing hazards. For instance, data collected from a water management system can benefit citizens for the quality of their drinkable water by measuring the water quality or any other possible issue. Information collected from vehicle movements and people benefic the traffic stream in cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[105]</ref>. In terms of security, for example; cyber-attacks such as Malware or Trojans may prevent public/private services or even necessary social affairs, and impose implications on pumping stations, tram infrastructure systems, power grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[106]</ref> or emergency warning systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[107]</ref>. It has also the potential to disrupt normal functions of city traffic light systems and/or water supply/treatment. Some real and potential examples of attacks in the past are attacks on water pumps <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108]</ref> or valves that control the flow of chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[109]</ref>. Despite a wide deployment of IoT/IIoT/smart devices in smart cities, the lack of a standard monitoring and comprehensive control of the devices has imposed security issues. With this shortcoming in progress, more security problems are likely to happen <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110]</ref>. Recently, cyber-attacks on water treatment plants with the use of IIoT devices has been increased.</p><p>To detect cyber-attacks in the domain of the water treatment systems, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[107]</ref> proposed a method by using a network traffic classification approach. It employs a statistical anomaly-based detection method to analyses the traffic data collected from a lab-controlled water data sensor that was compromised by a cyber-attack. It then compares the collected data from the normal operation of a secure water treatment system. Using a statistical anomaly-based detection method coupled with cardiography waveform patterns used in monitoring normal heartbeat rates, the study found out inconsistencies or anomalies in the traffic data.</p><p>Also, one of the main features of smart city networks is the massive scale of generated data. The analysis of this massive data is of great importance for various purposes such as QoS, security, and etc. AI techniques in this domain can be seen as a beneficial solution for analysing these massive data. Also, for ensuring network security and preventing/defending attacks, network traffic classification plays a vital role. Furthermore, traffic classification improves efficiency in the performance and guarantees the Quality of Service (QoS) of IoT devices. In this regard, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> presented a deep learning model by the use of capsule network concept to deal with the classification of big data. The choice of capsule network is due to the fact that it benefits from deep learning process in terms of processing data on a large scale as well as a finer granularity feature extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[111]</ref>. It proposed an end-to-end classification model to improve the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112]</ref> as it is reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> that the end-to-end classification model is able to simplify the complexity of feature extraction in the conventional traffic classification algorithm. The proposed method employs an image processing learning model that converts each data flows to a two-dimensional matrix after segmentation. The matrix is then sent to the classification process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">IoT-based Smart Healthcare Systems</head><p>IoT presents numerous applications and solutions for almost all aspects of life. Healthcare system is one of the most important domains in the recent considerations. It employs IoT applications to provide a better service for all citizens. IoT benefits the healthcare sector in several ways; for example by providing devices and applications to measure healthrelated meters and forwarding those measurements to the medical professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113]</ref>. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a network of wireless sensors (i.e. smartphone or a customized device) that comprises devices to provide and record different measurements of the body and send them to a local Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) for analysis. However, the huge generated traffic by smart interconnected IoT healthcare devices may impose complexities for handling heavy traffic in traditional network architectures. The research work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113]</ref> proposed a method to efficiently manage the generated traffic from WBAN. It exploits the concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN) by which it classifies the traffic generated by WBAN into three groups such as emergency/periodic data, sensor health traffic, and environmental data. In the proposed architecture, the PDA receives data from sensor nodes and classifies various traffic types. It then sends the classified data to the required server for further analysis. In this architecture, an SDN controller remotely configures (modifies flow tables) the PDAs using communication services such as Wi-Fi or 3G/4G networks according to the operator/network policies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Real-world use cases and commercial/open-source products</head><p>This section aims to provide the applications of traffic classification for IoT. We refer to the applications of IoT traffic classification to the available real-world use cases and products. It outlines several commercial/open source and free cybersecurity solutions available today for IoT use. Despite the wide usage of traffic classification solutions, current products mainly address the security perspective of IoT. The current products are mostly developed for professional use and may not explicitly aim at the IoT environment. However, there are few commercial products that are claimed to be solely designed for IoT/smart home cybersecurity. In this section, we provide cybersecurity products that are available as commercial and non-commercial IDS/IPS applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Traffic-based analysis</head><p>There are several open-source and free cybersecurity solutions based on network traffic analysis that are freely available. Snort <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[120]</ref> is an open-source IDS/IPS that is developed and owned by Cisco System. It is based on wellknown tcpdump that sniff traffic for real-time network analysis and logging. This application is based on pattern matching detection. A packet in the network traffic is analyzed by a packet decoder module by which various features of the packet such as a data-link layer, network protocols, and TCP or a UDP segment are examined. The results from the analysis are then forwarded to a pre-processor module in which the IP packets are edited or discarded. At the final stages, Snort compares the received data from the pre-processor with the rules containing the footprints from attacks of different layers of the OSI model <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref>. Similar to Snort, Suricata <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[122]</ref> is an open-source and free IDS/IPS that is based on pattern matching detection in real-time. This project was designed and developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF). In Suricata, all the information is collected from the application layer and merged. The merged information is sent for analysis in the final stage. It is also able to evaluate the activities in the protocol level at the lower levels of the OSI model such as IP, TLS, ICMP, TCP, and UDP. Bro <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[88]</ref> is a NIDS, based on Unix systems. It is designed and developed in the Lawrence Berkeley National Labs and the International Computer Science Institute. Bro NIDS detects intrusions using pattern recognition in the network traffic. To monitor the traffic of inbound and outbound in a real-time manner, this application employs two network interface cards. In addition, to minimize the CPU load in FreeBSD, it proposes using patched kernel modules. Bro claims the speed of real-time detection up to Gbps. OpenWIPS-ng <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[123]</ref> is an open source and free modular Wireless IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) that protects wireless passwords based on packet sniffing by detecting intrusion patterns</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Log-based analysis</head><p>Log-based threat analysis usually works based on reading the log files that have already been produced via a trafficbased analysis tool. Therefore, log-based analysis products are often faster than those products whose analysis is based on network traffic. However, a real-time detection feature is omitted in these products due to their nature as the detection process is accomplished after the log files are created. Open Source HIDS Security (OSSEC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[124]</ref> is an open-source and free HIDS designed and developed by Trend Micro. Although OSSEC is unable to analyse network data traffic, it provides an evaluation of the checksum signatures of all log files to detect possible intrusions. Sagan <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[125]</ref> is an open-source and free HIDS based on log analysis. Segan is also compatible with the data gathered by Snort. AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[126]</ref> is a Unix-based open source and free HIDS that works based on signature comparison and focuses on the detection of rootkits. It works based on creating databases from config files and then verifies the integrity of the files based on the regular file expression in its datasets. Samhain <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[127]</ref> is an opensource and free HIDS that offers evaluation/analysis of file integrity, and log files as well as detecting rootkit viruses by using log file analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">IoT commercial cybersecurity solutions</head><p>There are several commercial cybersecurity solutions available to date for home-scale IoT devices. Norton Internet Security <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[128]</ref> introduces Norton Core which is an in-home Wi-Fi router that uses deep packet inspection for intrusion detection, and Symantec Global Intelligence Network (GIN) to secure IoT devices. A security score is calculated for every connected device in the network to set the level of security threats and action to be taken. On the other hand, BitDefender BOX hub <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129]</ref> provides a smart home cybersecurity solution with several features such as device identification and management, vulnerability assessment, anomaly detection and security protection against brute force. It also provides an enhanced parental control that safeguards the user from cyberbullying and scams. It can also send alerts for any verbal attacks, aggressive language, an inappropriate invitation or requests for private information such as pictures, passwords, and card numbers. CUJO <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[130]</ref> is another popular AI-driven cybersecurity and network intelligence solution that gives an auto device identification that recognizes names, brands and group devices on the home network. It goes through an identification phase by organising information into several levels where each level uncovers additional details on the network device (i.e. Apple product to Apple TV to Apple TV 4K). Furthermore, it supports personalized security for every device in and out of home by proactively blocking new and known threats. Following the trend, Dojo Intelligent Platform (DIP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131]</ref> is a multi-layered IoT cybersecurity solution for home and communication service provider that provides IP packets analysis as they arrive through a Wi-Fi router. Dojo's sophisticated defence system utilizes pattern recognition to learn to protect the Wi-Fi network and all the smart connected devices from intruders and cyber risks. DIP offers three major features for service providers, which are, the gateway solution, the cloud-based platform, and the mobile app SDK. Whereas Luma <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132]</ref> suggest that the smart Wi-Fi router provides a simple set up and deployment. In addition to its cybersecurity protection that blocks hackers from accessing a network and providing alerts on a potential threat, it gives a performance boost by prioritizing devices when it is necessary. Luma focuses on privacy connection with an advanced encryption, VPN network over thousands of servers in scattered locations, and a shared IP address to keep an activity untracked. Another popular antivirus, F-Secure introduced F-Secure SENSE router <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[133]</ref> that comes as part of the total premium cybersecurity package, which also includes internet security, VPN, and a password manager for all connected devices. Uniquely F-Secure SENSE uses computing power to scan files from malware and running analysis through AI approaches on file metadata and performs further analysis on the steps or classifies the object as clean/malicious. As a privacy principle, it ensures to collect only needed data while respect the users' privacy. It also uses device discovery to adapt to its security needs, as different types of connected devices require different types of protection. Then, with the whole devices topology in view, the security engine monitors and alerts when any abnormality takes place in smart devices, by sensing their traffic to provide extra protection against IoT threats.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Available Datasets for IoT</head><p>The effectiveness and reliability of researches are evaluated based on their performance. For example, in the case of an IDS, the effectiveness is evaluated by the detection of attacks. This evaluation requires a comprehensive dataset that contains normal and abnormal behaviours. As such, the quality of the dataset plays a big role in the development phase as well as in the implementation phase. As the network behaviours and patterns change, a perfect dataset could provide an effective model to the detection model in a real threat environment. Improvement in dataset collection may assist in improving cybersecurity research throughout the time. Today, a number of public datasets are available for testing and evaluation in the cybersecurity research area. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[134]</ref> a taxonomy of different datasets related to the cybersecurity area was discussed. Based on this taxonomy, current datasets are categorized into three main groups which are synthetic, benchmark, and real-life datasets.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[135]</ref>, synthetic datasets are generated to address particular demands, conditions or evaluations that satisfy real data. They are effective in designing any type of system for theoretical analysis so that the design can be augmented. Synthetic datasets help to discover a primary solution or remedy when the outcomes prove to be satisfactory. They are utilized in testing and designing various types of test scenarios.</p><p>Benchmark datasets are generated using simulated environments in large networks. The simulation of different attack scenarios is performed during the generation of benchmark datasets.</p><p>Real Life datasets are created by collecting network traffic in a specific period of time on a realistic network. They comprise both normal as well as attack traffic in appropriate proportions (i.e., testbeds). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows a taxonomy of different datasets that are used in IoT network traffic classification. Many studies reviewed in this paper have proposed their evaluation through a testbed in which the datasets used are private.

They improved the KDD dataset in these aspects; non-repeated and duplicate record to remove bias towards data frequency, resampling the number of selected records from each difficulty-level to address the skewed and unproportioned distributed issues. However, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[139,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">140]</ref>, a major disadvantage of NSLKDD is that the low footprint attack scenarios were neglected to be represented. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref>.1.2 ISCX-UNB <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[141]</ref> The ISCX-UNB dataset is created based on the concept of profiles that include detailed descriptions of intrusions and abstract distribution models for applications, protocols, or lower-level network entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[142]</ref>. It was captured in an emulated network over five (5) days. It utilizes two different profiles (α-profiles and β-profiles) to create a new dataset in packet-based and bidirectional flow-based format. The α-profiles describe the malicious activity and β-profiles define normal user behaviour that generated from the real activity of a traffic network. The packets are labelled network traces, including full packet payloads in pcap format.

UTSC-2016 comprises a total record of 752,040 in which malware and benign traffics have a total count of 406,633, and 345,407 respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Discussion</head><p>There are a number of intrusion detection models that have been built and developed for the purpose of research and development that contribute to features enhancement as well as intrusion detection. Similarly, countless detection approaches were proposed to advance the effectiveness of the detection models. Previous works demonstrate the important role of datasets in IDS research community. Nevertheless, some discussion on the benchmark dataset determines their ineffectiveness to replicate the real traffic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[135]</ref> due to; (i) most of the datasets are improperly labelled or are unlabelled as the information of the actual attacks is unknown, (ii) unbalanced proportion of data instances (benign and malicious) <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[149]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[135]</ref>, (iii) inadequately trained or updated data from recent network traffic. On the other hand, there are several challenges in real-life datasets for IoT apart from the challenges in collecting real-time network traffic with a comprehensive labelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[150]</ref>. The other challenges include problems with anonymized data that related to data privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[151]</ref>, lack of relevant traffic features <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[152]</ref>, and difficulty in satisfying the requirement for different types of IDS (host-based and network-based) <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[135]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Challenges and Open issues</head><p>Recently, IoT traffic classification has been targeted by the academic community due to its capabilities to analyse and infer the network traffic. However, because this field of research is still in the early stage, it will encounter several challenges and open research issues. The concept of traffic classification is identical in IoT and Non-IoT domains by which network traffic is analysed for different purposes. To date, there are a number of published works such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[92]</ref> on open research challenges and direction on solely traffic classification and hence, in this section we discuss more on recent challenges and issues in the applications and enabling technologies of IoT traffic classification. This section presents several challenges as well as open research issues for IoT traffic classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Challenges</head><p>Traffic classification in IoT faces a number of challenges such as quality of service, infrastructure, standardisation, and data source. These challenges must be fully addressed in IoT in order to be deployed as a concrete solution. Most of the IoT devices are wireless from which different traffic models are generated. Security breaches must be carefully analysed by studying valid and up-to-date datasets. Different environments and infrastructures require specific studies and analyses. These are seen as extremely challenging issues due to the heterogeneous nature of IoT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.1">Quality of service (QoS)</head><p>With a sharp increase of latency-sensitive services and applications in IoT domain, a demand for higher speed transmission is required on the Internet. Based on an analytic report from the Cisco Visual Networking Index 2017-2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[153]</ref>, the monthly volume of the world's Internet traffic exceeds 200 and 396 exabytes in 2019 and 2022 respectively. Similarly, the estimated volume of video/voice traffic in 2019 and 2022 will reach 77%, and 82% of the total Internet traffic respectively. To meet the traffic demands of such huge volumes, an efficient use of the available resources such as bandwidth, frequency slot of an Elastic Optical Network (EON), and memory capacity of a datacentre are of a high importance. It is reported that improper treatment of network traffic effectively impacts the survivability of the network and the QoS requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref>. IoT is tightly coupled with the Internet and their traffic go through the same medium. Meeting QoS requirements guarantee the services and applications continue serving. Network Traffic Classification is a significant component for infrastructure management that ensures the quality of service. There are still plenty rooms for improving QoS in IoT using traffic classification methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.2">Scalability</head><p>IoT is well known for its huge scale deployment. Such a huge scale generates enormous data not only in a large volume, but also in various forms, values, velocity, and veracity which implies the definition of Gig Data <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[155]</ref>. The bid data generated by sensors, actuators, IoT gadgets, smartphones and more are converted to a network packet that are further deeply analysed. An example of the challenge caused by this huge scale of data is the prediction of possible intrusion attacks. Essentially, the efficient functioning of a NIDS highly depends on the continuous collection of traffic data and learning their characteristics on the fly. However, the continuous collection of Big Data will lead to significant system challenges to implementing machine learning frameworks. Currently, there are a number of tools such as Hadoop, Spark, and more, that lighten the process of Big Data analysis. However, these tools require a scalable environment to run the machine learning frameworks and the process of data analysis in a real-time manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.3">Standardization</head><p>IoT involves many technologies across multiple industries. The number of IoT devices including M2M and non-M2M devices are increasing in an exponential fashion. For example, a small home network may contain more than a hundred connected IoT devices. Hence, standardization of IoT devices and protocols is of significant importance. The scope of standardization ranges from communicating layer standard organization (i.e. ISTF, IEEE) to application layer standardization (i.e. ETSI, CoRE). These standards not only profit from organizations and vendors, but also many applications and services such as network traffic classification benefit from them. For example, IETF is motivating vendors to develop formal specifications of the intended purpose of their IoT devices, in the form of a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), so that their network behaviour in any operating environment can be locked down and verified rigorously <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[84]</ref>. Therefore, a fast and universal standard realization is highly required in order to develop a globally agreed and common end-to-end specification for realizing both use cases and architecture principles of IoT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.4">Up-to-date traffic pattern</head><p>A periodic update of traffic patterns is highly required for specific applications in IoT traffic classification. For example, an IDS classifies network traffic through observing the network traffic to detect any abnormality in the traffic patterns. The process of periodically updating traffic patterns is significant in terms of detecting malicious traffic. This is because some illegitimate traffic is able to take control of new masks in a short while; therefore, traffic pattern update needs to be done swiftly <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[156]</ref>. The same issue is feasible for other scenarios such as smart homes/ factories, water supply systems attacks, etc. User authentication model is also at risk using IoT traffic classification where a fake user can mask the traffic signature of the original user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Open Issues</head><p>Although traffic classification has been widely accepted as a pervasive practice in many organisations and applications, it is still immature in IoT domain. There are several existing issues that are yet to be opened which cause more challenges continue to emerge. In this section, some of the open research issues are addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1">Smart Home IoT vulnerabilities</head><p>IoT devices are seen as a possible target or source of multiple types of cyber-attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[157]</ref>. An important security challenge is the accessibility of information as well as the availability of the resource for communication. However, accessibility and availability can be disturbed by attacks such as DDoS.</p><p>IoT devices can be grouped into two categories based on the management of the smart home environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[158]</ref>. The first group is locally managed devices which comprises the devices that connected to a local network. These devices are accessible within their native network where the smart home device resides. The second one is the remotely managed devices in which the devices are connected to the Internet of an external network. As these devices can be accessed from the Internet, the risks associated with the Internet are also increasing. Security vulnerabilities in smart home devices not only attract hackers to disturb the functionality of these devices, but also motivate them to hijack and use devices as the DDOS botnet in a large-scale network. An example is the Mirai botnet attack in 2016 that took advantage of those unprotected IoT devices by scanning the internet for open telnet port with default usernames and passwords to access and succeed to control more than a hundred thousand of IoT devices. Those infected devices are later used to generate DDoS traffic attacking the targeted victim. In this regard, novel solutions are needed to reduce the number of devices without such security that could potentially lead to more dangerous attacks like Mirai in the future. A better understanding of the nature and characteristics of the traffic generated by smart home IoT device is necessary for early detection and prevention against an attack generated by such devices. Currently, there are no researches aimed at identifying characteristics of exclusively MTC traffic that generate smart home IoT devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2">Smart City</head><p>The study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> reported that smart cities traffic data is more challenging compared to smart home or industry IoT applications. First, the data traffic scale is bigger because there are larger numbers of users and IoT devices. Second, with a variety of services offered, data flows transferred between devices become more diverse. Third, traffic attacks come from many sources and with more complex malware traffic that uses the obfuscation technique to make them be invisible. All these reasons include the complexity of data traffic and the differences in fine details of smart cities, which impose a major challenge on the classification of traffic in various scenarios. However, to date, no specific data from smart city traffic is publicly available for the purpose of understanding the characteristics and a real-world case study. Thus, a dataset of the traffic trace of smart city without neglecting any area must be developed that covers all the perspectives in smart city characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.3">IoT traffic classification</head><p>It is comprehended that IoT traffic nowadays comprises various types of behaviour such as communication types, events, source, pattern, shapes, loads, volumes, etc. Different from the past, M2M devices are not limited to small sensor communications. In fact, IoT includes every object with communication functionality and connectivity. Even newly in the case of generated traffic by M2M devices, the variance of the number of sessions that are started every day is seen extremely higher than in smartphones <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This indicates a significant impact on traffic patterns as well as management and control. Thus, the behaviour of M2M can generate different characteristics, depending on the number and type of devices that are active in the network. With this consideration, one would take a precise set of traffic features of IoT to design a robust and reliable solution that addresses specific demands such as security, analysis, discovery, energy-saving and QoS concerns. Besides, considering a necessary set of objectives such as self-adaptability, cost-efficiency, and hardware independency, new researches and further solutions is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.4">Dataset</head><p>Traffic source is an essential part of a study's evaluation in terms of effectiveness and performance. Current public datasets are mostly provided for conventional networks with a shallow consideration toward specific features or infrastructures. Recently, the domain of traffic classification studies in IoT has dramatically increased. Studies are targeting specific objectives, new features, and different characteristics. Generally, publishing a real traffic trace can reveal security policies and privacy issues of users and organisations. As a result, a vast portion of the studies implemented either an out-dated dataset or a synthetic dataset generated by a lab testbed/incomprehensive use case. Therefore, finding a valid dataset that specifically targets an IoT domain is quite bothersome if not impossible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>This paper surveyed recent works in the field of traffic classification in the IoT domain. With the emergence of the IoT concept, various types of devices are being connected to each other. IoT devices compromise a wide range of diversities in types including portable, static, implantable, wearable devices etc. Motivated by the rise of new traffic patterns and the diversity in MTM/HTC characteristics, it is understood that IoT traffic nature is dissimilar to the conventional network traffic. Therefore, traffic classification in the IoT domain is more challenging in comparison with non-IoT domain. This is because, in IoT domain, the diversity of devices and its heterogeneity are extremely higher than in the non-IoT domain. Although the main concerns in traffic classification are security and QoS issues, new concerns and domains are newly emerging such as smart cities and even low-cost communication in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In this paper, we discussed the characteristics of the IoT network traffic and distinguished it from the human traffic patterns. A light-weight overview of traffic classification models was presented for a smooth transition to IoT traffic classification. We presented a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art IoT traffic classification in the context of application and architecture in IoT. From the review, it is understood that the major focus of the studies in IoT traffic classification is toward security concerns. Finally, we highlighted current challenges and possible future direction in IoT traffic network traffic classification. It is worth mentioning here that traffic classification research in IoT is still in its infancy stage and is yet to be tested in a real environment under realistic evaluations and datasets. Developing a dataset from real-world use cases and devices is highly required to maturase and realising traffic classification researches in IoT.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 current traffic monitoring methodologies that are employed for traffic classification</figDesc></figure>
