			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A methodology to retrieve soil moisture (SM) from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data is presented. The method uses a neural network (NN) to find the statistical relationship linking the input data to a reference SM data set. The input data are composed of passive microwaves (L-band SMOS brightness temperatures, T b 's) complemented with active microwaves (C-band Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) backscattering coefficients), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The reference SM data used to train the NN are the European Centre For Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model predictions. The best configuration of SMOS data to retrieve SM using an NN is using T b 's measured with both H and V polarizations for incidence angles from 25 • to 60 • . The inversion of SM can be improved by ∼10% by adding MODIS NDVI and ASCAT backscattering data and by an additional ∼5% by using local information on the maximum and minimum records of SMOS Tb's (or ASCAT backscattering coefficients) and the associated SM values. The NN-inverted SM is able to capture the temporal and spatial variability of the SM reference data set. The temporal variability is better captured when either adding active microwaves or using a local normalization of SMOS Tb's. The NN SM products have been evaluated against in situ measurements, giving results of comparable or better (for some NN configurations) quality to other SM products. The NN used in this paper allows to retrieve SM globally on a daily basis. These results open interesting perspectives such as a near-real-time processor and data assimilation in weather prediction models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>as it affects the water and energy exchanges at the land surface/atmosphere interface and it is the reservoir of water for agriculture and vegetation in general. Surface soil moisture (hereafter SM) is also a key parameter for hydrological models as it controls important processes such as runoff and it is an important parameter to monitor for flood risk evaluation.</p><p>The thermal emission of the Earth at low microwave frequencies (L-band, i.e., 1.4 GHz) depends essentially on the soil temperature and the amount of soil moisture. The brightness temperature decreases as the amount of soil moisture increases. Therefore, the soil moisture content can be derived from microwave observations at these frequencies. A passive L-band radiometer presents the advantage with respect to active systems at higher frequencies that the measurement is less sensitive to soil roughness and vegetation. This is the concept of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which is the first mission specifically designed to perform remote sensing measurements of soil moisture and ocean salinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The SMOS soil moisture operational algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is based on a direct or forward model and an optimal estimation approach: A model of the soil physics and the radiation transfer through the vegetation is used to simulate L-band brightness temperatures (hereafter T b 's) for a set of physical parameters, soil composition, and moisture content and vegetation opacity. The modeled T b 's are compared to those measured by SMOS. The SM content and the vegetation opacity can be estimated using an iterative process to minimize the difference of the model output with respect to the observations. This type of iterative solution using a direct model is said to be local because an independent minimization process needs to be performed for each new observation.</p><p>The second approach is finding an inverse model that provides SM values directly from a given set of measured T b 's. Neural networks (NNs) are an efficient mathematical method to obtain such an inverse model. In contrast to the direct model approach discussed earlier, an inverse model using NNs is a global method that aims at building an inverse model at once using a relatively large number of observations, instead of applying a direct model for each new observation.</p><p>NNs have been successfully applied to many inverse problems in the remote sensing field such as the retrieval of atmospheric <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, ocean <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and continental surface parameters such as surface heat fluxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. NNs have also been applied to retrieve soil moisture at small scale from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or radiometric <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> observations. These studies are devoted to agricultural fields or to the watershed scale, and the NNs were trained with simulated T b 's or backscattering coefficients using radiative transfer and backscattering models. NNs have been compared to other methods such as the Bayesian approach or the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. It has been found that all of those methods give similar results but the NNs are faster <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The potential of this approach has also been studied to retrieve SM from Sentinel-1 SAR observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Recently, radiative transfer models have been discussed as a possible approach to train NNs to retrieve SM from SMAP observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>A different approach is to use in situ measurements of SM as reference to train the NNs. This approach has been used to link a total of 3000 T b measurements obtained with the AMSR-E radiometer with in situ measurements of SM in Mongolia and Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The trained NN has been applied to one AMSR-E pointing in the north of Italy and compared to in situ measurements in a 100-km 2 area. Some preliminary results on the use of such an approach to invert Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data trained with in situ measurements in 75 sites have been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Of course, the problem to train an NN with in situ measurements is that they are point measurements while radiometers or scatterometers in space have typical footprints of 50 × 50 km 2 . In addition, there are not available in situ measurements all over the globe to ensure that the training data set is statistically significant to perform global inversions once the NN is trained.</p><p>An alternative approach is to use global land surface model (LSM) simulations as reference data to train the NNs. This is an efficient method to merge multisensor observations and LSM outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, it uses the synergies of the different sensors and gives better results that a posteriori merging of the retrievals is done independently with each sensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Several works have used this approach to study the retrieval of SM from remote sensing data at global scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Those works used active microwaves backscattering from the ERS satellite (5.3 GHz), passive microwave brightness temperatures in horizontal and vertical polarizations for a single incidence angle at <ref type="bibr">19.35</ref> GHz by SSM/I, NDVI from AVHRR, and skin temperature from the ISCCP project. The NNs were trained with different surface physics models forced with numerical weather prediction models. The statistical model based on NN can be applied to check the consistency of the surface model and as the basis for variational assimilation of satellite observations into a numerical surface model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The NN gives the most likely output for the set of input data, and it can effectively change soil moisture toward more correct values <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. A study of this method as a strategy to retrieve SM monthly averages has been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The development of an NN retrieval scheme that works globally on a daily basis is difficult, and it relies on the use of multiple sources of information (vegetation information, multiwavelength observations, etc.). In this paper, we have used NNs to retrieve SM from SMOS brightness temperatures (T b 's) complemented with ASCAT backscattering coefficients, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI, and ECOCLIMAP soil texture maps. SMOS is the first radiometer in space with full-polarization and multiangular capabilities. Therefore, a dedicated retrieval scheme has to be studied. Following the approach discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which has been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the reference SM data set used to train the NNs comes from the LSM model of a numerical weather prediction model. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model has been selected as it includes accurate surface physics and estimations of the SM in the 0-7-cm depth layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The ECMWF IFS model is already used by the SMOS SM retrieval operational algorithm to initialize SM before the minimization process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Two preliminary studies using simulated SMOS data before the launch of the satellite were done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The first one was devoted to the use of NNs to measure the sea surface salinity, and the second one was devoted to the retrieval of SM. To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to use NNs to retrieve SM from actual SMOS data.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the different data sets used in this paper. Works that used NNs to retrieve SM globally before the launch of SMOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> have used NNs to do a nonlinear mapping from an input space of low dimension (typically 1-5) to the 1-D output space (SM). SMOS works in full polarization mode and for wide ranges of incidence angles from 0 • to ∼60 • . Therefore, even working with angle-binned data, only using SMOS, the dimension of the input space can be as high as 24 (12 angle bins of 5 • width per polarization), many more than that of any other NN scheme to retrieve SM discussed in the literature. Thus, it is important to start with a sensitivity analysis of the different data sets to SM and to adopt a good strategy of dimensionality reduction. This is presented in Section III. A discussion of the NN approach can be found in Section IV, while the results are presented in Section V. The evaluation of the NN SM retrieval is discussed in Section VI in comparison with ECMWF SM, in situ measurements, and previous NN retrievals. Finally, Section VII summarizes the conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. DATA</head><p>This section describes the different data sets used in this paper. The goal is to construct a database to train the NNs by collocating a data set of geophysical variables, including a reliable SM estimate with real SMOS observations and other complementary data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. SMOS Data</head><p>As already mentioned, SMOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> measures the thermal emission from the Earth at a frequency of 1.4 GHz in full polarization and for incidence angles from 0 • to ∼60 • . SMOS has 69 antennas with a diameter of 16.5 cm distributed in a Y-shaped structure with 4.5-m long arms to perform interferometry and synthesize an aperture of ∼7.5 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The satellite is tilted by 32.5 • . The projection of the synthesized beam on the Earth surface is, in general, an ellipse whose axis ratio and orientation depend on the observed point position. The field of view, defined as the projection of the full width at half maximum of the synthesized beam over land, changes from ∼30 to 50 km, and it is 43 km on average over the field of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The satellite follows a sun-synchronous polar orbit with a 6:00 A.M./P.M. equator overpass time (with 6:00 A.M. being the local solar time at the ascending node). To retrieve SM from SMOS T b 's using NNs, one would like to use brightness temperatures with the more straightforward physical interpretation, i.e., in the Earth polarization reference frame. In addition, as an NN should have as input a vector of constant length, it is needed to work with fixed angle bins. Therefore, we have used the Level 3 Brightness Temperature (L3TB) from the Centre Aval de Traitement des Données SMOS (CATDS). The L3TB product <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> is a daily global brightness temperature data set in a 0.25 • EASE grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> obtained from the L1B product <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. It includes all the T b 's acquired in a given day, transformed to the ground polarization reference frame (horizontal, H, and vertical, V, polarizations), and averaged within 5 • -width incidence angle bins. The center of the first angle bin is 2.5 • . Ascending and descending orbits are processed separately.</p><p>As the satellite progresses, any given location on the Earth's surface is "seen" a number of times at different incidence angles, depending on the location with respect to the satellite subtrack: The further away, the fewer the angular acquisitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the number of T b measurements (in H polarization) as a function of the incidence angle and the distance to the satellite subtrack (parameter Xswath) for a subset of L3TB data. Along track, a wide range of angles is obtained (0 to 60 • ). On the opposite, the only angle range that it is accessible all across the swath is from 40 • to 45 • .</p><p>The database constructed for this project also contains information from the CATDS L3 User Data Product <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, such as the SM obtained by the SMOS operational algorithm (hereafter SMOS L3SM), and the probability of having a radio frequency interference (RFI) at a given position (parameter RFI_Prob).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. ASCAT Data</head><p>The Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) is a real aperture radar operating at 5.255 GHz (C-band) on board EUMETSAT's Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellite <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. MetOp is in a sun-synchronous orbit, with equator crossing times of approximately 21:30 local time for the ascending overpass and 09:30 for the descending overpass. ASCAT uses fan-beam antennas that cover two 550-km swaths which are separated from the satellite ground track by about ∼336 km. ASCAT measures the backscattered radiation at incidence angles from 25 • to 65 • .</p><p>Passive and active microwaves have different sensitivity to SM, vegetation, and roughness. In the case of SMOS and ASCAT, the observing frequency is also different. Thus, AS-CAT data are a potentially useful data set to complement SMOS in the framework of NN inversions. However, in order to use ASCAT as input to the NNs, a preprocessing step is necessary to interpolate the backscatter coefficients to the single constant incidence angle. The adopted preprocessing scheme is inspired from the processing chain of the ERS and ASCAT SM products <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The reference incidence angle has been chosen to be 40 • as it is in the middle of the observed incidence angle range <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The relationship between backscatter and incidence angle is linear over a large range of angles; therefore, the angle interpolation has been done using a linear regression. The time window used to compute the regression has to be large enough to ensure the robustness of the regression while ensuring that the surface conditions other than SM (particularly the vegetation, which affects the slope) remain nearly constant. As a good compromise, the time window has been chosen to be seven days, ending the day one wants to estimate the backscattering coefficient for an incidence angle (θ) of 40 • (hereafter σ 40 ). The slope of the line fitted to the points is determined in the data of this window. In general, the fitted line does not go through the backscattering coefficient measured for the time t of interest (which has been acquired at a variable angle from 25 • to 65 • ). Therefore, a line with the same slope but containing the measurement at time t is computed. This is the line used to estimate σ 40 . In summary, the seven-day window is used to compute the slope of the σ(θ) function, but the actual line used to compute σ 40 is shifted to take into account the backscattering at time t, which depends mainly on the SM content. For many grid points, the backscatter coefficient can be measured several times per day at different incidence angles, both in ascending and descending overpasses. A σ 40 is computed from each σ value. Finally, the different values are averaged to obtain a daily estimation of σ 40 .</p><p>The more elaborated processing discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> computes not only the slope but also the curvature of the σ(θ) function. In addition, data from several years are used to reduce the uncertainties in the σ 40 estimates by computing averaged values for a particular period of the year. However, Sections V and VI show that the simpler ASCAT data processing discussed in this paper is enough to show the complementarity of passive and active microwaves to retrieve SM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. ECMWF Models</head><p>The ECMWF products used in this work are operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) models with the "Hydrology-improved Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land" (H-TESSEL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. A significant improvement of H-TESSEL took place on November 9, 2010 with the addition of the following: 1) a simplified extended Kalman filter for the global operational soil moisture analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>; 2) a new snow analysis based on NESDIS snow cover data at a 4-km resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>; and 3) a monthly varying climatology of leaf area index (LAI) based on MODIS data <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Therefore, in this paper, only data from November 9, 2010 have been used.</p><p>The original ECMWF IFS products used in this paper have a native resolution of ∼25 km <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> similar to that of the CATDS grid. They have been resampled to the CATDS EASE grid and temporally interpolated to the time of the SMOS acquisitions for ascending and descending orbits (the IFS products have a temporal sampling of 3 h). We will use the volumetric moisture content in the first layer (0-7-cm depth; hereafter ECMWF SM L1 ) of these models as reference or target SM to train the NNs. In addition, we have used the snow depth and the soil temperature in the first layer to filter out regions with snow or frozen soils.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. MODIS NDVI</head><p>The SMOS signal is affected by the vegetation water content. In addition, the presence and amount of vegetation is correlated with SM in many ecosystems. Therefore, a vegetation index could improve the SM retrieval, as it has been found in previous works using other satellite observations and a similar methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Here, the MODIS NDVI product MYD13C1 has been used. The MODIS NDVI product contains atmospherically corrected bidirectional surface reflectances masked for water, clouds, and cloud shadows. Global MYD13C1 data are cloud-free spatial composites of the gridded 16-day 1-km MYD13A2 and are provided as a level-3 product projected on a 0.05 • geographic Climate Modeling Grid. Cloud-free global coverage is achieved by replacing clouds with the historical MODIS time series climatology record.</p><p>A zero-order spatial interpolation of the 0.05 • MODIS grid to the 0.25 • CATDS grid has been done. In addition, the 16-day MODIS NDVI value for a given grid point is assigned to that point for the previous 8 days and the following 7 days, without any temporal interpolation. This approach presents the advantage of giving a rough estimate of the vegetation characteristics without imposing strong constraints, for instance, in an operational context. It will be seen in the following that the introduction of such information actually improves significantly the SM retrieval (see Section V).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Wetlands</head><p>With the emissivity of water being typically half of that of dry soil, the brightness temperatures measured by SMOS over water bodies are significantly lower than those measured over soil, even with a high SM content. Big water bodies are filtered using land-water masks. The problem is dealing with inundated areas. If the SMOS pixel is completely covered by free water, the point is easily filtered out using T b thresholds (see Section III-A). For the pixels partially inundated, the situation is more complex. Therefore, in order to have a clean data set to train the NNs, it is pertinent to introduce information on wetland extension on the database.</p><p>There are several wetland extension data sets such as the NASA JPL Wetland Extent database <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The last two ones have been extensively validated at global scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, but the GLWD is a static data set without temporal variation estimations. Therefore, we have used the GIEMS monthly averages of wetland extensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Texture</head><p>Soil texture is fundamental information when dealing with SM as, for instance, the emissivity of a sand or clay soil with the same volumetric SM will be very different (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>). This is a consequence of the soil microphysics as, even if the total volumetric soil moisture is the same, there would be many more free water molecules in a sandy soil that will absorb the Earth thermal radiation, reducing the emissivity and the observed T b 's. Therefore, giving texture information to the NN can be important in particular to achieve good retrievals for intermediate values of SM, as those values can be easily measured in soils with a variety of textures. Therefore, the sand and clay fractions from the ECOCLIMAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> soil texture maps have been added to the database. This is the same texture information that is used by the SMOS L2 and L3 algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DATA ANALYSIS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Time Period and Data Filtering</head><p>The data sets presented in Section II have been compiled from Nov 9, 2010 (ECMWF models with improved surface physics, see above) to December 31, 2012. From this data set, we have extracted a subset to perform a sensitivity analysis and the training of the NNs. The subset samples one full year from two from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012 to capture the year cycle. During this period, one day over four is kept for the analysis. For each selected day, the subset only contains one grid point every two in latitude and longitude, reducing the total number of points by a factor of 4. Grid cells with a latitude higher than 75 • or lower than -60 • or corresponding to water bodies are excluded. Points with frozen soil (soil temperature in the first layer of ECMWF models lower than a threshold of 274 K) or covered by snow (as predicted by ECMWF models) at a given time are also filtered out. The data subset does not include points for which the monthly average wetland fraction is higher than 10%. Regarding the SMOS data, grid cells with a cumulative probability of the presence of RFI higher than 20% or with T b 's lower than 50 K or higher than 400 K are filtered out. Finally, grid cells corresponding to sites of the USDA-NRCS SCAN network (USA) are also removed from this subset as these sites will be used to perform independent a posteriori tests of the NN retrieval performance (see Section VI-D).</p><p>The distribution of SM in the filtered subset is relatively uniform from 0 to ∼0.5 m 3 /m 3 except for the values close to zero. In contrast, there is a small number of points with very high SM values from 0.53 to 0.8 m 3 /m 3 that correspond to peat soils in the arctic regions during northern summer. Those organic soils with SM values of 0.53-0.8 m 3 /m 3 can de facto  be considered as inundated wetlands, and the number of these points is less than 1% of the total number of points. Therefore, they have been filtered out.</p><p>The total number of points in the training subset having simultaneously well-defined SMOS T b 's for incidence angles from 0 to 60 • , ASCAT σ 40 , MODIS NDVI, and ECMWF SM 1 is ∼10 5 . This number increases by a factor of 3.4 if only SMOS incidence angles from 25 • to 60 • are requested as the swath that can be used is wider (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Sensitivity to Soil Moisture</head><p>In order to better understand the sensitivity of SMOS T b 's and other observables to SM, the filtered data subset has been used to compute the Pearson correlation coefficients (R) of those observables with respect to ECMWF SM 1 . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> show the results.</p><p>1) SMOS Brightness Temperatures: The correlation of SMOS T b 's and ECMWF SM 1 is globally low both for H and V polarizations (blue and red circles, respectively). The correlation increases (in absolute value) for V polarization for increasing incidence angles up to |R| = 0.61. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> also shows the correlations of other quantities derived from SMOS T b 's such as the T b 's divided by the soil temperature of the first layer of ECMWF model predictions (blue and red crosses for H and V polarizations, respectively), which are an approximation to the soil emissivity. Nevertheless, the correlation with SM is very close to that of the T b 's. The correlation of the normalized polarization difference ((</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T H b -T V b )/(T H b + T V b )</formula><p>, black diamonds) shows a positive correlation with SM, but the absolute values are not higher than those obtained for the T b 's alone. The relatively low correlation coefficients discussed earlier imply that a careful selection of the best set of SMOS T b 's is needed to ensure a good retrieval using NNs.</p><p>2) Other Physical Magnitudes: In addition to SMOS T b 's, the correlation of other physical magnitudes with respect to ECMWF SM 1 is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. The correlation of the soil temperature and the soil sand and clay fractions with ECMWF SM 1 is lower than 0.5. The clay fraction is positively correlated with SM because water molecules are captured within the clay. The sand fraction is negatively correlated with the SM content in the first few centimeters of soil (where the thermal emission from the Earth detected by SMOS comes from) because sand favors infiltration. In contrast, the correlation of the daily estimate of ASCAT σ 40 and SM is 0.62, and that of MODIS NDVI with SM is 0.80. This high value is partly due to the high seasonal patterns present both in NDVI and SM in some regions of the globe, as shown, for instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>3 ) of the T b 's in the time series for a given grid point (i, j) are computed. Then, at a time t, the index I 1 is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">I 1 (t, i, j) = T b (t, i, j) -T min b (i, j) T max b (i, j) -T min b (i, j) . (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>This computation is not a trivial normalization of the brightness temperatures globally because it is done independently for each grid point. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the correlation of the index I 1 with respect to ECMWF SM 1 for each incidence angle (blue and red triangles for H and V polarizations, respectively). In contrast to the original T b 's, the correlation of the I 1 index with SM is almost independent of the incidence angle with a value of ∼-0.4.</p><p>The index I 1 can be used to define a new index I 2 using the SM values at each grid point (i, j) at the time when T b reaches its minimum SM T min b (i, j) and maximum SM T max b (i, j) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I 2 (t, i, j) = SM T min b (i, j) + SM T max b (i, j) -SM T min b (i, j) × I 1 (t, i, j).</formula><p>As I 1 , the index I 2 is computed for each incidence angle bin and polarization at the time t of the SMOS acquisition.</p><p>The information content of index I 2 is very strong as it contains local information on the dynamic ranges of both the measured T b 's and the model SM. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the correlation R of the index I 2 with respect to ECMWF SM 1 for each incidence angle (blue and red squares for H and V polarizations, respectively). Like index I 1 , the correlation of index I 2 with SM is almost independent of the incidence angle. In contrast, correlation increases up to values of 0.90-0.92. Table I also shows the correlation with ECMWF SM 1 of the locally normalized index I 2 computed with ASCAT σ 40 (I σ 40  2 ), which is also very high (0.87).</p><p>The definition of indexes I 1 and I 2 is inspired by the socalled "change detection" approach used for SM retrieval with ERS and ASCAT scatterometer data <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. However, one should bear in mind that, in this paper, the indexes I 1 and I 2 are just local normalizations. In contrast, the ASCAT SM retrieval is not a mere scaling between dry and wet soil conditions as done by index I 1 but also corrects for vegetation effects. In addition, the ASCAT SM retrieval does not use modeled SM data as reference as used for calculating index I 2 . Instead, dry and wet reference values are estimated by analyzing several years of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Nevertheless, as discussed earlier, these simple normalization indexes can be used to improve the performances of the NN retrieval (see also Section V).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. METHOD: NNS</head><p>Multilayer feedforward NNs are universal approximators <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and a very efficient method to find a function linking a set of input data to SM. In particular, the NN approach can exploit the synergy of different instruments due to its truly multivariate nature and its nonlinear capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. It has been shown that the NN is able to exploit complex interactions among the satellite data so that combining a priori the satellite information into the retrieval scheme gives better results than a posteriori combination of individually retrieved products <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The feedforward network used in this work has two layers. Many tests were done to determine the optimal architecture, the transfer functions, and the minimization algorithms. Above 5-7 neurons in the hidden layer (depending on the dimension of the input vector), the results do not improve anymore and remain constant up to 20 neurons. Using an NN with three layers (two hidden layers) does not improve the results. This is in agreement with Cybenko <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, who showed that a network with a single layer of sigmoid functions can approximate any continuous function. Using a logarithmic-sigmoid function or a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function (tansig) gives results in perfect agreement. Several minimization algorithms were tested, finding no differences except in computing time; therefore, the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm was preferred. The low sensitivity of the results to those parameters is due to the large statistics in the training database, which contains more than 3 10 5 vectors. Therefore, the results shown in the following have been obtained with ten nodes or neurons in the hidden layer and with tansig transfer functions. The second layer is composed of a single node with a linear function. For each neuron in the first layer, the input vector (including a unity element, the bias) is multiplied by a vector of weights using a scalar product. The activation functions associated to each neuron are applied to those scalars. The operation is repeated for the second layer. The vector containing the outputs of the first layer of neurons plus a unity element is again multiplied by a vector of weights, and the linear combination is used as the input of the neuron of the second layer that is constituted of a linear function. Therefore, for an input vector of eight elements, for instance, an NN with the former structure will have a total of (8 + 1) × 10 + (10 + 1) × 1 = 101 free parameters corresponding to 10 weight vectors of 9 elements and 1 weight vector of 11 elements.   asymptotically a minimum. The effect of the weight initialization on the minimization results has been tested, finding that the effect is negligible.</p><p>Once the training is done, more independent tests have been performed using data from a period that has not been used for the NN training (November 2010 to December 2011), or for locations of in situ stations, from November 2010 to December 2012 since, as mentioned in Section III-A, data from these locations have been removed from the training data set.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Using SMOS T b 's as Input 1) Selection of SMOS T b 's:</head><p>As discussed in Section III, an appropriate selection of the incidence angles of the SMOS observations is necessary to ensure the best SM retrieval in a fraction of the swath as large as possible. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows a comparison of the SM produced by several NNs applied to ascending orbit data of the test subset (January 2012-December 2012) with respect to ECMWF SM 1 using three different metrics: the correlation coefficient (R), the root-mean-squared difference or "error" (RMSE), and the mean absolute difference or "error" (MAE). The retrieval is better using only H polarization than using only V polarization (see, for instance, results for NN inversions with seven T b 's in H polarization in the angle range from 25 • to 60 • "7Tb H 25-60" and the results for the equivalent model with T b 's in V polarization "7Tb V 25-60"). Using a combination of H and V T b 's gives better results than using just H or V T b 's alone (see, for instance, the results for NN inversions with seven T b 's in H polarization and seven T b 's in V polarization in the angle range from 25 • to 60 • "14Tb HV 25-60" and the results for the equivalent model with T b 's in V polarization "7Tb H 25-60"), which is logical as the input vector dimension increases by a factor of two. Adding the normalized polarization difference as input (NN 14Tb, 7(H-V)/(H+V)) does not improve the results.</p><p>Regarding the incidence angle range, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows the results for SM inversions obtained with different sets of input data. The retrieval performance actually improves from using H and V T b 's in the angle range from 25 • to 45 • ("8Tb HV 25-45") to 20 • -50 • ("12Tb HV 20-50") and 25 • -60 • ("14Tb HV 25-60"). In contrast, using T b 's in the 20 • -60 • range (16Tbs 20-60) does not improve the quality of the NN SM anymore, while it decreases the width of the swath in which the SM can be obtained (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Therefore, the best set of SMOS T b 's to retrieve SM using NNs is composed of seven T b 's for angle bins from 25 • to 60 • for both H and V polarizations (a total of 14 T b 's).</p><p>2) Adding Additional Data as Input: a) Soil temperature and texture: In a first approximation, the T b is the product of the soil temperature multiplied by the emissivity. Therefore, it is interesting to test the effect of adding the soil temperature as one of the input vector elements for the NN. In addition, the emissivity depends on the dielectric constant of the soil, which depends itself on soil texture (and moisture content, of course). Thus, some information on the soil texture, namely, the clay and sand fractions, can potentially improve the SM retrieval. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows the performance of the NN retrieval when adding soil temperature and texture information in addition to seven SMOS T b 's for H and V polarizations in the angle range from 25 • to 60 • . The addition of temperature or clay and sand fractions improves the correlation of SM retrieved by NN and ECMWF SM by 4% (R). Everything together improves R by 8%. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the scatterplots of SM retrieved by NN versus ECMWF SM. Interestingly, adding the sand and clay fractions breaks a bimodality that is present for intermediate SM values in the scatterplot of SM retrieved by an NN with only SMOS T b 's as input versus ECMWF SM 1 .</p><p>b) Using a vegetation index: In the presence of vegetation, the T b 's measured by SMOS will also depend on the vegetation opacity which attenuates soil radiation and depolarizes the soil signal. Therefore, some information on the vegetation estate is a potential valuable input for the NN. On the other hand, as discussed in Section III, the correlation of MODIS NDVI (with only two reference dates per month) and SM is actually very high (R ∼ 0.8), in good agreement with previous studies using other data sets at a monthly scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. This correlation comes from the global close relationship of SM and vegetation at a seasonal scale length, but of course, one cannot retrieve accurately the highly changing dynamics of surface SM (at a time scale of a few hours) using just NDVI. In contrast, NDVI helps significantly the retrieval of SM by NN, providing a good "seasonal first guess," while SMOS T b 's are instantaneous estimations of the SM content. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows that NDVI actually improves the NN retrieval by 8% (model "14Tb's, NDVI"), while the retrieval improves by 11% when adding also soil texture and temperature information (model "14Tb, NDVI, tex, T"), reaching a significantly high correlation of R = 0.9. c) Effect of adding active microwaves: NN retrievals combining active and passive microwave observations have been tested using ASCAT and SMOS data. Using jointly SMOS and ASCAT for SM retrieval at a daily scale is nontrivial since SMOS and ASCAT do not observe the same point at the same time (see Section II) and SM can change rapidly at the scale of hours. In this paper, the ASCAT active microwave information Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. SM computed by applying the trained NN to ascending orbit data of the test subset (January 2012-December 2012) versus ECMWF SM 1 . From top to bottom and from left to right: Scatterplots correspond to NNs with the following input data: "14Tbs," "14Tbs, T, tex," "14Tbs, σ 40 , tex, NDVI," and "14I 2 , I 2σ 40 " (see Section V for a detailed description of those NN retrievals). The black dashed line is the 1:1 line, and the black solid line is the regression line. The linear regression equation is given in the bottom of each panel.</p><p>has been introduced as a daily averaged value, which could damp the sensitivity to SM variations. In addition, this value will be compared to ECMWF SM 1 estimations interpolated at the time of the SMOS acquisitions. Developing an optimized multisensor retrieval is out of the scope of this paper, which is mainly devoted to SMOS. However, this relatively simple ASCAT data processing is enough to show that adding active microwaves to the retrieval can improve significantly the results (see Section VI-B). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows the results of SM retrievals using SMOS + ASCAT data. Adding ASCAT improves the SM retrieval by 5% (R). Adding NDVI and soil clay and sand fractions increases R up to 0.91. In this case, adding the soil temperature to the input vector does not improve the performance of the retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>d) Using local information on the T b dynamic range: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows the results of NN retrievals using index I 1 . Adding this index to the input vector increases the correlation of NN SM and ECMWF SM 1 from R = 0.80 (model "14Tb's") to R = 0.83 (model "14Tb's, I 1 "). Adding the vegetation index, the correlation increases to R = 0.88. Adding the soil tex-ture information, the correlation increases to R = 0.90, which equals the highest value obtained without I 1 . In this case, adding the soil temperature to the input vector does not add any information. The advantages of a retrieval "14Tb's,I 1 , NDVI, tex" with respect to "14Tb's, NDVI, tex, T" is that it only needs two remote sensing data sets (daily SMOS data and an NDVI estimation every 15 days) and static texture information. Therefore, once the NN is trained, using model "14Tb, I 1 , NDVI, tex," the SM can be retrieved without ECMWF data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Using Local Information on the T b 's and SM Dynamic Range</head><p>As discussed in Section III, local information on the T b 's and SM dynamic range can be used to define the index I 2 , which becomes the physical magnitude that shows the highest correlation with ECMWF SM 1 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Of course, this is logical as, in this case, the NN gets as input some information on the SM magnitude that should be retrieved. Since the linear correlations of I 2 and SM are very high, it is likely that using I 2 the NN does not need as many input elements as the NN using T b 's as input. Even using only one angle bin for the two polarizations ("2I 2 HV40-45"), the correlation coefficient R obtained applying the trained NN to the ascending orbit data of the test subset (January 2012-December 2012) is already higher than 0.9 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>). In addition, such retrieval methodology would allow to retrieve SM for the whole SMOS swath. Correlation increases when adding more I 2 indexes for other angle bins up to four angle bins in the range 25 • -45 • and two polarizations ("8I 2 HV25-45" input). Using more angle bins reduces the RMSE without an increase of R. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref> shows the result for two polarizations and seven angle bins, 14I 2 , which is the equivalent configuration to that giving the best results when using T b 's. Using 8I 2 and NDVI, the retrieval still improves by ∼1%. The same score (R = 0.94) is also obtained with "14I 2 , I 2 σ 40 ." When using index I 2 , adding the soil temperature and even the soil texture to the input vector does not add any information with respect to the previous models. This is because the I 2 index contains implicitly this information from the local SM values for the extreme T b 's. Ideally, computing local extreme T b 's and the associated SM values should be done in a period as long as possible to have robust results. In this paper, the extreme values have been computed using 2.5 years of data. The effect of using a shorter period has also been tested. When computing the extreme values using only one year of data, the global correlation obtained for a given NN configuration decreases by ∼2%.</p><p>The advantage of using I 2 is that it allows to perform good retrievals even with a small number of observables given as input to the NN and that it gives the best results in terms of quality metrics with respect to the reference SM data set. The disadvantage is that potential errors in the local SM time series extreme values used to compute index I 2 will be easily replicated in the NN retrieval. In contrast, when not using any SM information as input to the NN, the nonlinear regression done during the NN training makes the NN less sensible to outliers in the reference SM data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Reference NN Retrievals: Maps</head><p>Five of the best NN models have been selected to perform further evaluation of different SM retrievals using NNs. Those retrievals are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>. The retrieval NNSM 1 uses as input similar information to that used by the SMOS L3 opera-tional algorithm: SMOS T b 's, soil texture and temperature, and a vegetation index (NDVI for NNSM 1 and LAI for SMOS L3). Retrieval NNSM 2 also uses the local normalized T b 's (I 1 ) in addition to SMOS T b 's and NDVI. Retrieval NNSM 3 also uses ASCAT data as input. Finally, retrievals NNSM 4 and NNSM 5 use the change detection approach with SMOS I 2 indexes and NDVI (NNSM 4 ) or I 2 σ 40 (NNSM 5 ). In addition, the best retrieval using only SMOS data as input (NNSM 6 ) has also been selected in order to compare its performances with those using the multisensor approach.</p><p>The Level 3 CATDS SMOS products are divided in ascending (equator overpass at 6 A.M.) and descending (6 P.M.) half orbits. The reason is that sources of RFI are often directional and they affect differently morning and evening overpasses. In addition, the evaluation of SMOS products against in situ measurements has shown different results for morning and evening overpasses (see also Section VI-D and references therein). Therefore, in this paper, data from ascending and descending orbits are also processed independently.</p><p>The reference NN retrievals have been applied to SMOS data from descending orbits instead of data from ascending orbits such as those presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>. The NN retrieval quality is comparable (within 1%) to that using ascending orbits.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows an example of the retrieval NNSM 2 for ascending and descending orbits on August 22, 2011 and the corresponding ECMWF SM 1 . In addition, the lower panels of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> show the monthly average of SM obtained with the retrieval NNSM 5 for July 2010 and the corresponding average of ECMWF SM 1 . The NN retrievals reproduce the main spatial structures of the ECMWF SM 1 data set. The most significant differences in this example are the drier soil predicted by the NN retrieval in western USA, central Asia, and Australia. In addition, the NN retrieval predicts somewhat wetter soil in the Sahara desert borders.</p><p>From the input-data/SM relationship learned globally and over a long time period during the training phase, the NN gives the most likely SM value for a given set of input data <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Even if the NN has been trained with ECMWF SM 1 , the NN output over a given region at a given time does not necessarily equal the ECMWF SM 1 value because the retrieval is driven by the remotely sensed data. In the case shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, taking into account the global input-data/SM relationship learned by the NN, the ECMWF SM 1 values in the western USA, central Asia, Australia, and the Sahara border are not the most likely SM values. At least in the USA, the values predicted by the NNSM retrieval can actually be a statistical correction of ECMWF estimates, as other studies have already shown that ECMWF models are, on average, too wet in the west of the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Temporal Correlation</head><p>In order to get further insight on the ability of the NN with different input data to capture the temporal and spatial variability of the reference ECMWF SM product, it is pertinent to compute temporal (R temp ) and spatial correlations (R spa ) of the NN products with respect to the SM used as reference. This approach has already been used in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The temporal correlation is defined as the Pearson correlation of the NN SM and ECMWF SM 1 time series of each grid point. R temp has only been computed if the time series for the whole period of this study contains more than 30 points. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows maps of R temp for the different retrievals. First, there exist regions with negative correlation such as the Sahara region. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> shows the variance of the ECMWF SM 1 time series for each grid point. There are clear similarities between the variance and the R temp maps, showing that regions with negative R temp are those where the variance of the local time series is very low. In addition, in this arid region, the SM content is also very low. Therefore, the relative uncertainties of the different SM estimations are very high. This makes that, when comparing two different SM products over these areas, the correlation is low in absolute value and can even be negative.</p><p>It is interesting to note that there are significant differences for the different NNSM retrievals that were not obvious in the global correlations shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">V</ref> shows the average R temp computed for each of the maps in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Both for retrievals using SMOS T b 's or the change detection approach, those with a better ability to capture the temporal dynamics of the ECMWF SM 1 data are those that include active microwave data as input (NNSM 3 and NNSM 5 , respectively). This is in agreement with previous studies that already pointed out the good performance of active microwave data to capture the soil moisture temporal variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. However, it is worth noting that the passive microwave ability to capture the temporal variability can be similar to those of active microwaves when using the local normalization of SMOS T b 's (index I 1 ) in addition to the T b 's themselves as input to the NN (retrieval NNSM 2 , Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">V</ref>). Even retrieval NNSM 6 , using only SMOS T b 's and I 1 , shows a better ability to capture the temporal variability of SM than retrieval NNSM 1 . Both NNSM 2 and NNSM 3 give an average R temp higher than that of retrieval NNSM 4 , which uses the SM change detection approach. Nevertheless, the best R temp is obtained when using this approach both with active and passive microwaves as input to the NN (SMNN5). With the exception of retrieval NNSM 1 , the multisensor retrievals perform better than the best SMOSonly retrieval by 8%-17%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Spatial Correlation</head><p>In addition to the maps of local temporal correlation, it is interesting to compute the time series of global daily correlations, which are sometimes called "spatial" correlations, by computing the Pearson 1-D correlation coefficient comparing the values of two daily SM maps (NN SM and ECMWF SM 1 ) for all grid points. One should bear in mind that these values are not the 2-D cross-correlation of the two SM maps, but in the following, the "spatial" correlation, R spa , terminology will be used for simplicity.  The time series of R spa for retrievals NNSM 2 and NNSM 3 are very similar to that of NNSM 1 (and that of NNSM 4 is very similar to that of NNSM 5 ), and they are not shown in this figure . 
Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">VI</ref> gives the mean R spa for each retrieval as computed from the corresponding time series. The time series of R spa show a seasonal oscillation, with slightly lower values for the months of northern summer. This is because the frozen soil    In any case, the R spa time series imply that the NN retrieval is robust as its performances when applied to data not included in the training data set are comparable to the performances obtained over the training period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparison With In Situ Measurements</head><p>A full validation of SMOS L3 SM, ECMWF SM 1 , and NN SM with respect to in situ measurements for a variety of ecosystems, physical conditions, or regions is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is interesting to compare the different NN retrievals discussed earlier to in situ measurements. Therefore, the reference NNSM retrievals, SMOS L3 SM, and ECMWF SM 1 have been compared to in situ measurements made by the SCAN network of the U.S. Department of Agriculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. This network has already been used to evaluate modeled SM products as well as SM retrievals from remote sensing data (ASCAT, SMOS, etc.), including monthly estimates using NNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The SCAN data have been obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Since L-band radiation is emitted by the first few centimeters under the soil surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, the SM products have been compared to in situ SM measurements in the 0-5-cm depth range. A total of 188 time series of in situ measurements have been used to evaluate the SM products. The in situ measurements have been compared with the closest CATDS EASE grid point. The different SM products have been compared at the time of SMOS overpasses. The in situ SM is measured every 30 min. Thus, the closest measurement in time to the SMOS overpass has been selected.</p><p>Of course, one should keep in mind that in situ sensors make a local measurement that is not necessarily representative of the spatial resolution of the remote sensors or the numerical weather prediction models (tenths of kilometers). Some reasons of possible discrepancies are the presence of irrigated areas, water bodies, or local precipitations within the SMOS synthesized beam footprint. In addition, the topography or soil texture differences will affect the hydrological processes taking place at the scale of tenths of kilometers, making a single point measurement not representative of the remotely sensed area. However, the large number of SCAN sites allows to do a statistical analysis of the results. In order to have as consistent statistics among the different products as possible, for each time series, it has been used only at the times for which all in situ, ECMWF SM 1 , SMOS L3 SM, and NN SM are available. In addition, a minimum number of 30 days per time series has been required to compute statistics. The computation has been done independently for ascending and descending SMOS orbits in the full period of this study (November 2010-December 2012). It is important to remind that, as mentioned in Section III, the EASE grid points corresponding to SCAN sites have been voluntarily excluded from the training database for them to be used as testing data.</p><p>For each site, the standard deviation of the difference (STDD) of ECMWF SM 1 , SMOS L3 SM, and NNSM with respect to the in situ measurement has been computed. In addition, the Pearson correlation (R) of those products with respect to the in situ SM and the bias (defined as the mean of the difference time series) have also been computed. Finally, the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values of all those metrics have been calculated. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">VII</ref>.</p><p>The retrieval NNSM 1 , which uses as input similar information to that used by the SMOS L3 algorithm, shows a correlation with the in situ measurements similar to that of SMOS L3 SM. Both for ascending and descending SMOS orbits, NNSM 1 and SMOS L3 SM give the lowest average correlation with the in situ data (0.52 and 0.45-0.48 for ascending and descending orbits, respectively). The correlation is higher for the SMOSonly retrieval NNSM 6 that uses index I 1 (0.53-0.55), and it increases to 0.59-0.61 for NNSM retrievals that include active microwave data and/or an SM change detection approach (I 2 ) such as NNSM 2, 4, and 5. Interestingly, the NNSM 3 retrieval, which uses locally normalized brightness temperatures (I 1 ), also gives R values of the same order, confirming the interest of this approach that does not include any a priori information on SM to capture the temporal variability of the SM time series (see also Section VI-B). ECMWF SM 1 also shows a correlation with the in situ measurements of 0.59-0.61 both for ascending and descending orbits.</p><p>Regarding the STDD, the highest values are given by the SMOS L3 SM time series (0.06-0.07) followed by ECMWF SM 1 (∼0.05). NNSM 1-3 retrievals present an STDD of 0.04-0.05, and those using the change detection approach NNSM 4-5 present a fairly low STDD of (∼0.03). Regarding the bias, NNSM retrievals show a positive bias similar to the ECMWF SM 1 , which is logical as the NNs have been trained with ECMWF data. In contrast, SMOS L3 SM shows a negative bias. The bias values obtained for ECMWF SM 1 and SMOS L3 SM are in agreement with previous SM product evaluation studies over the SCAN sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and other USA watersheds <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>The correlations obtained at the time of SMOS descending overpasses are clearly lower than those for ascending overpasses for all SMOS-based products (NNSM and SMOS L3SM). This is also in agreement with previous studies, which have interpreted this fact as the possible effect of convective rainfall, which occurs during the day affecting potentially differently the local in situ measurement and the ∼40-km remote sensing measurement and decreasing the correlation for descending overpasses, which take place in the afternoon/evening <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. However, it is interesting to note that, proportionally, the difference in correlation for ascending and descending orbits is lower for NNSM retrievals using the daily σ 40 estimation from active microwaves (NNSM 2) and for the retrievals using the change detection approach. In summary, the comparison of the NNSM retrievals to USDA/SCAN in situ measurements shows the good performances of these retrievals. Products NNSM 4 and 5 (using the local extremes of SMOS brightness temperatures and the associated ECMWF SM 1 values) give the best statistics of all the SM products discussed in this paper (ECMWF SM 1 , SMOS L3, and NNSM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Comparison With Previous NN Retrievals of SM at Global Scale</head><p>The use of NNs to perform an SM retrieval from multiinstrument observations has already been studied using active microwaves (ERS), passive microwaves (SSM/I), NDVI (AVHRR), and skin temperature (ISCCP) as input data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The NNs were trained with different surface physics models forced with numerical weather prediction models. In all those studies, the NN approach was evaluated with monthly averages, while this paper describes a daily retrieval. Nevertheless, it is interesting to compare some results of this paper to those of previous studies since they use the approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> but with different input data sets.</p><p>The monthly SM inversion using NNs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the JULES LSM show a global correlation R of 0.92. The SM inversion discussed in this paper is able to capture the variability of ECMWF model SM in a daily basis as it shows a global correlation varying from 0.9 to 0.94, depending on the exact input data sets. On the other hand, the spatial and temporal correlations between the retrieved and the reference monthly SM average found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> are 0.81-0.90 and 0.54-0.67, respectively. In this paper, the spatial and temporal correlation in between the daily retrieved SM and the reference one has been found to be 0.90-0.95 and 0.47-0.58, respectively (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">V</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">VI</ref>). Therefore, the values obtained in this paper for the temporal correlation at daily bases are close to those obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> using monthly averages.</p><p>Finally, the monthly SM estimation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> has also been compared to the in situ measurements from the SCAN network obtaining a temporal correlation of -0.07, much lower than that of other SM products like HTESSEL (0.72). In contrast, the daily NNSM retrievals discussed in this paper show a similar temporal correlation to that of ECMWF/HTESSEL (∼0.60, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">VII</ref>).</p><p>The current study using SMOS and previous studies of global SM retrieval using SSM/I [22]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> use the same approach (training an NN to link a multisensor input data set to a reference SM from an LSM). Therefore, the good temporal and spatial correlation between the NNSM retrievals obtained on a daily basis and ECMWF SM 1 or in situ measurements confirm the strong sensitivity of SMOS to SM compared to the nondedicated microwave observations used by those previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</head><p>A methodology to retrieve soil moisture from multiinstrument observations on a daily basis has been presented. The approach is based on a feedforward NN using SMOS brightness temperatures (passive microwaves at 1.4 GHz), ASCAT backscattering coefficient (active microwaves at 5.3 GHz), MODIS NDVI, and ECOCLIMAP soil texture maps. The NNs have been trained using ECMWF IFS models, which include soil moisture estimations in the 0-7-cm depth range (ECMWF SM 1 ).</p><p>The best compromise to retrieve SM from SMOS T b 's over a large fraction of the swath (∼670 km) is to use SMOS data in the incidence angle range from 25 • to 60 • (in seven bins of 5 • width). The global correlation coefficient of the SM retrieved by NN and ECMWF SM 1 is ∼0.9 for NN retrievals that, in addition to SMOS T b 's, use MODIS NDVI, soil texture, and one of the following: 1) ASCAT σ 40 ; 2) ECMWF soil temperature, or 3) 14 normalized Tb's computed using the minimum and maximum values of T b 's for each incidence angle and polarization at each latitude and longitude grid point.</p><p>A change detection approach (defining a local normalization of brightness temperatures using the extreme values and the associated SM) has also been discussed. In this case, soil texture or temperature become irrelevant as the information is implicitly contained in the SM values for the extreme T b 's. Using only this approach with SMOS T b 's and ASCAT backscattering or NDVI, one can obtain a correlation R of 0.94 between the SM retrieved by NN and the reference ECMWF SM used as target for the NN learning phase. In addition, one advantage of the change detection approach is that good results can be obtained using SMOS data for a lower number of incidence angles, allowing a retrieval over a larger swath (and hence a better temporal coverage).</p><p>It has been shown that the NNs are able to capture the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture. The temporal variability is better reproduced when using retrieval schemes that include active microwave information or, alternatively, using only passive microwave data that include a local normalization of SMOS brightness temperatures.</p><p>When compared to in situ measurements, the NNSM retrievals perform well. The NNSM retrievals that use a local normalization of the SMOS brightness temperatures and the associated extreme SM values give the best results of all the products evaluated in this paper (ECMWF SML1, SMOS L3, and NN SM).</p><p>We have discussed different strategies to retrieve SM from SMOS observations using NNs that perform very well. The best model would depend on the particular application of the NN retrieval. For instance, for an operational NN algorithm, using ASCAT will require access to ASCAT data in real time, and in addition, these data have to be preprocessed to estimate the backscattering at 40 • incidence angle first, which can put strong constraints on an operational algorithm. In addition, requiring both SMOS and ASCAT observations of the same point reduces the coverage to the intersection of the swaths of the instruments of both satellites. In contrast, MODIS NDVI improves significantly the NN retrieval, and it is a very soft constraint to a real-time pipeline as only one NDVI every 15 days is used for the NN retrieval. Adding soil texture improves the results by ∼3%, but soil texture is static information that does not make more complex a real-time algorithm. Retrieval schemes using local normalization indexes need a few years of data for the indexes to be significant, but they are less dependent on external data sets and they allow to retrieve SM over a larger swath because a lower number of incident angles is required.</p><p>Once trained, NNs are a very efficient method to retrieve SM. For instance, using the data filtering discussed in Section III, applying the NN to all SMOS ascending orbits in the database discussed in this paper (with more than two years of data) takes ∼150 s on a standard desktop computer. This fact opens exciting perspectives for a near-real-time operational product.</p><p>Training NNs with a numerical weather prediction model ensures that the retrieved SM is consistent with the model. However, the NN SM can correct the model accordingly to the remote sensing observations. Therefore, this approach can be the basis for an efficient satellite data assimilation into numerical weather prediction models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Meteorological offices need satellite data no more than 3 h after sensing to be able to assimilate the observations in a forecasting system. A near-realtime algorithm using NNs such as those discussed in this paper will be able to retrieve SM fast enough to be assimilated into such a system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

THREE DIFFERENT METRICS ARE GIVEN TO COMPARE THE SM RETRIEVED BY THE NN TO THE EMCWF SM: CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (R), ROOT-MEAN-SQUARED DIFFERENCE OR ERROR (RMSE), AND MEAN ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCE OR ERROR (MAE) For each input vector containing a combination of SMOS T b 's, ASCAT σ 40 , MODIS NDVI, and other data, there is an associated target containing a ECMWF SM 1 value. The output of the NN is compared to the target, and the weights are adjusted by minimizing a cost function (mean squared error). The minimization has been done by gradient backpropagation with the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm (using the Matlab Neural Network library). The input and the targets have been normalized to fall in the range [-1, 1], as this optimizes the training of the NN.Data in the period from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012 have been selected for the training (∼3 × 10 5 vectors). This data subset has been decomposed randomly in 60% actually used for the training, 20% for validation, and 20% for test purposes such as to compute the global correlation of NN outputs with the reference SM (see TablesII and III). The validation data set is used to detect signs of overlearning during the minimization (learning). This occurs when the correlation of retrieved SM and target SM improves for the training data set but the performances start to degrade on the validation data set. No signs of overlearning have been detected as the training database is composed of a large number of statistically significant data. The minimization has been stopped after 30-50 iterations once the cost function has approached</figDesc></figure>
