<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Path planning is a critical issue to ensure the safety and reliability of the autonomous navigation system of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Due to the nonlinearity and constraint issues, existing algorithms perform unsatisfactorily or even cannot find a feasible solution when facing large-scale problem spaces. This paper improves the path planning of AUVs in terms of both the path planning model and the optimization algorithm. The proposed model is comprehensive, which aggregates the length, energy consumption, and collision risk into the objective function and incorporates the steering window constraint. Based on the model, we develop a nature-inspired ant colony optimization algorithm to search the optimal path. Our algorithm is named alarm pheromone assisted ant colony system (AP-ACS), since it incorporates the alarm pheromone in addition to the traditional guiding pheromone. The alarm pheromone alerts the ants to infeasible areas, which saves invalid search efforts and thus improves the search efficiency. Meanwhile, three heuristic measures are specifically designed to provide additional knowledge to the ants for path planning.</p><p>In the experiments, different from the previous works that are tested on synthetic instances only, we implement an interface to retrieve the practical underwater environment data. AP-ACS and the compared algorithms are thus tested on several practical environments of different scales. The experimental results show that AP-ACS can effectively handle the constraints and outperforms the other algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency and stability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. However, the path planning of AUVs is known to be a complex and challenging problem, which encounters nonlinearity and constraint issues. In addition, due to the need for the oceangoing voyage, the large-scale characteristic further increases the difficulty of solving the problem. Therefore, exploring an efficient path planning algorithm for AUVs has become a current research hotspot.</p><p>In the literature, many deterministic algorithms were proposed to solve the path planning problem of AUV <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, which commonly abstracted the path planning problem as a shortest path problem or a minimum power consumption problem. However, these studies always ignore the multiconstraint and multi-objective characteristics of the practical underwater path planning. In addition, many of these path planning algorithms are based on two-dimensional spaces. Their results encounter difficulties to be applied in the practical three-dimensional space of the AUVs.</p><p>With the development of the evolutionary computation paradigm, the evolutionary algorithms were used to solve the path planning problem of AUV, owing to their effectiveness and flexibility to deal with complex problems. Some representative works include the genetic algorithm (GA) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, and the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. Although the evolutionary algorithms can find the optimal solution of the constrained optimization problem on small-scale or coarsegrained working scenarios accurately and efficiently, they often perform poorly or even cannot find a feasible solution when facing some large-scale or fine-grained landscape. With the sharp increase in the search space, even the latest evolutionary algorithms are prune to premature convergence. Meanwhile, research on large-scale underwater path planning is rare, and existing path planning algorithms are not compared with largescale optimization algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. The existing methods also make simplifications on the control model, for example, they a) neglect some navigation constraints and objectives and b) construct manual working scenarios to conduct experiments. Therefore, we believe that the performance of evolutionary computation-based AUV path planner can be further improved.</p><p>To address the above-mentioned problems, this paper improves the path planning of AUV in terms of both the path planning model and the optimization algorithm. Meanwhile, unlike the previous studies which are tested only on some small-scale synthetic instances, our model and algorithm are deployed and tested in large-scale practical underwater en-vironments. In addition, in the experiments, we compare our method with both representative AUV path planners and some leading-edge large-scale optimization algorithms to show its advantages. Generally speaking, the contributions of this paper lie in the following three aspects. 1) Model: We establish an Underwater Environment Model (UEM) for simulating the underwater environment and a Trajectory Model for the path planning. The UEM is comprehensive: it considers seamounts and suspended objects in the real underwater environment. Besides, the model is based on a self-developed Google Map API to obtain the practical data conveniently. The Trajectory Model considers more constraints and objectives than the literature. First, considering the movement limitation coming from the steering gear of AUVs, we define and incorporate the steering window constraint in our model. Second, in addition to the path length and energy consumption, the model further considers the potential risk as one of the evaluation objectives. Based on the environment and trajectory models, the path planning is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. 2) Algorithm: However, because of the complexity of this constrained optimization problem, the existing algorithms perform unsatisfactorily. This is especially so for some large-scale environments that the algorithms fail to identify a feasible path. We propose a novel ant colony system that incorporates an alarm pheromone trait (AP-ACS). This is inspired by the natural pheromone that a hormone called Alarm Pheromone is released when some animals (like ants, bees, and earthworms) encounter danger to alert peers away from the dangerous areas. In AP-ACS, the alarm pheromone is released to inform companions to keep away from the deficient areas when an ant walks into a dead end or fails to find the feasible path. In this way, many ineffective searches in the original problem space are avoided, so that the search space is greatly reduced. Besides, three heuristic information values were specially designed to provide effectual guidance for the path planning. 3) Experiment: In previous studies, the problem instances are constructed based on synthetic datasets. Differently, in this work, we put forward an approach to retrieve the practical underwater environment data through the Google Map API, which can well-reflect the characteristics of the actual environment. In addition, the proposed AP-ACS is compared with four representative related path planners, as well as two state-of-the-art largescale optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that AP-ACS outperforms the other algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and stability. The alarm pheromone enhances the robustness of the algorithm by avoiding the ineffective searches and make AP-ACS more suitable for path planning of AUVs, especially in the complex and large-scale underwater environments.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews related work and sums up the challenges of the problem. Section III describes the Environment Model and the Trajectory Model. Section IV proposes the improved ACS algorithm incorporating the alarm pheromone. In Section V, experiments and the comparisons of the algorithms are presented and discussed. At last, we draw several conclusions in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK AND CHALLENGES</head><p>In recent years, with the proliferation of autonomous vehicles, the algorithms developed for vehicle autonomous navigation system have successfully solved many problems, such as lane recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, driver-vehicle interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, driving style control <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, and motion planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. Meanwhile, for the autonomous navigation of AUVs, the underwater path planning algorithms have also received more and more attention. However, the underwater environment is a threedimensional space that contains seamounts and suspending obstacles. The multi-objective and multi-constraint conditions of the path planning in such a complex environment bring great challenges to the solvers, especially in a large-scale problem space. In this section, we review the related work on AUV path planning, which can be divided into two categories: the deterministic algorithms and the nondeterministic evolutionary algorithms. In addition, some large-scale optimization methods are also introduced at the end of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Deterministic Algorithms</head><p>At the very beginning, many traditional deterministic algorithms are used to solve the path planning problem, which generally abstracted the path planning problem as a shortest path problem or a minimum power consumption problem. Latombe <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> proposed several path planning methods, such as cell decomposition methods and potential field methods. Cetin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> applied the mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Garau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> used an A* search procedure to find optimal paths on ocean environments with different scales of eddies and different current intensities. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, Petres et al. proposed an algorithm called FM* that effectively extracted twodimensional continuous paths from discrete representations of the environment. Furthermore, the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm and its extensions such as Dynamic RRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> and Multi-particle RRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> have also been used to solve the path planning problem.</p><p>However, these deterministic algorithms are basically unable to solve the problem of path planning when the scale of the problem becomes large, and they always ignore the constraints of the problem. The models of these algorithms also do not consider obstacles and seamounts at the same time. In addition, many of the path planning algorithms are based on twodimensional spaces, and the results are often difficult to apply to the practical three-dimensional space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Nondeterministic Evolutionary Algorithms</head><p>In recent years, evolutionary algorithms have seen great success to deal with NP-hard problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Their computational costs increase sub-linearly with the geometric growth of the scale of the datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. The GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, DE <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> and ACO <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> algorithms have been reported for solving path planning problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> proposed a path planner based on a hybrid genetic algorithm for the twodimensional ground maps they constructed. Roberge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> made a detailed comparison of standard PSO and standard GA and indicated that the GA produces superior trajectories to the PSO with statistical significance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, the space was divided into several parallel subspaces and a spiral particle path search method based on discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) was established. Fu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> also proposed a variant of PSO, named phase angle-encoded and quantumbehaved particle swarm optimization (θ-QPSO), which showed superior performance over GA, DE, and three other PSO-based algorithms. Zeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> proposed an algorithm hybridizing GA and a Quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO). Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> proposed a path planner based on an improved self-adaptive DE algorithm, in which the three-dimensional problem space was decomposed into subspaces, and different cost functions were applied to evaluate the path quality. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, an ant colony system was applied, and the simulation experiments indicated that the algorithm can carry out path planning in three-dimensional space effectively.</p><p>However, we find that the control models of these algorithms can be further refined. More importantly, the performance of these algorithms reduces dramatically on large-scale instances. This challenge is often referred to as: "the curse of dimensionality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. The sharp increase of the search space has formed many local optimal regions, which makes the algorithm easily trap into the local optimum and leads to premature convergence eventually. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Large-Scale Optimization Algorithms</head><p>In recent years, some efforts have been made to conquer large-scale optimization problems. Tucnik et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> proposed a multi-agent-based path planning approach to solve largescale inter-city road discovery. Potter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> proposed a framework for large-scale optimization algorithms based on a cooperative coevolution (CC) strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. In general, the large-scale evolutionary algorithms are developed based on three methods: 1) adopting a CC approach to decompose the scale of the problem, 2) designing new strategies to improve global search capabilities, or 3) combining the above two. The success of CC-based evolutionary algorithms is mainly because the decomposition strategy can turn the problem into sub-problems and reduce the difficulty of searching solutions. However, this type of algorithms usually encounter a limitation coming from the dimension grouping strategies: it is difficult to consider the dependency of variables between different groups in the coevolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Therefore, some research efforts of large-scale optimization problem have been paid to enhance the global search ability of evolutionary algorithms by means of new learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. Furthermore, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> developed a novel dynamic segment-based predominant learning swarm optimizer (DSPLSO) based on the combination of the above-mentioned two methods. The experimental results on the CEC'2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> and CEC'2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> largescale benchmark functions showed that DSPLSO was compet-itively efficient and effective compared with the state-of-theart large-scale optimization algorithms. However, to the best of our knowledge, the large-scale evolutionary optimization algorithms have not yet been reported in the literature of underwater path planning of AUVs.</p><p>To summarize, this paper deals with the following three challenges of AUV path planning problems: (1) how to model the practical constraints and objectives of the problem; (2) how to solve the constrained optimization problem efficiently and consider large-scale datasets, and (3) how to compare the experimental results with existing path planners as well as the large-scale optimization algorithms on real-world datasets and how to visualize the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MODELS</head><p>This section establishes and interprets the Underwater Environment Model (UEM) for the underwater environment and the Trajectory Model for the paths. In the literature, many studies proposed their own models for underwater path planning. Generally, the common grounds of existing models are: they consider seamounts and obstacles to construct the environment and then transform the three-dimensional path planning problem into selecting waypoints in different planes of the three-dimensional coordinate system. However, the traditional UEM model and Trajectory Model still have the following limitations:</p><p>1) The constraints of path planning are not taken into fully consideration: In previous studies, the UEM converts the problem into selecting waypoints in each plane, without imposing any constraint. However, this is not always the case since the movement of AUV encounters the steering limitation. This paper introduces the concept of steering window and incorporates the constraints into the path planning problem.</p><p>2) The objectives of path planning can be further improved:</p><p>Although the traditional models consider constructing a collision-free path, but they pay no attention to the obstacles around the path, which may be a potential threat to the navigation of AUVs. On this basis, the Trajectory Model of this study further integrates the ideas of Sight Space <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> and considers the potential risk factors. Our optimization objectives of path planning hence include a potential risk item to keep the vehicle as far as possible from the obstacles.</p><p>3) The related datasets are constructed manually: The traditional UEM modeling methods construct manual working scenarios so as to conduct experiments. However, on the one hand, the process of manual data creation is time-consuming, especially for large-scale instances. On the other hand, such datasets have difficulty to characterize the real-world environments. In this regard, this paper puts forward a new modeling approach to retrieve the practical datasets from the Google Map API.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Underwater Environment Model</head><p>In order to simulate the realistic underwater environment consisting of the underwater seamounts and suspended objects, we establish the UEM by modeling the space coordinate system (Definition 1) and the obstacles (Definition 2).</p><p>Definition 1 (Space Coordinate System): In the UEM, the underwater space is regarded as a rectangular cuboid. The space coordinate system (SCS) is created to specify the position, where X-axis denotes the length, Y-axis denotes the width, and Z-axis denotes the depth, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Along the X-axis, the space is divided into L + 1 parallel planes (X 0 → X L ) equally, which are perpendicular to Y-axis and Z-axis. Then, each plane is divided into (W + 1) × (D + 1) grids along Y-axis and Z-axis, i.e., we divide the underwater space into (L + 1) × (W + 1) × (D + 1) subspaces in the SCS. Every subspace can be located by (x, y, z) in the SCS. Obviously, the model could be established more accurately by dividing more grids from the space.</p><p>Definition 2 (Obstacles): The obstacle could be either the seamounts or some suspended objects. A two-dimensional array is used to store obstacles in each plane. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, for the value in the array, we set it to 1 if the corresponding grid is passable whereas 0 if it contains obstacles. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) shows the rasterized underwater environment, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(b) depicts the two-dimensional array representation after modeling. Next, we will introduce the acquisition of the rasterized underwater environment.</p><p>1) The Underwater Seamounts: In real world, the shape data of the seamounts can be collected by some observation apparatus. Similarly, this paper develops an approach for retrieving the practical underwater seamount data by utilizing the Google Map API. Starting from a selected point on the ocean, we sample at the latitude and longitude on the Google Map to form a sampling matrix as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. After that, we use a self-developed tool to obtain the elevation data of all points in the sampling matrix in order to model the realistic seafloor terrain. The tool can also customize sampling parameters (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), such as the scale of the matrix and sampling intervals. In this way, we can obtain seamount elevation data in any scale at any location on the ocean.</p><p>After retrieving the sampling matrix, we need to scale the elevation data down according to the size of the SCS. For a plane X i , all grids are first initialized to be passable, and  then the grids whose Z value are less than the scaled-down elevation value will be set to be impenetrable, like Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a).</p><p>2) The Suspended Object: The underwater environment may contain ubiquitous suspended objects. As we all know, the suspended objects can be scanned by some electronic equipments. To simplify the problem, the UEM extends all suspended objects into several imaginary spheres. For a plane X i , the UEM regards all grids inside the spheres as an impenetrable obstacle, like Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Trajectory Model</head><p>Before path planning, we need to further establish a Trajectory Model for the AUVs' path. First, the definition of the path is described in Definition 3.</p><p>Definition 3 (Path Matrix): In this model, we consider a path as a connection from several waypoints in different planes. Along the X-axis in the SCS, we choose a point in each plane X i and then joint all the waypoints to form a trajectory. Including the start-point and the target-point, the trajectory of AUVs can be represented by L + 1 points. A Path Matrix is defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) to represent the path in our model. where P 0 is the start-point and P L is the target-point of the path. In this way, we convert the path planning to the problem of selecting waypoints in each plane between X 1 and X L-1 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">path=        P 0 P 1 ... P L        =        x 0 y 0 z 0 x 1 y 1 z 1 ... ... ... x L y L z L        (1)</formula><p>Next, we will discuss the constraints and objectives of path planning, respectively.</p><p>1) Constraints of Path Planning: Considering the fact that the range of each move of the AUVs is limited, we use the concept of the steering window in our model.</p><p>Definition 4 (Steering Window): For the point P i of plain X i , the exploring range of the next plain X i+1 is limited in a rectangle called Steering Window (SW). With the constraint of the SW, AUVs can only select the next waypoint in a LR×U D rectangle defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">SW Pi = (x, y, z) (x, y, z)∈X i+1 , y ∈ y i - LR 2 , y i + LR 2 , z ∈ z i - U D 2 , z i + U D 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where i = 0, 1, • • • , L -1. Therefore, there are a total number of L constraints from the plain X 0 to the plain X L-1 . The traditional UEM does not consider that the accessible range for which the AUVs can turn around, so that the AUVs are able to move from waypoint to waypoint without any limitation. Now, we introduce the constraints that AUVs can only select the next passable point in the current point's SW. If there is no feasible point in the current point's SW, i.e., all waypoints are obstacles, it means that AUVs cannot enter the next plane and the path planning fails.</p><p>2) Objectives of Path Planning: The objectives of path planning vary from applications to applications. In our model of AUV path planning, the length of trajectory (definition 5), the energy consumption based on the smoothness of trajectory (definition 6), and risk (definition 8) issues are considered.</p><p>Definition 5 (Length of a Trajectory): The length of the trajectory is always the focus of path planning.

In other words, the Sight Space is a subspace in front of a certain point in sight.</p><p>Definition 8 (Risk of a Trajectory): AUVs are very sensitive to obstacles: driving close to the obstacles carries a high potential risk of damage to the equipment. For safty, the path need to be as far away from the obstacles as possible in order to prevent possible collisions. Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) sums the number of obstacles in the Sight Space of every waypoint to assess the proximity of the path to the obstacles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. THE IMPROVED ACS ALGORITHM FOR UNDERWATER PATH PLANNING</head><p>The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) was first proposed by Dorigo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> in 1991. Some insect scientists discovered that although ants are visually underdeveloped, they can find the shortest path between the cave and the food without any hints. This owes to the pheromone released to the path by ants, which is a kind of communication medium. When facing a junction, an ant is more likely to choose a path with a higher pheromone density. Initially, all the ants randomly explore the entire space. The ants will deposit more pheromone on shorter paths. Later, because the accumulated pheromone values are higher, the shorter paths will attract more ants to follow and so accumulate even more pheromone amounts. This process repeats, which constructs a positive feedback loop. Eventually, all ants find the shortest path since the pheromone on this path dominates the others. The ACO was first introduced to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. Later, it has been successfully applied to many discrete optimization problems such as Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, and some others like Data Mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>, Image Processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>, and Map Matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we develop an alarm pheromone assisted ant colony system (AP-ACS) to solve the path planning problem defined in Section III. The general procedure of AP-ACS is presented as follows. In the initialization, all the ants are placed at the start-point of the problem. Repeatedly, each ant uses the state transition rule to select the next waypoint, until the path planning is completed. During the path construction process, the local and global pheromone update rules are applied to update the pheromone information. The algorithm then iterates until the termination condition is met. The termination rule of the algorithm is set as: 1) the algorithm reaches the maximum number of evaluation times or 2) the algorithm has converged completely.</p><p>We incorporate two different types of pheromone information in the algorithm, one named guiding pheromone and the other named alarm pheromone, both are inspired from the nature. The guiding pheromone guides the search of ants, as in the traditional ACO algorithms. In addition, to deal with the constraints of AUV path planning, the alarm pheromone is used to alert and avoid the infeasible positions in the problem space. Assume that if an ant inadvertently walks into a dead end: 1) its SW is full of obstacles, or 2) the ant is currently on the plane X L-1 but its SW does not contain the target-point. In this case, this ant fails to find a feasible path for the problem. The infeasible search efforts will lower the efficiency of the algorithm. This is especially so for the large-scale problem instances, where the infeasible positions occupy a very large portion of the problem space. In AP-ACS, once an ant walks into a dead end or explores a place that is too far away from the target-point, it deposits the alarm pheromone to alert the successors. This mancinism not only handles the constraints of the path planning but also improves the search efficiency of the algorithm.</p><p>Next, we describe the major components of the algorithm, including the initialization, the state transition rule, the update of the two pheromones, respectively. Then, we present the pseudocode of AP-ACS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Initialization of the Algorithm</head><p>The algorithm contains N ants, each is initialized at the start-point of the problem. Meanwhile, the algorithm maintains two pheromone matrices that store the guiding and alarm pheromone information at every point in the problem space.

The greedy algorithm repeatedly selects a point in the SW that maximizes the heuristic information, until the full path is constructed. The heuristic information of the greedy algorithm is the same as AP-ACS, which will be defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) later. However, if the greedy algorithm fails to get a feasible path (encounters a dead end), C nn is calculated as the fitness of the path which directly connects the start-point and the target-point.</p><p>The alarm pheromone for all points is initialized to 0 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">δ 0 = 0<label>(8)</label></formula></div>

If q ≤ q 0 , the ant performs exploitation that it directly selects the point with the largest pheromone and heuristic values. Otherwise, the ant selects the point by a Roulette Wheel Selection rule for exploration.

In Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>, the heuristic information η(P i , P j ) is calculated by the product of three heuristic information of smoothness (definition 10), safety (definition 11), and purposefulness (definition 12).

Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">12</ref>) measures the cost of movement after choosing point P j , by calculating the reciprocal of the average distance the AUV needs to change direction. Meanwhile, 1 is added to the denominator to avoid the denominator being zero.

Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">13</ref>) measures the potential safety when selecting point P j based on the definition of the Sight Space. Herein, D sum (P j ) sums up the number of obstacles in the Sight Space Ω Pj of P j , which can be used to measure the potential danger after choosing the point P j . In addition, since the algorithm will aggregate three heuristic measures eventually, all the heuristic measures should be normalized before used. Therefore, the equation needs to use the relative value instead of the absolute value, and thus the min</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Pu∈SW P i</formula><p>{D sum (P u )} is introduced for the normalization purpose.

( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) measures the distance from the current optional point P j to the targetpoint P target . In addition, the measure is normalized in the identical way as Eq.

Pheromone Update Rule 1) Local Update Rule: In the local update step, AP-ACS processes the guiding pheromone only. For each ant, when selecting the next waypoint P j , the guiding pheromone τ (P j ) of the selected point P j is updated as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">15</ref>), where ξ is the local evaporation rate of pheromone.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">τ (P j ) = τ (P j ) × (1 -ξ) + τ 0 × ξ<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Because τ 0 = 1 L×C nn ≤ τ (P j ), the guiding pheromone τ (P j ) is reduced by a certain amount, i.e., subsequent ants will tend to explore other unvisited areas, which can effectively avoid the algorithm being stagnant.</p><p>2) Global Update Rule: The traditional ACS deposits pheromone after all ants have fully established the path, which aims to guide the subsequent search of ants towards the promising direction. The proposed AP-ACS updates not only the guiding pheromone but also the alarm pheromone in this global update step. The guiding pheromone is updated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">τ (P t ) = (1-σ)×τ (P t )+σ×∆τ (P t ), ∀P t ∈ path bsf ∆τ (P t ) = 1 F total (path bsf ) (16)</formula><p>where σ denotes the global evaporation rate, and path bsf represents the best-so-far path of all iterations. With the update, the guiding pheromone on the global best path will be increased.</p><p>Meanwhile, the alarm pheromone is updated at the end of each generation. Considering whether or not an ant has successfully built a feasible path to the problem, the ant is named to be alive or dead respectively. A dead ant increases the alarm pheromone on its path, whereas an alive ant reduces the alarm pheromone (until it returns to the initial value δ 0 = 0 again). In this way, the infeasible paths are effectively marked with the alarm pheromone to remind the companions to circumnavigate. Note that the alarm pheromone values on all the waypoints of all ants are updated in a generation. If path m represents the path found by the ant m, the alarm pheromone of every point P t on path m (∀P t ∈ path m ) is updated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">δ(P t ) = δ(P t ) + 1, if ant m is alive δ(P t ) -1, if ant m is dead and δ(P t ) &gt; δ 0<label>(17)</label></formula><p>According to the definition of the two pheromones, each ant is supposed to choose the next waypoint P j with larger guiding pheromone τ (P j ) but less alarm pheromone δ(P j ). Therefore, in the previous State Transition step, the amount of the alarm pheromone δ(P j ) of point P j should be inverted before use. The conversion process is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ϕ(P j ) = 1 ln[1 + δ(P j )] + 1 (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where ϕ(P j ) is the converted measure of the alarm pheromone δ(P j ).</p></div>

Pseudocode of AP-ACS</head><p>The pseudocode of AP-ACS is presented in Algorithm 1, where the population size of the ant colony is N .</p><p>So far, we have completely proposed a novel alarm pheromone assisted ant colony system (AP-ACS) for underwater path planning. Inspired by the natural world, AP-ACS employs both the guiding pheromone and the alarm pheromone that can effectively handle the objectives and  4) The Greedy Algorithm: A greedy search algorithm mentioned in Section IV-A. The greedy search algorithm relies on the greedy strategie, so it is recommended to set a larger purposefulness heuristic parameter. 5) CCTS-ABCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>: A large-scale optimization algorithm, which hybridizes the cooperative coevolutionary artificial bee colony algorithm (CC-ABCA) and Tabu search (TS). CC strategy mainly decomposes problem into groups and evolves separately so that the original problem needs to be divided into sub-questions. In our model, the path planning problem is selecting waypoints in each plane between X 1 and X L-1 (a total of L-1 planes). If the original problem needs to be divided into N OC sub-problems, the path planning problem can be designed as that each group only processes planning in</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">X 0 X 1 X 2 X NOC X L . .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">L-1</formula><p>N OC planes and then sends the obtained solution to the schedule bees of CCTS-ABCA to get an effective solution by merging. To be more effective, we assign all planes alternately to each cluster. The scheme of assigning L-1 planes to N OC clusters is as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. The rows in the table represent clusters, and the columns represent planes. All the tags of each row are the planes that the cluster needs to plan. In this way, CCTS-ABCA is ready to plan paths. 6) DSPLSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>: The dynamic segment-based predominant learning swarm optimizer (DSPLSO) described in Section II.</p><p>All the algorithms use the same Path Evaluation Function defined in Eq.

However, for the middle-scale (50×50×50) datasets, which have a more complex terrain, the two DEs are inferior to the two ACS algorithms. Furthermore, as the scale becomes larger, it can be seen that the solutions of both DE algorithms are several orders of magnitude worse than the two ACS solutions. Therefore, the performance of the two DE algorithms deteriorates dramatically in large-scale optimization.</p><p>As mentioned in Section II, due to "the curse of dimensionality", the latest large-scale evolutionary algorithms usually adopt a cooperative coevolution (CC) approach or design new learning strategies. The large-scale optimization algorithm CCTS-ABCA adopts the first method, and DSPLSO combines the two methods. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, it can be seen that CCTS-ABCA performs unsatisfactorily on most of the instances. The CC strategy usually involves a step of breaking down the original problem into sub-problems and then evolving each group separately. However, when applying a CC-based algorithm in our working scenario, the path segments are evolved independently in different groups, but whether the path segments obtained by different clusters can be smoothly connected is not considered. This is the why the CCTS-ABCA performs unsatisfactorily in dealing with the path planning problem of this paper. For the DSPLSO algorithm, we can see from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> that, although it possesses a strong search capabilities on small-scale datasets, the algorithm still traps into the local optimal solutions in large-scale or complex environments. To summarize, our proposed AP-ACS outperforms these two algorithms that are specifically designed for largescale optimization problems. Now, let us take a close look at the comparison between AP-ACS and the original ACS. The two ACS algorithms perform almost identically on small-scale or middle-scale instances. However, for the larger-scale instances, the original ACS is usually trapped into local optima or infeasible paths, whereas AP-ACS can always find a better and feasible solution. Therefore, the incorporation of the alarm pheromone enables AP-ACS to avoid invalid exploration and to evolve toward a more reasonable solution space by guiding ants away from the highrisk areas. Thus, AP-ACS maintains good performance on # means that the algorithm cannot find a feasible solution in all runs.</p><p>small-scale cases and outperforms the original ACS on largescale or complex practical underwater environments. Furthermore, we visualize the paths produced by the six evolutionary algorithms of different scales in the North Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea for comparison, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. For the small-scale dataset in the North Pacific Ocean (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>), most algorithms present a feasible, smooth, and satisfactory path. However, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, when the scale of the problem increases and the underwater seamounts become more rugged, the two DE algorithms cannot produce a smooth path, and always choose to bypass obstacles, rather than in a broader field of vision to find a better solution, which will consume more energy of AUVs. Moreover, for the large-scale datasets in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>, it can be seen that the two DEs and CCTS-ABCA cannot construct a feasible path because they are trapped into local optimum prematurely. As for DSPLSO, although the algorithm attempts to bypass the obstacle, the resulting paths are also very tortuous because the search ability is still insufficient. In contrast, the proposed AP-ACS can successfully build feasible and superior solutions in all cases. This points out that AP-ACS performs better than the other algorithms in this discrete optimization problem. Note that, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>(e) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(f)</ref>, the path produced by AP-ACS can across the valley between two seamounts with the help of the alarm pheromone whereas the original ACS takes a detour to avoid obstacles. This further indicates that AP-ACS has a more strong searching ability and can still produce a satisfactory solution even in a complex environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Efficiency Analysis of Algorithms</head><p>To compare the efficiency of the six evolutionary algorithms, we set a threshold for each dataset in particular and record   whether each algorithm can evolve to this threshold and its runtime. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref> shows the average value of the runtime and the average value of the corresponding success rate of the six evolutionary algorithms over 30 independent runs. Also, the bolded forms indicate that their corresponding algorithms perform most effectively on this instance. From the table, we can see that AP-ACS is the most promising and effective algorithm. The comparison of the running time shows that AP-ACS is almost identical to the two DEs on small-scale datasets but is significantly more efficient than the two DEs on a large-scale instance. For large-scale instances, CCTS-ABCA and DSPLSO take a less time than the two DEs, but they are still not as promising as AP-ACS when considering both the time cost and the search success rate. Generally, it can be seen from the table that our AP-ACS achieves the best satisfactory success rate in a short time on large-scale and complex instances. As can be observed from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>, the original ACS cannot even find one feasible path on the instance of the North Pacific Ocean (problem scale = 200 × 200 × 200) or the East China Sea (problem scale = 100 × 100 × 100) because the original ACS cannot handle the constraints coming from the steering limitation of AUVs and it lacks of search capabilities. On the contrary, AP-ACS can find feasible solutions in all circumstances and takes relatively less time to evolve in most of the working scenarios. Owing to the elimination of dangerous paths, ineffective searches are avoided, so that the search process is accelerated and the search quality is improved. Therefore, we further prove that AP-ACS can produce paths both effectively and accurately. The incorporation of the alarm pheromone enhances the robustness of AP-ACS and makes AP-ACS more suitable for large-scale path planning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Stability Analysis of Algorithms</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> shows the box plots of F total obtained by six algorithms in 30 independent runs, where the lower quartile, median, mean, upper quartile, maximum, and outliers of results are depicted. The four sub-figures show the performance of different algorithms at the scales of 25×25×25, 50×50×50, 100×100×100, and 200×200×200, respectively. It can be seen that, as the scale of the problem increases, the position of the box plot of AP-ACS gradually becomes the lowest. In addition, the box plots of AP-ACS always possess a much narrower range than the others. These results show that the proposed AP-ACS not only obtains the best accuracy but also exhibits the best stability for different executions on different datasets. At the same time, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, the standard deviation of the fitness values obtained by each algorithm in each dataset can also reflect the stability of the algorithm to some extent. In small-scale scenarios, the standard deviation of AP-ACS is not much different from that of the other algorithms. However, in the large-scale environments, the standard deviation of AP-ACS becomes significantly lower than the other algorithms (even when compared with the two large-scale optimization algorithms: CCTS-ABCA and DSPLSO).</p></div>

The guiding pheromone leads the ants to search towards short, energyefficient, and low-risk paths, whereas the alarm pheromone provides hints to avoid ants step into invalid areas. Besides, three heuristic information values are specially designed to provide effectual guidance for the path planner. In the next section, we will test the performance of AP-ACS and compare it with other algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTS AND COMPARISONS</head><p>In this section, the effectiveness of the proposed AP-ACS is verified by comparing it with four peer algorithms and two large-scale optimization algorithms on several practical instances of different scales. We first describe the experimental environment and the compared algorithms. Then, we compare and analyze the accuracy, efficiency and stability of each algorithm respectively. The visualizations of results are also displayed in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Experimental Environment</head><p>All algorithms are coded in C++ and the results are visualized in MATLAB TM 2017. The experiments are performed on a 2.50GHz Intel(R) Core TM i5 CPU 4300U computer with 8Gb RAM. In order to test the performance of the algorithms under a wide variety of underwater environments, initially, two locations with different topographies were selected as the source of our instances. As can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a) and Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(b), the North Pacific Ocean (Lng: 19.4147924, Lat: 156.5991211) and the East China Sea (Lng: 28.8639184, Lat: 122.8930664) have different characteristics: the seabed seamounts in the North Pacific Ocean are sharp, whereas those in the East China Sea are relatively flat. However, the East China Sea contains more rugged seamounts than the North Pacific Ocean. Then, the dataset acquisition approach defined in Section III is used to generate four datasets in the scales of 25×25×25, 50×50×50, 100×100×100, and 200×200×200 for these two locations, respectively. Thus, eight practical datasets of different scales are ready to test the performance of the algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Algorithms for Comparisons</head><p>We compare AP-ACS with four representative related path planners and two state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms:</p><p>1) The Original DE <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>: A DE-based path planner.</p><p>2) Self-adaptive DE <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>: An improved DE-based path planner including a self-adaptive strategy to enhance solution quality and avoid premature convergence.</p><p>3) The Original ACS: A simplification of AP-ACS which excludes the alarm pheromone. It is used to compare with AP-ACS to figure out the influence coming from the incorporation of the alarm pheromone clearly.</p></div>			</div>
