<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preface</head><p>We describe in this book, hybrid intelligent systems using type-2 fuzzy logic for intelligent control and mobile robotics. Hybrid intelligent systems combine several intelligent computing paradigms, including fuzzy logic, and bio-inspired optimization algorithms, which can be used to produce powerful automatic control systems. The book is organized in three main parts, which contain a group of chapters around a similar subject. The first part consists of chapters with the main theme of theory and design algorithms, which are basically chapters that propose new models and concepts, which can be the basis for achieving intelligent control and mobile robotics. The second part contains chapters with the main theme of evolutionary optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems in intelligent control with the aim of designing optimal type-2 fuzzy controllers for complex control problems. The third part contains chapters with the theme of bio-inspired optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems in intelligent control, which includes the application of particle swarm intelligence and ant colony optimization algorithms for obtaining optimal type-2 fuzzy controllers.</p><p>In the part of theory and algorithms there are 4 chapters that describe different contributions that propose new models and concepts, which can be the considered as the basis for achieving intelligent control and mobile robotics. The first chapter offers an introduction to the area of type-2 fuzzy logic for intelligent control applications. The second chapter describes the basic concepts and theory of type-2 fuzzy logic that will be used in the applications mentioned in the book. The third chapter describes a general methodology for the design of type-2 fuzzy logic controllers. The fourth chapter describes the important concept of stability in type-2 fuzzy controllers and a systematic method to achieve it.</p><p>In the part of evolutionary optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems intelligent control there are 5 chapters that describe different contributions on achieving control using hybrid intelligent systems based on type-2 fuzzy logic. The first chapter describes the hardware implementation of interval type-2 fuzzy controllers on FPGAs. The second chapter deals with automatic control of aircraft dynamic systems using type-2 fuzzy controllers generated by genetic algorithms. The third chapter describes the design of type-2 fuzzy reactive and tracking controllers for autonomous mobile robot navigation. The fourth chapter describes the application of genetic algorithm for the automatic design of interval type-2 fuzzy controllers for linear and non-linear plants. The fifth chapter proposes the use of the human evolutionary model for the design of intelligent type-2 fuzzy logic controllers for general applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction to Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Control</head><p>We describe in this book, new methods for building intelligent systems using type-2 fuzzy logic and soft computing techniques. Soft Computing (SC) consists of several computing paradigms, including type-1 fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms, which can be used to create powerful hybrid intelligent systems. In this book, we are extending the use of fuzzy logic to a higher order, which is called type-2 fuzzy logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Combining type-2 fuzzy logic with traditional SC techniques, we can build powerful hybrid intelligent systems that can use the advantages that each technique offers in solving complex control problems.</p><p>Fuzzy logic is an area of soft computing that enables a computer system to reason with uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. A fuzzy inference system consists of a set of if-then rules defined over fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. Fuzzy sets generalize the concept of a traditional set by allowing the membership degree to be any value between 0 and 1. This corresponds, in the real world, to many situations where it is difficult to decide in an unambiguous manner if something belongs or not to a specific class. Fuzzy expert systems, for example, have been applied with some success to problems of decision, control, diagnosis and classification, just because they can manage the complex expert reasoning involved in these areas of application. The main disadvantage of fuzzy systems is that they can't adapt to changing situations. For this reason, it is a good idea to combine fuzzy logic with neural networks or genetic algorithms, because either one of these last two methodologies could give adaptability to the fuzzy system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. On the other hand, the knowledge that is used to build these fuzzy rules is uncertain. Such uncertainty leads to rules whose antecedents or consequents are uncertain, which translates into uncertain antecedent or consequent membership functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Type-1 fuzzy systems, like the ones mentioned above, whose membership functions are type-1 fuzzy sets, are unable to directly handle such uncertainties. We also describe in this book, type-2 fuzzy systems, in which the antecedent or consequent membership functions are type-2 fuzzy sets. Such sets are fuzzy sets whose membership grades themselves are type-1 fuzzy sets; they are very useful in circumstances where it is difficult to determine an exact membership function for a fuzzy set <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Uncertainty is an inherent part of intelligent systems used in real-world applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. The use of new methods for handling incomplete information is of fundamental importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. Type-1 fuzzy sets used in conventional fuzzy systems cannot fully handle the uncertainties present in intelligent systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>. Type-2 fuzzy sets that are used in type-2 fuzzy systems can handle such uncertainties in a better way because they provide us with more parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>. This book 1 Introduction to Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Control deals with the design of intelligent systems using interval type-2 fuzzy logic for minimizing the effects of uncertainty produced by the instrumentation elements, environmental noise, etc. Experimental results include simulations of feedback control systems for non-linear plants using type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic controllers; a comparative analysis of the systems' response is performed, with and without the presence of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>.</p><p>Stability is one of the more important aspects in the traditional knowledge of Automatic Control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Type-2 Fuzzy Logic is an emerging and promising area for achieving Intelligent Control (in this case, Fuzzy Control). In this book we consider the use the Fuzzy Lyapunov Synthesis as proposed by Margaliot to build a Lyapunov Stable Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Control System <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>, and then we make an extension from a Type-1 to a Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Control System, ensuring the stability on the control system and proving the robustness of the corresponding fuzzy controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</p><p>This book deals with the design of type-2 fuzzy logic controllers using genetic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. The type-2 controllers were tested with different levels of uncertainty to regulate velocity in a Direct current (DC) motor. The type-2 controllers were synthesized in Very High Description Language (VHDL) code for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), using Xilinx System Generator (XSG) of Xilinx ISE and Matlab-Simulink <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref>. Comparisons were made between type-2 versus type-1 fuzzy controllers in VHDL code and a Proportional Integral Differential (PID) Controller, to regulate the velocity of a DC motor <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>.</p><p>We also present the design of fuzzy systems for the longitudinal control of an F-14 airplane using genetic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. The longitudinal control is carried out by controlling only the elevators of the airplane. To carry out such control it is necessary to use the stick, the rate of elevation and the angle of attack. These 3 variables are the input to the fuzzy inference system, which is of Mamdani type, and we obtain as output the value of the elevators. After designing the fuzzy inference system we turn to the simulation stage. Simulation results of the longitudinal control are obtained using a plant in Simulink and those results are compared against the PID controller. For optimizing the fuzzy logic control design we use a genetic algorithm (GA).</p><p>The book also describes an evolutionary algorithm approach for the optimization of type-2 fuzzy reactive and tracking controllers applied to a mobile robot <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. The algorithm optimizes the type-2 fuzzy inference systems for each of the controllers. Both the reactive and tracking controllers are needed to achieve autonomous navigation of the mobile robot.</p><p>In this book we also propose the use of a hybrid PSO-GA optimization method for automatic design of fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) to minimize the steady state error of a plant's response <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>. We test the optimal FLC obtained by the hybrid PSO-GA method applied on linear systems using benchmark plants. The bioinspired and the evolutionary methods are used to find the parameters of the membership functions of the FLC to obtain the optimal controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. Simulation results are obtained with Simulink showing the feasibility of the proposed approach. A comparison is also made among the proposed Hybrid PSO-GA, GA and PSO to determine if there is a significant difference in the results.</p><p>The use of new methods for handling incomplete information is of fundamental importance in engineering applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. We simulated the effects of uncertainty produced by the instrumentation elements in type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic controllers to perform a comparative analysis of the systems' response, in the presence of uncertainty. We are presenting an innovative idea to optimize interval type-2 membership functions using an average of two type-1 systems with the Human Evolutionary Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. We are showing comparative results of the optimized proposed method. We found that the optimized membership functions for the inputs of a type-2 system increases the performance of the system for high noise levels.</p><p>We describe the use of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for the ball and beam control problem, in particular for the problem of tuning a fuzzy controller of Sugeno type. In our study case the controller has four inputs, each of them with two membership functions, we consider the interpolation point for every pair of membership function as the main parameter and their individual shape as secondary ones in order to achieve the tuning of the fuzzy controller by using an ACO algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Simulation results show that using ACO and coding the problem with just three parameters instead of six, allows us to find an optimal set of membership function parameters for the fuzzy control system with less computational effort needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>.</p><p>In this book we also describe the application of a simple ACO as a method of optimization for membership functions' parameters of a fuzzy logic controller in order to find the optimal intelligent controller for an autonomous wheeled mobile robot. Simulation results show that ACO outperforms a GA in the optimization of fuzzy logic controllers for an autonomous mobile robot <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>.</p><p>This work also describes the application of the optimization algorithm for particle swarm known by its acronym as PSO, used to adjust the parameters of membership functions of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to find the optimal intelligent control for a wheeled autonomous mobile robot. Results of several simulations show that the PSO is able to optimize the type-1 and type 2 FLC for this specific application <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</p><p>We use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method to find the parameters of the membership functions of a type-2 fuzzy logic controller (Type-2 FLC) in order to minimize the state error for linear systems. PSO is used to find the optimal Type-2 FLC to achieve regulation of the output and stability of the closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. For this purpose, we change the values of the cognitive, social and inertia variables in the PSO. Simulation results, with the optimal FLC implemented in Simulink, show the feasibility of the proposed approach.</p><p>In general, the above mentioned applications of type-2 fuzzy logic in intelligent control are representative of the state of art in the area. However, we also have to mention that there exist applications of type-2 fuzzy logic in pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73]</ref>, time series prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">85]</ref>, and classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">83]</ref>, that have been successful in the real world, but are not the main concern in this book. There have also been important theoretical advances on type-2 fuzzy logic that have enable more efficient processing and type reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71]</ref>, which have helped obtaining solutions to real world problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">86</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type-2 Fuzzy Logic</head><p>We introduce in this chapter a new area in fuzzy logic, which is called type-2 fuzzy logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref>. Basically, a type-2 fuzzy set is a set in which we also have uncertainty about the membership function <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. Of course, type-2 fuzzy systems consist of fuzzy if-then rules, which contain type-2 fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. We can say that type-2 fuzzy logic is a generalization of conventional fuzzy logic (type-1) in the sense that uncertainty is not only limited to the linguistic variables but also is present in the definition of the membership functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>. Fuzzy Logic Systems are comprised of rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Quite often, the knowledge that is used to build these rules is uncertain. Such uncertainty leads to rules whose antecedents or consequents are uncertain, which translates into uncertain antecedent or consequent membership functions. Type-1 fuzzy systems, whose membership functions are type-1 fuzzy sets, are unable to directly handle such uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. We describe in this chapter, type-2 fuzzy systems, in which the antecedent or consequent membership functions are type-2 fuzzy sets. Such sets are fuzzy sets whose membership grades themselves are type-1 fuzzy sets; they are very useful in circumstances where it is difficult to determine an exact membership function for a fuzzy set <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The original fuzzy logic, founded by Lotfi Zadeh, has been around for more than 30 years, and yet it is unable to handle uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref>. That the original fuzzy logic (type-1 fuzzy logic) cannot do this sounds paradoxical because the word "fuzzy" has the connotation of uncertainty. The expanded fuzzy logic (type-2 fuzzy logic) is able to handle uncertainties because it can model and minimize their effects.</p><p>In what follows, we shall first introduce the basic concepts of type-2 fuzzy sets, and type-2 fuzzy reasoning. Then we will introduce and compare the different types of fuzzy inference systems that have been employed in various applications. We will also consider briefly type-2 fuzzy logic systems and the comparison to type-1 fuzzy systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Type-2 Fuzzy Sets</head><p>The concept of a type-2 fuzzy set, was introduced by Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref> as an extension of the concept of an ordinary fuzzy set (henceforth called a "type-1 fuzzy set"). A type-2 fuzzy set is characterized by a fuzzy membership function, i.e., the membership grade for each element of this set is a fuzzy set in [0,1], unlike a type-1 set where the membership grade is a crisp number in <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1]</ref>. Such sets can be used in situations where there is uncertainty about the membership grades themselves, e.g., an uncertainty in the shape of the membership function or in some of its parameters. Consider the transition from ordinary sets to fuzzy sets. When we cannot determine the membership of an element in a set as 0 or 1, we use fuzzy sets of type-1. Similarly, when the situation is so fuzzy that we have trouble determining the membership grade even as a crisp number in [0,1], we use fuzzy sets of type-2.</p><p>This does not mean that we need to have extremely fuzzy situations to use type-2 fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. There are many real-world problems where we cannot determine the exact form of the membership functions, e.g., in time series prediction because of noise in the data. Another way of viewing this is to consider type-1 fuzzy sets as a first order approximation to the uncertainty in the real-world. Then type-2 fuzzy sets can be considered as a second order approximation. Of course, it is possible to consider fuzzy sets of higher types but the complexity of the fuzzy system increases very rapidly. For this reason, we will only consider very briefly type-2 fuzzy sets. Lets consider some simple examples of type-2 fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. Corresponding to each value of σ, we will get a different membership curve (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.1). So, the membership grade of any particular x (except x=m) can take any of a number of possible values depending upon the value of σ, i.e., the membership grade is not a crisp number, it is a fuzzy set. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.1 shows the domain of the fuzzy set associated with x=0.7; however, the membership function associated with this fuzzy set is not shown in the figure.  This is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.3. Now, imagine that this membership of x is a fuzzy set. Let us call the domain elements of this set "primary memberships" of x (denoted by μ 1 ) and membership grades of these primary memberships "secondary memberships" of x [denoted by μ 2 (x, μ 1 )]. So, for a fixed x, we get a type-1 fuzzy set whose domain elements are primary memberships of x and whose corresponding membership grades are secondary memberships of x. If we assume that the secondary memberships follow a Gaussian with mean m(x) and standard deviation σ m , as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.3, we can describe the secondary membership function for each x as μ 2 (x,μ 1 ) = e -½ [(μ 1 -m(x))/ σ m ] 2  (2.4)</p><p>where μ 1 ∈ [0,1] and m is as in equation (2.3). We can formally define these two kinds of type-2 sets as follows.</p><p>Definition 2.1 Gaussian type-2 A Gaussian type-2 fuzzy set is one in which the membership grade of every domain point is a Gaussian type-1 set contained in [0,1]. Example 2.3 shows an example of a Gaussian type-2 fuzzy set. Another way of viewing type-2 membership functions is in a three-dimensional fashion, in which we can better appreciate the idea of type-2 fuzziness. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.4 we have a three-dimensional view of a type-2 Gaussian membership function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.2 Interval type-2</head><p>An interval type-2 fuzzy set is one in which the membership grade of every domain point is a crisp set whose domain is some interval contained in [0,1].</p><p>Example 2.1 shows an example of an interval type-2 fuzzy set. We will give some useful definitions on type-2 fuzzy sets in the following lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.3 Footprint of uncertainty</head><p>Uncertainty in the primary memberships of a type-2 fuzzy set, Ã, consists of a bounded region that we call the "footprint of uncertainty" (FOU). Mathematically, it is the union of all primary membership functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</p><p>We show as an illustration in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.5 the footprint of uncertainty for a type-2 Gaussian membership function. This footprint of uncertainty can be obtained by projecting in two dimensions the three-dimensional view of the type-2 Gaussian membership function. We illustrate the concept of upper and lower membership functions as well as the footprint of uncertainty in the following example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 2.4 Gaussian primary MF with uncertain standard deviation</head><p>For the Gaussian primary membership function with uncertain standard deviation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.1), the upper membership function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">upper(FOU(Ã)) = N(m, σ 2 ; x) (2.5)</formula><p>And the lower membership function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">lower(FOU(Ã)) = N(m, σ 1 ; x). (2.6)</formula><p>We will describe the operations and properties of type-2 fuzzy sets in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Operations of Type-2 Fuzzy Sets</head><p>In this section we describe the set theoretic operations of type-2 fuzzy sets. We are interested in the case of type-2 fuzzy sets, Ã i (i = 1,…,r), whose secondary membership functions are type-1 fuzzy sets. To compute the union, intersection, and complement of type-2 fuzzy sets, we need to extend the binary operations of minimum (or product) and maximum, and the unary operation of negation, from crisp numbers to type-1 fuzzy sets, because at each x, μ Ãi (x, u) is a function (unlike the type-1 case, where μ Ãi (x) is a crisp number). The tool for computing the union, intersection, and complement of type-2 fuzzy sets is Zadeh's extension principle.</p><p>Consider two type-2 fuzzy sets Ã 1 and Ã 2 , i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Ã 1 =  x μ Ã1 (x)/ x (2.7)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ã 2 =  x μ Ã2 (x)/ x (2.8)</formula><p>In this section, we focus our attention on set theoretic operations for such general type-2 fuzzy sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.5 Union of type-2 fuzzy sets</head><p>The union of Ã 1 and Ã 2 is another type-2 fuzzy set, just as the union of type-1 fuzzy sets A 1 and A 2 is another type-1 fuzzy set. More formally, we have the following expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ã 1 ∪ Ã 2 =  x∈X μ Ã1∪Ã2 (x)/ x (2.9)</formula><p>We can explain Equation (2.9) by the "join" operation. Basically, the join between two secondary membership functions must be performed between every possible pair of primary memberships. If more than one combination of pairs gives the same point, then in the join we keep the one with maximum membership grade. We will consider a simple example to illustrate the union operation. In </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 3.6 Intersection of type-2 fuzzy sets</head><p>The intersection of Ã 1 and Ã 2 is another type-2 fuzzy set, just as the intersection of type-1 fuzzy sets A 1 and A 2 is another type-1 fuzzy set. More formally, we have the following expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ã 1 ∩ Ã 2 =  x∈X μ Ã1∩Ã2 (x)/ x (2.10)</formula><p>We illustrate the intersection of two type-2 Gaussian membership functions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> We can explain Equation (2.10) by the "meet" operation. Basically, the meet between two secondary membership functions must be performed between every possible pair of primary memberships. If more than one combination of pairs gives the same point, then in the meet we keep the one with maximum membership grade.  The complement of set Ã is another type-2 fuzzy set, just as the complement of type-1 fuzzy set A is another type-1 fuzzy set. More formally we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Ã' =  x μ Ã'1 (x)/ x (2.11)</formula><p>where the prime denotes complement in the above equation. In this equation μ Ã'1 is a secondary membership function, i.e., at each value of x μ Ã'1 is a function (unlike the type-1 case where, at each value of x, μ Ã'1 is a point value).</p><p>Example 2.5 Type-2 fuzzy set operations In this example we illustrate the union, intersection and complement operations for two type-2 fuzzy sets Ã 1 and Ã 2 , and for a particular element x for which the secondary membership functions in these two sets are μ Ã1 (x) = 0.5/0.1 + 0.8/0.2 and μ Ã2 (x) = 0.4/0.5 + 0.9/0.9.

A higher-type number just indicates a higher "degree of fuzziness". Since a higher type changes the nature of the membership functions, the operations that depend on the membership functions change; however, the basic principles of fuzzy logic are independent of the nature of membership functions and hence, do not change. Rules of inference like Generalized Modus Ponens or Generalized Modus Tollens continue to apply.</p><p>The structure of the type-2 fuzzy rules is the same as for the type-1 case because the distinction between type-2 and type-1 is associated with the nature of the membership functions. Hence, the only difference is that now some or all the sets involved in the rules are of type-2. In a type-1 fuzzy system, where the output sets are type-1 fuzzy sets, we perform defuzzification in order to get a number, which is in some sense a crisp (type-0) representative of the combined output sets. In the type-2 case, the output sets are type-2; so we have to use extended versions of type-1 defuzzification methods. Since type-1 defuzzification gives a crisp number at the output of the fuzzy system, the extended defuzzification operation in the type-2 case gives a type-1 fuzzy set at the output. Since this operation takes us from the type-2 output sets of the fuzzy system to a type-1 set, we can call this operation "type reduction" and call the type-1 fuzzy set so obtained a "type-reduced set". The type-reduced fuzzy set may then be defuzzified to obtain a single crisp number; however, in many applications, the type-reduced set may be more important than a single crisp number.</p><p>Type-2 sets can be used to convey the uncertainties in membership functions of type-1 fuzzy sets, due to the dependence of the membership functions on available linguistic and numerical information. Linguistic information (e.g. rules from experts), in general, does not give any information about the shapes of the membership functions. When membership functions are determined or tuned based on numerical data, the uncertainty in the numerical data, e.g., noise, translates into uncertainty in the membership functions. In all such cases, any available information about the linguistic/numerical uncertainty can be incorporated in the type-2 framework. However, even with all of the advantages that fuzzy type-2 systems have, the literature on the applications of type-2 sets is scarce. Some examples are Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref> for decision making, and Wagenknecht &amp; Hartmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref> for solving fuzzy relational equations. We think that more applications of type-2 fuzzy systems will come in the near future as the area matures and the theoretical results become more understandable for the general public in the fuzzy arena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Singleton Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems</head><p>This section discusses the structure of a singleton type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLS), which is a system that accounts for uncertainties about the antecedents or consequents in rules, but does not explicitly account for input measurement uncertainties. More complicated (but, more versatile) non-singleton type-2 FLSs, which account for both types of uncertainties, are discussed later.</p><p>The basics of fuzzy logic do not change from type-1 to type-2 fuzzy sets, and in general will not change for type-n. A higher type number just indicates a higher degree of fuzziness. Since a higher type changes the nature of the membership functions, the operations that depend on the membership functions change, however, the basic principles of fuzzy logic are independent of the nature of membership functions and hence do not change. Rules of inference, like Generalized Modus Ponens, continue to apply.</p><p>A general type-2 FLS is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.9. As discussed before a type-2 FLS is very similar to type-1 FLS, the major structural difference being that the defuzzifier block of a type-1 FLS is replaced by the output processing block in type-2 FLS. That block consists of type-reduction followed by defuzzification.</p><p>During our development of a type-2 FLS, we assume that all the antecedent and consequent sets in rules are type-2, however, this need not necessarily be the case in practice. All results remain valid as long as long as just one set is type-2. This means that a FLS is type-2 as long as any one of its antecedent or consequent sets is type-2. In the type-1 case, we generally have fuzzy if-then rules of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R l : IF x 1 is A l 1 and … x p is A l p , THEN y is Y l l = 1,…, M (2.12)</formula><p>As mentioned earlier, the distinction between type-1 and type-2 is associated with the nature of the membership functions, which is not important when forming the rules. The structure of the rules remains exactly the same in the type-2 case, but now some or all of the sets involved are type-2. Consider a type-2 FLS having r inputs x 1 ∈ X 1 , …, x r ∈ X r and one output y ∈ Y. As in the type-1 case, we can assume that there are M rules; but, in the type-2 case the lth rule has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R l : IF x 1 is Ã l 1 and … x p is Ã l p , THEN y is ì l l = 1,…, M<label>(2.13)</label></formula><p>This rule represents a type-2 fuzzy relation between the input space X 1 × …× X r , and the output space, Y, of the type-2 fuzzy system. In a type-1 FLS the inference engine combines rules and gives a mapping from input type-1 fuzzy sets to output type-1 fuzzy sets. Multiple antecedents in rules are combined by the t-norm. The membership grades in the input sets are combined with those in the output sets using composition. Multiple rules may be combined using the t-conorm or during defuzzification by weighted summation. In the type-2 case the inference process is very similar. The inference engine combines rules and gives a mapping from input type-2 fuzzy sets to output type-2 fuzzy sets. To do this one needs to compute unions and intersections of type-2 fuzzy sets, as well as compositions of type-2 relations.</p><p>In the type-2 fuzzy system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.9), as in the type-1 fuzzy system, crisp inputs are first fuzzified into fuzzy input sets that then activate the inference block, which in the present case is associated with type-2 fuzzy sets. In this section, we describe singleton fuzzification and the effect of such fuzzification on the inference engine. The "fuzzifier" maps a crisp point</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">x = (x 1 ,…, x r ) T ∈ X 1 × X 2 … × X r ≡ X into a type-2 fuzzy set Ã x in X.</formula><p>The type-2 output of the inference engine shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.9 must be processed next by the output processor, the first operation of which is type-reduction. Type-reduction methods include: centroid, center-of-sums, height, modified height, and center-of-sets. Lets assume that we perform centroid type-reduction. Then each element of the type-reduced set is the centroid of some embedded type-1 set for the output type-2 set of the FLS. Each of these embedded sets can be thought of as an output set of an associated type-1 FLS, and, correspondingly, the type-2 FLS can be viewed of as a collection of many different type-1 FLSs. Each type-1 FLS is embedded in the type-2 FLS; hence, the type-reduced set is a collection of the outputs of all of the embedded type-1 FLSs (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.10). The typereduced set lets us represent the output of the type-2 FLS as a fuzzy set rather than as a crisp number, which is something that cannot be done with a type-1 fuzzy system.</p><p>Referring to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.10, when the antecedent and consequent membership functions of the type-2 FLS have continuous domains, the number of embedded sets is uncountable. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.10 shows a situation in which we have assumed that the membership functions have discrete (or discretized) domains. The memberships in the type-reduced set, μ Y (y i ), represent the level of uncertainty associated with each embedded type-1 FLS. A crisp output can be obtained by aggregating the outputs of all embedded type-1 FLSs by, e.g., finding the centroid of the typereduced set.</p><p>If all of the type-2 uncertainties were to disappear, the secondary membership functions for all antecedents and consequents would each collapse to a single point, which shows that the type-2 FLS collapses to a type-1 FLS. If we think of a type-2 FLS as a "perturbation" of a type-1 FLS, due to uncertainties in their membership functions, then the type-reduced set of the type-2 FLS can be thought of as representing the uncertainty in the crisp output due to the perturbation. Some measure of the spread of the type-reduced set may then be taken to indicate the possible variation in the crisp output due to the perturbation. This is analogous to using confidence intervals in a stochastic-uncertainty situation.</p><p>We defuzzify the type-reduced set to get a crisp output from the type-2 FLS. The most natural way to do this seems to be finding the centroid of the typereduced set. Finding the centroid is equivalent to finding the weighted average of the outputs of all the type-1 FLSs that are embedded in the type-2 FLS, where the weights correspond to the memberships in the type-reduced set (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.10). If the type-reduced set Y for an input x is discretized or is discrete and consists of α points, then the expression for its centroid is</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">y(x) = [ α k=1 y k μ Y (y k ) ]/ [ α k=1 μ Y (y k ) ] (2.14)</formula><p>If α is large then data storage may be a problem for the computation of Equation <ref type="bibr">(2.14)</ref>. This equation can, however, be evaluated using parallel processing, in this case data storage will not be problem. Currently, however, most researchers</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Embedded type-1 FLS #2 Embedded type-1 FLS #1 Embedded type-1 FLS #α μ Y (y 1 ) μ Y (y 2 ) μ Y (y α )</formula><p>Aggregator still depend on software for simulations and cannot make use of parallel processing. We can, however, use a recursive method to vastly reduce the memory required for storing the data that are needed to compute the defuzzification output. From Equation (2.14), we can calculate</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">A(i) = A(i-1) + y i μ Y (y i ) A(0) = 0 (2.15)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">B(i) = B(i-1) + y i μ Y (y i ) B(0) = 0 (2.16)</formula><p>for i =1,…, α. With these formulas we just need to store A and B during each iteration.</p><p>From our previous discussions about the five elements that comprise the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.9 type-2 FLS, we see that there are many possibilities to choose from, even more than for a type-1 FLS. To begin, we must decide on the kind of defuzzification (singleton or non-singleton). We must also choose a FOU for each type-2 membership function, decide on the functional forms for both the primary and secondary membership functions, and choose the parameters of the membership functions (fixed a-priori or tuned during a training procedure). Then we need to choose the composition (max-min, max-product), implication (minimum, product), type-reduction method (centroid, center-of-sums, height, modified height, center-of-sets), and defuzzifier. Clearly, there is an even greater richness among type-2 FLSs than there is among type-1 FLSs. In other words, there are more design degrees of freedom associated with a type-2 FLS than with a type-1 FLS; hence, a type-2 FLS has the potential to outperform a type-1 FLS because of the extra degrees of freedom.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Introduction</head><p>Uncertainty affects decision-making and appears in a number of different forms. The concept of information is fully connected with the concept of uncertainty. The most fundamental aspect of this connection is that the uncertainty involved in any problem-solving situation is a result of some information deficiency, which may be incomplete, imprecise, fragmentary, not fully reliable, vague, contradictory, or deficient in some other way. Uncertainty is an attribute of information. The general framework of fuzzy reasoning allows handling much of this uncertainty; fuzzy systems employ type-1 fuzzy sets, which represent uncertainty by numbers in the range [0, 1]. When something is uncertain, like a measurement, it is difficult to determine its exact value, and of course type-1 fuzzy sets make more sense than using sets. However, it is not reasonable to use an accurate membership function for something uncertain, so in this case what we need is another type of fuzzy sets, those which are able to handle these uncertainties, the so called type-2 fuzzy sets. So, the amount of uncertainty in a system can be reduced by using type-2 fuzzy logic because it offers better capabilities to handle linguistic uncertainties by modeling vagueness and unreliability of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, we have seen the use of type-2 fuzzy sets in Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLS) in different areas of application <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. A novel approach for realizing the vision of ambient intelligence in ubiquitous computing environments (UCEs), is based on embedding intelligent agents that use type-2 fuzzy systems which are able to handle the different sources of uncertainty and imprecision in UCEs to give a good response <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. There are also papers with emphasis on the implementation of type-2 FLS and in others, it is explained how type-2 fuzzy sets let us model and minimize the effects of uncertainties in rule-base FLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">76]</ref>. There is also a paper that provides mathematical formulas and computational flowcharts for computing the derivatives that are needed to implement steepestdescent parameter tuning algorithms for type-2 fuzzy logic systems. Some research works are devoted to solve real world applications in different areas, for example in signal processing, type-2 fuzzy logic is applied in prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time-series with uniform noise presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56]</ref>. In medicine, an expert system was developed for solving the problem of Umbilical Acid-Base (UAB) assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>.

It is a well known fact, that in the control of real systems, the instrumentation elements (instrumentation amplifier, sensors, digital to analog, analog to digital converters, etc.) introduce some sort of unpredictable values in the information that has been collected <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. So, the controllers designed under idealized conditions tend to behave in an inappropriate manner. Since, uncertainty is inherent in the design of controllers for real world applications; we are presenting how to deal with this problem using type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC), to reduce the effects of imprecise information <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61]</ref>. We are supporting this statement with experimental results, qualitative observations, and quantitative measures of errors. For quantifying the errors, we utilized three widely used performance criteria, these are: Integral of Square Error (ISE), Integral of the Absolute value of the Error (IAE), and Integral of the Time multiplied by the Absolute value of the Error (ITAE).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Systems</head><p>In the 40's and 50's, many researchers proved that dynamic systems could be mathematically modeled using differential equations. In these works we have the foundations of the Control Theory, which in addition with the Transform Theory (Laplace's Theory), provided an extremely powerful means of analyzing and designing control systems. These theories were developed until the 70's, when the area was called Systems Theory to indicate its definitiveness.</p><p>Soft computing techniques have become an important research topic, which can be applied in the design of intelligent controllers. These techniques have tried to avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks, and they allow us to obtain efficient controllers, which utilize the human experience in a more natural form than the conventional mathematical approach. In the cases in which a mathematical representation of the controlled system is difficult to obtain, the process operator has the knowledge, the experience to express the relationships existing in the process behavior.</p><p>A FLS, described completely in terms of type-1 fuzzy sets is called a type-1 fuzzy logic system (type-1 FLS). It is composed by a knowledge base, which comprises the information given by the process operator in form of linguistic control rules, a fuzzification interface, which has the effect of transforming crisp data into fuzzy sets, and inference system, which uses the fuzzy sets in conjunction with the knowledge base to make inferences by means of a reasoning method. Finally, a defuzzification interface, which translates the fuzzy control action so obtained to a real control action using a defuzzification method.</p><p>In this chapter, the implementation of the fuzzy controller in terms of type-1 fuzzy sets, has two input variables, which are the error e(t), the difference between the reference signal and the output of the process, as well as the error variation Δe(t),</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">) ( ) ( ) ( t y t r t e - = (3.1) ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( - - = Δ t e t e t e</formula><p>(3.2) so the control system can be represented as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.1. </p></div>

Hence, a type-2 membership grade can be any subset in [0,1], the primary membership, and corresponding to each primary membership, there is a secondary membership (which can also be in [0,1]) that defines the possibilities for the primary membership. Uncertainty is represented by a region, which is called the footprint of uncertainty (FOU). When  A FLS described using at least one type-2 fuzzy set is called a type-2 FLS. Type-1 FLSs are unable to directly handle rule uncertainties, because they use type-1 fuzzy sets that are certain. On the other hand, type-2 FLSs, are very useful in circumstances where it is difficult to determine an exact membership function, and there are measurement uncertainties.</p><p>It is known that type-2 fuzzy sets enable modeling and minimizing the effects of uncertainties in rule-based FLS. Unfortunately, type-2 fuzzy sets are more difficult to use and understand than type-1 fuzzy sets; hence, their use is not widespread yet. As a justification for the use of type-2 fuzzy sets, are mentioned at least four sources of uncertainties not considered in type-1 FLSs:</p><p>1. The meanings of the words that are used in the antecedents and consequents of rules can be uncertain (words mean different things to different people).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Consequents may have histogram of values associated with them, especially</head><p>when knowledge is extracted from a group of experts who do not all agree. 3. Measurements that activate a type-1 FLS may be noisy and therefore uncertain. 4. The data used to tune the parameters of a type-1 FLS may also be noisy.</p><p>All of these uncertainties translate into uncertainties about fuzzy set membership functions. Type-1 fuzzy sets are not able to directly model such uncertainties because their membership functions are totally crisp. On the other hand, type-2 fuzzy sets are able to model such uncertainties because their membership functions are themselves fuzzy. A type-1 fuzzy set is a special case of a type-2 fuzzy set; its secondary membership function is a subset with only one element, unity.</p><p>A type-2 FLS is again characterized by IF-THEN rules, but its antecedent or consequent sets are now of type-2. Type-2 FLSs, can be used when the circumstances are too uncertain to determine exact membership grades such as when the training data is corrupted by noise. Similar to a type-1 FLS, a type-2 FLS includes a fuzzifier, a rule base, fuzzy inference engine, and an output processor, as we can see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.5. The output processor includes type-reducer and defuzzifier; it generates a type-1 fuzzy set output (from the type-reducer) or a crisp number (from the defuzzifier) <ref type="bibr">(Mendel, 2005)</ref>.

A set of five experiments is described in this section. The first two experiments were performed in ideal conditions, i.e., without any kind of disturbance. In the last three experiments, Gaussian noise was added to the feedback loop with the purpose of simulating, in a global way, the effects of uncertainty from several sources. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.1 shows the feedback control system that was used for obtaining the simulation results.

In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.3, we listed the obtained values of ISE, IAE, and ITAE for this experiment.

By visual inspection, we can observe that the output system' response of the Experiment 1, and this one, are similar as it is shown in Figures 3.17  In uncertainty absence, the IAE values obtained at the plant's output are very similar for type-1 and type-2 FLCs, here is more evident that a type-1 FLC works a little better than in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.17.</p><p>Experiment 3: System with uncertainty using a type-1 FLC.

We can appreciate from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.20 that the lower overshoot and the best settling times are reached using a type-2 FLC. In Figures 3.21 and 3.22, we can see that with a type-2 FLC the overshoot error decreases very quickly and it remains lower than using a type-1 FLC. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.23, we can observe that through time the lower errors are obtained using a type-2 FLC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Summary</head><p>We have presented the study of the controllers' design for nonlinear control systems using type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic. We presented five experiments where we simulated the systems' responses with and without uncertainty presence. In the experiments, a quantification of errors was achieved and documented in tables for different criteria such as ISE, IAE, and ITAE, it was shown that the lower overshoot errors and the best settling times were obtained using a type-2 FLC. Based on the experimental results, we can say that the best results are obtained using type-2 fuzzy systems. In our opinion, this is because type-2 fuzzy sets that are used in type-2 fuzzy systems can handle uncertainties in a better way because they provide us with more parameters and more design degrees of freedom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Introduction</head><p>Stability has been one of the central issues concerning fuzzy control since Mamdani's pioneer work. Most of the critical comments to fuzzy control are due to the lack of a general method for its stability analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. But as Zadeh often points out, fuzzy control has been accepted by the fact that it is task-oriented control, while conventional control is characterized as setpointoriented control, and hence do not need a mathematical analysis of stability. Also, as Sugeno has mentioned, in general, in most industrial applications, the stability of control is not fully guaranteed and the reliability of a control hardware system is considered to be more important than the stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The success of fuzzy control, however, does not imply that we do not need a stability theory for it. Perhaps the main drawback of the lack of stability analysis would be that we cannot take a model-based approach to fuzzy control design. In conventional control theory, a feedback controller can be primarily designed so that a close-loop system becomes stable. This approach of course restricts us to setpoint-oriented control, but stability theory will certainly give us a wider view on the future development of fuzzy control.</p><p>Therefore, many researchers have worked to improve the performance of the FLC's and ensure their stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Li and Gatland in 1995 proposed a more systematic design method for PD and PI-type FLC's. Choi, Kwak and Kim present a single-input FLC ensuring stability. Ying in 1994 presented a practical design method for nonlinear fuzzy controllers, and many other researchers have results on the matter of the stability of FLC's, and Cázarez et al., in 2008 presents an extension of the Margaliot work to built stable type-2 fuzzy logic controllers in Lyapunov sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>. This work is based on Margaliot´s work, we use the Fuzzy Lyapunov Synthesis to build an Stable Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller for a 1 Degree of Freedom (DOF) manipulator robot, first without gravity effect to prove stability, and then with gravity effect to prove the robustness of the controller. The same criteria can be used for any number of DOF manipulator robots, linear or nonlinear, and any kind of plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>This chapter is organized as follows: In Section 4.2 we present an introductory explanation of type-1 and type-2 FLC's. In Section 4.3 we extend Margaliot's result to build a general rule base for any type (1 or 2) of FLC's. Experimental results are presented in Section 4.4 and the summary is given in Section 4.5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Summary</head><p>Margaliot's approach for the design of FLC's is now proved to be valid for both, Type-1 and Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers. In the case of Type-2 FLC's membership functions, we can perturb or change the definition domain of the FOU without losing of stability of the controller; in the case described in this chapter, we have to use an adaptive gain to regulate the plant in a desired time. For our example of the 1DOF manipulator robot, stability holds when extending the FOU on the domain [0,1), and we also have shown that a FLC designed following the Fuzzy Lyapunov Synthesis is stable and robust.</p></div>

A fuzzy inference system (FIS) consists of three stages: Fuzzification, Inference and Defuzzification. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_64">5</ref>.1, the fuzzy system information processing is shown. Uncertainty is an attribute of information, which may be incomplete, inaccurate, vague, weak, contradictory, and so on.</p><p>The type-2 fuzzy systems consist of four stages: Fuzzification, Inference, Type Reduction and Defuzzification. We describe below these stages. The fuzzification maps a numeric value x=(x 1, … x p ) T ϵ X 1 × X 2 ×… × X p =X , into a type-2 fuzzy set A x in X. A x is a singleton fuzzy set if μ Ax =1/1 for x=x' and μ Ax =1/0 for all others x ǂ x'. The Inference (reasoning) stage consists of two blocks, the rules and the inference engine, it works the same way as for type-1 fuzzy systems, except the antecedents fuzzy sets and the consequent are represented by type-2 fuzzy sets. The process consists of combining the rules and map the input to the output (type-2 fuzzy sets), using the Join and Meet operations. The Type Reductor is used to convert all type-2 fuzzy sets to type-1 fuzzy intervals on the output. There are several methods to calculate the reduced set, such as joint center, center of sums, height, center joint, among others. The Defuzzification stage consists in obtaining a numeric value for the output. Using the COS type reductor <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, the defuzzification is an average value since the range is given by [y l ,y r ].</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_64">5</ref>.2, the type-2 fuzzy system information processing is shown. </p><formula xml:id="formula_60">' x 1 x 2 ' x 2 x ) ( 1 - A FOU X x f y ∈ = ) ( X x ∈ 1 X x ∈ 2 COS ) ' ( 1 1 x A - μ ) ' ( 1 1 x A - μ ) ' ( 2 x A - μ ) ' ( 2 x A - μ ) ' (× - A ) ' (× - A ) ( 2 - A FOU ) (× l f ) (× r f</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Introduction</head><p>This chapter focuses on the field of fuzzy logic and also considering the control area <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Both areas can work together to solve various problems, in this case the longitudinal flight control. Over time the airplanes have evolved and at the same time improving their techniques for controlling their flight and avoid accidents as much as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>. For this reason, we are considering in this paper the implementation of a system that controls the horizontal position of the aircraft. We created the fuzzy system to perform longitudinal control of the aircraft and then we used a simulation tool to test the fuzzy controller under noisy conditions. We designed the fuzzy controller with the purpose of maintaining the stability in horizontal flight of the aircraft by controlling only the movement of the elevators. We also use a genetic algorithm to optimize the fuzzy logic control design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Background and Basic Concepts</head><p>In this section we present the background of aviation and how it has been changing over time and also some basic concepts for understanding this work <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Aviation History</head><p>In 1680 Giovanni Borello studied the application of the flight muscles of birds and he came to the conclusion that a person could never fly by himself. In the nineteenth century Sir George Cayley established the modern concept of a plane and he applied the idea of a fixed wing capable of lifting the airplane. Cayley established the aerodynamics foundation. In 1804 Cayley constructed a plane and realized his first unmanned flights. Cayley worked during the 5 decades following in his prototype and in 1853 an assistant of Cayley performed a flight of short duration in the plane that was in England. In 1856 Jean-Marie Le Bris realized his first sky gliding flight higher than his point of departure thanks to the glider "L'Albatros Artificiel", which for takeoff was drawn by horses in the beach. Etienne Lenoir who was a Belgian inventor has the Credit for the first internal combustion engine in 1859, he developed only one horsepower and it was inefficient, but that resulted in billions of internal combustion engines have been built since then. Many people were part of that inventions and development of the aircraft up to date is in continue growth and development for the benefit of humanity. If we want to speak about a war plane we can say something about the F-14 airplane because it is the airplane that has been used for this task. The development of the F-14 came about because of the need to improve the aging American Fighters in use in the early days of the Cold War. Some form of upgrade was required if the United States was to maintain its competitive edge over the Soviet Union. As a result, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force teamed up to explore the possibility of developing a fighter plane that would, as far as possible, be appropriate for the needs of both forces. The practical flight aircraft was only possible once there was the energy source capable of driving.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Control Surfaces</head><p>Every aircraft has control surfaces or other means which are used to generate the forces and moments required to produce the accelerations, which causes the aircraft to be steered along its three-dimensional flight path to its specified destination. A conventional aircraft is represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.1. It is shown with the usual control surfaces, namely elevator, ailerons, and rudder. Such conventional aircrafts have a fourth control, the change in thrust, which can be obtained from the engines. Many modern aircraft, particularly combat aircraft, have considerably more control surfaces, which produce additional control forces or moments. Some of these additional surfaces and motivators include horizontal and vertical canards, spoilers, variable cambered wings, reaction jets, differentially operating horizontal tails and movable fins. One characteristic of flight control is that the required motion often needs a number of control surfaces to be used simultaneously. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.3">Flight Maneuvers</head><p>Any aircraft is capable of 3 possible rotations about 3 mutually perpendicular axes whose intersection point is above the center of gravity of the airplane (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.2). As we can appreciate from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.2, Pitch is the type of rotation that is done on the Y axis of the plane and it can be represented as an ascent or descent of its nose. Roll is a movement around the longitudinal axis of the plane (X axis) and be seen as a lateral inclination thereof. Yaw is a rotation about the vertical axis (Z) of the plane, and produces a change in the horizontal direction of flight. Each flight maneuver is assigned to a particular type of control: side control, direction control and longitudinal control. The first one, controls the ailerons and if one of these is flexed downward, it results in an increased lift on the wing for causing the rise of the same, while if the wing is bent upward, the wing produces a sustainability decrease, encouraging the decline of the plane. The second one controls the rudder and this is done using the pedals. For a yaw movement to the right, the driver presses the right pedal, thus turning the rudder surface to the right. Finally, the longitudinal control is responsible for controlling the elevators and when we talk about longitudinal control we make reference to the pitching motion generated by the aircraft. All controlled flight consists of either one, or a combination or more than one, of these basic maneuvers. It is important to know what can happen if you have to control the flight of an airplane because, when back pressure is applied to the elevator control, the airplane's nose rises in relation to the pilot. When forward pressure is applied to the elevator control, the airplane's nose lowers in relation to the pilot. When right pressure is applied to the aileron control, the airplane's right wing lowers in relation to the pilot. When left pressure is applied to the aileron control, the airplane's left wing lowers in relation to the pilot. When pressure is applied to the right rudder pedal, the airplane's nose moves (yaws) to the right in relation to the pilot.

These forces are thrust, lift, weight, and drag (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.3). Thrust is the forward force produced by the powerplant/propeller. It opposes or overcomes the drag force. As a general rule, it is said to act parallel to the longitudinal axis. This is not always the case as explained later. Drag is a backward, retarding force, and is caused by disruption of airflow by the wing, fuselage, and other protruding objects. Drag opposes thrust, and acts rearward parallel to the relative wind. Weight is the combined load of the airplane itself, the crew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight pulls the airplane downward because of the force of gravity. It opposes lift, and acts vertically downward through the airplane's center of gravity (CG).</p><p>The lift opposes the downward force of weight, is produced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the wing, and acts perpendicular to the flight path through the wing's center of lift. Each airplane has a standard mathematical model and usually linear models are applied whose parameters are obtained from wind tunnel tests results using a scale model. These models are evaluated in each operation point with the information obtained in the tests. There are more sophisticated nonlinear models that approximate the aerodynamic coefficients by truncated Taylor series.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Genetic Algorithms</head><p>Genetic algorithms (GAs) are numerical optimization algorithms inspired by both natural selection and genetics. We can also say that the genetic algorithm is an optimization and search technique based on the principles of genetics and natural selection. A GA allows a population composed of many individuals to evolve under specified selection rules to a state that maximizes the "fitness". The method is a general one, capable of being applied to an extremely wide range of problems. The algorithms are simple to understand and the required computer code easy to write <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</p><p>GAs were in essence proposed by John Holland in the 1960's. His reasons for developing such algorithms went far beyond the type of problem solving with which this work is concerned. His 1975 book, Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems (recently re-issued with additions) is particularly worth reading for its visionary approach. More recently others, for example De Jong, in a paper entitled Genetic Algorithms are NOT Function Optimizers , have been keen to remind us that GAs are potentially far more than just a robust method for estimating a series of unknown parameters within a model of a physical system.</p><p>A typical algorithm might consist of the following:</p><p>1. Start with a randomly generated population of n l-bit chromosomes (candidate solutions to a problem).</p><p>2. Calculate the fitness ƒ(x) of each chromosome x in the population.</p><p>3. Repeat the following steps until n offspring have been created: A. Select a pair of parent chromosomes from the current population, the probability of selection being an increasing function of fitness. Selection is done "with replacement," meaning that the same chromosome can be selected more than once to become a parent. B. With probability p c (the "crossover probability" or "crossover rate"), cross over the pair at a randomly chosen point (chosen with uniform probability) to form two offspring. If no crossover takes place, form two offspring that are exact copies of their respective parents. (Note that here the crossover rate is defined to be the probability that two parents will cross over in a single point. There are also "multi-point crossover" versions of the GA in which the crossover rate for a pair of parents is the number of points at which a crossover takes place.) C. Mutate the two offspring at each locus with probability pm (the mutation probability or mutation rate), and place the resulting chromosomes in the new population. If n is odd, one new population member can be discarded at random. 4. Replace the current population with the new population.</p><p>5. Go to step 2. Some of the advantages of a GA include: • Optimizes with continuous or discrete variables, • Doesn't require derivative information, • Simultaneously searches from a wide sampling of the cost surface, • Deals with a large number of variables, • Is well suited for parallel computers, • Optimizes variables with extremely complex cost surfaces (they can jump out of a local minimum),</p><p>• Provides a list of optimal values for the variables, not just a single solution,</p><p>• Codification of the variables so that the optimization is done with the encoded variables, and</p><p>• Works with numerically generated data, experimental data, or analytical functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Problem Description</head><p>The purpose of this work was to develop an optimal fuzzy system for automatic control to maintain the aircraft in horizontal flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. The goal was to create the fuzzy system to perform longitudinal control of the aircraft and also to use a simulation facility to test the fuzzy controller with noise. The main goal was to achieve the stability in horizontal flight of the aircraft by controlling only the movement of the elevators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">PID Control and Fuzzy System for Longitudinal Control</head><p>If we want to use the longitudinal control we need to use 3 elements, which are: a) Stick: The lever of the pilot. Moving the control stick backwards (toward the pilot) will rise the nose of the plane, and if push forward there is a lowering of the nose of the plane. b) Angle of attack(α). c) Rate of elevation (q): The speed at which an aircraft climbs.</p><p>We need the elements above mentioned to perform elevator control. The comparison of the control system was carried out first using the PID controller (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.4) for longitudinal control and then we compared the results obtained with the same plant but using a fuzzy controller that was created and eventually carried out the simulation of the 2 controllers and the comparison of the results of fuzzy control with respect to PID control.  The fuzzy system that we used as a controller has 3 membership functions for each of the inputs and 3 membership functions of the output. We worked with different types of membership functions, such as the Gaussian, Bell, Trapezoidal and Triangular. The rules that we used for the fuzzy system are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.6. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Simulation Results</head><p>In this section we present the results obtained when performing the tests using the simulation plant with the PID and Fuzzy controllers. It also presents the results obtained by optimizing the fuzzy system with a genetic algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.1">Results with PID Controller</head><p>The first simulation was performed with the PID controller and we obtained the elevators behavior shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.7. We obtained an average elevator angle of 0.2967. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.2">Results with the Fuzzy Controller</head><p>Once the simulation results with the PID Controller were obtained, we proceeded with our Fuzzy Controller (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.8) using the fuzzy system that was created previously.  Having obtained the above results, we used a genetic algorithm to optimize the membership functions of the fuzzy system <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and after implementing the genetic algorithm we obtained the optimized results shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.2. The fitness function of the GA is based on the error between the PID and fuzzy controllers as shown in:</p><p>Where Y PID the output of the PID controller, Y FS is the output of fuzzy controller and n is the number of points used in the comparison. Given the above results we can see that better results were obtained using genetic algorithms and in particular the best result was using Membership functions of triangular type. The best fuzzy system that the genetic algorithm produced is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.10. The convergence of Genetic Algorithms is shown in Fig 6 .9. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 6.9. Convergence graph of Genetic Algorithms</head><p>As we can appreciate when we used the genetic algorithm the best result that we obtained was when we worked using triangular membership functions because we obtained an error of 0.0261. The best fuzzy system generated by the genetic algorithm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.10. When we performed the simulation in our plant, we started using square wave form and we obtained the previous results. We also worked with a sine wave form as a reference obtaining the following results (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.3). When we apply the Genetic Algorithm using sine wave in our simulation plant we could observe differences between the simulations (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.11). As we mentioned before we used 4 types of membership functions, such as bell, gauss, trapezoidal and triangular.</p><p>At the time of carrying out the simulation the error was 0.004 using bell membership functions, as we can appreciate this is the better result. The decrease of error is because when we work with sine wave at the time of carrying out the simulation, our plant does not have many problems for the type of waveform and that is because the sine wave is easy to follow(more continues). When we work using square wave we have more complex behavior because this kind of wave is more difficult. To consider a more challenging problem we decided to continue working with square wave and in this form improve our controller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 6.11. Convergence graph of Genetic Algorithms</head><p>We were also interested in improving the controller by adding noise to the plant. We decided to use Gaussian noise to simulate uncertainty in the control process.</p><p>The Gaussian Noise Generator block generates discrete-time white Gaussian noise. You must specify the Initial seed vector in the simulation. The Mean Value and the Variance can be either scalars or vectors. If either of these is a scalar, then the block applies the same value to each element of a sample-based output or each column of a frame-based output. Individual elements or columns, respectively, are uncorrelated with each other. When the Variance is a vector, its length must be the same as that of the Initial seed vector. In this case, the covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements come from the Variance vector. Since the off-diagonal elements are zero, the output Gaussian random variables are uncorrelated. When the Variance is a square matrix, it represents the covariance matrix. Its off-diagonal elements are the correlations between pairs of output Gaussian random variables. In this case, the Variance matrix must be positive definite and it must be N-by-N, where N is the length of the Initial seed.</p><p>The probability density function of the n-dimensional Gaussian noise is expressed as follows:</p><p>Where x is a length-n vector, K is the n-by-n covariance matrix, µ is the mean value vector, and the superscript T indicates transpose matrix. The Gaussian Noise Generator block in plant is shown in Fig 6 .12. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_118">6</ref>.12. Simulation Plant with Gaussian Noise.</p><p>As we mentioned previously, we worked using Gaussian noise and when you want to work with Gaussian noise you have to specify previously mentioned values as shown in Fig. We started to use 41 in the initial seed, as we obtained the results and we decided to use a higher value of initial seed. When we simulated, we obtain the results shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.5. In this case a type-2 fuzzy system (last row) produces a better result when the noise level is sufficiently high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7">Summary</head><p>Based on the results obtained with the proposed method we can say that to achieve control of the plane in the Pitch axis, the fuzzy controller is a good alternative to achieve good control of the elevators and maintain the aircraft on the Pitch axis as required.</p><p>The result that we obtained was better when genetic algorithm optimization with triangular type membership functions was used. It is important to consider different membership functions because the differences can be appreciated and the best result can be selected. When we worked with a higher level of noise in our simulation plant, the type-2 fuzzy controller achieved a good result and the error was less than the previously obtained with type-1 fuzzy systems.</p><p>It is important to know that when working with a higher level of noise in most cases the result will be better if type-2 fuzzy systems are used because they can endure more uncertainty than type-1 fuzzy systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Introduction</head><p>Optimization is a term used to refer to a branch of computational science concerned with finding the "best" solution to a problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>. Here, "best" refers to an acceptable (or satisfactory) solution, which may be the absolute best over a set of candidate solutions, or any of the candidate solutions. The characteristics and requirements of the problem determine whether the overall best solution can be found. Optimization algorithms are search methods, where the goal is to find a solution to an optimization problem, such that a given quantity is optimized, possibly subject to a set of constraints. Some optimization methods are based on populations of solutions. Unlike the classic methods of improvement for trajectory tracking, in this case each iteration of the algorithm has a set of solutions. These methods are based on generating, selecting, combining and replacing a set of solutions. Since they maintain and they manipulate a set, instead of a unique solution throughout the entire search process, they use more computer time than other metaheuristic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. This fact can be aggravated because the "convergence" of the population requires a great number of iterations. For this reason a concerted effort has been dedicated to obtaining methods that are more aggressive and manage to obtain solutions of quality in a nearer horizon. This chapter is concerned with bio-inspired optimization methods where a hybrid PSO-GA is proposed. In this case, we combine each method in order to obtain the best feature to design an optimal fuzzy controller (FLC) applied for linear systems. We expect better results from the hybrid PSO-GA method than those traditional methods like GA and PSO. Also we compare the proposed method with genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization used separately. The bioinspired methods are used to find the parameters of the membership functions to obtain the optimal FLC to stabilize the plant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related work:</head><p>Up to date there are several research papers using genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization for different optimization problems like mathematical functions, fuzzy controllers, control parameters, the vehicle trajectories, scheduling problems and many more <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">82]</ref>.

Section 3 introduces the controller design where a Hybrid PSO-GA is used to select the parameters of the membership functions of the FLC, GA and PSO are also applied for comparison purposes. Robustness properties of the closed-loop system are achieved with a fuzzy logic control system using a Takagi-Sugeno model where the error and the change of error, are considered as the linguistic variables.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Theoretical Basis and Problem Statement</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1">Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)</head><p>PSO is a population based stochastic optimization technique developed by Eberhart and Kennedy in 1995, inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. PSO shares many similarities with evolutionary computation techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA). The system is initialized with a population of random solutions and searches for optima by updating generations. However, unlike the GA, the PSO has no evolution operators such as crossover and mutation. In the PSO, the potential solutions, called particles, fly through the problem space by following the current optimum particles. Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space, which are associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far (The fitness value is also stored). This value is called pbest. Another "best" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle. This location is called lbest. When a particle takes all the population as its topological neighbors, the best value is a global best and is called gbest.</p><p>The particle swarm optimization concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO). Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random numbers being generated for acceleration toward pbest and lbest locations. In the past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in many research and application areas. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods. Another reason that PSO is attractive is that there are few parameters to adjust. One version, with slight variations, works well in a wide variety of applications. Particle swarm optimization has been used for approaches that can be used across a wide range of applications, as well as for specific applications focused on a specific requirement.</p></div>

GA assumes that the potential solution of any problem is an individual and can be represented by a set of parameters. These parameters are regarded as the genes of a chromosome and can be structured by a string of values in binary form. A positive value, generally know as a fitness value, is used to reflect the degree of "goodness" of the chromosome for the problem which would be highly related with its objective value <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>. The GA works as follows:</p><p>1. Start with a randomly generated population of n chromosomes (candidate solutions to a problem). 2. Calculate the fitness of each chromosome in the population. 3. Repeat the following steps until n offspring have been created: a. Select a pair of parent chromosomes from the current population, the probability of selection being an increasing function of fitness. Selection is done with replacement, meaning that the same chromosome can be selected more than once to become a parent. b. With probability (crossover rate), perform crossover to the pair at a randomly chosen point to a form two offspring. c. Mutate the two offspring at each locus with probability (mutation rate), and place the resulting chromosomes in the new population. 4. Replace the current population with the new population. 5. Go to step 2. The simple procedure just described above is the basis for most applications of GAs.</p></div>

The hybrid method uses the same population/swarm in the two methods in the same iteration obtaining the best individual/particle. PSO and GA communicate with each other; every four iterations the best individual/particle is injected into the population of the worst method and vice versa. We used the maximum number of iteration/generations to stop the method keeping only the best FLC obtained.

For the FLC a Takagi-Sugeno type of fuzzy system is used with two inputs a) error, and b) error change, with three membership functions for each input, "Negative, Zero and Positive" (Gaussian and triangular), and one output, defined with constant values.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">8</ref>.1 shows the Fuzzy Rules.  Once we obtained the FLC design, we set the parameters of both methods: the GA chromosome has 17 genes of real values that represent the two inputs, error and error change and one output constant values and using different values in the genetic operator's; mutation and single point crossover. We use different values for the cognitive, social parameters of the PSO and inertial value to balance the swarm. For the hybrid PSO-GA method we apply the same parameter configuration used in GA and PSO. The three bio-inspired methods use the same space of solutions (population) that we use to find the optimal values of the parameters of the membership functions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">8</ref>.2 shows the parameters of the membership functions, the minimal and the maximum values in the search range for the Hybrid PSO-GA, GA and PSO to find the best fuzzy controller system for the linear plants.                    </p></div>

In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">8</ref>.9 we show the comparison of the optimization methods and we can observe a significant difference in the results obtained by hybrid PSO-GA with respect to the GA and PSO results obtained separately in plant 2 which is more complex to solve. We apply a t-Student test using the Minitab 15.1 to compare the proposed method with each GA and PSO individually for Plant 1 and Plant 2. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">8</ref>.10 shows the t-Student test for the comparison of the GA and PSO with the hybrid PSO-GA for Plant 1 and Plant 2. Since the t-Value is sufficiently high, we can conclude that there exists sufficient statistical evidence to say that the hybrid PSO-GA is better than GA and PSO for Plant 2. In the case of Plant 1, we obtain better results with the GA and PSO because the problem is not sufficiently complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5">Summary</head><p>We described in this chapter the application of bio-inspired methods to design optimized fuzzy logic controllers using genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and a hybrid PSO-GA method. To test these optimized FLCs we use different plants. In particular we presented results of a genetic algorithm, PSO and a hybrid PSO-GA, using two benchmark problems with different level of complexity. The main result shows that the optimal FLC gets stability in less than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the FLCs obtained by PSO are better than the FLC's obtained by the GA because the PSO is less time consuming in the process and achieves lower overshoot in one of the plants, the plots of the results shows this difference. However the results obtained by the hybrid method show the best result in plant 2 with respect to the other two methods; based in this fact we feel that the hybrid method will obtain better results when used in more complex problems. The t-Student test applied to the hybrid PSO-GA with respect to the GA and PSO for the Plant 2, shows that there exists sufficient statistical evidence to confirm a significant difference in the results with a 95% of confidence.</p><p>We have achieved satisfactory results with the GA, PSO and the hybrid PSO-GA; the next step is to solve the problem using Type-2 FLC in a perturbed environment and considering multiple objective optimization to obtain better results. Moreover, in the future we will extend the results for nonlinear systems. </p></div>

The use of new methods for handling incomplete information is of fundamental importance in engineering applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. We simulated the effects of uncertainty produced by the instrumentation elements in type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic controllers to perform a comparative analysis of the systems' response, in the presence of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. We are presenting an innovative idea to optimize interval type-2 membership functions using an average of two type-1 systems with the Human Evolutionary Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>; we are showing comparative results of the optimized proposed method. We found that the optimized membership functions for the inputs of a type-2 system increases the performance of the system for high noise levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1">Introduction</head><p>Uncertainty affects decision-making and appears in a number of different forms.</p><p>The concept of information is fully connected with the concept of uncertainty. The most fundamental aspect of this connection is that the uncertainty involved in any problem-solving situation is a result of some information deficiency, which may be incomplete, imprecise, fragmentary, not fully reliable, vague, contradictory, or deficient in some other way <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>. The general framework of fuzzy reasoning allows handling much of this uncertainty; fuzzy systems employ type-1 fuzzy sets, which represent uncertainty by numbers in the range [0, 1]. When something is uncertain, like a measurement, it is difficult to determine its exact value, and of course, type-1 fuzzy sets makes more sense than using crisp sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. However, it is not reasonable to use an accurate membership function for something uncertain, so in this case what we need is another type of fuzzy sets, those which are able to handle these uncertainties, the so called type-2 fuzzy sets. So, the amount of uncertainty in a system can be reduced by using type-2 fuzzy logic because it offers better capabilities to handle linguistic uncertainties by modeling vagueness and unreliability of information. In industry, type-2 fuzzy logic and neural networks has been used in the control of non-linear dynamic plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55]</ref>.</p><p>This chapter deals with the optimization of interval type-2 membership functions in a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). Since, uncertainty is inherent in controllers for real world applications, as a first step, we are presenting how to deal with it using type-2 FLC to diminish the effects of imprecise information. We are supporting this statement with experimental results, qualitative observations, and quantitative measures of errors. For quantifying the errors, we utilized three widely used performance criteria, these are: Integral of Square Error (ISE), Integral of the Absolute value of the Error (IAE), and Integral of the Time multiplied by the Absolute value of the Error (ITAE). Then as a second step, we optimized the parameters of the Gaussian membership functions (MFs) using the Human Evolutionary Model (HEM) which will be explained in section 9.3, and ISE as the fitness function. In this case, we used as an output, the average of two type-1 system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2">Fuzzy Controllers</head><p>A FLS, described completely in terms of type-1 fuzzy sets is called a type-1 fuzzy logic system (type-1 FLS). It is composed by a knowledge base that comprises the information given by the process operator in form of linguistic control rules; a fuzzification interface, who has the effect of transforming crisp data into fuzzy sets; an inference system, that uses them in conjunction with the knowledge base to make inference by means of a reasoning method; and a defuzzification interface, which translates the fuzzy control action so obtained to a real control action using a defuzzification method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>. In this chapter, the implementation of the fuzzy controller in terms of type-1 fuzzy sets, has two input variables such as the error e(t), the difference between the reference signal and the output of the process, as well as the error variation Δe(t),</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">) ( ) ( ) ( t y t r t e - =<label>( 9 . 1 ) ) 1 ( ) ( )</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_67">( - - = Δ t e t e t e ( 9 .</formula><p>2 ) so the control system can be represented as in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>.1. A FLS described using at least one type-2 fuzzy set is called a type-2 FLS. Type-1 FLSs are unable to directly handle rule uncertainties, because they use type-1 fuzzy sets that are certain. On the other hand, type-2 FLSs, are very useful in circumstances where it is difficult to determine an exact certainty, and measurement uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Similar to a type-1 FLS, a type-2 FLS includes fuzzifier, rule base, fuzzy inference engine, and output processor <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. The output processor includes type-reducer and defuzzifier; it generates a type-1 fuzzy set output (from the typereducer) or a crisp number (from the defuzzifier). A type-2 FLS is again characterized by IF-THEN rules, but its antecedent or consequent sets are now type-2. In the case of the implementation of the type-2 FLC, we have the same characteristics as in type-1 FLC, but we used type-2 fuzzy sets as membership functions for the inputs and for the output.</p><p>For evaluating the transient closed-loop response of a computer control system we can use the same criteria that normally are used for adjusting constants in PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controllers. These are:  </p><formula xml:id="formula_68"> ∞ = 0 | ) ( | ITAE dt t e t (<label>9 . 5 )</label></formula><p>The selection of the criteria depends on the type of response desired, the errors will contribute different for each criterion, so we have that large errors will increase the value of ISE more heavily than to IAE. ISE will favor responses with smaller overshoot for load changes, but ISE will give longer settling time. In ITAE, time appears as a factor, and therefore, ITAE will penalize heavily errors that occur late in time, but virtually ignore errors that occur early in time.</p></div>

The third part in the individual representation is devoted to individual's fitness values. An individual p i is defined as p i =(gr i ,ge i ,fv i ) where gr i =(gr i1 ,…,gr iM ) is a vector (a row) of the matrix GR of dimension M × N. The genetic effects (ge i ) are rows in a matrix GE. In this method we can have one or several fitness values (fv), so we can handle single objective optimization problems (SOOP), and multiobjective optimization problems (MOOP). Fitness values are defined as vectors fv i 9.3 The Human Evolutionary Model 123 in the matrix FV J×N , in this way we have fv=(fv 1 ,…,fv J ). In this context, a population P i is defined as P i =(GR i +GE i +FV i ). In the attribute ge igender , we have the valid values set {M,F,0}, in this set M alludes a subpopulation of male individuals, F is used for the female subpopulation, and 0 means that this attribute will not be considered. The genetic attribute ge iactAge contains the actual age of an individual; its value corresponds to the number of generation that the individual has survived. We can set the maximum life expectance for each individual in the attribute ge i- maxAge . The task of the attribute ge iphLevel is to leave trace about which individuals have been involved in previous generations producing good offsprings. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>.3 shows the general structure of HEM. In Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>.3, we have a general description of HEM containing six main blocks. In the first block, we show that the human or group of humans is part of the system. HEM is an intelligent evolutionary algorithm that learns from experts their rational and intuitive procedures that they use to solve optimization problems. In this model, we consider that we have two kinds of humans: real human beings and artificial humans. In the first block of Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>.3 we show that real human beings form one class. In the second block, the artificial human implemented in the AIIS of HEM is shown. Humans as part of the system are in charge of teaching the artificial human all the knowledge needed for realizing the searching task. The AIIS should learn the rational and intuitive knowledge from the experts; the final purpose is that the artificial human eventually can substitute the human beings most of the times. HEM has a feedback control system formed by blocks three and four; they work coordinately for monitoring and evaluating the evolution of the problem to be solved. In the fifth block, we have a single objective optimization (SOO) method for solving single objective optimization problems (SOOP). In addition, using the SOO method we can to find the ideal, utopian and nadir vectors for multiple objective optimization problems (MOOP). In the sixth block, we have a multiple objective optimization (MOO) method, which is dedicated to find the Pareto optimal set (POS) in MOOP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.5.5">Building Solutions</head><p>Candidate solutions are created by simulating the movement of artificial ants on the construction graph by moving through neighbor vertices of the construction graph G. The vertices to be visited are chosen in a stochastic decision process, where the probability of choosing a particular neighbor vertex depends on both the problem dependent heuristic information and the amount of pheromone associated with the neighbor vertex. An intuitive decision rule to select the next vertex to visit, which combines both the heuristic information and the amount of pheromone associated with vertices, is to make the decision based on the vertices' probabilities. Given an ant currently located at vertex from i to j, the probability of selecting a neighbor vertex is given by ∑ ,</p><p>According to Equation (11.3), the probability of choosing a particular neighbor vertex is higher for vertices associated with greater amount of pheromone and heuristic information, and subsequently increases in line with increases of the amount pheromone. The pheromone varies as a function of the algorithm iteration according to how frequent (the more frequent, the higher the pheromone) the vertex or edge has been used in previous candidate solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.5.6">Pheromone Trails</head><p>After all the ants finished building the candidate solutions of an iteration, the updating of pheromone trails in the construction graph is usually accomplished in two steps, namely reinforcement and evaporation. The reinforcement step consists of increasing the amount of pheromone of every vertex (or edge, in the case that pheromone is associated with edges of the construction graph) used in a candidate solution and it is usually only applied to the best candidate solution.</p><p>In general, the pheromone increment is proportional to the quality of the candidate solution, which in turn increases the probability that vertices or edges used in the candidate solution will be used again by different ants. Assuming that pheromone values are associated with vertices of the construction graph, a simple reinforcement rule given by ∆ , <ref type="bibr">(11.4)</ref> where∆ is the amount of pheromone proportional to the quality of the candidate solution CS to be deposited. For instance, the control optimization is based on the definition of an "odor" associated to each sample represented by an ant and the mutual recognition of ants sharing a similar "odor" to construct a colonial odor used to discriminate between nest mates and intruders. In other approaches, when a specialized ant meets a given object it collects it with a probability that is the higher the sparser are the objects in this region, and after moving, it brings in the object with a probability that is the higher the denser are the objects in this region.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.7">Summary</head><p>We described on this chapter how we can use the interpolation point for an input pair of membership functions as the main parameter and their individual shape as secondary ones to get a simpler representation of the optimization problem. The fuzzy controller used is of Sugeno type, with four inputs, each of them with two membership functions, Ant Colony Optimization algorithm was tested to tune the fuzzy controller, and simulation results have been shown that ACO works well for the ball and beam control problem. We can conclude that coding the problem with just three parameters instead of six, and using ACO as the optimizer method allows us to find an optimal set of membership function parameters for the ball and beam fuzzy control system. For future work, we propose to try different shapes of membership functions, as well as trying to generalize the interpolation point method for more than two membership functions, showing more granularity. Another direction could be to try using type 2 fuzzy logic, and adding a certain type of perturbation into the system in order to observe its behavior versus the use of type 1 fuzzy logic. Following with Ant algorithms, we can try different methods, such as; Ant Colony System (ACS), Elitist Ant System (EAS), Ant System Rank (ASrank), MaxMi-nAnt System (MaxMinAS), Fuzzy Ant Colony Sytem (FACO), etc. Recent works are concerned in trying to get ACO-hybrid algorithms such as; FACO, PSO-ACO or GA-ACO, it seems to be a good idea trying them on others well known control problems, like bouncing ball, inverted pendulum, flow control, motor control, etc. </p></div>

PSO is used to find the optimal Type-2 FLC to achieve regulation of the output and stability of the closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.1">Introduction</head><p>Optimization algorithms are search methods, where the goal is to find a solution to an optimization problem, such that a given quantity is optimized, possibly subject to a set of constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>. Some optimization methods are based on populations of solutions. Unlike the classic methods of improvement for trajectory tracking, in this case each iteration of the algorithm has a set of solutions. These methods are based on generating, selecting, combining and replacing a set of solutions. Since they maintain and they manipulate a set, instead of a unique solution throughout the entire search process, they used more computer time than other metaheuristic methods. This fact can be aggravated because the "convergence" of the population requires a great number of iterations. For this reason a concerted effort has been dedicated to obtaining methods that are more aggressive and manage to obtain solutions of quality in a nearer horizon. This chapter is concerned with bio-inspired optimization methods like particle swarm optimization (PSO) to design optimized fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) for linear problems. This method is used to find the parameters of the membership functions obtaining the optimal FLC for plant control. This chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical basis and problem statement. Section 3 introduces the controller design where a PSO is used to select the parameters. Robustness properties of the closed-loop system are achieved with a type-2 fuzzy logic control system using a Takagi-Sugeno model where the error and the change of error, are considered the linguistic variables. Section 4 provides a simulation study of the plant using the controller described in Section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.2">Theoretical Basis and Problem Statement</head><p>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). PSO is a population based stochastic optimization technique developed by Eberhart and Kennedy in 1995, inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. PSO shares many similarities with evolutionary computation techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</p><p>The system is initialized with a population of random solutions and searches for optima by updating generations. However, unlike the GA, the PSO has no evolution operators such as crossover and mutation. In the PSO, the potential solutions, called particles, fly through the problem space by following the current optimum particles. Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space, which are associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far (The fitness value is also stored). This value is called pbest. Another "best" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle. This location is called lbest. When a particle takes all the population as its topological neighbors, the best value is a global best and is called gbest.</p><p>The particle swarm optimization concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO). Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random numbers being generated for acceleration toward pbest and lbest locations. In the past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in many research and application areas. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods. Another reason that PSO is attractive is that there are few parameters to adjust. One version, with slight variations, works well in a wide variety of applications. Particle swarm optimization has been used for approaches that can be used across a wide range of applications, as well as for specific applications focused on a specific requirement.</p><p>The basic algorithm of the PSO has the following nomenclature: </p></div>

The membership functions used in the entry are trapezoidal for negative (N) and positive (P), and a triangle was used to zero (C) linguistic terms.  The FLC has 9 rules, which are adapted to the style of Takagi-Sugeno controller, so the output has a single point, so the results are constants values (P, C, N), which obtained through a procedure using a weighted average defuzzification by.    The above results are acceptable for type-2 fuzzy logic control because we obtain a final result of 0.0500 using 380 particles and 300 iterations in a time of 7 hours 55 minutes and 08 seconds for this experiment, which is cannot be considered high due to the complexity of the problem.</p><p>The type-2 fuzzy controllers were implemented with the type-2 fuzzy logic toolbox that was developed previously by our research group <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>.</p></div>

The trajectory tracking controller is designed based on the dynamics and kinematics of mobile autonomous robot through the application of PSO for the optimization of membership functions of fuzzy controller both type-1 and type-2 with the good results obtained after simulations. </p></div>

Varying the signal to noise ratio in type-1 and type-2 FLCs.To test the robustness of the type-1 and type-2 FLCs, we repeated experiments 3 and 4 giving different noise levels, going from 30 db to 6 db of SNR ratio in each experiment. In Table9.4, we summarized the values for ISE, IAE, ITAE considering 200 units of time with a P signal of 22.98 db in all cases. As it can be seen in Table 9.4, in presence of diverse noise levels, the behavior of type-2 FLC is better than type-1 FLC above 10 db.From Table9.4, taking two examples, the extreme cases; we have for an SNR ratio of 8 db, in type-1 FLC the next performance values ISE=1004, IAE=352.45, ITAE=4526; for the same case, in type-2 FLC, we have ISE=903, IAE=330.38, ITAE=4104.For 10 db of SNR ratio, we have for type-1 FLC, ISE=205.01, IAE=155.94, ITAE=1583.4, and for type-2 FLC, ISE=149.3, IAE=131.77, ITAE=1262.2.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Perfor-</cell><cell cols="2">Type-1 FLC</cell><cell cols="2">Type-2 FLC</cell></row><row><cell>mance</cell><cell>Ideal Sys-</cell><cell>Syst. with</cell><cell>Ideal</cell><cell>Syst. with</cell></row><row><cell>Criteria</cell><cell>tem</cell><cell>uncertainty</cell><cell>System</cell><cell>uncertainty</cell></row><row><cell>ISE</cell><cell>5.2569</cell><cell>205.0191</cell><cell>5.2572</cell><cell>149.3097</cell></row><row><cell>IAE</cell><cell>13.8055</cell><cell>155.9412</cell><cell>13.7959</cell><cell>131.77</cell></row><row><cell>ITAE</cell><cell>46.0651</cell><cell>1583.4</cell><cell>45.8123</cell><cell>1262.2</cell></row><row><cell>Experiment 5.</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>

		<title level="a" type="main">quantified using performance criteria such as ISE, IAE, and ITAE that in systems without uncertainties (ideal systems) is a better choice to select a type-1 FLC since it works a little better than a type-2 FLC, and it is easier to implement it. It is known that type-1 FLC can handle nonlinearities, and uncertainties up to some extent. Unfortunately, real systems are inherently noisy and nonlinear, since any element in the system contributes with deviations of the expected measures because of thermal noise, electromagnetic interference, etc., moreover, they add nonlinearities from element to element in the system</title>

	<note>We can say that using a type-2 FLC in real world applications can be a better choice since this type of system is a more suitable system to manage uncertainty. as we can see in the results shown in Tables 9.5 and 9.6. References</note>
