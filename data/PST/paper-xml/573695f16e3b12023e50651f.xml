<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We investigate, in a systematic fashion, coherent structures, or defects, which serve as interfaces between wave trains with possibly different wavenumbers in reaction-diffusion systems. We propose a classification of defects into four different defect classes which have all been observed experimentally. The characteristic distinguishing these classes is the sign of the group velocities of the wave trains to either side of the defect, measured relative to the speed of the defect. Using a spatial-dynamics description in which defects correspond to homoclinic and heteroclinic connections of an ill-posed pseudoelliptic equation, we then relate robustness properties of defects to their spectral stability properties.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction.</head><p>In this paper, we investigate coherent structures in essentially onedimensional spatially extended systems. Specifically, we are interested in interfaces between stable spatially periodic structures with possibly different spatial wavenumbers as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.1. These interfaces can also be thought of as defects at which the underlying perfectly periodic structure is broken. In many cases, both the periodic structures and the defect will depend on time. We focus on defects where the resulting pattern is time-periodic, possibly after transforming into an appropriate moving frame of reference. Our goal is to investigate the existence and stability properties of such defects. In particular, we are interested in classifying defects according to their codimension and studying their robustness under parameter variations. Throughout this paper, we will use the term wave trains to denote spatially periodic travelling waves.</p><p>We begin by briefly reviewing some numerical simulations and experiments in which defects have been observed and by introducing, on a heuristic level, the concepts needed for the classification of defects. Afterward, we recall some facts we need about wave trains before stating the definition of defects and our main results. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.1 contains a summary of the notation we shall use throughout this paper. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">i(L) = dim N(L) -codim Rg(L) index of a Fredholm operator L Y = H 1/2 (S 1 , R n ) × L 2 (S 1 , R n )</formula><p>spaces for spatial-dynamical systems Experiments and simulations. To set the scene, we describe numerical simulations of defects and review various experiments in which they have been observed. Consider first the left and center plot in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2. Both are space-time contour plots of solutions to the Brusselator (see Appendix B for the equations). Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(i), which reproduces simulations from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, shows a standing defect that emits wave trains alternately to the left and right so that the emitted wave trains travel away from the defect toward the domain boundary. Defects of this type are often referred to as flip-flops or one-dimensional spirals. Note that the defect is time-periodic since the space-time plot is periodic in the vertical time direction. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(ii) shows a standing defect near the left domain boundary that emits wave trains simultaneously to the left and right; such defects are often referred to as target patterns. In the interior of the domain, a travelling defect is formed between the waves emitted by the target Downloaded 01/02/13 to 139.184. <ref type="bibr">30.136</ref>. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php The numerical simulations shown here were carried out using Barkley's code ezspiral <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Figure (i) on the left shows a space-time plot (time is plotted upward and space horizontally) of a flip-flop that emits wave trains alternately to the left and right: The emitted wave trains travel away from the defect toward the domain boundary. Figure (ii) in the middle is a space-time plot (time is plotted upward and space horizontally): Near the left boundary, we see a standing target pattern that emits waves simultaneously to the left and right. In the interior of the domain, a travelling defect is formed between the waves emitted by the target pattern and the spatially homogeneous oscillations that occupy the right half of the domain. Figure (iii) is a snapshot of a two-dimensional spiral wave. A one-dimensional line defect emerges from the center of the spiral and connects to the bottom of the domain. Along the line defect, the phase of the oscillations jumps by half a period.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y 1 = H 1 (S 1 , R n ) × H 1/2 (S 1 , R n ) c d c -</formula><p>pattern and the spatially homogeneous oscillations that occupy the right half of the domain. The travelling defect is time-periodic when viewed in a comoving frame. Indeed, shearing the space-time plot appropriately in the horizontal direction renders the figure vertically periodic with the defect being a vertical line.</p><p>Flip-flops of a slightly different nature have been observed in numerical simulations in the excitable regime of the Oregonator <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, where a localized pulse destabilizes and releases pulses in its wake-a mechanism often referred to as backfiring. The emerging pattern resembles Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(i) with pulses being released alternately to the left and right. The resulting interfaces can also move with nonzero speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Chemical oscillations have been generated in various reactions, most of which are related to the original Belousov-Zhabotinsky mechanism. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, defect patterns were observed in the chlorite-iodite-malonic-acid (CIMA) reaction in the parameter regime where stable, stationary, spatially periodic Turing patterns and time-periodic spatially homogeneous oscillations coexist. In one space dimension, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure 2]</ref> shows flip-flops of the type plotted in Figure <ref type="bibr">1.2(i)</ref>. We emphasize that the waves emerging from the chemical flip-flop in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> are not generated by an inhomogeneity in the medium. Instead, the defect forms spontaneously. At the defect, the phase of the wave trains jumps by half a period.</p><p>Defects with a different type of phase slip were observed in photo-sensitive monolayers on thin Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The two-dimensional spiral waves shown in [58, Figures <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>] exhibit stationary line defects along which the phase of the oscillations jumps by half the period. The spiral waves are presumably generated by a period-doubling bifurcation of spatially homogeneous oscillations that then leads to a Hopf bifurcation of the two-dimensional spirals <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The line defects appear to orient themselves parallel to the propagation direction of the wave trains. We refer to Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(iii) for a snapshot of a twodimensional spiral wave that exhibits such a line defect. The pattern shown there was first found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, to which we refer for details on the equation used to generate it.</p><p>Hydrothermal waves can also exhibit defects. The recent experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, in which nonlinear waves and various kinds of defects were triggered by heated wires immersed in thin layers of oil, were motivated by the desire to obtain a quantitative comparison with coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations. Other experiments where defects have been observed are the printer instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, laterally heated fluid layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and thermal convection of binary fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Heuristic classification. We are interested in finding characteristic properties of coherent structures of the kind shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.1. It turns out that the group velocities of the asymptotic wave trains are the deciding characteristic. The group velocity c g associated with a wave train can be thought of as the speed with which small perturbations are transported along the wave train (we will make this more precise in section 1.3 below; see also <ref type="bibr">Figure 1.3)</ref>. Alternatively, the group velocity can be computed as the derivative of the frequency of the wave train with respect to its wavenumber (see section 1.2 below). We may then distinguish defects according to whether perturbations to the left or right of the defect travel toward, parallel to, or away from the interface. In fact, we propose the following classification:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">sinks c - g &gt; c d &gt; c + g , contact defects c - g = c d = c + g , transmission defects either c ± g &gt; c d or c ± g &lt; c d , sources c - g &lt; c d &lt; c + g ,</formula><p>where c d is the speed of the defect, and c - g and c + g denote the group velocities of the wave trains to the left and right, respectively, of the interface. We refer to Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.4 for an illustration. We emphasize that the slope of the level sets in the space-time plots of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2 reflects the phase velocity of the wave trains. In contrast, the characteristic curves sketched in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.4 Downloaded 01/02/13 to 139.184. <ref type="bibr">30.136</ref>. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php indicate the direction of the group velocity. In general, the signs of these two velocities are not related. While phase and group velocity of the waves in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(i) and (ii) have the same sign, the group velocity of the waves in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(iii) is directed toward the boundary, while they travel toward the spiral center.</p><p>The intuition is that sources generate the wave trains to either side since their group velocity points away from the interface. Sinks are passively created by wave trains that transport from the left and right toward the interface, thus forming it. Contact and transmission defects typically connect identical wave trains; these defects account for phase differences between the wave trains to their left and right.</p><p>We remark that there are defects that do not fit into the classification shown above (for instance, those for which c - g = c d &gt; c + g ). Nevertheless, we will argue in section 6.10 that the only "relevant" defects are those captured by our classification.</p><p>Last, we briefly revisit the experiments and simulations mentioned above to demonstrate that each of the defect classes indeed arises in physical systems. The flip-flop in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(i), the target pattern in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(ii), and the chemical flip-flops observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> in the CIMA reaction appear to be sources. The interface between travelling and standing waves shown in the center of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(ii) is a sink. We believe that the line defects that are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(iii) and that occur in the modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> are contact defects. Transmission defects arise in the ferroin-catalyzed Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and in the heated-wire experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Sources and sinks have also been observed in the printer instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and in the heated-wire experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</p><p>Defects in general reaction-diffusion systems. The idea to characterize coherent structures<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> using the group velocity is, of course, not new. Interfaces between wave trains with almost identical wavenumbers were, for instance, studied in great detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Defects in the cubic-quintic and in coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau equations were investigated by van Saarloos and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and by Doelman <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Our goal is to investigate defects arising in reaction-diffusion equations. The difficulty is that defects cannot be obtained as solutions to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Instead, they are solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE) that depend genuinely on time. In fact, while the formation of periodic structures has been studied comprehensively in one, two, and three space dimensions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the references therein), defects within these periodic structures are not as well understood, at least from a mathematical viewpoint. There are two reasons for this. First, defects are modulated waves and therefore time-periodic in a comoving frame. Thus, dynamical-systems methods with respect to the spatial variable, that are so successful when dealing with travelling waves, are not immediately applicable. Second, it appears difficult to use period maps to investigate defects as the linearization about a defect has the essential spectrum up to the imaginary axis. This fact precludes the immediate use of implicit function theorems. Note that the essential spectrum of each defect is generated by the spectrum of the asymptotic wave trains that always touches the imaginary axis. When studying spatially periodic patterns that respect a lattice symmetry group, this issue can be resolved by restricting our attention to functions that respect the same lattice group. Defects, however, inherently break the lattice symmetry.</p><p>We focus on essentially one-dimensional media such as the real line x ∈ R, cylindrical domains R × Ω ⊂ R × R m , or patterns with a radial symmetry x ∈ R + . In these cases, we can reverse the role of time and space and treat the unbounded spatial variable x as the evolution variable, while time is restricted to the compact interval of periodicity. Dynamical-systems techniques can then be adapted to investigate bifurcations of small-amplitude solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. It is also possible to study periodic <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> as well as homoclinic and heteroclinic solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> of not necessarily small amplitude. Based on these ideas, we characterize in this paper properties of typical defects of arbitrary amplitude by interpreting them as homoclinic and heteroclinic trajectories that are constructed in a robust transverse fashion. To classify defects, we count relative dimensions of the infinite-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds.</p><p>Last, we do not wish to give the impression that all interesting patterns observed in nature are necessarily time-periodic. In fact, there are many fascinating patterns that do not fit at all into the framework described above and that are therefore not captured by the analysis presented here. However, as documented above, many patterns observed in physical systems are time-periodic when viewed in an appropriate frame and therefore fit into our framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Main results.</head><p>Reaction-diffusion systems. As a prototype for equations that give far-from-equilibrium dynamics, we focus on reaction-diffusion equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u t = Du xx + f (u), x∈ R,<label>(1.1)</label></formula><p>where u ∈ R n . We assume that the diffusion matrix is diagonal with strictly positive entries and that the nonlinearity f ∈ C ∞ (R n , R n ) is smooth. We think of f as a generic nonlinearity with no additional symmetries.</p><p>Wave trains. The common feature of the experiments mentioned above is the presence of wave trains which are travelling waves of the form u wt (kxωt; k), where u wt (φ; k) is 2π-periodic in φ. Typically, the spatial wavenumber k and the temporal frequency ω are related via the nonlinear dispersion relation ω = ω nl (k) so that the phase velocity is given by c p = ω nl (k)/k. A second quantity related to the nonlinear dispersion relation is the group velocity</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">c g = dω nl dk (1.2)</formula><p>of the wave train which will play a central role in our results. The group velocity c g gives the speed of propagation of small localized wave-package perturbations of the wave train (see Example II in section 1.3). Our primary interest is in wave trains that have a nonconstant dispersion relation<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> so that c g ≡ 0.</p><p>We shall assume that the wave trains are spectrally stable.

Next, we consider coherent structures which are waves that are time-periodic in an appropriate frame of reference and asymptotic in space to wave trains with possibly different wavenumbers.</p><p>Definition 1.1. We say that a solution u(</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x, t) = u d (x -c d t, ω d t) of (1.1</formula><p>) is an elementary defect with speed c d and frequency ω d if ω d = 0 and if there are asymptotic wavenumbers k - and k + and smooth phase-correction functions θ ± (ξ) with θ ± (ξ) → 0 as ξ → ±∞ such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">u d (ξ, τ ) = u d (ξ, τ + 2π) (1.5) and u d (ξ, ω d t) -u wt (k ± ξ + (k ± c d -ω nl (k ± ))t -θ ± (ξ); k ± ) -→ 0 (1.6)</formula><p>uniformly in t as ξ → ±∞ for the functions as well as their derivatives with respect to (ξ, t). Last, we assume that ∂ ξ u d (ξ, τ ) and ∂ τ u d (ξ, τ ) are linearly independent functions. Formulated in the steady frame, the periodicity (1.5) and convergence (1.6) conditions are</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">u(x, t) = u(x + c d T d , t + T d ), T d = 2π ω d ,</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">u(x, t) -u wt (k ± x -ω nl (k ± )t -θ ± (x -c d t); k ± ) -→ 0 uniformly in 0 ≤ t ≤ T d as x → ±∞.</formula><p>We will see in Corollary 5.2 that the phase functions θ ± (ξ) can be chosen to be constants θ ± for sinks, sources, and transmission defects, whereas contact defects have phase functions θ ± (ξ) ∝ log ξ + O(1/|ξ|) that diverge logarithmically.</p><p>Throughout this paper, we denote the phase and group velocities of the asymptotic wave trains by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">c ± p = ω nl (k ± ) k ± , c ± g = dω nl dk (k ± ),</formula><p>respectively. Note that (1.5)-(1.6) imply that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ω nl (k + ) -k + c d = ω d = ω nl (k -) -k -c d . (1.7)</formula><p>In particular, the assumption that defects are time-periodic implies the Rankine-Hugoniot condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">c d = ω nl (k + ) -ω nl (k -) k + -k - (1.8)</formula><p>Downloaded 01/02/13 to 139.184.30.136. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php for the defect speed whenever k + = k -. To justify our use of the term Rankine-Hugoniot, we note that the group velocity, which measures transport, is the derivative of the frequency. In conservation laws, transport is the derivative of the flux, so we may interpret the frequency ω nl as the flux function of a fictitious conservation law. In that sense, (1.8) is the corresponding Rankine-Hugoniot condition. Using these findings, we see that <ref type="bibr">(1.6</ref>) is equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">u d (ξ, τ ) -u wt (k ± ξ -τ -θ ± (ξ); k ± ) -→ 0, ξ → ±∞. (1.9)</formula><p>To illustrate <ref type="bibr">(1.8)</ref>, consider the sink in the center of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(ii). Since the wave trains to the right of the defect are spatially homogeneous, we have k + = 0. Inspecting the figure further, we see that ω nl (k -) &gt; ω nl (k + ), and (1.8) implies that c d &gt; 0, which is consistent with the simulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main result.</head><p>We are now ready to describe the main result of this paper. We begin by introducing four distinct classes of defects. Each type occurs in an open set of reactiondiffusion systems, or, more precisely, for nonempty open subsets U of nonlinearities f in C 3 (R n , R n ) and of diffusion matrices D. We define the four different defect types as follows:</p><p>(i) Sinks are elementary defects with c -</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">g &gt; c d &gt; c + g . (ii) Contact defects are elementary defects with c - g = c d = c + g . (iii) Transmission defects are elementary defects with either c ± g &gt; c d or c ± g &lt; c d .</formula><p>(iv) Sources are elementary defects with c - g &lt; c d &lt; c + g . All contact and transmission defects that we are aware of have k -= k + . In fact, contact defects for which k -= k + and ω (k -) = ω (k + ) will not persist upon varying (k -, k + ), and we will therefore restrict our analysis to contact defects for which k -= k + . Note also that we include neither sinks that have k -= k + nor degenerate sinks for which c - g = c d &gt; c + g or c - g &gt; c d = c + g , since we do not expect that such defects occur for open sets of wavenumbers k -or k + , respectively. We refer to section 6.10 for more details.</p><p>Our main result will link robustness properties of defects to spectral properties of the linearization of the period map of (1.1). To describe these properties, we therefore linearize (1.1) in the comoving frame ξ = xc d t with τ = ω d t about an elementary defect u d (ξ, τ ) and obtain the linear equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ω d u τ = Du ξξ + c d u ξ + f (u d (ξ, τ ))u. (1.10)</formula><p>We denote the linear period map of this parabolic equation with time-periodic coefficients by</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Φ d : u(•, 0) -→ u(•, 2π).</formula><p>For any pair of real numbers η = (η -, η + ), we define L 2 η (R, R n ) to be the space of all locally square-integrable functions for which (i) For sinks, we assume that Φ d -1 has a bounded inverse on L 2 η (R, R n ). (ii) For contact defects, we assume that Φ d -1 has a bounded inverse L 2 η (R, R n ) for all weights η -= η + = 0 that are sufficiently close to zero.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">u 2 L 2 η = R - u(ξ)e η -ξ 2 dξ + R + u(ξ)e η + ξ 2 dξ is finite. Definition 1.2. Consider Φ d on L 2 η (R, R n ) with</formula><p>(iii) For transmission defects, we assume that ρ = 1 has algebraic multiplicity one as an eigenvalue of Φ d on L 2 η (R, R n ). (iv) For sources, we assume that ρ = 1 has algebraic multiplicity two as an eigenvalue of</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Φ d on L 2 η (R, R n ).</formula><p>It turns out that, in each of the above four cases, Φ d -1 is Fredholm with index zero on L 2 η (R, R n ) with weights chosen according to Definition 1.2. The above requirements on the spectra of Φ d can also be formulated in terms of multiplicities of appropriate roots of certain Evans functions (see section 5). We emphasize, however, that the minimal-spectrum assumption for contact defects does not refer to the usual Evans function that we constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> since the essential spectrum of contact defects always extends into the right half-plane in the exponentially weighted spaces that we use (see section 6.1).</p><p>We recall the main hypothesis that we require for the wave trains. Hypothesis 1.3. Each of the wave trains that we consider is part of a one-parameter family given locally by solutions u wt (kx-ω nl (k)t; k) of (1.1), where u wt (φ; k) is 2π-periodic in φ. We also assume that the dispersion relation ω = ω nl (k) is well defined and smooth, again locally near each of the wave trains, and that ω nl (k) = 0. Last, we assume that each of these wave trains is spectrally stable in the sense sketched in <ref type="bibr">(1.4)</ref> and made precise in Hypotheses 3.1 and 3.2 below.</p><p>The following theorem distills the analysis of the present paper into a multiplicity and robustness result.</p><p>Theorem 1.4. Assume that Hypothesis 1.3 is met.

Due to the gauge invariance A → e iφ A of the CGL, defects can actually be constructed, in a frame moving with the defect speed c d , as heteroclinic and homoclinic orbits of an ODE. Indeed, coherent defects of the CGL are of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">A(x, t) = A d (x -c d t, ω d t) = a(x -c d t)e iφ(x-c d t) e -iω d t (1.15) so that A d (ξ, τ ) = a(ξ)e i[φ(ξ)-τ ] .</formula><p>Substituting this ansatz into (1.13), it follows [22, Appendix B] that (a, z) satisfies the ODE a ξ = a Re z, <ref type="bibr">(1.16</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">z ξ = -z 2 - 1 1 + iα 1 + iω d -(1 + iβ)a 2 + c d z ,</formula><p>where z = a ξ /a + iφ ξ . Thus, defects of the CGL correspond to heteroclinic orbits of the ODE (1.16), while the equilibria connected by these orbits correspond to wave trains of the CGL. The observation made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> is that the dimensions of the unstable and stable manifolds of these equilibria are related to the group velocities of the corresponding wave trains: In a frame moving with the speed of the defect, the dimension of stable manifolds associated with wave trains that transport to the left is larger than that of wave trains that transport to the right. Equivalently, the dimension of unstable manifolds associated with wave trains that transport to the right is larger than that of wave trains that transport to the left. These dimensions, however, are directly related, via counting arguments, to the codimension of connecting orbits between equilibria as these arise as intersections of stable and unstable Downloaded 01/02/13 to 139.184.30.136. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php manifolds. This argument therefore establishes a beautiful connection between the intuition given by the group velocity and rigorous counts of the codimension of defects. Equation (1.16) has been studied thoroughly in the literature (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> for references). In particular, the CGL has been shown to admit sources (the so-called Nozaki-Bekki holes), sinks, and transmission defects (commonly referred to as homoclons <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for existence results of these defects and to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for the stability of sinks. We will show in section 7 that the cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation (CQGL) admits contact defects.</p><p>Example II: The viscous Burgers equation. Arguably, the simplest possible defects are those with "small amplitude" that serve as interfaces between two wave trains with almost the same wavenumber. The term "small amplitude" therefore refers to the small difference of the asymptotic wavenumbers and not to the actual amplitudes of wave trains and defects which could be large.</p><p>One way of finding such defects is to derive an equation that describes slowly varying wavenumber modulations (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.3) of the wave trains u wt (kxω nl (k)t; k). Hence, we fix a wavenumber k and seek solutions to the reaction-diffusion system (1.1) of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">u(x, t) = u wt (kx -ω nl (k)t + Φ(X, T ); k + ε∂ X Φ(X, T )) + O(ε 2 ),<label>(1.17)</label></formula><p>where 0 &lt; ε 1, and where the variables (X, T ) depend on (x, t) via</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">X = ε(x -c g t), T = 1 2 ε 2 t. (1.18)</formula><p>Thus, the function q(X, T ) := ∂ X Φ(X, T ) describes the slowly varying modulation of the wavenumber. It can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> that q(X, T ) satisfies the viscous Burgers equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">∂ T q = λ lin (0) ∂ 2 X q -ω nl (k) ∂ X (q 2 ) (1.19)</formula><p>over time scales of order O(1) in T and that any solution to (1.19) yields, in fact, a solution to the reaction-diffusion system (1.1) via (1.17). Using <ref type="bibr">(1.18)</ref>, this validity result justifies the interpretation of the group velocity as the speed of propagation of small localized wave-package perturbations.</p><p>To analyze defects, suppose that the dispersion relation is convex near the wavenumber k so that ω (k) &gt; 0 (the only difference for concave dispersion relations is that some of the signs below may change). Equation <ref type="bibr">(1.19</ref>) admits stationary fronts of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">q d (X) = - ω ω nl (k) tanh ωω nl (k) λ lin (0) X (1.20)</formula><p>that converge to the equilibria q ± = ∓ 2ω/ω nl (k) as X → ±∞ for each ω &gt; 0. These fronts of <ref type="bibr">(1.19)</ref> correspond to defects of (1.1) that connect the wave train with wavenumber k + εq - to the wave train with wavenumber k + εq + . Since the dispersion relation is locally convex, and since q -&gt; 0 and q + &lt; 0, we see that the group velocity of k + εq -is larger than c g , while the group velocity of k + εq + is smaller than c g . Thus, the defects described by <ref type="bibr">(1.20)</ref> are sinks whose characteristics on each side point toward the interface. This is, of course, in agreement with the fact that (1.20) describes the viscous Lax shocks of the Burgers equation.</p><p>Another consequence of the above discussion is that sources do not exist in the smallamplitude limit. Indeed, for ω (k) &gt; 0, the only waves of the viscous Burgers equation that connect q -to q + for q -&lt; q + are rarefaction waves. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">4</ref>We remark that it has been proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that the shocks given in (1.20) persist as transverse defects of the reaction-diffusion equation (1.1); note that this requires a proof as the Burgers equation is valid only over finite time intervals.</p><p>Example III: Absolute and essential instability of pulses and fronts. Bifurcations from travelling waves provide another mechanism by which defects can be created. Imagine, for instance, a pulse travelling with a nonzero speed through a stable spatially homogeneous background. Now, envision a scenario where the stable background becomes unstable through a Turing or Hopf instability upon varying appropriate external parameters: At a supercritical Turing bifurcation, stationary wave trains with small amplitude and nonzero wavenumber will bifurcate from the homogeneous background state. We proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> that, under certain generic assumptions, modulated pulses arise that travel through these wave trains with nonzero speed. Since the wave trains will have zero group velocity, the modulated pulse is an elementary transverse transmission defect. Linear and nonlinear stability of these defects have been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, respectively. Analogous bifurcations can also occur at fronts when the rest state ahead of the front destabilizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Last, we proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> that both flip-flops and one-dimensional target patterns (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.2(i) and (ii)) will bifurcate from standing pulses whose background states undergo a Hopf instability. This appears to be the mechanism that creates the chemical flip-flops observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Plan of the paper. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review robustness and stability properties of localized pulses and fronts that connect spatially homogeneous equilibria. The purpose of this review is to prepare the spatial-dynamics viewpoint that we shall adopt when we investigate defects. Section 3 is devoted to wave trains and their stability for both the temporal and the spatial-dynamical system. In section 4, we prepare the ground for the proof of Theorem 1.4 by investigating the spectra of the period maps associated with the linearization about defects. We then prove Theorem 1.4 in section 5 by linking robustness properties of defects to geometric transversality conditions of the spatial-dynamical system. We also show that the resulting geometric conditions are equivalent to the minimal-spectrum assumption. In section 6, we address stability, interactions, and bifurcations of defects as well as the influence of boundaries and inhomogeneities on their dynamics. Last, in section 7, we prove that the CQGL has contact defects in appropriate parameter regimes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Localized travelling waves.</head><p>To illustrate the main ideas behind Theorem 1.4 and its proof, we review travelling waves that approach stable spatially homogeneous rest states. We describe both rigidly propagating travelling waves u = u tw (x-c tw t) and oscillatory modulated waves u = u mtw (xc mtw t, ω mtw t) of reaction-diffusion systems</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">u t = Du xx + f (u), x∈ R, (2.1) with u ∈ R n .</formula><p>2.1. Pulses and fronts. Suppose that u tw (xct) is a front that satisfies (2.1) and that connects two stable spatially homogeneous equilibria u ± of (2.1) so that u tw (ξ) → u ± as ξ → ±∞. Thus, we use the independent variables (ξ, t) = (xct, t) so that (2.1) becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">u t = Du ξξ + cu ξ + f (u), ξ ∈ R, (2.2)</formula><p>and u tw (ξ) is an equilibrium. The linearization of (2.2) about the front u tw (ξ) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">L tw u = Du ξξ + cu ξ + f (u tw (ξ))u, (2.3)</formula><p>which defines a closed unbounded operator L tw on L 2 (R, R n ) and on BC 0 (R, R n ). We shall see below that u tw (ξ) decays exponentially to zero as |ξ| → ∞. As a consequence, λ = 0 is always an eigenvalue of L tw with eigenfunction u tw (ξ). This eigenvalue occurs due to the translation symmetry of (2.2) which implies that u tw (• + ξ 0 ) is a solution for each fixed spatial shift ξ 0 ∈ R. Since L tw is Fredholm with index zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we can apply Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction to the steady-state equation associated with (2.2) near the family of fronts. Exploiting the translation symmetry ξ → ξ + ξ 0 , it is not difficult to see that fronts and pulses are robust with respect to small perturbations of the nonlinearity provided λ = 0 has geometric and algebraic multiplicity one as an eigenvalue of L tw (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and the references therein for details).</p><p>An alternative approach to this problem is as follows. We seek travelling-wave solutions u tw (xct) of (2.1). Substituting this ansatz gives the travelling-wave equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">u ξ = v, (2.4) v ξ = -D -1 [cv + f (u)]</formula><p>in the 2n-dimensional phase space, which we also write as</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">u = F(u; c),</formula><p>where u = (u, v) ∈ R 2n . The front u tw (ξ) which connects two stable spatially homogeneous equilibria u ± corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit u tw (ξ) of (2.4) which connects the equilibria u ± = (u ± , 0). The eigenvalue problem for the operator L tw can now be written as the linear ODE</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">u ξ = v, (2.5) v ξ = -D -1 [cv + f (u tw (ξ))u -λu].</formula><p>For λ close to zero, this equation is close to the ODE linearization of (2.4) about the travelling wave u tw . We can therefore expect that the spectral properties of L tw for λ close to zero are related to properties of the heteroclinic orbit of the travelling-wave ODE (2.4). A front with stable homogeneous background states corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit that connects saddles whose unstable and stable manifolds have dimension n. The insets show the eigenvalues of the linearization of (2.4) about the saddles.</p><p>First, consider the PDE linearization about a homogeneous equilibrium u tw (ξ) ≡ u ± . Using Fourier transform, it is easy to see that λ belongs to the spectrum if and only if (2.5) has a nontrivial bounded solution. For λ 1, (2.5) is close to u ξξ = λD -1 u, which is a linear hyperbolic equation with n stable and n unstable spatial eigenvalues ν = ± λ/d j , where D = diag(d j ). If we therefore assume that the homogeneous equilibria u ± are spectrally stable, we can conclude that the corresponding two equilibria u ± = (u ± , 0) of the travellingwave ODE (2.4) are saddles whose stable and unstable manifolds have equal dimension n. In particular, fronts and pulses with stable background states correspond to heteroclinic and homoclinic orbits to saddles with unstable and stable dimension equal to n (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.1).</p><p>Next, robustness of fronts corresponds to robustness of the heteroclinic connection u tw = (u tw , u tw ) as a solution to the ODE (2.4). In fact, heteroclinic orbits are robust as solutions in the phase space if and only if stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversely upon varying the parameter c near the wave speed c tw of the front or pulse; if we add the equation c ξ = 0 for the parameter c to (2.4) and denote the center-stable and center-unstable manifolds of the equilibria u ± by W cu ext (u -) and W cs ext (u + ), then robustness is equivalent to requiring</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">T (utw,ctw) W cu ext (u -) + T (utw,ctw) W cs ext (u + ) = R 2n × R.</formula><p>This, in turn, is equivalent to a minimal intersection in R 2n for fixed c = c tw ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">T utw W u (u -) ∩ T utw W s (u + ) = span u tw , (2.6) together with a Melnikov condition M = ∞ -∞ ψ(ξ), ∂ c F(u tw (ξ); c tw ) dξ = 0.

The relation between the ODE and the functional-analytic robustness argument becomes clearer when we approach the eigenvalue problem from an ODE viewpoint. Eigenfunctions correspond to bounded solutions of (2.3), while generalized eigenfunctions are found as bounded solutions of the derivative of the variational equation with respect to λ, evaluated in the eigenfunction.</p><p>To find bounded solutions of (2.3), we denote by E s + (λ) the λ-dependent linear subspace of initial conditions at ξ = 0 that lead to bounded solutions of <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>  In particular, we have E(λ) = 0 if and only if λ is an eigenvalue of L tw . Furthermore, we have E(0) = 0, and, upon expanding the determinant, it is also not hard to see that E (0) = 0 if and only if both (2.6) and (2.7) are met.</p><p>A related way to solve the eigenvalue problem in a neighborhood of λ = 0 consists of finding roots of the injection map</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">ι(λ) : E u -(λ) × E s + (λ) -→ C 2n , (u -, u + ) -→ u --u + . (2.9)</formula><p>Near λ = 0, this map can be pulled back to</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">ι 0 (λ) : E u -(0) × E s + (0) -→ C 2n , (u -, u + ) -→ P u -(λ)u --P s + (λ)u + . (2.10)</formula><p>Note that ι 0 (0) is Fredholm with index zero and null space E u -(0) ∩ E s + (0). If we denote the dimension of this null space by , which coincides with the geometric multiplicity of λ = 0, then we can compute the roots of ι 0 near λ = 0 via Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, which results in a linear system of equations in variables. The λ-dependent determinant of the reduced equation is a reduced Evans function E 0 (λ) whose roots, counted with multiplicity, coincide with those of E(λ) in a neighborhood of zero. In particular, these two functions differ only by a nonzero analytic factor. In our case, the geometric multiplicity of λ = 0 is one so that = 1. Thus, the reduced Evans function E 0 (λ) is a scalar function, and we have E 0 (0) = 0 if and only if the algebraic multiplicity of λ = 0 is one. This latter approach of the construction of a reduced Evans function for eigenvalue problems is the one that we shall adopt below.</p></div>

Contact defects occur as robust one-parameter families in the asymptotic wavenumber k = k ± provided both ι + and ι -are onto (and therefore invertible).</p><p>Proof. First note that, since ι + is onto, so is the map ι from (5.1). In particular, via Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, the intersection of center-unstable and center-stable manifolds persists. We claim that the defect lies neither in the strong-stable nor the strong-unstable manifold. Indeed, if it did, ι + or ι -would have a nontrivial kernel and could therefore not be onto. The complement of the strong-stable manifold in the center-stable manifold of the wave train is an open subset of the center-stable manifold (initially in a neighborhood of the wave train, but then also in a neighborhood of u d (0) upon using continuity of the evolution on the center-stable manifold). In particular, the perturbed intersection points in W cs + still belong to the interior of the center-stable manifold. A similar description is true for the center-unstable manifold which shows persistence for nearby wavenumbers and parameters upon varying c d = ω nl (k) appropriately.

The injection maps ι ± are both onto if and only if the minimal-spectrum assumption holds, i.e., if and only if the contact defect is transverse.</p><p>Proof. The null spaces of ι -and ι + consist exactly of eigenfunctions of the linearized period map Φ d in L 2 η -,η + with exponential weights η -= η + &lt; 0 and η -= η + &gt; 0, respectively. Lemma 5.6 and Proposition 5.7 implicitly show that higher-dimensional intersections of center-stable and center-unstable manifolds would contribute to the null spaces of ι + and ι -. They would, however, typically not contribute an additional root of the extension into λ = 0 of the Evans function E(λ) of Theorem 4.5.

Indeed, if we consider the modulated-wave equation near a wave train in the frame that moves with its group velocity c d = c g , then the wave train has an algebraically double spatial Floquet exponent ν = 0 (see section 3.4 and Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1). If we keep the defect speed fixed at c d = c g (k * ), then the saddle node can be unfolded by varying the frequency</p><formula xml:id="formula_142">ω d near ω nl (k * ),</formula><p>where k * is the wavenumber of the wave train we started with.

To leading order, we therefore recover the steady-state equation of the Burgers equation <ref type="bibr">(1.19)</ref>, which, as discussed in section 1.3, admits stable sinks. We refer to Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.3 for an illustration. Large-amplitude sinks arise close to contact defects. If we vary frequency or speed so that the saddle-node wave train splits into two wave trains, then the saddle-node homoclinic orbit that corresponds to the contact defect becomes a heteroclinic orbit-in fact, a sink-that connects the two wave trains (as illustrated in the lower left half of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.4). It is an interesting problem to determine whether the resulting sink is stable or not. On account of Theorem 4.5, the Evans function of the contact defect will have a simple zero at the origin, while the sink does not have an eigenvalue at λ = 0. Thus, we expect that the sink will have either a weakly stable or a weakly unstable eigenvalue near zero. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">8</ref>We remark that the bottom of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.4 also illustrates that the same wave trains can accommodate several distinct defects. Indeed, the two wave trains in the bottom plot of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.4 are connected by "small-amplitude" and "large-amplitude" sinks.</p><p>Folds. Next, we discuss what happens when the minimal-spectrum assumption, which is equivalent to the transversality condition for center-stable and center-unstable manifolds in the proof of Theorem 1.4, is violated. In this case, sinks acquire a simple eigenvalue at λ = 0 in the space L 2 η with sign η ± = ±1. This degeneracy corresponds to a tangency of the center-unstable and center-stable manifolds of the wave trains in the modulated-wave equation (4.2). Thus, if the tangency is quadratic as expected, it will persist along a curve in (k -, k + )-parameter space. On one side of this curve, there exists a pair of sinks, while there are no sinks on its other side. It is not hard to prove that the additional critical eigenvalue near λ = 0 will stabilize one of the two sinks and destabilize the other one. The scenario for transmission defects and sources is similar since the linearization acquires a Jordan block of length two. For transmission defects, we then see two defects for k &lt; k * , say, and none for k &gt; k * , while folds for sources occur only when an additional external parameter is present.</p><p>Contact defects behave differently. If the center-stable and center-unstable manifolds intersect tangentially, expect again a standard saddle-node bifurcation of contact defects in the modulated-wave equation that is unfolded by the wavenumber k. Since the asymptotic wavenumbers are identical, the tangency will, however, not generate a localized eigenfunction of the linearization. In particular, the Evans function near λ = 0 does not change at all. Thus, none of the two contact defects will acquire any additional eigenvalues, and both of them will be spectrally stable! Instead, an unstable root arises for the Evans functions associated with the maps ι ± from (5.8) which have the wrong Morse index. Of course, the two stable contact defects are not close to each other in the supremum norm, which precludes viewing one of them as a small perturbation of the other one.</p><p>Locking and unlocking via flip bifurcations. Contact defects are also destroyed at values of k at which the center-unstable manifold intersects the center-stable manifold along the strong-stable manifold of the asymptotic wave train. The associated homoclinic flip bifurcation has been analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for ODEs, and the resulting bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.4. We remark that it is straightforward to obtain the same for (4.2) by using exponential dichotomies and foliations of center-stable and center-unstable manifolds. Note that the contact defect exists for wavenumbers below a critical wavenumber, say, and its speed is therefore determined solely by the group velocity. Above the critical wavenumber, the defect changes into a transmission defect whose speed is now determined by a Melnikov integral that depends on the profile of the defect. Thus, we may refer to this bifurcation as an unlocking bifurcation at which the speed of the defect unlocks from the group velocity of the underlying wave trains. We remark that neither the transmission defect nor the contact defect acquires any additional eigenvalues during this transition. Phenomenologically, the unlocking transition is preceded by an increasing localization of the defect structure. At the bifurcation point, the convergence toward the wave trains changes from algebraic to exponential. The unlocked transmission defect approaches the wave train ahead<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">9</ref> of it at a uniform exponential rate, whereas the relaxation toward the wave train behind the defect occurs at a weak exponential rate. A similar phenomenon occurs when transmission defects bifurcate from pulses at parameter values where the homogeneous background undergoes a Turing instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>A more dramatic unlocking bifurcation occurs if we allow an additional external parameter µ to vary. It can then happen that both the strong-stable and strong-unstable manifolds of a saddle-node periodic orbit intersect, which can be interpreted as the simultaneous unlocking of the contact defect at both end points. The analysis of this bifurcation is very similar to the one for localized inhomogeneities of wave trains with zero group velocity that we will discuss in section 6.5. According to the bifurcation diagram shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.5, we find contact defects before the bifurcation and sources afterward. Note that the source coexists with the small-amplitude sink that is created in the saddle-node bifurcation. Source and sink together can now form a bound state that corresponds to a transmission defect.</p><p>Other bifurcations. Defects may also arise when additional harmonic frequencies are introduced. Motivated by experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and numerical simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we have analyzed which defects can be created near period-doubling bifurcations of wave trains. We showed contact defect source in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> that phase-slip defects can arise as interfaces between spatially homogeneous oscillations with a relative phase shift of π.</p><p>Of course, there are many more bifurcations that we expect to encounter. Sinks, for instance, persist even if we vary the two wavenumbers of the asymptotic wave trains independently, and we should therefore expect to observe any heteroclinic bifurcation of codimension two. In fact, even nontransverse homoclinic orbits may occur for large sets in parameter space.</p><p>The examples above notwithstanding, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations can result in very complicated solution structures, and a complete classification appears to be impossible. To give a few examples, homoclinic orbits with complex spatial Floquet exponents are accompanied by a plethora of multiloop solutions. Sources and sinks that travel with the same speed form a heteroclinic loop, and the resulting heteroclinic bifurcation may lead to various different source-sink bound states (each being a transmission defect).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Pinning at inhomogeneities.</head><p>Most of the counting arguments in sections 4 and 5 rely on the fact that ∂ τ u d and ∂ ξ u d provide bounded solutions of the linearization of (4.2) about a defect, while ω d and c d provided the corresponding Lagrange multipliers. Spatial inhomogeneities break the translation symmetry, which prevents us from using moving frames. In particular, we will only be able to study defects with vanishing speed c d = 0.

We omit the details and refer instead to [39, section 5] and <ref type="bibr">[49, section 8]</ref>, where analogous analyses have been carried out.</p><p>Corollary 6.3. If the hypotheses of the preceding theorem are met, and both the source and the inhomogeneity are symmetric (i.e., invariant under x → -x), then the Melnikov function M (p) is odd.

In particular, ψ c d (x, τ ) is odd in x, and the corollary follows then from Theorem 6.2.</p><p>In summary, large-amplitude sources with zero speed will be pinned to inhomogeneities, and their temporal frequency will change according to Theorem 6.2. In general, we therefore expect to see several pinned sources that have different temporal frequencies which depend on the location of the defects. Thus, our analysis seems to corroborate the statements made in [23, section 6.2.1], where inhomogeneities are mentioned as a possible explanation for the occurrence of what appears to be a one-parameter family of sources in the experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The experimental observations reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> seem to indicate, however, that these sources drift and are therefore not pinned. This issue therefore warrants further investigation.</p><p>For sinks with c d = 0, we do not expect pinning. Indeed, the intersection of centerunstable and center-stable manifolds is transverse for sinks at ε = 0 and therefore persists as a family of transverse intersections for all small ε independently of where we place the sink.</p><p>An alternative heuristic way of investigating the interaction of small-amplitude sinks with even smaller localized slowly varying inhomogeneities is via the approximation by the Burgers equation that we discussed in section 1.3. For ε = 0, the sinks or shocks in the Burgers equation have an eigenvalue at zero which is induced by translation symmetry. The resulting normally hyperbolic invariant manifold that consists of all translates of the sink persists for all ε close to zero. The leading-order terms of the perturbed flow on the invariant manifold are obtained by projecting the term in the Burgers equation that represents the inhomogeneous term g(x, u) in (6.8) onto the manifold using the adjoint eigenfunction associated with the translation eigenvalue. In conservation laws, the null space of the adjoint is spanned by the constant function, so the perturbed flow is given by the mass of the term that represents the inhomogeneity g(x, u). Since the Burgers equation (1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>) is written in terms of the wavenumber, it turns out that the derivative g x (x, u) of the inhomogeneity arises in the Burgers equation. Therefore, since the mass of g x (x, u) is zero, the reduced flow on the perturbed manifold vanishes to leading order, and the family of sinks persists with positions that are independent of the inhomogeneity. The spatial-dynamics argument presented above shows that the higher-order terms do not make a difference and that the situation remains unchanged for large-amplitude sinks and, typically, for large inhomogeneities. This analysis of the Burgers equation suggests also that sinks with c d = 0 will simply outrun the inhomogeneity without experiencing a noticeable change of velocity so that the inhomogeneity will merely affect the asymptotic wave train. Thus, we shall now briefly discuss the influence of inhomogeneities on wave trains. Note that wave trains with nonzero group velocity are not affected by an inhomogeneity as they arise as transverse intersections of their center-stable and center-unstable manifolds of (6.8) with ε = 0 which persist for all ε close to zero. In this setting, we may interpret inhomogeneities as pinned transmission defects.</p><formula xml:id="formula_149">(i) (ii) (iii) S s + S u - S s S u - W c W ss + (u + wt ) W uu -(u - wt ) source</formula><p>Wave trains with zero group velocity behave differently since small localized inhomogeneities create either contact defects or sources within such wave trains. To prove this, we again interpret wave trains as transverse intersections of center-unstable and center-stable manifolds. For wave trains with zero group velocity, this intersection, which consists precisely of the center manifold, is two-dimensional, and the vector field on it is given by (6.7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Factoring out the S 1 -symmetry that is generated by the temporal time shift, we are left with a small line segment parametrized by the wavenumber q. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.6(i), this line segment, considered as a subset of W cu -, is separated at u uu -into two half-lines by the strong-unstable manifold of the periodic orbit that corresponds to the wave train. Similarly, the strong-stable manifold cuts the line segment, considered as a subset of W cs + , into two halflines at u ss + . Without an inhomogeneity, we have u ss + = u uu -= u wt as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.6(i). The set of those initial data in W cu -whose solutions converge toward the wave train as ξ → -∞ (which we will refer to as the unstable set S u -) consists of points with line-segment coordinate u &lt; u uu -, i.e., of "half" of W cu -. Analogously, the stable set S s + of those data whose solutions converge to the wave train as ξ → ∞ consists of points whose line-segment coordinate satisfies u &gt; u ss + . Upon introducing the inhomogeneity, the transverse intersection will persist, but the stable and unstable sets may split. If u uu -&gt; u ss + as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.6(ii), then an intersection</p><formula xml:id="formula_150">S s + ∩ S u -= {u ∈ W cu -∩ W cs + ; u uu -&gt; u &gt; u ss + }</formula><p>occurs which corresponds to a one-parameter family of contact defects with varying phase slip.</p><p>If the and unstable sets split in the opposite direction, so that u uu -&lt; u ss + , then contact defects cannot appear. In this case, we may, however, use the parameter ω = ω nl (k * ) + ω to unfold the saddle-node wave trains at x = ±∞. While the intersection points on the fibers move linearly with ω, the dynamics on the base points of the fibers changes with the square root of ω. Thus, we denote the strong-stable manifold of the wave train u + wt at x = ∞ with positive group velocity by W ss + (u + wt ) and, analogously, the strong-unstable manifold of the wave train u - wt at x = -∞ with negative group velocity by W uu -(u - wt ). Furthermore, we denote their intersections with the one-dimensional manifold W c at x = 0 by v ss + and v uu -, respectively. We then have</p><formula xml:id="formula_151">v ss + (ω) = u ss (ε) -a + √ ω and v uu -(ω) = u uu (ε) + a - √ ω for certain positive coefficients a ± &gt; 0.</formula><p>In particular, we find a unique ω such that u ss + (ω) = u uu -(ω), which corresponds to a source as claimed.</p><p>6.6. Frequency locking through periodic forcing. Time-periodic forcing of the reactiondiffusion system breaks the temporal translation invariance and therefore tends to lock the frequency of defects to integer multiples of the forcing frequency ω f . As a consequence, the frequency is effectively removed as a parameter, and the time-derivative ∂ τ u d of defects no longer contributes to the null space of Φ d . Wave trains are still parametrized by their wavenumber k and arise as time-periodic solutions in a frame that moves with speed c, where ω nl (k)kc = ω f . (6.9) Note that the forcing frequency ω f and the nonlinear dispersion relation ω nl in the above equation can be replaced by rational multiples, which leads to further complications. For simplicity, we therefore focus on the simplest possible scenario. Thus, assume that the autonomous system (4.2) admits a transverse defect so that (6.9) is met for both k = k -and k = k + with c = c d . We then add a forcing term εg(t, u) with temporal frequency ω f to (1.1). A sink will persist regardless of its phase relative to the periodic forcing since the map ι si defined in (5.2) is onto (here, we add ε as a parameter and keep k ± fixed). For sources, we cannot vary the variable ω d that appears in the map ι so from <ref type="bibr">(5.4)</ref>. Instead, we use the relative phase difference θ defined via u d (ξ, τ + θ). As in section 6.5, we can then prove that sources persist for phase differences that correspond to simple roots of an appropriate Melnikov function M (θ). There should be an even number of such roots, which correspond to persisting sources that are alternately spectrally stable and unstable.</p><p>Alternatively, we may seek small-amplitude defects by studying the effect of temporal forcing on wave trains. As outlined above, wave trains will simply adjust their speed to ensure that (6.9) is met, and small-amplitude defects will therefore not occur.

The periodic orbits as well as the homoclinic connection therefore persist if we vary k -= k + , provided we choose c = c p = ω nl (k)/k. Thus, transmission defects arise with the same codimension as travelling waves and as proper modulated waves. In particular, defect speed and phase velocities can lock.</p><p>In contrast, phase velocity and defect speed of sinks, sources, and contact defects do not lock, since these defects arise as travelling waves only with a larger codimension than as defects with ω d = 0. Indeed, sinks and sources have k -= k + , so the condition c p (k -) = c p (k + ) is a genuine additional equation that raises the codimension by one. For contact defects, we need c p (k) = c g (k) along the branch which holds only if ω nl (k) = 0 as an explicit computation shows.</p><p>6.8. Large bounded domains. So far, we have focused on defects on the unbounded real line. Experiments, however, take place on bounded domains in a fixed laboratory frame. Thus, defects with nonzero speed are transient phenomena that disappear by colliding either with other defects or with the domain boundaries. Defects with speed close to zero, however, should exist over much longer time intervals. In this section, we shall therefore discuss the persistence of defects on large but bounded domains.</p><p>An additional motivation is provided by the need for computational tools that allow us to compute defects in an efficient way. Stable defects can, of course, be computed using direct simulations. If we are, however, interested in computing defects for many different parameter values, in finding their bifurcation points, or in computing unstable defects, then a formulation as a boundary-value problem that allows for a systematic continuation-using, for instance, auto97 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>-would be desirable. To obtain such a formulation, we consider (4.2) in the frame of the defect, truncate the real line to a finite bounded interval, and impose appropriate phase and boundary conditions. We currently implement this procedure in auto97.</p><p>Boundary layers. We begin by investigating how wave trains interact with boundaries. Thus, consider the half line R + with a boundary at x = 0. We focus on c = 0 and seek defects that are caused by the boundary conditions at x = 0. In the context of the modulated-wave equation (4.2), the boundary conditions at x = 0 are represented by the infinite-dimensional subspace B -of Y that consists of all elements of Y which satisfy the boundary conditions. We are interested in finding defects as orbits of (4.2) that lie in the intersection of -and the center-stable manifold W cs + (u wt ) of a wave train u wt . Thus, in analogy to section 6.3, we consider the map</p><formula xml:id="formula_154">ι bc : B -× W cs + -→ Y, (u 0 , u + ) -→ u 0 -u + .</formula><p>For boundary conditions such as Dirichlet, Neumann, and various mixed conditions for which the reaction-diffusion system (1.1) is well-posed, the injection map ι bc is Fredholm, and its index is zero if c g &gt; 0 and one if c g ≤ 0.</p><p>Therefore, we expect one-parameter families of sinks for wave trains, with group velocity c g &lt; 0 toward the boundary, that connect to the boundary at x = 0. This family of sinks is parametrized by the wavenumber k of the wave train at x = ∞. On the other hand, boundary-layer sources, which connect to wave trains with group velocity c g &gt; 0 away from the boundary, occur only for isolated wavenumbers k. Similarly, there is typically only a finite number of boundary-layer contact defects since c g = 0 is fixed, even though the Fredholm index is one.</p><p>Examples of boundary-layer contact defects are homogeneous oscillations under Neumann boundary conditions. For small wavenumbers, and group velocities directed toward the boundary, we then find boundary-layer sinks which, for Neumann boundary conditions, can be thought of as symmetric sinks since we can extend the equation to the entire real line by reflecting across the boundary. Our discussion of inhomogeneities in section 6.5 can also be used to show that, for any homogeneous oscillation, there exists an open set, in fact a half space, of Robin boundary conditions that emit wave trains. The resulting defects are therefore boundary-layer sources. The boundary conditions in the complementary half space produce solutions that are asymptotically homogeneous oscillations, that is, boundary-layer contact defects. We also refer to the discussion in [55, section 5.3] on the existence of two-dimensional radially symmetric target patterns that are generated by boundary conditions imposed at a small hole in the domain.</p><p>Truncation. We are now prepared to discuss whether defects on R can be approximated by defects on large but bounded intervals (-L, L). The discussion in the preceding section shows that the boundary conditions should be compatible in the sense that boundary-layer defects exist which absorb or generate the wave trains in the far field of the sources, contact defects, or sinks whose persistence we would like to prove.</p><p>Suppose, for instance, that there exist a source between wave trains with asymptotic wavenumbers k ± and boundary-layer sinks that absorb these wave trains at the boundaries x = ±L. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, it then follows that the source persists as a solution to the truncated problem in a frame moving with speed c(L) provided the frequency is adjusted to ω(L). Here, the corrections to speed and frequency satisfy (c(L), ω(L)) = (c d , ω d )+O(e -δL ) for some δ &gt; 0. Furthermore, the solution is O(e -δL ) close to the profile of the defect on R for |ξ| &lt; L/2 and to the boundary-layer sinks for |ξ| &gt; L/2. For symmetric sources and symmetric boundary conditions <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">11</ref> at ξ = ±L, we have c(L) ≡ 0.</p><p>Similar results are true for sinks, although there is the severe restriction that both asymptotic wave trains to be created by boundary-layer sources. For contact defects, we need to assume the existence of boundary-layer contact defects that connect to the boundary. To obtain persistence, we need to unfold the saddle-node wave trains in a fashion similar to the discussion in section 6.5. We omit the details.</p><p>Stability. Stability properties of defects on bounded intervals (-L, L) with fixed boundary conditions are remarkably different from their counterparts on R. First, the period map Φ L d of a defect on (-L, L) will have only point spectrum. We denote the union of all Floquet exponents of Φ L d by Σ L . If we take the limit as L → ∞, then the set Σ L converges to a limiting set in the symmetric Hausdorff distance where the convergence is uniform on bounded subsets of C <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The limiting set is the disjoint union of three sets, namely, the boundary spectrum Σ bdy , the extended point spectrum Σ ext , and the absolute spectrum Σ abs . Before defining them in detail, we remark that Σ bdy and Σ ext are discrete, while Σ abs is continuous in a sense that will be made precise below. The convergence of Σ L toward both the boundary spectrum and the extended spectrum is exponential in L and includes convergence of the algebraic multiplicity. The convergence toward the absolute spectrum, however, is algebraic of order O(1/L), and the number of elements in Σ L in any fixed neighborhood of an element of Σ abs tends to infinity as L → ∞.</p><p>We now define the three sets whose union is the limiting spectral set, and we begin with the absolute spectrum. We say that λ belongs to the complement of the absolute spectrum in C if there exist exponential weights η ± such that Φ dρ is Fredholm with index zero on L 2 η -,η + (R, C n ) and the relative Morse index of both asymptotic wave trains is zero relative to the exponential weights. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">12</ref> The absolute spectrum consists of a countable union of semialgebraic curves which end precisely in spatial double roots ν with Re ν = η ± of the dispersion relation of one of the asymptotic wave trains. We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> for more details.</p><p>The extended point spectrum consists of all λ ∈ C for which there are exponential weights η ± with the same properties as above so that the null space of Φ dρ on L 2 η -,η + (R, C n ) is not trivial. Last, the boundary spectrum is defined as the extended point spectrum of the boundary-layer defects that are involved in the construction of the defect on (-L, L).</p><p>Since we assumed that the wave trains are spectrally stable, we see that the absolute spectrum of sinks, transmission defects, and sources lies in the open left half-plane since the group velocities of the asymptotic wave trains are not zero. The absolute spectrum of contact defects always touches the imaginary axis at λ = 0 and consists, in fact, of a line segment λ &lt; 0 inside a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin. Indeed, the two roots ν ± near zero of the dispersion relation (6.2) λ = d ν 2 + d 3 ν 3 + O(ν 4 ) are complex conjugates for λ &lt; 0.</p><p>The extended point spectrum of sinks, transmission defects, and sources contains λ = 0 with multiplicity 0 for sinks, 1 for transmission defects, 2 for sources.</p><p>(6.10)</p><p>Last, the boundary spectrum near the origin is given as follows: 0 for each boundary-layer sink, for each boundary-layer source, <ref type="bibr">(6.11)</ref> where the time-derivative of the boundary-layer source provides the eigenfunction.</p><p>Thus, in summary, if we consider the union of boundary and extended point spectrum near the origin for truncated sinks and sources, then both of them have two eigenvalues near the origin. For truncated sinks, these two eigenvalues arise due to the two boundary-layer sources near the boundaries x = ±L, whereas the eigenvalues for truncated sources occur from the source itself with the two boundary-layer sinks not contributing any eigenvalues. While one of the two eigenvalues for truncated sinks or sources accounts for the time-derivative, i.e., for the temporal translation symmetry that is still present, the other eigenvalue, which is associated with the position of the defect relative to the boundary, is free to move and may stabilize or destabilize the truncated defect. 6.9. Interactions of defects. Heuristically, the interaction of defects with each other or with boundaries can be explained to a large extent by deriving formal solvability conditions. These conditions arise when we try to match defects, and they can be calculated by projecting certain matching terms onto the null space of Φ d -1, i.e., onto the eigenfunctions associated with λ = 0, using the adjoint eigenfunctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</p><p>First, we need to clarify what we mean when we refer to the eigenfunctions of Φ d associated with the Floquet exponent λ = 0, since the essential spectrum of Φ d touches λ = 0. We believe that the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues that we need to take into account are those that arise in the weighted spaces given in Theorem 6.1. Indeed, the essential spectrum of defects is generated by the asymptotic wave trains, and its effect is accounted for by the Burgers equation <ref type="bibr">(1.19)</ref>. Given our spatial-dynamics interpretation of the group velocities, we believe that the interaction of defects manifests itself in their spectra in the spaces L 2 η (R, R n ) with η chosen as in Theorem 6.1.</p><p>Transverse sinks do not have any eigenvalues at λ = 0 (see Theorem 6.1). Therefore, they do not interact with the tails of adjacent sources but instead react passively by adjusting their speed via (1.8) according to changes of the wavenumbers in the far field. Changing the phase (6.3) of one of the asymptotic wave trains will cause the sink to correct its position and temporal phase according to the algebraic phase jump condition (6.4).</p><p>Transverse sources have a double eigenvalue at λ = 0 that is induced by the derivatives of the source with respect to time and space. Therefore, for each source, we obtain two differential equations that define the time derivatives of its position and its phase as functions of perturbations in the far field. Since the associated adjoint eigenfunctions at λ = 0 are exponentially localized by Theorem 6.1, sources interact with adjacent defects or boundaries only very weakly, namely through terms of the form e -δL for δ &gt; 0 that are exponentially small in the distance L between the source and other defects or boundaries.</p><p>Transmission defects have a simple eigenvalue at λ = 0, and the associated adjoint eigenfunction is localized behind the defect, where the group velocity points away from the interface, and constant ahead of the defect. We therefore believe that transmission defects will adjust their phase instantaneously whenever the phase of the wave train ahead of them is changed. Downloaded 01/02/13 to 139.184.30.136. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php</p><p>The position and temporal phase of transmission defects are also affected by the presence of boundaries or perturbations their wake. These interactions are described by a single differential equation. Note that position and temporal phase are implicitly related through phase matching with the wave trains ahead of the transmission defect (see sections 6.1 and 6.2).</p><p>To our knowledge, interactions that involve contact defects have not been studied previously (not even on a formal level). We believe that Theorem 4.5, which asserts that the Evans function has a simple root at λ = 0, may play an important role, since this root may change the temporal algebraic decay rate of localized perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. 6.10. Genericity. Our goal in this paper has been to present a list of transverse defects. It is a challenging task to prove whether, and in what sense, this list is complete.</p><p>From a formal point of view, we included all possible combinations of group velocities c ± g relative to the defect velocity c d with the exception of one-sided contact defects for which one of the group velocities is equal to the defect speed but the other one is not, i.e., for which either c</p><formula xml:id="formula_155">- g = c d = c + g or c - g = c d = c + g .</formula><p>The reason for omitting one-sided contact defects is that they form part of the boundary of the region in (k -, k + ) space where transverse sinks exist. Put differently, in any given system, we expect that only a finite number of wavenumbers occur that are generated by boundaries or by sources. In general, there is no reason why one-sided defects should be selected as they occur only in one-parameter families. For the same reasons, we do not take degenerate sinks, transmission defects, or contact defects into account even though degeneracies, such as eigenvalues at the origin with higher multiplicity, can typically be found by varying only the asymptotic wavenumbers. If we therefore wish to exclude degenerate defects as well as one-sided contact defects, we may consider introducing a notion of genericity that requires the persistence of generic defects when we truncate the real line to a large but finite interval with generic boundary layers in the sense of section 6.8.</p><p>The reason for including sources as generic defects is that they actively select wavenumbers. Similarly, we wish to regard contact and transmission defects as generic since they occur within a background of wave trains with identical wavenumber. In other words, the reason for their generic existence is that they accommodate phase slips within an oscillatory medium (see section 6.2). Interpreted in a different way, contact and transmission defects occur in open sets of wavenumbers once we impose the constraint that k -= k + .</p><p>From a purely mathematical viewpoint, and thinking solely in terms of the codimension with which a certain heteroclinic orbit exists, there is no difference between, say, transmission defects and one-sided contact defects. However, the goal would be to find a notion of genericity that accurately reflects the physical intuition that we described above, i.e., that allows sources, for instance, but rejects one-sided contact defects. 6.11. Higher space dimensions. The classification we have presented is valid for essentially one-dimensional media. In particular, our approach, and therefore our results, apply equally well to problems on cylindrical domains with a bounded higher-dimensional cross section. Indeed, the key feature that we exploited are exponential dichotomies which exist provided the operators encountered enjoy certain compactness properties that are satisfied for the cross-sectional variables whenever the cross section is bounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>.</p><p>In fact, our results can also be adapted immediately to cover line defects in the plane that are spatially periodic in the direction parallel to the line defect <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. If we, for the sake of clarity, choose coordinates so that the line defect corresponds to x = 0, so that y the variable parallel to the line defect, then the modulated-wave equation (4.2) would contain the Laplace operator in the y variable, while the spatial evolution variable would be the x-variable transverse to the defect. We would then pose (4.2) on the space of functions that are periodic in time and in y. For instance, line defects between planar wave trains that propagate in a direction parallel to the defect can be easily analyzed in this framework.</p><p>Certain two-dimensional point defects, such as spiral waves and target patterns in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction or stationary focus patterns in convection experiments, are amenable to a similar description since we can measure group velocities in the radial variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. A classification analogous to the one presented here has not yet been attempted in higher space dimensions.</p></div>

The splitting distance of the strong-unstable and the strong-stable manifold, on the other hand, is given by  <ref type="bibr">(7.31)</ref> defines, to leading order, a small nonempty cone in the (γ, δ)plane (see Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.3). The reversible connection indeed exists as both the center-unstable and the center-stable manifolds intersect the fixed-point space {N = 0} of the reverser transversely, which follows from the expression for ψ 1 (0) and since N d (0) = R d (0)/2 = 0. Last, we show that the reversible contact defects persist if we vary the wavenumber k * near k * = 0. To accomplish this, it suffices to prove that the center-unstable and center-stable manifolds of the equilibrium k * = 0 intersect transversely along the contact defect. Thus, we evaluate their splitting distance (7.29) at k * = 0, which yields ∆ cd 0 (k, 0; γ, δ) = where we exploited the fact that the splitting distance vanishes at k = 0 due to reversibility of (7.12). We infer from the above expression that the center-unstable and center-stable manifolds intersect transversely at k = 0 provided γ + 6  5 δ + O(2) = 0. This curve, along which transversality fails, lies outside the existence cone (7.31) for contact defects, which proves that the reversible contact defects are robust and persist under variations of k * .</p><formula xml:id="formula_178">∆ cd 1 (γ, δ) = ψ 1 (0), W uu (0) -W ss (0) = M γ 1 (0)γ + M δ 1 (0)δ + O<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Theorem 7.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion.</head><p>We have presented a framework that allows us to systematically study interfaces between nonlinear wave trains with possibly different wavenumber. We used this approach to analyze sinks, contact defects, transmission defects, and sources which are specific defects with distinguished characteristics that occur robustly in reaction-diffusion systems. In addition, we discussed the stability and interaction properties of these defects and investigated some of their bifurcations.</p><p>The major open problem is the completeness of the above classification. Other open issues are the nonlinear stability of contact defects, transmission defects, and sources. We also emphasize that the list of bifurcations that we discussed is not exhaustive. Last, it would be interesting to see how individual defects can be accounted for in a macroscopic description of oscillatory media by coupling mean-field equations of Burgers type to ordinary differential equations for the position and phases of defects.</p><p>From now on, we shall use the notation u θ (ξ) := u(ξ, θ(ξ)+•). To derive differential equations for θ and w, we take the scalar product of (A. To prepare for the later use of the contraction-mapping principle, we modify the nonlinear terms. We choose two cut-off functions χ 0 (r) and χ 1 (r) such that χ 0 (r) ≥ 0, χ 1 (r) ≤ 0, and χ 0 (r) = r for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, 2 for r ≥ 2, χ 1 (r) = 1 for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, 0 for r ≥ 2.</p><p>Instead of (A.8) and (A.10), we then consider the equations θ ξ = δχ 0 B 0 (θ)w + G 0 (θ, w) δ , (A.11) w ξ = A(θ)w + G 1 (θ, w), <ref type="bibr">(A.12)</ref> where</p><formula xml:id="formula_179">A(θ) = A 0 + F u (u θ d ) -∂ τ u θ d B 0 (θ), (A.13) G 1 (θ, w) = χ 1 |w| Y δ F(u θ d + w) -F(u θ d ) -F u (u θ d )w -G 0 (θ, w)∂ τ u θ d .</formula><p>We emphasize that our cut-off preserves the S 1 -equivariance with respect to the symmetry θ → θ + θ for θ ∈ R.

We therefore choose ω and c as in <ref type="bibr">(7.26</ref>) so that a given point k = k * on the manifold of equilibria persists as a saddle-node equilibrium for (γ, δ) = 0. We define the Melnikov integrals</p><p>where F denotes again the right-hand side of (7.12). A tedious but straightforward computation gives</p><p>We are now ready to describe the bifurcation picture for small (γ, δ). Consider a twodimensional section transverse to the flow that lies in a small neighborhood of (R d , S d , N d,r , N d,i )(0) in the three-dimensional manifold described by the algebraic relation <ref type="bibr">(7.13)</ref>. In this two-dimensional section, the center-stable and center-unstable manifolds coincide when (γ, δ, ω, c) = 0. Their intersection forms a line which is parametrized by the coordinate k of the base point of the corresponding strong-stable fiber on the center manifold (which is, in fact, the manifold of equilibria). Since the general bifurcation diagram is rather complicated, we focus separately on the two cases δ = 0 (the CGL) and k * = 0.</p><p>First, we set δ = 0. Since we are interested in contact defects, we choose (ω, c) according to <ref type="bibr">(7.26</ref>) so that the fixed base point k * persists as a saddle-node equilibrium. To find contact defects, we need to solve ∆ cd 0 (k, k * ; γ, 0) = 0. Using its definition (7.29), we see that the nontrivial roots of this equation are given by k = ±1/ √ 3 and by k = k * . The first case is close to the Eckhaus instability, and we will not consider it here. Instead, we show that the second case cannot lead to contact defects: We focus first on the region γ &gt; 0, so that the unstable manifold of the saddle-node equilibrium k * for (7.27) is the set k &lt; k * . Since M γ 1 (k * ) &gt; 0, however, the strong-unstable manifold of the equilibrium k * will miss the stable set of the equilibrium k * as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.2(i). For γ &lt; 0, both the sign of the splitting distance and the flow on the slow manifold change sign, and we again conclude that there is no homoclinic orbit to k * = 0. In particular, there are no contact defects for δ = 0. Varying ω and c to unfold the saddle node at k = k * , we see that sources are created. Indeed, we can parametrize the equilibria in the unfolding of the saddle node using µ</p><p>The Melnikov integrals with respect to µ j vanish since the parameters µ j enter only at second order. The base points, however, change to leading order in µ j , which allows us to find an intersection of the strong-stable and strong-unstable fibers. These intersections, which correspond to sources, are known as the Nozaki-Bekki holes and can be given explicitly in terms of elementary functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</p><p>Appendix A.

There are positive numbers κ and C 1 such that the equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>)</p><p>Proof. We will prove the lemma by beginning with an equation for which we know that exponential dichotomies exist and then successively changing the equation until we arrive at (A.16). We will make sure that the equations will have exponential dichotomies at each stage by appealing to the roughness theorem for dichotomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and to Theorem A.4 in section A.2. To save notation, we consider the linear equation w ξ = Aw and simply give the different operators A in our chain of equations.</p><p>We begin by recalling that the linearization A = A 0 + F u (u wt (kξ + θ 0 )) about the asymptotic wave train has center-stable and strong-unstable exponential dichotomies uniformly in θ 0 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 2]</ref>. Since θ d (ξ) → 0 as ξ → ∞, Theorem A.4 in section A.2 implies that there is a ξ 0 &gt; 0 so that A 0 + F u (u wt (kξ + θ d (ξ))) has center-stable and strong-unstable exponential dichotomies for ξ ≥ ξ 0 . Invoking the roughness theorem [39, Theorem 1] finally shows that A 0 + F u (u d (ξ)) has center-stable and strong-unstable dichotomies for ξ ≥ 0 with rate κ and constant C 1 .</p><p>In summary, we showed that</p><p>has center-stable and strong-unstable dichotomies for ξ ≥ 0. It therefore remains to establish the same result for</p><p>where θ ≡ 0. Note that, by construction, any solution w(ξ) of (A.18) for which w(0), ∂ τ u d (0) = 0 satisfies</p><p>for all ξ. It is then not difficult to see that (A.18) restricted to solutions that satisfy (A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>) has center-stable and strong-unstable dichotomies since (A.18) is merely part of the decomposition Downloaded 01/02/13 to 139.184.30.136. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php From this point on, we can proceed, with very minor modifications, as in the proof of Fenichel's theorem given in [42, section 2 and Appendix A] by setting up a contraction-mapping argument on the space Y 1 η 0 . Since the proof in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> is very detailed, we decided not to repeat it here. We should, however, comment on an additional result that we need to make the proof in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> work. In order to apply the arguments on <ref type="bibr">[42,</ref> page 73], we need the following optimal-regularity result.</p><p>Lemma A. </p><p>is well defined and bounded as long as 0 &lt; η &lt; κ.</p><p>Proof. Define E u 0 = Rg(Φ uu θ (0, 0)), and consider the operator</p><p>It follows as in [49, section 5.2] that T is a closed unbounded operator on Y η with inverse given by S, which proves the lemma.</p><p>The optimal-regularity result allows us also to prove smooth dependence of the fixed point on the parameters (ω, c). Indeed, if we define</p><p>we can replace u and F by ǔ and F and proceed exactly as above.</p><p>Finally, we mention that the resulting center-stable manifold is constructed in the artificially augmented phase space w ∈ Y 1 . The intersection of this manifold with the smooth bundle defined by (A.5) is transverse, since the normal direction to the bundle is contained in the center subspace. Therefore, the "true" center-stable manifold, defined as the intersection of the center-stable manifold that we constructed above and the bundle given by (A.5), is the desired smooth and flow-invariant center-stable manifold. The statements about fibers can be proved as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref> for a given function θ = θ(ξ), where A(θ) has been defined in (A.13). We assume that (A.25) has an exponential dichotomy on R + for each constant function θ(ξ) ≡ θ 0 ∈ R and that the rate κ and the constant C of the dichotomies can be chosen independently of θ 0 ∈ R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. Slowly varying coefficients. We consider the equation</head><p>The following theorem, proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> for ODEs and PDEs, respectively, shows that (A.25) then has dichotomies for any slowly varying function θ(ξ).</p><p>Theorem A.4. There are positive constants ε 0 , κ, and Č such that (A.25) has an exponential dichotomy on R + with rate κ and constant Č for each differentiable function θ(ξ) with θ(0) = 0 and sup ξ≥0 |θ (ξ)| ≤ ε 0 .</p><p>Proof. We denote by Φ s θ 0 (ξ, ζ) and Φ u θ 0 (ξ, ζ) the exponential dichotomies of the equation w ξ = A(θ 0 )w for constant functions θ(ξ) ≡ θ 0 ∈ R. Since the θ 0 -dependent terms of the operator A(θ 0 ) are bounded and depend smoothly on θ 0 (see (A.13) and (A.9)), the robustness theorem for exponential dichotomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> implies that these dichotomies can be chosen to depend smoothly on θ 0 ∈ R. In fact, there are positive constants C and κ such that</p><p>uniformly in ξ ≥ ζ ≥ 0. We denote by E u 0 the range of the unstable projection Φ u 0 (0, 0) for θ 0 = 0.</p><p>Next, pick a function θ(ξ) so that θ(0) = 0 and sup ξ≥0 |θ (ξ)| ≤ ε 0 . Consider the operator</p><p>which is independent of θ. We may consider T as a closed unbounded operator on L 2 (R + , Y ). If we can prove that T (θ) has a bounded inverse with bounds that are independent of θ, then the theorem is proved as we may then proceed as in [49, section 5.3.1] to construct exponential dichotomies of (A.25) with constants and rates that do not depend on θ.</p><p>Thus, we have to solve the equation </p><p>with S(θ) ≤ ε 0 C 1 for some C 1 &gt; 0 that does not depend on θ. Therefore, 1 + S(θ) is invertible on L 2 (R + , Y ) uniformly in θ provided ε 0 &gt; 0 is smaller than 2/C 1 . The desired solution to (A.29) is then given by u := L(θ)g = Ľ(θ)[1 + S(θ)] -1 g, where Ľ(θ) has been defined in <ref type="bibr">(A.30)</ref>. This proves that T (θ) has a bounded inverse on L 2 (R + , Y ) and, together with the fact that T (θ) is closed, shows that the inverse is bounded as an operator into the domain of T (θ). Since the bounds are clearly independent of θ, we have proved our claim and therefore the theorem. which excites both Turing and Hopf modes. We solved the system (B.1) using a forward Euler scheme in time and centered finite differences in space.</p></div>			</div>
