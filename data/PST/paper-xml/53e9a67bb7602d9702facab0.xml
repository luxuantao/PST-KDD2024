<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In multiperson decision making (MPDM) problems, it is quite natural that different decision makers may have different experience, cultures and educational backgrounds. As a result, these decision makers may use different preference representation structures to express their individual preference information.</p><p>Chiclana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> initiated a notable MPDM model based on fuzzy preference relations, where the preference information can be represented by means of preference orderings, utility functions and fuzzy preference relations. Chiclana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> further incorporated multiplicative preference relations in the MPDM model. Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed a multiplicative MPDM model involving three kinds of preference representation structures (preference orderings, utility functions, multiplicative preference relations), assuming the multiplicative preference relations as the uniform element of the preference representation structures. Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> presented a linguistic MPDM model based on linguistic preference relations, integrating fuzzy preference relations, different types of multiplicative preference relations and multigranular linguistic preference relations. Moreover, Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Herrera and Martínez <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Herrera-Viedma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Mata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, Chen and Ben-Arieh <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> introduced several methods to solve the MPDM problems with multi-granularity linguistic evaluation information. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Herrera-Viedma et al. proposed a consensus model for the MPDM problem with different preference representation structures. Palomares et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> proposed an attitude-driven web consensus support system for heterogeneous group decision making.</p><p>Several desirable properties have been proposed in the MPDM model with different preference representation structures. Chiclana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> discussed the conditions under which the reciprocity property is maintained in the aggregation of fuzzy preference relations using the ordered weighted average (OWA) operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> guided by a relative linguistic quantifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Meanwhile, in the above MPDM models, the internal consistency is a key issue. The internal consistency refers to the ranking among alternatives derived from the transformed preference representation structure is the same one from the original preference representation structure. Chiclana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> studied the conditions under which the internal consistency is maintained.</p><p>Inspired by the MPDM model initiated by Chiclana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the corresponding consensus model presented in Herrera-Viedma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and also inspired by the direct approach presented in Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, this study proposes a direct consensus framework for MPDM problems with different preference representation structures (preference orderings, utility functions, multiplicative preference relations and fuzzy preference relations). In the direct consensus framework, the individual selection methods, associated with different preference representation structures, are used to obtain individual preference vectors of alternatives. Then, the standardized individual preference vectors are aggregated into a collective preference vector. Finally, based on the collective preference vector, the feedback adjustment rules, associated with different preference representation structures, are presented to help the decision makers reach consensus. The results in this study are helpful to complete Chiclana et al.'s MPDM with different preference representation structures, based on the following reasons:</p><p>(i) The proposed framework can avoid internal inconsistency issue when using the transformation functions among different preference representation structures. (ii) It satisfies the Pareto principle of social choice theory.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the preliminary knowledge regarding four kinds of preference representation structures (preference orderings, utility functions, multiplicative preference relations and fuzzy preference relations) and the OWA operator. A direct consensus framework for MPDM problems with different preference representation structures is proposed, and the differences between our proposal and models presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> are analyzed in Section 3. Following this, the selection process is designed in Section 4. Subsequently, Section 5 proposes the consensus processes to help the decision makers reach consensus. Two desirable properties are presented in Section 6, and an illustrative example is provided in Section 7. Finally, concluding remarks are included in Section 8.</p></div>

A vector U = (u 1 , u 2 , . . ., u n ) T is called a utility function, where u i 2 [0, 1] represents the utility evaluation value given by a decision maker to the alternative x i . Definition 3 (Multiplicative preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>). A matrix A = (a ij ) nÂn is called a multiplicative preference relation if a ij Â a ji = 1 and a ij &gt; 0 for "i, j, where a ij indicates a ratio of the preference intensity of alternative x i to that of x j . Definition 4 (Fuzzy preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>). A fuzzy preference relation on a set of alternatives X is represented by a matrix P = (p ij ) nÂn , where p ij 2 [0, 1] denotes the preference degree of the alternative x i over x j . A fuzzy preference relation usually assumed to be additive reciprocal, i.e., p ij + p ji = 1, "i, j.</p></div>

Inspired by these two processes, we proposed a direct framework for MPDM problems with four kinds of preference representation structures.

The details of the consensus process are introduced in Section 5.</p><p>Note 1: Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> argued that two basic selection models may be considered.

The proposed framework is based on the direct approach, so this framework is called the direct consensus framework in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> The direct consensus framework is inspired by the MPDM model initiated by Chiclana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the corresponding consensus model presented in Herrera-Viedma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, there are some differences between our proposal and the models presented  in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Specifically, the differences are shown from three aspects:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Differences between our proposal and the models presented in</head><p>(1) Process of selection.</p><p>The process of selection consists of three steps in models presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, namely: (i) making the information uniform through transformation functions, in order to carry out the next step of aggregation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, preference orderings, utility functions and multiplicative preference relations are transformed into fuzzy preference relations employing the corresponding transformation functions; (ii) aggregating all the uniformed individual preferences into a collective one via an aggregation operator. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, a collective fuzzy preference relation is obtained in this step; and (iii) ranking alternatives or selecting the best alternative (s) according to the quantifier-guided dominance degree (QGDD) and the quantifier-guided non-dominance degree (QGNDD).</p><p>In our direct consensus framework, the implementation of the process of selection contains two steps: (i) obtaining individual preference vectors by using the corresponding individual selection methods; and (ii) obtaining a collective preference vector by aggregating all the standardized individual preference vectors. In Section 6.2, an example (i.e., Example 1) is provided to illustrate these differences regarding the selection processes. (2) Process of consensus.</p><p>Compared with the model presented in Herrera-Viedma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, we proposed the novel feedback adjustment rules. The proposed feedback adjustment rules are associated with the individual preference representation structures, and consist of two steps: (i) the standardized collective preference vector is transformed into the preference information that is described by the preference representation structure used by the individual decision maker; and (ii) decision makers revised his/her preferences, according to the original individual preference information and the transformed collective preference information. The details of the feedback adjustment rules are introduced in Section 5.2.

These two methods have similar effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. However, the time complexity of the EM is greater than the RGMM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>In this study, we investigate the MPDM problem with different preference representation structures (preference orderings, utility functions, multiplicative preference relations and fuzzy preference relations). The main points presented are as follows:</p><p>(1) Inspired by the MPDM model initiated by Chiclana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the corresponding consensus model presented in Herrera-Viedma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and also inspired by the direct approach presented in Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, we propose a direct consensus framework for MPDM problems with different preference representation structures. (2) We present the selection process in the direct consensus framework. In the proposed selection process, the individual selection methods, associated with different preference representation structures, are used to obtain individual preference vectors of alternatives. Then, the standardized individual preference vectors are aggregated into a collective preference vector. (3) We propose the consensus process in the direct consensus framework. In the proposed consensus process, based on the collective preference vector, the novel feedback adjustment rules, associated with different preference representation structures, are presented to help the decision makers reach consensus. (4) We show that the proposed framework can avoid the internal inconsistency issue, and also satisfy the Pareto principle of social choice theory.</p><p>Moreover, Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and Fan and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> initiated several optimization-based models to integrate different preference representation structures. We argue that it will be interesting in any future research to see if a comparative study of different MPDM models with different preference representation structures is proposed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
