<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper addresses the problem of cluster formation control for a networked multi-agent system in the simultaneous presence of aperiodic sampling and communication delays. First, to fulfil multiple formation tasks, a group of agents are decomposed into M distinct and nonoverlapping clusters. The agents in each cluster are then driven to achieve a desired formation while the multi-agent system as a whole accomplishes M cluster formations. Second, by a proper modeling of aperiodic sampling and communication delays, an aperiodic sampled-data cluster formation protocol is delicately constructed such that the information exchanges among neighboring agents only occur intermittently at discrete instants of time. Third, a detailed theoretical analysis of cluster formability is carried out and a sufficient and necessary condition is provided such that the system is M -cluster formable. Furthermore, a discontinuous Lyapunov functional approach is developed to derive a design criterion on the existence of an admissible sampled-data cluster formation protocol.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>F ORMATION control, as one of the most fundamental distributed cooperative control problems for multi-agent systems (MASs), has attracted considerable interest from control and robotics communities in recent years. Applications of multi-agent formation control cover a broad range of areas, such as search and rescue operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, satellite and spacecraft formation flying <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, source seeking and exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Generally, the objective of formation control is to drive a group of autonomous agents to achieve and to maintain a desired geometric structure or pattern on their states or outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Up until now, significant research efforts have been devoted to addressing formation control of various MASs, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, nonholonomic mobile robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, first-order integrators <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, second-order integrators <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and higher-order dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Note that different agent dynamics and formation tasks call for different formation control strategies. Representative approaches for multi-agent formation control in the literature can be arguably categorized as behaviorbased approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, virtual structure approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, leader-following approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, graph theory-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and consensus approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Although several formation protocols and algorithms for MASs have been designed in the literature, it is worth mentioning that most aforementioned results are developed to solve a single formation control problem, where all the agents therein are driven to form one single geometric pattern. However, such a single formation case may be unrealistic or even fail to perform multiple distinct formation tasks in many practical circumstances. For example, consider the crime deterrence scenario by making multi-robot formations in a sense of security against invaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. When there is more than one invader passing along a way in a surveillance area, a team of mobile robots should be first broken down into multiple groups and then different groups make various troop formations to capture or enclose the invaders. The other example is the search and rescue scenario by multiple robots in a disaster site, where victims are required to be located and rescued. In this case, a diverse group of robots with different capabilities should be deployed to develop various formations so as to efficiently find and aid the victims. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to employ a single-formation-based control strategy and the existing multi-agent formation protocols and algorithms cannot be applied to implement multiple formation missions.</p><p>Recently, inspired by the existing group/cluster consensus literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the time-varying group formation control problem for a linear MAS was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The agents therein were partitioned into multiple subgroups and multiple sub-formations were realized by the whole MAS. Sufficient conditions for group formation were derived and an algebraic Riccati equation based approach was presented to design the group formation protocol. Note that the formation protocol in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> requires continual and instantaneous interagent communication, which means that each agent communicates with its neighboring ones at every instant of time and information sent by each agent is instantly delivered to its neighbors. Apparently, this requirement is not suitable within a networked communication environment. For example, in the wireless networked multi-quadrotor UAV system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, each quadrotor's state (position and velocity) should be first sampled by digital measurement modules at discretized instants and then be sent to a ground control station through a wireless communication medium (e.g., the Zigbee network). In this situation, conventional formation control protocols based on continual inter-agent communication are no longer applicable on account of sampled and digital measurement. Besides, practical communication networks may suffer from limited network bandwidth and/or congested network traffic, thus rendering delayed or lost information exchange among the agents. For example, in underwater vehicle navigation, the communication channel possesses low bit rates, delays and data losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These network-induced constraints (e.g., sampling, delays, data losses) may result in most of the aforementioned formation protocols suffering from limitations when applying to networked MASs. Hence, the following question naturally arises: Does there exist an admissible formation control protocol such that a networked MAS can simultaneously realize multiple distinct formations even under the effects of some network-induced constraints? To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a problem has not been addressed yet, which deserves an investigation. This motivates the present study.</p><p>In this paper, we will address the cluster formation control problem for an MAS operating via a communication network. A generalized M -cluster state formation framework will be considered such that the MAS evolves various predefined formations to suit for different distributed tasks. For this purpose, we will decompose a group of agents into M disjoint clusters, while the agents in each cluster will be required to reach a specific geometric formation. It will be shown that the developed M -cluster formation framework covers some existing single formation frameworks, group (or cluster) consensus frameworks and (leadless) consensus frameworks as its special cases. The major contribution is twofold. i) A delicate aperiodic sampled-data cluster formation protocol will be proposed under which the information exchanges among neighboring agents only take place intermittently at discrete and aperiodic sampling instants. Communication delays among the agents will also be taken into account; and ii) A sufficient and necessary condition which guarantees the M -cluster formability of the MAS will be derived and a numerically efficient criterion for designing the desired cluster formation protocol will also be presented.</p></div>

A directed path in a digraph is a sequence of distinct and ordered edges taking of the form (i, i 1 ), (i 1 , i 2 ), • • • , (i p-1 , i p ), (i p , j). A cycle of a digraph is a directed path beginning and ending with the same agent i = j. A digraph with no cycles is called a directed acyclic graph (or a DAG for short). A digraph has a directed spanning tree if there exists at least one node which has a directed path to any other nodes.</p></div>

Non-Overlapping Decomposition</head><p>Different from the existing formation control problems where all the agents are governed to form a single geometric pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, in the following, we will consider a cluster formation problem. To achieve this goal, the N agents in (1) will be firstly split into several clusters such that the whole MAS will achieve various predefined geometric formations. In doing so, the following definition is presented.</p><p>Definition 1: Let V be an index set of N interacting nodes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">If there exist M clusters V 1 , V 2 , • • • , V M , where 1 ≤ M ≤ N , such that 1) V m = Ø, ∀ m ∈ M = {1, 2, • • • , M }; 2) ∪ M m=1 V m = V; and 3) V m ∩ V n = Ø, ∀ m, n ∈ M; m = n, then {V 1 , V 2 , • • • , V M } is called a non-overlapping decom- position (NOD) of the index set V.</formula><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the following definition is given.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Definition 2: For any graph G = (V, E, A), let {V 1 , V 2 , • • • , V M } be an NOD of the index set V and G m be the underlying subgraph of the node subset V m in G, ∀ m ∈ M. Furthermore, define a digraph G as follows: 1) The node set V consists of G 1 , G 2 , • • • , G M , i.e., each G m ∈ V , ∀ m ∈ M, represents a node in G ; and 2) The edge set E consists of paired nodes (G m , G n ), ∀ m, n ∈ M. There is an edge (G m , G n ) from the G n -th node to G m -th node in G if and only if there exist p ∈ V m and q ∈ V n such that (p, q) ∈ E in G. Then, G is called a graph with NOD if G is a DAG. Consider that the communication topology G = (V, E, A) of MAS (1) is a graph with NOD {V 1 , V 2 , • • • , V M }. Denote by {G 1 , G 2 , • • • , G M } the underlying subgraphs of subset {V 1 , V 2 , • • • , V M },</formula><p>respectively. Then, there always exists a suitable relabel of the indices for all agents in G such that the Laplacian matrix L associated with the graph G is lower triangular of the following form <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L =      L 11 0 • • • 0 L 21 L 22 • • • 0 . . . . . . . . . . . .

Let n m be the number of nodes in the subset V m , ∀ m ∈ M. Without loss of generality, the subset V m is indexed as V m = {l m + 1, l m + 2, • • • , l m + n m , }, ∀ m ∈ M,</formula><p>where l m = ∑ m-1 s=0 n s with n 0 = 0. Before we proceed, the following mild assumption is introduced, which is also commonly made in the study of group/cluster consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Assumption 1: Each row sum of L mn , ∀ m, n ∈ M, is zero. Remark 1: Note that a geometric interpretation of Assumption 1 can be obtained by an in-degree balanced graph defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. More specifically, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, G m is said to be in-degree balanced to G n , ∀ m, n ∈ M, if any node p in G m satisfies ∑ ln+nn q=ln+1 a pq = 0 for all nodes in G n , which equals to each zero row sum of L mn .</p><p>Assumption 2: G m , ∀ m ∈ M, has a directed spanning tree. Remark 2: By virtue of Assumption 1, one can see that L mm is the Laplacian matrix of the non-negatively weighted subgraph G m , ∀ m ∈ M. In the meantime, Assumption 2 indicates that zero is a simple eigenvalue of L mm , ∀ m ∈ M, and all the other nonzero eigenvalues are with positive real parts.</p><p>Based on the above assumptions, we recall the following lemma which plays an important role in the subsequent theoretical analysis.</p><p>Lemma 1: <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> Under Assumptions 1 and 2, the Laplacian matrix L of the form (2) has M simple zero eigenvalues with associated linearly independent right eigenvectors</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">v 1 = col{1 n1 , 0 N -n1 }, v 2 = col{0 n1 , 1 n2 , 0 N -n1-n2 }, • • • , v M = col{0 N -n M , 1 n M };</formula><p>and the real parts of all other N -n M eigenvalues are positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. M -Cluster State Formation</head><p>A formation often represents a geometric structure or pattern which satisfies some prescribed inter-agent geometric constraints achieved and preserved by a group of agents. There are a variety of formation representations, such as distancebased formations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, displacement-based formations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and position-based formations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In the sequel, we use the relative vectors between agents to describe the geometric formation pattern.</p><p>For any m ∈ M, the desired state formation of the agents in cluster V m is represented by the following augmented timeinvariant vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">fm = col{f lm+1 , f lm+2 , • • • , f lm+nm } ∈ R nmnx where f p ∈ R nx , ∀ p ∈ V m ,</formula><p>is the anticipated sub-formation vector for agent p. Let F = col{ f1 , f2 , • • • , fM } be the vector specifying the desired cluster state formation of all the N agents and xm (t) = col{x lm+1 (t), x lm+2 (t), • • • , x lm+nm (t)} be the augmented state vector of the agents in cluster V m . The definition of M -cluster state formation is given as follows.</p><p>Definition 3: (M -Cluster State Formation) MAS (1) achieves M -cluster state formation specified by F if there exists a vector-valued function r m (t) ∈ R nx such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">lim t→∞ ( xm (t) -fm -rm (t) ) = 0 nmnx , ∀ m ∈ M (3)</formula><p>holds for any given bounded initial condition, where rm (t) = 1 nm ⊗ r m (t) with r m (t) ∈ R nx representing a formation position vector in cluster V m to be determined later. Remark 3: Note that if (3) holds, then one has</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">lim t→∞ (x p (t) -f p -r m (t)) = 0 nx (4)</formula><p>for any p ∈ V m ; m ∈ M. Thus, x p (t) -f p eventually reaches a common value, which guarantees that the desired formation shape can be maintained. Moreover, an alternative representation of (3) can be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">lim t→∞ (x p (t) -x q (t)) = f p -f q , p, q ∈ V m (5)</formula><p>for each cluster. This requires that the state difference between any two agents p and q in the same cluster asymptotically converges to the desired constant offset f p -f q , which defines the formation shape/frame, and thus the two patterns formed by x p (t) and f p for all the agents in the same cluster are congruent. In this sense, the desired formation in each cluster can be successfully achieved by the agents. It should be mentioned that r m (t) in ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is defined to guide a group of agents to track an anticipated trajectory fm . Thus, r m (t) can be deemed as a position vector of the formation in cluster V m . Consequently, the control objective of M -cluster formation is to make all the agents in cluster V m reach an agreement on r m (t) while keeping the offset vector fm and the MAS as a whole reaches M cluster formations. On the other hand, from (5), if f p ≡ f q for any p, q ∈ V m , then one has lim t→∞ (x p (t) -x q (t)) = 0. In other words, all the n m agents in cluster V m achieve a point formation or reach a state consensus. In this case, the proposed M -cluster formation framework covers the existing cluster (or group) state consensus frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> as a special case. In particular, if there is only one cluster involved in MAS (1), then one has from (5) that lim t→∞</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(x i (t) -x j (t)) = f i -f j , ∀ i, j ∈ V.</formula><p>On this occasion, the proposed M -cluster state formation framework reduces to the conventional single state formation frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Furthermore, if one enforces f i ≡ f j , ∀ i, j ∈ V, the well-studied state consensus frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> can be retrieved. Hence, the proposed M -cluster formation framework is more general than some existing ones.</p><p>Remark 4: Assumption 1 reveals that the intra-cluster interactions represented by L mm in the same cluster are all cooperative and the inter-cluster interactions represented by L mn , m = n, among different clusters are either cooperative or antagonistic. This assumption is reasonable in practical situations because the agents in the same cluster should work cooperatively to achieve a desired formation, while the agents among different clusters can work either cooperatively or antagonistically only provided the MAS as a whole achieves various expected cluster formations. As a matter of fact, the particular case of L mn ≡ 0 nm×nn for any m = n implies that M clusters of agents are controlled independently to realize M various formations. However, it should be pointed out that the inter-cluster interactions highlight a distinct difference between the proposed M -cluster state formation and M independently controlled state formations. Allowing different clusters to be interacted enables one to perform multiple formation control more efficiently and effectively. For example, consider a disaster site where a team of robots is controlled to perform the search and rescue mission for survivors. If the framework of M independently controlled formations is adopted, M clusters of robots can be controlled independently by M distant control stations. Due to lack of inter-cluster interactions, it is quite possible that two clusters of robots finally locate the same victim while leaving another victim without being detected and treated timely.</p></div>

First, Theorem 2 is numerically efficient for large-scale MASs as one only needs to validate four linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which are both independent of the number of agents. Second, by the newly developed discontinuous Lyapunov functional approach, it is expected that Theorem 2 is less conservative than the criteria using traditional continuous and time-independent Lyapunov functional approaches. Owing to the discontinuous term V d,i (•), the proposed Lyapunov functional candidate <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> takes full advantage of the sawtooth characteristic of the delay τ (t) generated by the aperiodic sampling periods and ZOH. Third, Theorem 2 can be applied, in a general way, to resolve the problems of consensus, cluster consensus or single formation for networked MASs with aperiodic sampling and communication delays, as discussed in Remark 3. </p><formula xml:id="formula_35">Y X Unicycle robot i ) (t x i ) (t y i ) (t v i ) (t i φ ) (t i ω</formula></div>

It can be seen that 1) A(f p -f q ) = 0 for any p, q ∈ V m ; q ∈ N p ; m ∈ M, thus H can be chosen as 0; 2) In cluster V 1 , the six robots' positions xp (t) and ȳp (t) will be driven to achieve a regular hexagon formation in the XY plane; in cluster V 2 , the three robots' positions will be driven to achieve a regular triangle formation in the XY plane; and in cluster V 3 , the four robots' positions will be driven to achieve a square formation in the XY plane; and 3) the robots' linear velocities νx i (t) and νy i (t) will be driven to reach a 3-cluster consensus. The initial conditions of robots are randomly chosen as ϕ i (t) = col{15(rand -0.5)m, 10(rand -0.3)m/s, 15(rand -0.5)m, 10(rand -0.3)m/s} for t ∈ [-h max , 0], where rand denotes a uniformly distributed pseudorandom number on the interval (0, 1). Select σ = 0.7, h = 80ms and h = 350ms. Solving Theorem 2, it is found that the LMIs are feasible with K = I 2 ⊗ [0.0584, 0.2305]. In this simulation, the piecewise linear delay τ (t) = t -t k + h is generated randomly such that h k ∈ [h, h]. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> depicts the sawtooth evolution of the delay function τ (t).

More specifically, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the trajectories of positions, linear velocities and formation position of the 3cluster robot formation control system under CFP (9) within t = 40s. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> demonstrates the snapshots of position trajectories of the 3-cluster robot formation control system at t = 0s, t = 8s, t = 20s and t = 40s, respectively. Based on the above simulation results, one can see that the multirobot system under consideration can successfully achieve the desired 3-cluster formation on the positions xi (t) and ȳi (t), and also reach the desired 3-cluster consensus on the linear velocities νx i (t) and νy i (t), respectively, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed sampled-data cluster formation control approach.     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>The cluster formation control problem of a networked MAS subject to aperiodic sampling and communication delays has been addressed. To fulfil different formation tasks, a group of agents have been decomposed into M non-overlapping clusters. The agents in different clusters have been driven to achieve distinct state formations, and thus the MAS as a whole has reached the desired M -cluster formation. Then, by a proper modeling of aperiodic sampling and communication delays among agents, an aperiodic sampled-data transmission scheme has been developed. Moreover, a sufficient and necessary condition on the cluster formability and a sufficient condition on the existence of an admissible sampled-data cluster formation protocol have been provided. An application to a team of nonholonomic mobile robots has been studied, through which the effectiveness of the proposed sampleddata distributed cluster formation control approach has been demonstrated through simulations.</p></div>
