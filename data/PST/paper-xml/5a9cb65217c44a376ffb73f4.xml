The new human-cooperative strategies are developed to detect the human subject's movement efforts in order to make the robot behavior flexible and adaptive. The motion intention extracted from the measurement of the subject's muscular effort in terms of the applied forces/torques can be represented to derive the reference trajectory of his/her limb using a viable impedance model. Then, adaptive online estimation for impedance parameters is employed to deal with the nonlinear and variable stiffness property of the limb model. In order for the robot to follow a specific impedance target, we integrate the motion intention estimation into a barrier Lyapunov function based adaptive impedance control. Experiments have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed dual-arm coordination control scheme, in terms of desired motion and force tracking.</p><p>Index Terms-Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), dual-arm exoskeletons, human-cooperative manipulations, variable stiffness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the past decades, exoskeleton robots have been developed for human power augmentation and rehabilitation training <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. One of the most critical issues in controlling a robotic exoskeleton is to enable the robots to understand the human's motion intention so that the robots could actively cooperate with the human subject. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the bimanual tasks for dual-arm manipulation can be classified into two categories: symmetric bimanual task and asymmetric bimanual task. In practice, most tasks need bimanual dual-arm cooperation in an asymmetric manner, and asymmetric tasks bring more challenges in the control design than symmetric tasks do. In this paper, we develop an asymmetric bimanual coordination control for a dual-arm exoskeleton system to cooperate with a human in which the left hand is holding a canvas whereas the right hand a pen drawing a line by tracing a circular trajectory on the canvas. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the velocities of the two manipulators' end-effectors can be viewed as relative motions by the introduction of a relative Jacobian, which combines the individual Jacobians of both manipulators together. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, by using the relative Jacobian, the kinematic redundancy of the dual-arm system was utilized for optimizing torque distributions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, both kinematics and dynamics using the relative Jacobian were presented, and the robust/model-free impedance controller for a dual-arm system was proposed. However, the aforementioned works focus on industrial manipulators without consideration of human participation. Moreover, each manipulator is assumed to be redundant and far from singular configurations, while in practice, singularities and physical constraints can be encountered during the performance of the task. Thus, it is necessary to investigate cooperative control strategies into the task requirements and handle the various constraints at the same time.</p><p>In human-robot cooperative manipulation, to enable a robot to actively collaborate with the human operator, we must solve the problem of how to make the exoskeleton robot understand the motion intention of the human operator. In the robotics community, impedance control has been regarded as an effective approach to achieve the physical human-robot interaction. When a human subject intends to change the motion, a load force would be produced as the robot extracts its motion in terms of the force exerted by the human subject. To solve this problem, we expect to estimate the motion intention of the human operator and integrate it into the control system design. In this paper, we use the position and force sensors as a communication medium between human arms and robot arms. In order to estimate the motion intention of the human operator from available sensory information, many efforts have been made <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, one of the main problems of these works is that the variable stiffness property was not considered in the impedance model for motion intention estimation. Consequently, the estimation may not be accurate enough.</p><p>On the other hand, special consideration should also be taken into account for the dual-arm exoskeleton with position and velocity constraints in manipulation tasks for avoiding the singularity region, physical limits, dangerous region, etc. It is necessary to carefully deal with the constraints in the control design. For robot control design, barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) emerge as a promising approach for handling such physical constraints such as joint limits, torque limits, and safety zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Considering the problems mentioned above, in this paper, we propose an asymmetric bimanual coordinate control for the dual-arm exoskeleton to perform human-cooperative manipulation. The contributions can be summarized as follows. 1) The force caused by the subject's muscular effort that is reflected during the interaction is used to detect the intention of the human operator's motion.</p><p>2) The approach of impedance parameters approximation is presented to estimate the variable stiffness, with the instantaneous measurements of the force and the position of the dual-arm endeffectors. 3) A novel BLF-based adaptive impedance control is proposed for the dual-arm exoskeleton in consideration of the position and velocity constraints.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. HUMAN-ROBOT COOPERATIVE MOTION GENERATION</head><p>Various approaches have been proposed for estimating the stiffness of robot actuators <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, these approaches cannot be applied to human-robot cooperation due to ignoring the estimation of human intention. In general, human intention can be represented by the applied force/torque to derive the system's reference motion, that is, it is passed to the system dynamics to determine the reference states of the system (velocity and position) through the human limb dynamic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, the muscle impedance of human limbs has been proven to be a mechanical transducer unit that can be possibly regulated during manipulation tasks and that demonstrates variable stiffness property. It is necessary to investigate the dynamic model between impedance estimation and human intention in consideration of variable stiffness. In this paper, a six-axis force/torque sensor is used to estimate the muscular efforts that the subject contributes to the end-effector, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>) and (c) and to predict the operator's motion in advance.</p><p>Consider an example of mechanical impedance for human limbs with an additional unknown force function ς(x, u) as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f = mẍ + b ẋ + kx + ς(x, u) (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where f is the applied force, x is the steady-state displacement, m is the mass parameter, b is the damper coefficient, k is the spring stiffness, and u is internal states or inputs, however unknown. We assume that exact values of f and the position x are measurable, and the corresponding derivatives of these variables can be obtained, and the stiffness-regulating input u is bounded with its first derivative u.</p><p>Then, assume that the ratio between the stiffness regulation rate of change and the velocity of the trajectory measurement is bounded, for instance, for any time t during the execution of the observer, the following inequality holds</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">| u(t)| &lt; u| ẋ(t)|, ∀t.

It is easy to calculate ΔK by using</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ΔK i = ξ i /(X m i -X e i ) if ξ i can be obtained.</formula><p>In this paper, we consider the human limb stiffness as the summation of the fixed term K and the variable term Ξ. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the human limb model is mainly related with the damper and spring components, and it can be simplified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">B e ( Ẋm -Ẋe ) + K(X m -X e ) + Ξ = F m (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where B e and K are unknown impedance parameters. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">6</ref>), it is difficult to calculate X e due to unknown B e and K, even if F m can be measured by a force sensor. Therefore, we need to estimate B e and K so we can achieve the reference position X e for the robotic exoskeleton in the task space.</p><p>Define K e = K + ΔK and the given desired interaction force F d , which is considered as the desired human intention. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">6</ref>) and the analytic solution of a linear first-order differential equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we can obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">X m = e -s 1 t (C 1 + C 2 t 0 s 2 e t 0 s 1 d v dt) + X e + K -1</formula><p>e F m , where C 1 and C 2 are constants, s 1 = t 0 K e /B e dt and s 2 = B -1 e F m are variables.

It should be noted that the reference trajectory X r is generated by the human intention F d and the human limb movement K -1 e F d penetrating into the environment, which is precisely the human limb penetration needed to produce the desired human intention F d .</p><p>However, the values of X e , K e , ΔK e , and B e are usually unknown. Let us consider using their estimations as replacement of their real values. Let Xe , Ke , and Be denote the estimations of X e , K e , and B e , respectively.

DYNAMICS OF THE DUAL-ARM EXOSKELETON ROBOT</head><p>The complete dual-arm exoskeleton dynamics including the human and robot can be described in the joint space as</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">H(q)q + C(q, q) q + M g (q) + τ d = τ + J T R λ (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">H(q) = diag[M A (q A ), M B (q B )</formula><p>] ∈ R n×n is the block diagonal of combined inertia matrices with the subscripts A and B presenting the human arm and the exoskeleton manipulator I, and the human arm and exoskeleton manipulator II, respectively. Subsequently, we keep such notions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">C(q, q)q = diag[C T A (q A , qA ) qA , C T B (q B , qB ) qB ] T ∈ R n is the combined torques of Coriolis and centrifugal forces; M g (q) = diag[G T A (q A ), G T B (q B )</formula><p>] ∈ R n×n is the gravitational matrix contributed by both the human operator and exoskeleton robot;</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">τ = [τ T A , τ T B ]</formula><p>T ∈ R n is the joint torque vector of dual arms; τ d ∈ R n is the unknown mechanical disturbance.

The constraint force can be measured by a force sensor on the end-effector and can be converted into joint space as f = J T R (q)λ ∈ R n where J R (q) = ∂ h ∂ q ∈ R l×n with l = 6, where λ ∈ R l is a generalized Lagrangian multiplier.</p><p>Inspired by the implicit function theorem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, there exists a proper partition of q, i.e., q = [q 1 T , q 2 T ] T for q 1 ∈ R n -l , and q 2 ∈ R l , such that h(q) = 0 can be rewritten as q 2 = Ω(q 1 ) with a nonlinear mapping function Ω. Considering the partition Ẋco = J R (q) q, we can derive Ẋco = [ ẊT 1 , ẊT 2 ] T and J R (q) = diag[J 1 (q), J 2 (q)], Ẋ1 = J 1 q1 , Ẋ2 = J 2 q2 .

Moreover, we have the following relationship for the independent coordinates q 1 , q1 as q = [(q 1 ) T , Ω(q 1 ) T ] T , q = [I n -l , ∂ Ω (q 1 ) ∂ q 1 ] T q1 = A(q 1 ) q1 . Differentiating the constraint h(q) = 0 with regard to time t, we have J R (q)A(q 1 ) q1 = 0. Noting that q1 is an independent coordinate, we have J R (q)A(q 1 ) = 0 and A T (q 1 )J T R (q) = 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EXPERIMENTS</head><p>The developed dual-arm exoskeleton robot consists of two 5-DOF exoskeleton platforms shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>). There are five revolute joints in the developed exoskeleton. Motors 1-5 are used for shoulder abduction-adduction, shoulder flexion-extension, elbow flexionextension, forearm pronation-supination and wrist radial-ulnar deviation, respectively. By using ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), we can estimate the human intention X r in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Therefore, a force sensor needs to be used to measure the interactive force between human and the dual-arm exoskeleton robot, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>), which is mounted on the end-effector of the right arm.</p><p>A drawing task is considered in the experiment as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>). The left arm moves according to the predetermined trajectory on the circular object held by the end-effector of the right arm. Five joints/DOFs are involved in the experiment, i.e., three joints/DOFs of the left arm to perform drawing task, and two joints/DOFs of the right arm to maintain the circular object. The left arm maintains the contact during the drawing. During execution of the task, the desired relative trajectories are designed to keep the end-effector of the left arm perpendicular to the surface of the circular object, which is held by the end-effector of the right arm. A constant force is exerted in vertical direction on the circular object. We first predefine a time-varying target trajectory and second employ the designed human intention estimation method to recognize the human's real intention and then drive the dual-arm exoskeleton robot to follow the recognized human intention by the developed adaptive control strategy. Specifically, the shoulder joint of the exoskeleton robot's left arm is constrained between two predefined target positions, whereas the elbow joint of the exoskeleton robot's left arm is expected to be constrained between another two predefined target positions. The same experiment was repeatedly performed five times with five different subjects whose information are Subject 1 (male; age: 24; height: 165 cm; weight: 59 kg), Subject 2 (male; age: 25; height: 181 cm; weight: 65 kg), Subject 3 (male; age: 24; height: 172 cm; weight: 72 kg), Subject 4 (female; age: 23; height: 160 cm; weight: 45 kg), and Subject 5 (female; age: 28; height: 158 cm; weight: 51 kg). Due to the similarity of the experimental results and page limits, we only present the results of Subjects 1, 3, and 5.</p><p>The results of the three subjects are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref><ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>. First, Subject 1's experimental results are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. The estimations of the human arm, i.e., B e , K e , and Ξ, are updated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(a)-(c</ref>). The interaction force and its estimation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(d)</ref>. The estimated human intention trajectories for the end-effector are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. The figure illustrates that the end-effector tracks the de-      sired trajectory with sufficiently small tracking errors. It is obvious that the tracking errors are smaller as time evolves. From these figures, the desired performance is obtained by using the proposed control scheme, even if little dynamics knowledge of the exoskeleton and the external disturbances in the environment is available. Moreover, in order to make an evaluation of the coincidence between the interaction force and its estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, a metric is employed: 2 , where N is the sampling data number in experiments, and i denotes the ith sampling point. The definition of the metric is able to quantitatively describe the estimation errors of the human subjects' motion intention, so the metric values are used to evaluate the performance of the experiments. Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref> and Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> show the results of Subjects 3 and 5, respectively. From these figures, we observe that the dual-arm exoskeleton is able to recognize the human intention by the proposed human intention estimation method and also can track the desired human intention trajectory effectively by the proposed adaptive control strategy. The external force exerted on the circular object held by arm II's end-effector is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>. We can observe that the actual external force λ tracks the target force λ d with small tracking error as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> for all the five subjects and the trajectory of λ shows the tendency of converging to the target force λ d . The metric values of Subjects 1, 3, and 5 are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">D = 1 N N i = 1 (F m 1 (i) -Fm 1 (i)) 2 + (F m 2 (i) -Fm 2 (i))</formula><p>We also perform a comparison experiment using the conventional impedance control method. In the comparative experiment, we choose the impedance parameters as . The force controller parameter in (32) is chosen as K f = 5. The target external force is λ d = -2.0N . We choose ĉi = 0(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) as the initial values of adaptive laws. Parameters in adaptive laws are set to Γ i = 0.15 and σ i = 2/(t + 1) 2 . The interaction force is measured by a force sensor mounted on the end-effector of the right arm. The design parameters with regard to the human arm model are chosen as γ K i = 0.1, γ B i = 0.1, and γ e i = 0.01. Moreover, our controller is designed at the torque level. Since the motor current is proportional to the motor torque and the current values from the motor drivers can be measured, we therefore use the input currents as control signals to track the desired currents, which are obtained by transferring the desired torques into the desired currents. This explains how the control law is designed at the torque level and why the results in the figures use currents as input signals.</p><p>The results of comparative experiments among all five subjects using the traditional impedance control method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>. The five lines in every figure denote the experiment result of each subject. The estimated human intention for exoskeleton shoulder and elbow joints are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(a) and (b). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(c) and (d) shows the measured interaction force in the experiment process. The input torque for the two joints are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(e) and (f). From Figs. 2-4 and 9(c) and (d), we observe that when using our human intention identification scheme, the interactive force between the exoskeleton robot arm and its human partner is smaller. In the comparative experiment, we used the same impedance parameters for all the five subjects. Moreover, we have compared the intersubject experimental results in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref><ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref>. From these figures, we see that the estimated human arm parameters B e , K e , and Ξ are considerably different. It is understandable because different human subjects should have different arm parameters. Though the human arm parameters cannot be identified exactly, we can approximate the human arm parameters using our method proposed in Section III. The damping parameter Be and the stiffness parameter Ke are calculated by the adaptation law <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, respectively. Then, the parameters can be approximated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. The proposed adaptation laws show that the estimated impedance parameters are able to make Fm → F m and F m → F d , which is proved in the appendix. This demonstrates that the parameters can be used to obtain human intention. The experimental results verify that the developed method is able to estimate the desired human intention F d while the motion tracking errors are convergent in the meantime.</p><p>The following performance indices are used to measure the quality of the proposed control method. The statistics are presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper developed a BLF-based adaptive impedance control for dual-arm exoskeleton with unknown intention of the human operator, unknown robot dynamics, and physical limits. The motion intention of the human operator is considered as the desired trajectory, and impedance parameter online approximation is employed to deal with the nonlinear and variable stiffness property of the human limb model. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed dual-arm coordination controller is effective. In the future work, we plan to take stroke patients as participants in the experiments to test control performance of our design.</p></div>
