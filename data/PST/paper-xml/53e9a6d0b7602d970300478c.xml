<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In this work, we consider the adaptive control problem for nonlinear systems in the following normal form: being a new control variable. When the nonlinearities a(x) and b(x) are unknown, many adaptive control schemes have been developed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the references therein), in which the unknown function b(x) is usually approximated by a function approximator b(x; ) (where is an estimated weight or parameter vector). Consequently, the estimate b(x; ) must be away from zero for avoiding a possible singularity problem. Several attempts have been made to deal with such a problem, as follows: i) choosing the initial parameter (0) sufficiently close to the ideal value by off-line training before the controller is put into operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>;</p><p>ii) using projection algorithms to guarantee the estimate inside a feasible set, in which b(x; ) 6 = 0 (some a priori knowledge for the studied systems is required for constructing the projection algorithms) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; iii) modifying the adaptive controller by introducing a sliding mode control portion to keep the control magnitude bounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; iv) applying neural networks or fuzzy systems to approximate the inverse of b(x) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which requires the upper bound of the first time derivative of b(x) being known a priori. In this correspondence, by introducing a modified Lyapunov function, a novel Lyapunov-based adaptive controller is presented. The singularity issue mentioned above is completely avoided, and at the same time, the stability and control performance of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. In Section II, we present the plant, assumptions, and some notations used in the paper. In Section III, a novel Lyapunov func- The authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117576 (e-mail: elegesz@nus.edu.sg).</p><p>Publisher Item Identifier S 0018-9286(00)00804-7.</p><p>tion is developed to construct a desired Lyapunov-based controller.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES</head><p>We study the adaptive control problem for nonlinear system (1) with unknown smooth functions a(x) and b(x). The control objective is to design a globally stable adaptive controller such that the system output y follows a desired trajectory y d as close as possible. if e(0) = 0 and js(t)j C, 8 t 0 with constant C &gt; 0, then e(t) 2 c, 8t 0 with c = e je i j 2 i01 i0n C; i = 1; 2; 11 1; n</p><p>and iii) if e(0) 6 = 0 and js(t)j C, then e(t) will converge to c within a time-constant (n01)=.

The main purpose of setting parameter " in controller ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is for adjusting the size of " . From a practical perspective, the size of the compact set z (depending on " and d ) is very important in the construction of function approximator. For example, when applying RBF neural networks, selection of the number and centers of basis functions is mainly based on the region of interest that corresponds to z. In general, the larger the set z is, the more the neural networks nodes are needed for achieving the same approximation accuracy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A number of large-scale systems founded in the real world are composed of a set of small interconnected subsystems, such as power systems, digital communication networks, economic systems, and urban traffic networks. It is generally impossible to incorporate many feedback loops into the controller design and is too costly even if they can be implemented. These difficulties motivate the development of decentralized control theory, in which each subsystem is controlled independently of its locally available information.</p><p>The decentralized stabilization problem for deterministic interconnected linear systems with uncertainties satisfying the so-called strict matching conditions has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and references therein. The interconnections among subsystems treated in these papers are mostly bounded by first-order polynomials of state. It was pointed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that a decentralized control system based on the first-order bounded interconnections may become unstable when the interconnections are of higher order. Recently, following the development of centralized control of deterministic nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a decentralized adaptive stabilization for a class of large-scale deterministic interconnected nonlinear systems was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, in which the strict matching condition was relaxed and higher order polynomial interconnections among subsystems were considered.</p><p>In this paper, we shall investigate a global decentralized stabilization problem for a class of large-scale stochastic nonlinear systems with strong interconnections, which involve first-order and higher order polynomial interconnections as special cases. Inspired by the recent work of centralized stochastic nonlinear control <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we show that the decentralized global robust stabilization can be achieved for the interconnected, large-scale, stochastic nonlinear systems by employing a Lyapunov-based recursive controller design method. Both the state feedback control and dynamic output feedback control are considered. Our results extend existing centralized global stabilization results for stochastic systems to decentralized control of large-scale interconnected stochastic nonlinear systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>_ xi = xi+1; i= 1; 2; 111 ; n 0 1 _ x n = a(x) + b(x)u; y = x 1 ; (1) where x = [x1; x2; 11 1; xn] T 2 R n state variables; u 2 R system input; y 2 R system output; a(x) and b(x) smooth functions.
