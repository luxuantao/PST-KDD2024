<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Introduction</head><p>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a paradigm for designing metaheuristic algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. The first algorithm which can be classified within this framework was presented in 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and, since then, many diverse variants of the basic principle have been reported in the literature. The essential trait of ACO algorithms is the combination of a priori information about the structure of a promising solution with a posteriori information about the structure of previously obtained good solutions.</p><p>Metaheuristic algorithms are algorithms which, in order to escape from local optima, drive some basic heuristic: either a constructive heuristic starting from a null solution and adding elements to build a good complete one, or a local search heuristic starting from a complete solution and iteratively modifying some of its elements in order to achieve a better one. The metaheuristic part permits the lowlevel heuristic to obtain solutions better than those it could have achieved alone, even if iterated. Usually, the controlling mechanism is achieved either by constraining or by randomizing the set of local neighbor solutions to consider in local search (as is the case of simulated annealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> or tabu search <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>), or by combining elements taken by different solutions (as is the case of evolution strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and genetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> or bionomic <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> algorithms).</p><p>The characteristic of ACO algorithms is their explicit use of elements of previous solutions. In fact, they drive a constructive low-level solution, as GRASP <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> does, but including it in a population framework and randomizing the construction in a Monte Carlo way. A Monte Carlo combination of different solution elements is suggested also by Genetic Algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, but in the case of ACO the probability distribution is explicitly defined by previously obtained solution comp onents.</p><p>The particular way of defining components and associated probabilities is problem-specific, and can be designed in different ways, facing a trade-off between the specificity of the information used for the conditioning and the number of solutions which need to be constructed before effectively biasing the probability distribution to favor the emergence of good solutions. Different applications have favored either the use of conditioning at the level of decision variables, thus requiring a huge number of iterations before getting a precise distribution, or the computational efficiency, thus using very coarse conditioning information.</p><p>The chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the common elements of the heuristics following the ACO paradigm and outlines some of the variants proposed. Section 3 presents the application of ACO algorithms to a number of different combinatorial optimization problems and it ends with a wider overview of the problem attacked by means of ACO up to now. Section 4 outlines the most significant theoretical results so far published about convergence properties of ACO variants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Ant Colony Optimization</head><p>ACO <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> is a class of algorithms, whose first member, called Ant System, was initially proposed by Colorni, Dorigo and Maniezzo <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The main underlying idea, loosely inspired by the behavior of real ants, is that of a parallel search over several constructive computational threads based on local problem data and on a dynamic memory structure containing information on the quality of previously obtained result. The collective behavior emerging from the interaction of the different search threads has proved effective in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, we use the following notation. A combinatorial optimization problem is a problem defined over a set C = c 1 , ... , c n of basic components. A subset S of components represents a solution of the problem; F ⊆ 2 C is the subset of feasible solutions, thus a solution S is feasible if and only if S ∈ F. A cost function z is defined over the solution domain, z : 2 C à R, the objective being to find a minimum cost feasible solution S*, i.e., to find S*: S* ∈ F and z(S*) ≤ z(S), ∀S∈F.</p><p>Given this, the functioning of an ACO algorithm can be summarized as follows (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>). A set of computational concurrent and asynchronous agents (a colony of ants) moves through states of the problem corresponding to partial solutions of the problem to solve. They move by applying a stochastic local decision policy based on two parameters, called trails and attractiveness. By moving, each ant incrementally constructs a solution to the problem. When an ant completes a solution, or during the construction phase, the ant evaluates the solution and modifies the trail value on the components used in its solution. This pheromone information will direct the search of the future ants.</p><p>Furthermore, an ACO algorithm includes two more mechanisms : trail evaporation and, optionally, daemon actions. Trail evaporation decreases all trail values over time, in order to avoid unlimited accumulation of trails over some comp onent. Daemon actions can be used to implement centralized actions which cannot be performed by single ants, such as the invocation of a local optimization procedure, or the update of global information to be used to decide whether to bias the search process from a non-local perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>More specifically, an ant is a simple computational agent, which i teratively constructs a solution for the instance to solve. Partial problem solutions are seen as states. At the core of the ACO algorithm lies a loop, where at each iteration, each ant moves (performs a step) from a state ι to another one ψ, corresponding to a more complete partial solution. That is, at each step σ, each ant k computes a set A k σ (ι) of feasible expansions to its current state, and moves to one of these in probability. The probability distribution is specified as follows. For ant k, the probability p ιψ k of moving from state ι to state ψ depends on the combination of two values:</p><p>• the attractiveness η ιψ of the move, as computed by some heuristic indicating the a priori desirability of that move; • the trail level τ ιψ of the move, indicating how proficient it has been in the past to make that particular move: it represents therefore an a posteriori indication of the desirability of that move.</p><p>Trails are updated usually when all ants have completed their solution, increasing or decreasing the level of trails corresponding to moves that were part of "good" or "bad" solutions, respectively.</p><p>The general framework just presented has been specified in different ways by the authors working on the ACO approach. The remainder of Section 2 will outline some of these contributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Ant System</head><p>The importance of the original Ant System (AS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> resides mainly in being the prototype of a number of ant algorithms which collectively implement the ACO paradigm. AS already follows the outline presented in the previous subsection, specifying its elements as follows.</p><p>The move probability distribution defines probabilities pιψk to be equal to 0 for all moves which are infeasible (i.e., they are in the tabu list of ant k, that is a list containing all moves which are infeasible for ants k starting from state ι), otherwise they are computed by means of formula <ref type="bibr">(5.1)</ref>, where α and β are userdefined parameters (0 ≤ α,β ≤ 1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">         ∉       ⋅ + + = ∑ ∉ otherwise 0 tabu ) ( if p k ) ( k ιψ η τ η τ ιζ β ιζ α ιζ β ιψ α ιψ ιψ k tabu (5.1)</formula><p>In formula 5.1, tabu k is the tabu list of ant k, while parameters α and β specify the impact of trail and attractiveness, respectively.</p><p>After each iteration t of the algorithm, i.e., when all ants have completed a solution, trails are updated by means of formula (5.2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">τ ιψ (τ) = ρ τ ιψ (τ -1) + ∆τ ιψ (5.2)</formula><p>where ∆τ ιψ represents the sum of the contributions of all ants that used move (ιψ) to construct their solution, ρ, 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1, is a user-defined parameter called evaporation coefficient, and ∆τ ιψ represents the sum of the contributions of all ants that used move (ιψ) to construct their solution. The ants' contributions are proportional to the quality of the solutions achieved, i.e., the better solution is, the higher will be the trail contributions added to the moves it used. For example, in the case of the TSP, moves correspond to arcs of the graph, thus state ι could correspond to a path ending in node i, the state ψ to the same path but with the arc (ij) added at the end and the move would be the traversal of arc (ij). The quality of the solution of ant k would be the length L k of the tour found by the ant and formula (5.2) would become τ ij (t)=ρ τ ij (t-1)+∆τ ij , with</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∑ = ∆ = ∆ m k k ij ij 1 τ τ (5.3)</formula><p>where m is the number of ants and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">k ij τ ∆</formula><p>is the amount of trail laid on edge (ij) by ant k, which can be computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">     = ∆ otherwise 0 tour its in (ij) arc uses ant if L Q k k ij k τ (5.4)</formula><p>Q being a constant parameter.</p><p>The ant system simply iterates a main loop where m ants construct in parallel their solutions, thereafter updating the trail levels. The performance of the algorithm depends on the correct tuning of several parameters, namely: α, β, relative importance of trail and attractiveness, ρ, trail persistence, τ ij (0), initial trail level, m, number of ants, and Q, used for defining to be of high quality solutions with low cost. The algorithm is the following.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Ant Colony System</head><p>AS was the first algorithm inspired by real ants behavior. AS was initially applied to the solution of the traveling salesman problem but was not able to compete against the state-of-the art algorithms in the field. On the other hand he has the merit to introduce ACO algorithms and to show the potentiality of using artificial pheromone and artificial ants t o drive the search of always better solutions for complex optimization problems. The next researches were motivated by two goals: the first was to improve the performance of the algorithm and the second was to investigate and better explain its behavior. Gambardella and Dorigo proposed in 1995 the Ant-Q algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, an extension of AS which integrates some ideas from Q-learning, and in 1996 Ant Colony System (ACS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> a simplified version of Ant-Q which maintained approximately the same level of performance, measured by algorithm complexity and by comp utational results. Since ACS is the base of many algorithms defined in the following years we focus the attention on ACS other than Ant-Q. ACS differs from the previous AS because of three main aspects:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pheromone</head><p>In ACS once all ants have computed their tour (i.e. at the end of each iteration) AS updates the pheromone trail using all the solutions produced by the ant colony.</p><p>Each edge belonging to one of the computed solutions is modified by an amount of pheromone proportional to its solution value. At the end of this phase the pheromone of the entire system evaporates and the process of construction and update is iterated. On the contrary, in ACS only the best solution computed since the beginning of the computation is used to globally update the pheromone. As was the case in AS, global updating is intended to increase the attractiveness of promising route but ACS mechanism is more effective since it avoids long convergence time by directly concentrate the search in a neighborhood of the best tour found up to the current iteration of the algorithm.</p><p>In ACS, the final evaporation phase is substituted by a local updating of the pheromone applied during the construction phase. Each time an ant moves from the current city to the next the pheromone associated to the edge is modified in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">( ) ( ) 0 ) 1 ( τ ρ τ ρ τ ⋅ - + ⋅ = 1 - t t ij ij</formula><p>where 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 is a parameter (usually set at 0.9) and τ 0 is the initial pheromone value. τ 0 is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">τ 0 =(n•L nn ) -1</formula><p>, where L nn is the tour length produced by the execution of one ACS iteration without the pheromone component (this is equivalent to a probabilistic nearest neighbor heuristic). The effect of local-updating is to make the desirability of edges change dynamically: every time an ant uses an edge this becomes slightly less desirable and only for the edges which never belonged to a global best tour the pheromone remains τ 0. An interesting property of these local and global updating mechanisms is that the pheromone τ ij (t) of each edge is inferior limited by τ 0 . A similar approach was proposed with the Max-Min-AS (MMAS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>) that explicitly introduces lower and upper bounds to the value of the pheromone trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>State Transition Rule</head><p>During the construction of a new solution the state transition rule is the phase where each ant decides which is the next state to move to. In ACS a new state transition rule called pseudo-random-proportional is introduced. The pseudorandom-proportional rule is a compromise between the pseudo-random state choice rule typically used in Q-learning [WQ92] and the random-proportional action choice rule typically used in Ant System. With the pseudo-random rule the chosen state is the best with probability q 0 (exploitation) while a random state is chosen with probability 1-q 0 (exploration). Using the AS random-proportional rule the next state is chosen randomly with a probability distribution depending on η ij and τ ij . The ACS pseudo-random-proportional state transition rule provides a direct way to balance between exploration of new states and exploitation of a priori and accumulated knowledge. The best state is chosen with probability q 0 (that is a parameter 0 ≤ q 0 ≤ 1 usually fixed to 0.9) and with probability (1-q 0 ) the next state is chosen randomly with a probability distribution based on η ij and τ ij weighted by α (usually equal to 1) and β (usually equal to 2) .</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">{ }        ≤ ⋅ ∉ on) (explorati otherwise 2.1 rule AS ion) (exploitat if max arg = ) ( 0 q q s ij ij k tabu ij β α η τ (5.5)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hybridization and performance improvement</head><p>ACS was applied to the solution of big symmetric and asymmetric traveling salesman problems (TSP/ATSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. For these purpose ACS incorporates an advanced data structure known as candidate list <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. A candidate list is a static data structure of length cl which contains, for a given city i, the cl preferred cities to be visited. An ant in ACS first uses candidate list with the state transition rules to choose the city to move to. If none of the cities in the candidate list can be visited the ant chooses the nearest available city only using the heuristic value η ij . ACS for TSP/ATSP has been improved by incorporating local optimization heuristic (hybridization): the idea is that each time a solution is generated by the ant it is taken to its local minimum by the application of a local optimization heuristic based on an edge exchange strategy, like 2-opt, 3-opt or Lin-Kernighan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. The new optimized solutions are considered as the final solutions produced in the current iteration by ants and are used to globally update the pheromo ne trails.</p><p>This ACS implementation combining a new pheromone management policy, a new state transition strategy and local search procedures was finally competitive with state-of-the-art algorithm for the solution of TSP/ATSP problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This opened a new frontier for ACO based algorithm. Following the same approach that combines a constructive phase driven by the pheromone and a local search phase that optimizes the computed solution, ACO algorithms were able to break several optimization records, including those for routing and scheduling problems that will be presented in the following paragraphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">ANTS</head><p>ANTS is an extension of the AS proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, which specifies some underdefined elements of the general algorithm, such as the attractiveness function to use or the initialization of the trail distribution. This turns out to be a variation of the general ACO framework that makes the resulting algorithm similar in structure to tree search algorithms. In fact, the essential trait which distinguishes ANTS from a tree search algorithm is the lack of a complete backtracking mechanism, which is substituted by a probabilistic (Non-deterministic) choice of the state to move into and by an incomplete (Approximate) exploration of the search tree: this is the rationale behind the name ANTS, which is an acronym of Approximated Nondeterministic Tree Search. In the following, we will outline two distinctive elements of the ANTS algorithm within the ACO framework, namely the attractiveness function and the trail updating mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attractiveness</head><p>The attractiveness of a move can be effectively estimated by means of lower bounds (upper bounds in the case of maximization problems) on the cost of the completion of a partial solution. In fact, if a state ι corresponds to a partial problem solution it is possible to compute a lower bound on the cost of a complete solution containing ι. Therefore, for each feasible move ι,ψ, it is possible to compute the lower bound on the cost of a complete solution containing ψ: the lower the bound the better the move. Since a large part of research in ACO is devoted to the identification of tight lower bounds for the different problems of interest, good lower bounds are usually available.</p><p>When the bound value becomes greater than the current upper bound, it is obvious that the considered move leads to a partial solution which cannot be completed into a solution better than the current best one. The move can therefore be discarded from further analysis. A further advantage of lower bounds is that in many cases the values of the decision variables, as appearing in the bound solution, can be used as an indication of whether each variable will appear in good solutions. This provides an effective way of initializing the trail values. For more details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trail update</head><p>A good trail updating mechanism avoids stagnation, the undesirable situation in which all ants repeatedly construct the same solutions making any further exploration in the search process impossible. Stagnation derives from an excessive trail level on the moves of one solution, and can be observed in advanced phases of the search process, if parameters are not well tuned to the problem.</p><p>The trail updating procedure evaluates each solution against the last k solutions globally constructed by ANTS. As soon as k solutions are available, their moving average z is computed; each new solution z curr is compared with z (and then used to compute the new moving average value). If z curr is lower than z , the trail level of the last solution's moves is increased, otherwise it is decreased. Formula (5.6) specifies how this is implemented:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">      - - - ⋅ = ∆ LB z LB z curr ij 1 0 τ τ (5.6)</formula><p>where z is the average of the last k solutions and LB is a lower bound on the optimal problem solution cost. The use of a dynamic scaling procedure permits discrimination of a small achievement in the latest stage of search, while avoiding focusing the search only around good achievement in the earliest stages.</p><p>One of the most difficult aspects to be considered in metaheuristic algorithms is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To obtain good results, an agent should prefer actions that it has tried in the past and found to be effective in producing desirable solutions (exploitation); but to discover them, it has to try actions not previously selected (exploration). Neither exploration nor exploitation can be pursued exclusively without failing in the task: for this reason, the ANTS algorithm integrates the stagnation avoidance procedure to facilitate exploration with the probability definition mechanism based on attractiveness and trails to determine the desirability of moves.</p><p>Based on the elements described, the ANTS algorithm is as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1.</head><p>Compute </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>If not(end_test) goto step 2.</p><p>It can be noted that the general structure of the ANTS algorithm is closely akin to that of a standard tree search procedure. At each stage we have in fact a partial solution which is expanded by branching on all possible offspring; a bound is then computed for each offspring, possibly fathoming dominated ones, and the current partial solution is selected from among those associated to the surviving offspring on the basis of lower bound considerations. By simply adding backtracking and eliminating the MonteCarlo choice of the node to move to, we revert to a standard branch and bound procedure. An ANTS code can therefore be easily turned into an exact procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Significant problems</head><p>In the following of this section we will present applications of ACO algorithms to some significant combinatorial optimization problems. This is to give the reader an idea of what is involved by the use of an ACO algorithm for a problem: even though the last subsection presents an overview of recent application the list is by no means exhaustive, as it becomes readily evident by searching the web under the keywords "ant colony optimization".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Sequential ordering problem</head><p>The first ACO applications were devoted to solve the symmetric and the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. Given a set of cities V = {v 1 , ... , v n }, a set of edges A = {(i,j) : i,j ∈V} and a cost d ij = d ji associated with edge (i,j) ∈ A, the TSP is the problem of finding a minimal length closed tour that visits each city once. In case d ij ? d ji for at least one edge (i,j) than the TSP becomes an Asymmetric TSP (ATSP). The first algorithm that applies an ACO based algorithm to a more general version of the ATSP problem is Hybrid Ant System for the Sequential Ordering Problem (HAS-SOP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>). HAS-SOP was intended to solve the sequential ordering problem with precedence constraints (SOP). The SOP in an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem first formulated by Escudero <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to design heuristics for a production planning system. The SOP mo dels real-world problems like production planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, single -vehicle routing problems with pick-up and delivery constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, and transportation problems in flexible manufacturing systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The SOP can be seen as a general case of both the ATSP and the pick-up and delivery problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. It differs from ATSP because the first and the last nodes are fixed, and in the additional set of precedence constraints on the order in which nodes must be visited. It differs from the pick-up and delivery problem because this is usually based on symmetric TSPs, and because the pick-up and delivery problem includes a set of constraints between nodes with a unique predecessor defined for each node, in contrast to the SOP where multiple precedences can be defined. HAS-SOP combines a constructive phase (ACS-SOP) based on the ACS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> with a new local search procedure called SOP-3-exchange. SOP-3exchange is based on a lexicographic search heuristic due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, on a new labeling procedure and on a new data structure called don't push stack inspired by the don't look bit <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> both introduced by the authors. SOP-3-exchange is the first local search able to handle multiple precedence constraints in constant time.</p><p>ACS-SOP implements the constructive phase of HAS-SOP but differs from ACS in the way the set of feasible nodes is computed and in the setting of one of the algorithm's parameters that is made dependent on the problem dimensions. ACS-SOP generates feasible solutions that does not violate the precedence constraints with a computational cost of order O(n 2 ) like the traditional ACS heuristic.</p><p>A set of experiments based on the TSPLIB data shows that HAS-SOP algorithm is more effective than other existing methods for the SOP. HAS-SOP was compared against the two previous most effective algorithms: a branch-and-cut algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that proposed a new class of valid inequalities and Maximum Partial Order/Arbitrary Insertion (MPO/AI), a genetic algorithm by Chen and Smith <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>To better understand the role of the constructive ACS-SOP phase and the role of the SOP-3-exchange local search MPO/AI was also coupled with the SOP-3exchange local search. Experimental results shows that MPO/AI alone is better than ACS-SOP due to the use of a simple local search embedded in its crossover operator. On the contrary, the combination between constructive phase and local search shows that HAS-SOP is better than both MPO/AI alone and MPO/AI + SOP-3-exchange. This is probably due to the fact that MPO/AI generates solutions that are already optimized and therefore the SOP-3-exchange procedure quickly gets stuck. On the contrary, ACS-SOP solution is a very effective starting point for the SOP-3-exchange local search therefore the HAS-SOP hybridization is very effective. Currently HAS-SOP is the best known method to solve the SOP and was able to improve 14 over 22 best known results in the TSPLIB data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Vehicle routing problems</head><p>A direct extension of the TSP, the first problem AS was applied to, are Vehicle routing problems (VRPs). These are problems where a set of vehicles stationed at a depot has to serve a set of customers before returning to the depot, and the objective is to minimize the number of vehicles used and the total distance traveled by the vehicles. Capacity constraints are imposed on vehicle trips, as well as possibly a number of other constraints deriving from real-world applications, such as time windows, backhauling, rear loading, vehicle objections, maximum tour length, etc. The basic VRP problem is the Capacitated VRP (CVRP): AS rank , the rank-based version of AS, was applied to this problem by Bullnheimer, Hartl and Strauss <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> with good results. These authors used various standard heuristics to improve the quality of VRP solutions and modified the construction of the tabu list considering constraints on the maximum total tour length of a vehicle and on its capacity.</p><p>Following these results, and the excellent ones obtained by ACS with TSP, SOP and QAP problems, ACS was applied to a VRP version more close to actual logistic practice, called VRPTW. VRPTW is defined as the problem of minimizing time and costs in case a fleet of vehicles has to distribute goods from a depot to a set of customers. The VRPTW minimizes a multiple, hierarchical objective function: the first objective is to minimize the number of tours (or vehicles) and the second objective is to minimize the total travel time. A solution with a lower number of tours is always preferred to a solution with a higher number of tours even if the travel time is higher. This hierarchical objectives VRPTW is very common in the literature and in case problem constraints are very tight (for exa mple when the total capacity of the minimum number of vehicles is very close to the total volume to deliver or when customers time windows are narrow), both objectives can be antagonistic: the minimum travel time solution can include a number of vehicles higher than the solution with minimum number of vehicles (see e.g. Kohl et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>).</p><p>To adapt ACS to a multiple objectives the Multiple Ant Colony System for the VRPTW (MACS-VRPTW <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>) has been defined. MACS-VRPTW is organized with a hierarchy of artificial ACS colonies designed to hierarchically optimize a multiple objective function: the first ACS colony (ACS-VEI) minimizes the number of vehicles while the second ACS colony (ACS-TIME) minimizes the traveled distances. Both colonies use independent pheromone trails but they collaborate by exchanging information through mutual pheromone updating. In the MACS-VRPTW algorithm both objective functions are optimized simultaneously: ACS-VEI tries to diminish the number of vehicles searching for a feasible solution with always one vehicle less than the previous feasible solution. ACS-VEI is therefore different from the traditional ACS applied to the TSP. In ACS-VEI the current best solution is the solution (usually unfeasible) with the highest number of visited customers, while in ACS the current best solution is the shortest one. On the contrary, ACS-TIME is a more traditional ACS colony: ACS-TIME, optimizes the travel time of the feasible solutions found by ACS-VEI. As in HAS-SOP, ACS-TIME is coupled with a local search procedure that improves the quality of the computed solutions. The local search uses data structure similar to the data structure implemented in HAS-SOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and is based on the exchange of two sub-chains of customers. One of this sub-chain may eventually be empty, implementing a more traditional customer insertion.</p><p>Experimentally has been shown that the performance of the system increases in case the best solution gb ψ calculated in ACS-TIME is used, in combination with the ACS-VEI best solution VEI ACSψ , to update the pheromone in ACS-VEI equation (5.7).</p></div>

MACS-VRPTW was also able to improve many results in the Solomon problem set both decreasing the number of vehicle or the travelled time.</p><p>MACS-VRPTW introduces a new methodology for optimising multiple objective functions. The basic idea is to coordinate the activity of different ant colonies, each of them optimizing a different objective. These colonies work by using independent pheromone trails but they collaborate by exchanging information. This is the first time a multi-objective function minimization problem is solved with a mu ltiple ant colony optimization algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Quadratic Assignment Problem</head><p>The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is the problem of assigning n facilities to n locations so that the assignment cost is minimized, where the cost is defined by a quadratic function. The QAP is considered one of the hardest CO problems, and can be solved to optimality only for small instances. Several ACO applications dealt with the QAP, starting using AS [MC94] and then by means of several of the more advanced versions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. The limited effectiveness of AS was in fact improved using a well-tuned local optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, but several other systems previously introduced were also adapted to the QAP. For example, two efficient techniques are the MMAS-QAP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> and HAS-QAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. For the testing of QAP solution algorithms, Taillard <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> proposed to categorize i nstances into four groups: (i) unstructured, uniform random (ii) unstructured, grid distance, (iii) real-world and (iv) real-world-like. Both MMAS-QAP and HAS-QAP have been applied to problem instances of type i and iii. The performances of these two heuristic approaches are strongly dependent on the type of problem. Comparisons with some of the best heuristics for the QAP have shown that HAS-QAP performs well as far as real-world, irregular and structured problems are concerned. On the other hand, on random, regular and unstructured problems the performance of this technique is less competitive. This problem-dependency was not shown by ANTS, which was also applied to QAP. In order to apply ANTS to QAP (or any other problem), it is necessary to specify the lower bound to use and what is a move in the problem context (step 2.2). The application described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> made the following choices.</p><p>As for the lower bound, since there is currently no lower bound for QAP, which is both tight and efficient to compute, the LBD bound was used, which can be computed in O(n) but which is unfortunately on the average quite far from the optimal solution.</p><p>As for the moves, it was declared that a move corresponds to the assignment of a facility to a location, thus adding a new component to the partial solution corresponding to the state from which the move originated. Some considerations on the move structure were used to improve the computational effectiveness of the resulting algorithm.</p><p>ANTS was tested on instances up to n=40 and showed to be effective on all instance types; moreover its direct transposition into an exact branch and bound was also effective when compared to other exact algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.4">Other problems</head><p>This section outlines some of the more recent applications of ACO approaches to problems other than those listed in the previous ones. This variety is well represented in the many diverse conference with tracks entirely dedicated to ACO and most notably in ANTS conference series, entirely dedicated to algorithms inspired by the observation of ants' behavior (ANTS'98, ANTS'2000 and ANTS'2002). Many different applications have been presented: from plan merging to routing problems, from driver scheduling to search space sharing, from set covering to nurse scheduling, from graph coloring to d ynamic multiple criteria balancing problems. A large part of the relevant literature can be accessed online from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, several introductory overviews have been published. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> for other overviews on ACO.</p><p>Among the problems not in the list above, a prominent role is played by the TSP. In fact, TSP has been and in many cases still is the first testbed for ACO variants, and more in general for most combinatorial optimization metaheuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. It was already on this problem that the limited effectiveness of the first variants emerged, and this fostered the design of improved approaches modifying some algorithm element and possibly hybridizing the framework with greedy local search or with other approaches, such as genetic algorithms or tabu seach <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. These variants were then applied to other problems, for exa mple MAX-MIN ant system was applied to the flow shop problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, a problem then faced also with other ACO modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, whereas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> a rank-based approach for the TSP is described or in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> a so-called best-worst variant.</p><p>More recently, different authors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>) have tackled the TSP with hybrid variants, mainly using tabu search, but also, in the case of large TSP instances, also with genetic evolution and nearest neighbor search, in order to improve both efficiency and efficacy. Moreover, variations of the basic TSP, such as the orienteering problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> or the probabilistic TSP where clients have to be visited with a certain probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have also been studied.</p><p>Scheduling problems provide another common area for testing the effectiveness of ACO algorithms. An ACO approach for the job-shop scheduling is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, whereas applications to real-world scheduling cases have been recently described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>More recently, the maturity of the field is showed by the fact that ACO approaches began to be proposed also for problems which are not standard combinatorial optimization testbed, but which are more directly connected to actual practice. For example, the problem of searching and clustering records of large databases is faced by means of ACO in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, while an algorithm for document clustering is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Even more theoretical problems linked to spatial data analysis were tackled with ACO techniques in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, a recent interesting research branch of ACO, not directly related to combinatorial optimization, is about telecommunication. In fact, the area of packet switching communications appear to be a promising field for ACO-related routing approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Whereas a standard optimization version of the frequency assignment problem was described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, an application to wavelength allocation was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, while techniques for path adaptive search are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> and an application to a satellite network in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Moreover, applications directly related to communication Quality of Service (QoS) have been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and more recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, while an application which optimizes communication systems with GPS techniques is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Convergence proofs</head><p>Recently, some works appeared which provide theoretical insight into the convergence properties of ant colony algorithms. All proofs refer to simplified versions of actually used systems, and do not provide direct guidelines for real-world usage, but they are of interest for the ascertainment of general properties of the systems used.</p><p>The first such proofs was proposed by Gutjahr <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, who worked on an ACO variant called Graph-Based Ant System (GBAS). The name derives from the analysis being carried on a so-called construction graph, which is a graph a ssigned to an instance of the optimization problem under consideration, encoding feasible solutions by "walks" on the graph. The objective function value of the walk is equal to the objective function value of the corresponding feasible solution of the original problem. It is always possible to design a construction graph for any given combinatorial optimization problem instance, with a number of nodes linear in the number of bits needed for the representation of a solution, and a number of arcs quadratic in this number of bits. Gutjahr proved that, under the conditions listed below, the solutions generated in each iteration of this Graph-based Ant System converge with a probability that can be made arbitrarily close to 1 to the optimal solution of the given problem instance. Essential conditions are: (i) there is only one optimal walk in W, i.e., the optimal solution is unique, and it is encoded by only one walk in W; (ii) along the optimal walk w*, the desirability values satisfy η kl .(u) &gt; 0 for all arcs ( k,l) of w* and the corresponding partial walks u of w*; (iii) a version of what is called elitist strategy is used, where only the best walks are rewarded: walks that are dominated by another already trav-ersed walk do not get pheromone increments anymore. Especially the first of these conditions is quite restrictive.</p><p>Stützle and Dorigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> propose another convergence proof. They consider both the MAX-MIN Ant System and the ACS outlined in Section 3, and they show that in this case it is possible to prove that allowing more and more iterations the cost of the best solution found converges with probability equal to 1 to the optimal cost. This a property already guaranteed by random search alone, and it does not get lost imposing a minimum trail value. Moreover, the authors show that it is possible to compute a lower bound for the probability of the current best solution to be optimal.</p><p>Finally, Gutjahr <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> in a recent paper builds upon these results context of ACO and shows that for a particular ACO algorithm, a time-dependent modification of GBAS, the current solutions converge to an optimal solution with probability exactly one. More specifically, he shows that by using suitable parameter schemes, it can be guaranteed that the optimal paths get attractors of the stochastic dynamic process realized by the algorithm. This improves all previous results and proves a property of the same strength of the tightest one so far obtained in the whole metaheuristic area, which was that obtained by Hajek <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> for Simulated Annealing.</p></div>
