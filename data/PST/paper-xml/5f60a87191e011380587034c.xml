<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Visual cognition of primates is superior to that of artificial neural networks in its ability to "envision" a visual object, even a newly-introduced one, in different attributes including pose, position, color, texture, etc. To aid neural networks to envision objects with different attributes, we propose a family of objective functions, expressed on groups of examples, as a novel learning framework that we term Group-Supervised Learning (GSL). GSL allows us to decompose inputs into a disentangled representation with swappable components, that can be recombined to synthesize new samples. For instance, images of red boats &amp; blue cars can be decomposed and recombined to synthesize novel images of red cars. We propose an implementation based on auto-encoder, termed group-supervised zeroshot synthesis network (GZS-Net) trained with our learning framework, that can produce a high-quality red car even if no such example is witnessed during training. We test our model and learning framework on existing benchmarks, in addition to a new dataset that we open-source. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that GZS-Net trained with GSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Primates perform well at generalization tasks. If presented with a single visual instance of an object, they often immediately can generalize and envision the object in different attributes, e.g., in different 3D pose <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Logothetis et al., 1995)</ref>. Primates can readily do so, as their previous knowledge allows them to be cognizant of attributes. Machines, by contrast, are most-commonly trained on sample features (e.g., pixels), not taking into consideration attributes that gave rise to those features.</p><p>To aid machine cognition of visual object attributes, a class of algorithms focuses on learning disentangled representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kingma &amp; Welling, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Higgins et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burgess et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kim &amp; Mnih, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2018)</ref>, which map visual samples onto a latent space that separates the information belonging to different attributes. These methods show disentanglement by interpolating between attribute values (e.g., interpolate pose, etc). However, these methods usually process one sample at a time, rather than contrasting or reasoning about a group of samples. We posit that semantic links across samples could lead to better learning.</p><p>We are motivated by the visual generalization of primates. We seek a method that can synthesize realistic images for arbitrary queries (e.g., a particular car, in a given pose, on a given background), which we refer to as controlled synthesis. We design a method that enforces semantic consistency of attributes, facilitating controlled synthesis by leveraging semantic links between samples. Our method maps samples onto a disentangled latent representation space that (i) consists of subspaces, each encoding one attribute (e.g., identity, pose, ...), and, (ii) is such that two visual samples that share an attribute value (e.g., both have identity "car") have identical latent values in the shared attribute subspace (identity), even if other attribute values (e.g., pose) differ. To achieve this, we propose a general learning framework: Group Supervised Learning (GSL, Sec. 3), which provides a learner (e.g., neural network) with groups of semantically-related training examples, represented as multigraph. Given a query of attributes, GSL proposes groups of training examples with attribute combinations that are useful for synthesizing a test example satisfying the query (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This endows the network with an envisioning capability. In addition to applications in graphics, controlled synthesis can also augment training sets for better generalization on machine learning tasks (Sec. 6.3). As an instantiation of GSL, we propose an encoder-decoder network for zero-shot synthesis: Group- Our contributions are: (i) We propose Group-Supervised Learning (GSL), explain how it casts its admissible datasets into a multigraph, and show how it can be used to express learning from semantically-related groups and to synthesize samples with controllable attributes; (ii) We show one instantiation of GSL: Group-supervised Zero-shot Synthesis Network (GZS-Net), trained on groups of examples and reconstruction objectives; (iii) We demonstrate that GZS-Net trained with GSL outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives for controllable image synthesis on existing datasets; (iv) We provide a new dataset, Fonts<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , with its generating code. It contains 1.56 million images and their attributes. Its simplicity allows rapid idea prototyping for learning disentangled representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>We review research areas, that share similarities with our work, to position our contribution.</p><p>Self-Supervised Learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gidaris et al. (2018)</ref>) admits a dataset containing features of training samples (e.g., upright images) and maps it onto an auxiliary task (e.g., rotated images): dataset examples are drawn and a random transformation (e.g., rotate 90 • ) is applied to each. The task could be to predict the transformation (e.g., =90 • ) from the transformed features (e.g., rotated image).</p><p>Our approach is similar, in that it also creates auxiliary tasks, however, the tasks we create involve semantically-related group of examples, rather than from one example at a time.</p><p>Disentangled Representation Learning are methods that infer latent factors given example visible features, under a generative assumption that each latent factor is responsible for generating one semantic attribute (e.g. color). Following Variational Autoencoders (VAEs, Kingma &amp; Welling, 2014), a class of models (including, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Higgins et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2018)</ref> achieve disentanglement implicitly, by incorporating into the objective, a distance measure e.g. KL-divergence, encouraging the latent factors to be statistically-independent. While these methods can disentangle the factors without knowing them beforehand, unfortunately, they are unable to generate novel combinations not witnessed during training (e.g., generating images of red car, without any in training). On the other hand, our method requires knowing the semantic relationships between samples (e.g., which objects are of same identity and/or color), but can then synthesize novel combinations (e.g., by stitching latent features of "any car" plus "any red object").</p><p>Conditional synthesis methods can synthesize a sample (e.g., image) and some use information external to the synthesized modalities, e.g., natural language sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhang et al. (2017)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hong et al. (2018)</ref> or class label <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mirza &amp; Osindero (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tran et al. (2017)</ref>. Ours differ, in that our "external information" takes the form of semantic relationships between samples. There are methods based on <ref type="bibr">GAN Goodfellow et al. (2014)</ref> that also utilize semantic relationships including Motion Re-targeting <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Yang et al., 2020)</ref>, which unfortunately requires domain-specific hand-engineering (detect and track human body parts). On the other hand, we design and apply our method on different tasks (including people faces, vehicles, fonts; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Further, we compare against two recent GAN methods starGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Choi et al., 2018)</ref> and ELEGANT <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Xiao et al., 2018)</ref>, as they are state-of-the-art GAN methods for amending visual attributes onto images. While they are powerful in carrying local image transformations (within a small patch, e.g., changing skin tone or hair texture). However, our method better maintains global information: when rotating the main object, the scene also rotates with it, in a semantically coherent manner. Importantly, our learning framework allows expressing simpler model network architectures, such as feed-forward auto-encoders, trained with only reconstruction objectives, as opposed to GANs, with potential difficulties such as lack of convergence guarantees.</p><p>Zero-shot learning also consumes side-information. For instance, models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lampert (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Atzmon &amp; Chechik (2018)</ref> learn from object attributes, like our method. However, (i) these models are supervised to accurately predict attributes, (ii) they train and infer one example at a time, and (iii) they are concerned with classifying unseen objects. We differ in that (i) no learning gradients (supervision signal) are derived from the attributes, as (ii) these attributes are used to group the examples (based on shared attribute values), and (iii) we are concerned with generation rather than classification: we want to synthesize an object in previously-unseen attribute combinations.</p><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Scarselli et al., 2009)</ref> are a class of models described on graph structured data. This is applicable to our method, as we propose to create a multigraph connecting training samples. In fact, our method can be described as a GNN, with message passing functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gilmer et al., 2017)</ref> that are aware of the latent space partitioning per attribute (explained in Sec. 4). Nonetheless, for self-containment, we introduce our method in the absence of the GNN framework.</p><p>3 GROUP-SUPERVISED LEARNING</p></div>

Each attribute value is a member of a countable set: a j ∈ A j . For instance, pertaining to visual scenes, A 1 can denote foreground-colors A 1 = {red, yellow, . . . }, A 2 could denote background colors, A 3 could correspond to foreground identity, A 4 to (quantized) orientation. Such datasets have appeared in literature, e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Borji et al. (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Matthey et al.

The first case trivially holds even for small S, e.g. COVER({i}, i) holds for all i. However, we are interested in non-trivial sets where |S| &gt; 1, as sets with |S| = 1 would cast our proposed network (Section 3) to a standard Auto-Encoder. The second case is crucial for zero-shot synthesis. Suppose the (image) features of node i (in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>   not given, we can search for S 1 , under the assumption that if COVER(S 1 , i) holds, then S 1 contains sufficient information to synthesize i's features as they are not given (i / ∈ S 1 ).</p><p>Until this point, we made no assumptions how the pairs (S, i) are extracted (mined) from the multigraph s.t. COVER(S, i) holds. In the sequel, we restrict ourselves with |S| = 2 and i ∈ S. We find that this particular specialization of GSL is easy to program, and we leave-out analyzing the impact of mining different kinds of cover sets for future work.</p></div>

To encourage disentanglement in the latent representation of attributes, we consider group S and example x s.t. COVER(S, x) holds, and for all x o ∈ S, x = x o , the pair (x o , x) share exactly one attribute value (|M (x o , x)| = 1). Encoding those pairs, swapping the latent representation of the attribute, and decoding should then be a no-op if the swap did not affect  other attributes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>). Specifically, we would like for a pair of examples, x (red border in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>) and x o (blue border) sharing only attribute j (e.g., identity)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , with z = E(x) and z o = E(x o ), be s.t.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">𝒙 𝐿 #!

This operates on all example pairs, regardless of whether they share an attribute or not. Given two examples and their corresponding latent vectors, if we swap latent information corresponding to any attribute, we should end up with a sensible decoding. However, we may not have ground-truth supervision samples for swapping all attributes of all pairs. For instance, when swapping the color attribute between pair orange truck and white airplane, we would like to learn from this pair, even without any orange airplanes in the dataset. To train from any pair, we are motivated to follow a recipe similar to <ref type="bibr">CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017)</ref>.

We propose this dataset to allow fast testing and idea iteration on zero-shot synthesis and disentangled representation learning. Samples from the dataset are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Details and source code are in the Appendix. We partition the 100-d latents equally among the 5 attributes. We use a train:test split of 75:25.</p><p>Baselines. We train four baselines:</p><p>• The first three are a standard Autoencoder, a β-VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Higgins et al., 2017)</ref>, and β-TCVAE (Chen et al., 2018). β-VAE and β-TCVAE show reasonable disentanglement on the dSprites dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Matthey et al., 2017</ref>). Yet, they do not make explicit the assignment between latent variables and attributes, which would have been useful for precisely controlling the attributes (e.g. color, orientation) of synthesized images. Therefore, for these methods, we designed a best-effort approach by exhaustively searching for the assignments. Once assignments are known, swapping attributes between images might become possible with these VAEs, and hopefully enabling for controllable-synthesis. We denote these three baselines with this Exhaustive Search, using suffix +ES. Details on Exhaustive Search are in the Appendix. • The fourth baseline, AE+DS, is an auto-encoder where its latent space is partitioned and each partition receives direct supervision from one attribute. Further details are in the Appendix.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>, our method outperforms baselines, with second-runner being AE+DS: With discriminative supervision, the model focus on the most discriminative information, e.g., can distinguish e.g. across size, identity, etc, but can hardly synthesize photo-realistic letters.</p></div>

We take the Test examples from Font, and split them 80:20 for train DR :test DR . For each attribute pair j, r ∈ [1..m] × [1..m], we train a classifier (3 layer MLP) from g j of train DR to the attribute values of r, then obtain the accuracy of each attribute by testing with g j of train DR .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>We propose a new learning framework, Group Supervised Learning (GSL), which admits datasets of example features and their attributes. It provides a learner groups of semantically-related samples, which we show is powerful for zero-shot synthesis. In particular, our Group-supervised Zero-Shot synthesis network (GZS-Net) is capable of training on groups of examples, and can learn disentangled representations by explicitly swapping latent features across training examples, along edges suggested by GSL. We show that, to synthesize samples given a query with custom attributes, it is sufficient to find one example per requested attribute and to combine them in the latent space. We hope that researchers find our learning framework useful and extend it for their applications.</p><p>You can download the dataset and its generating code from: http://anonymous/url/for/ blind/review , which we plan to keep up-to-date with contributions from ourselves and the community.   We report ELEGANT results showing best qualitative performance.</p><p>Overall, ELEGANT does not work well for holistic image manipulation (though works well for local image edits, per experiments by authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Xiao et al., 2018)</ref>).</p><p>B.4 STARGAN (CHOI ET AL., 2018)</p><p>We utilize the author's open-sourced code: https://github.com/yunjey/stargan. Unlike ELEGANT <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Xiao et al., 2018)</ref> and our method, starGAN only accepts one input image and an edit information: the edit information, is not extracted from another image -this is following their method and published code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C ZERO-SHOT SYNTHESIS PERFORMANCE ON DSPRITES DATASET</head><p>We qualitatively evaluate our method, Group-Supervised Zero-Shot Synthesis Network (GZS-Net), against three baseline methods, on zero-shot synthesis tasks on the dSprites dataset.</p><p>C.1 DSPRITES dSprites <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Matthey et al., 2017)</ref> is a dataset of 2D shapes procedurally generated from 6 ground truth independent latent factors. These factors are color, shape, scale, rotation, x-and y-positions of a sprite. All possible combinations of these latents are present exactly once, generating We train a 10-dimensional latent space and partition the it equally among the 5 attributes: 2 for shape, 2 for scale, 2 for orientation, 2 for position X, and 2 for position Y . We use a train:test split of 75:25.</p><p>We train 3 baselines: a standard Autoencoder, a β-VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Higgins et al., 2017)</ref>, and TC-VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. To recover the latent-to-attribute assignment for these baselines, we utilize the Exhaustive Search best-effort strategy, described in the main paper: the only difference is that we change the dimension of Z space from 100 to 10. Once assignments are known, we utilize these baseline VAEs by attribute swapping to do controlled synthesis. We denote these baselines using suffix +ES.</p><p>As is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, GZS-Net can precisely synthesize zero-shot images with new combinations of attributes, producing images similar to the groud truth. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Zero-shot synthesis performance of our method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A FONTS DATASET</head><p>Fonts is a computer-generated RGB image datasets. Each image, with 128 × 128 pixels, contains an alphabet letter rendered using 5 independent generating attributes: letter identity, size, font color, background color and font. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows some samples: in each row, we keep all attributes values the same but vary one attribute value. Attribute details are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The dataset contains all possible combinations of these attributes, totaling to 1560000 images. Generating attributes for all images are contained within the dataset. Our primary motive for creating the Fonts dataset, is that it allows fast testing and idea iteration, on disentangled representation learning and zero-shot synthesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B BASELINES B.1 EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH (ES) AFTER TRAINING AUTO-ENCODER BASED METHODS</head><p>After training the baselines: standard Autoencoder, a β-VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Higgins et al., 2017), and</ref><ref type="bibr">TC-VAE (Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. We want to search for the assignment between latent variables and attributes, as these VAEs do not make explicit the assignment. This knowing the assignment should hypothetically allow us to trade attributes between two images by swapping feature values belonging to the attribute we desire to swap.</p><p>To discover the assignment from latent dimension to attribute, we map all n training images through the encoder, giving a 100D vector per training sample ∈ R n×100 . We make an 80:20 split on the vectors, obtaining X trainES ∈ R 0.8n×100 and X testES ∈ R 0.2n×100 . Then, we randomly sample K different partitionings P of the 100D space evenly among the 5 attributes. For each partitioning p ∈ P , we create 5 classification tasks, one task per attribute, according to p:</p><p>X trainES [:, p j ] ∈ R 0.8n×20 , X testES [:, p j ] ∈ R 0.2n×20 5 j=1 . For each task j, we train a 3-layer MLP to map X trainES [:, p j ] to their known attribute values and measure its performance on X testES [:, p j ]. Finally, we commit to the partitioning p ∈ P with highest average performance on the 5 attribute tasks. This p represents our best effort to determine which latent feature dimensions correspond to which attributes. For zero-shot synthesis with baselines, we swap latent dimensions indicated by partitioning p. We denote three baselines with this Exhaustive Search, using suffix +ES (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2 DIRECT SUPERVISION (DS) ON AUTO-ENCODER LATENT SPACE</head><p>The last baseline (AE+DS) directly uses attribute labels to supervise the latent disentangled representation of the auto-encoder by adding auxiliary classification modules. Specifically, the encoder maps an image sample x (i) to a 100-d latent vector z (i) = E(x (i) ), equally divided into 5 partitions corresponding to 5 attributes:</p><p>5 ], which represent the attribute value (e.g. for font color attribute, the label represent different colors: red, green, blue,.etc). We use 5 auxiliary classification modules to predict the corresponding class label given each latent attribute partitions as input. We use Cross Entropy loss as the classification loss and the training goal is to minimize both the reconstruction loss and classification loss.</p><p>After training, we have assignment between latent variables and attributes, so we can achieve attribute swapping and controlled synthesis (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (AE+DS)). The inferior synthesis performance demonstrates that: The supervision (classification task) preserves discriminative information that is insufficient for photo-realistic generation. While our GZS-Net uses one attribute swap and cross swap which enforce disentangled information to be sufficient for photo-realistic synthesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.3 ELEGANT (XIAO ET AL., 2018)</head><p>We utilize the author's open-sourced code: https://github.com/Prinsphield/ELEGANT. For ELEGANT and starGAN (Section B.4), we want to synthesis a target image has same identity as id provider image, same background as background provider image, and same pose as pose provider image. To achieve this, we want to change the background and pose attribute of id image.</p><p>Although ELEGANT is strong in making image transformations that are local to relatively-small neighborhoods, however, it does not work well for our datasets, where image-wide transformations are required for meaningful synthesis. This can be confirmed by their model design: their final output is a pixel-wise addition of a residual map, plus the input image. Further, ELEGANT treats all attribute values as binary: they represent each attribute value in a different part of the latent space, whereas our method devotes part of the latent space to represents all values for an attribute. For investigation, we train dozens of ELEGANT models with different hyperparameters, detailed as:</p><p>• For iLab-20M, the pose and background contain a total of 117 attribute values (6 for pose, 111 for background). As such, we tried training it on all attribute values (dividing their latent space among 117 attribute values). We note that this training regime was too slow and the loss values do not seem to change much during training, even with various learning rate choices (listed below).</p></div>			</div>
