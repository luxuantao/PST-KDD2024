<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cross-Layer Modeling for Quality of Service Guarantees over Wireless Links Jia Tang, Student Member, IEEE, and Xi Zhang, Senior Member, IEEE Abstract-We propose a cross-layer approach to investigate the impact of physical-layer infrastructure on data-link-layer quality-of-service (QoS) performance over wireless links in mobile networks. At the physical layer, we take multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) diversity schemes as well as adaptivemodulation-and-coding (AMC) techniques into account. At the data-link layer, our focus is on how this physical-layer infrastructure influences the real-time multimedia delay-bound QoS performance. To achieve this goal, we first model the physical-layer service process as a finite-state Markov chain (FSMC). Based on this FSMC model, we then characterize the QoS performance at data-link-layer using the effective capacity approach, which turns out to be critically important for the statistical QoS guarantees over wireless links in mobile networks. We also investigate the impact of physical-layer power control and channel-state information (CSI) feedback delay on the QoS performance. The numerical results obtained demonstrate that our proposed cross-layer model can efficiently characterize the interactions between the physical-layer infrastructure and datalink-layer QoS performance.</p><p>Index Terms-Cross-layer design and optimization, mobile wireless networks, quality-of-service (QoS), effective capacity, adaptive-modulation-and-coding (AMC), multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO), real-time multimedia delay-bound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T O SUPPORT the diverse quality-of-service (QoS) re- quirements for heterogeneous mobile users, a large number of advanced schemes are developed at physical layer to overcome the impact of wireless fading channels. Among them, the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and adaptive-modulation-and-coding (AMC) scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> are promising techniques that have received significant research attention. While the main focus is how to utilize those techniques to improve the spectral efficiency, the problem of how to efficiently employ the unique nature of such techniques for enhancing upper-layer protocol design, and to determine what is the impact of these physical-layer techniques on supporting the diverse QoS requirements, have been neither well understood, nor thoroughly studied. Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to develop the cross-layer system model to integrate the QoS provisioning algorithms/protocols at higher network-protocol layers with MIMO and AMC implemented at physical layer. In this paper, our focus is on designing the cross-layer model that can characterize the interactions across physical-layer and datalink-layer, and on mapping the physical-layer parameters to the data-link-layer's real-time multimedia delay-bound QoS requirements.</p><p>There have been a variety of research works focusing on wireless system modeling in both physical-layer and datalink-layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Wu and Negi proposed a very interesting concept termed as "effective capacity". This concept turns out to be the dual problem of the so-called "effective bandwidth", which has been extensively studied in the early 90's with the emphasis on wired asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The effective capacity and effective bandwidth enable us to analyze the statistical delay-bound violation probability, which is critically important for real-time multimedia wireless networks. In this paper we propose a cross-layer approach to investigate the impact of physical-layer infrastructure on data-link-layer QoS performance in mobile wireless networks. At the physical layer, we integrate the MIMO transmit/receive-diversity with AMC and develop a unified finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) model that characterizes the channel state variation. At the data-link layer, our focus is on how the physicallayer infrastructure influences the real-time multimedia delaybound QoS provisioning performance. Based on our FSMC model developed at physical-layer, we characterize the QoS provisioning performance at data-link-layer by applying and extending the effective capacity method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We show how the effective capacity can function as a bridge that connects the physical-layer across to the data-link-layer. The numerical and simulation results obtained demonstrate that our approach can efficiently capture the interactions across different networkprotocol-layers and accurately characterizes the QoS provisioning performance. Based on our proposed cross-layer model, the advanced mechanisms such as adaptive resourceallocation, admission control, and packet scheduling schemes can be developed to guarantee the diverse QoS requirements for future wireless networks.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the physical-layer system model. Section III investigates the effective capacity and its relationship with the crosslayer design. Section IV-A presents the numerical results on effective capacity and statistical QoS guarantees. Section V discusses the impact of power-control and feedback-delay on the effective capacity. The paper concludes with Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE PHYSICAL-LAYER SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>The system model is shown in Fig.  antennas (Tx) at the basestation transmitter and N r antennas (Rx) at the mobile receiver. As shown by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the upperprotocol-layer packets are first divided into a number of frames at the data-link layer. The frames are stored at the transmitterbuffer and then split into bit-streams at the physical layer, where the AMC and MIMO-diversity are employed, respectively. The reverse operations are executed at the receiver side. Also, the channel-state information (CSI) is estimated at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter for AMC and MIMOdiversity (if necessary, depending on the specific MIMOdiversity scheme used). The upper-protocol-layer packets have the same packet-size, which consists of N p bits. Also, the frame at data-link layer has the same time-duration, which is denoted by T f . Due to the employment of AMC, the number of bits per frame varies depending on the modulationand-code modes selected. Therefore, each frame comprises various portions of the packet. Furthermore, at the data-link layer, the system integrates forward-error control (FEC) with automatic retransmission request (ARQ) strategies, which will be detailed in Section II-B. We assume that the wireless channel is flat-fading with Nakagami-m distribution, which is independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) between each transmit/receive antennapair. Also, the channel is invariant within a frame's timeduration T f , but varies from one frame to another. We use the Nakagami-m channel model because this model is very general and often best fits the land-mobile and indoor-mobile multipath propagations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We assume that the CSI is perfectly estimated at the receiver and reliably fed back to the transmitter. However, the CSI feedback can be delayed, which is particularly addressed in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. MIMO Diversity</head><p>We only focus on diversity-based MIMO systems. There exists a number of promising transmit/receive diversity schemes. For example, when the CSI is available at both sides of the wireless link, maximal-ratio transmission (MRT, also known as beamforming) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) are known as the optimal transmit-and receive-diversity schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, respectively. When the CSI is not available at the transmitter side, space-time block coding (STBC) is a pow- erful approach to achieve transmit diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Moreover, the selection combining (SC) at either the transmitter or receiver side emerges as a good tradeoff between performance and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. For a variety of MIMO-diversity schemes, we can show that the probability density function (pdf) of the combined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), denoted by p Γ (γ), can be derived as a unified expression as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p Γ (γ) = M Γ(mL) M-1 i=0 (-1) i M -1 i exp -(i + 1) βm γ γ • i(mL-1) j=0 ξ ji βm γ j+mL γ j+mL-1 (1)</formula><p>where Γ(•) represents the Gamma function, γ denotes the average SNR of the combined signal, m denotes the fading parameter, ξ ji is the multinomial expansion coefficients determined by ξ ji = b p=a ξ p (i-1) /[(j -p)!] with a = max 0, j -(M -1) , b = min j, (i -1)(M -1) , ξ j0 = ξ 0i = 1, ξ j1 = 1/(j!), and ξ 1i = i, and finally, the parameters M , L, and β are MIMO-diversity-scheme dependent, which are specified in TABLE I. Note that in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), M and L denote the selection diversity order and combining diversity order, respectively, and β only affects STBC scheme that reduces the variation of the channel. The total diversity order is determined by M × L (also equal to N t × N r ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Adaptive Modulation and Coding</head><p>The AMC technique has emerged as one of the key solutions to increase the spectral-efficiency of wireless networks.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the authors studied adaptive modulation integrated with convolutional-code-based FEC strategy. Following the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the specific modulation-and-coding modes for the AMC scheme used in this paper are constructed as follows.</p><p>The entire SNR range is partitioned by, e.g., K = 7 nonoverlapping consecutive intervals, resulting in K +1 boundary points denoted by {Γ k } K+1 k=1 , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Γ 1 &lt; Γ 2 &lt; • • • &lt; Γ K+1 with Γ 1 = 0 and Γ K+1 = ∞.</formula><p>Correspondingly, the AMC is selected to be in mode k if the SNR, denoted by γ, falls into the range: Γ k ≤ γ &lt; Γ k+1 , where k = 1, 2, ..., K. More specifically, the code rates of the available modes are 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5625, 0.75, and 0.75, respectively, and their corresponding constellations are "outage", BPSK, QPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM, respectively. As the SNR increases, the system selects the AMC mode with higher spectral-efficiency to transmit data. On the other hand, as the SNR gets worse, the system decreases the transmission rate to adapt to the degraded channel conditions. In the worst case, the transmitter can stop transmitting data, which corresponds to the "outage" mode of the system. The packet-error rate (PER) when using the kth AMC mode (k = 2, 3, ..., K), denoted by PER k (γ), can be approximated as follows [4, eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">PER k (γ) = 1, if 0 &lt; γ &lt; γ k a k exp(-g k γ), if γ ≥ γ k (2)</formula><p>where a k , g k , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">γ k are mode-dependent parameters [4, TABLE II]. Accordingly, the AMC is in mode k if the SNR γ falls into the range of Γ k ≤ γ &lt; Γ k+1 .</formula><p>Based on the pdf of the SNR in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), the probability π k , that the SNR falls into mode k is determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">π k = Γ k+1 Γ k p Γ (γ)dγ = ⎡ ⎣ γ mL, βm γ Γ k+1 Γ(mL) ⎤ ⎦ M - ⎡ ⎣ γ mL, βm γ Γ k Γ(mL) ⎤ ⎦ M (3)</formula><p>where k = 1, 2, ..., K and γ(•, •) denotes the incomplete Gamma function. We select the boundaries such that Γ k ≥ γ k for all k = 2, 3, ..., K. Then, using Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), we obtain the average PER of mode k, denoted by PER k , as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">PER k = 1 π k Γ k+1 Γ k a k exp(-g k γ)p Γ (γ)dγ = a k M π k Γ(mL) M-1 i=0 (-1) i M -1 i i(mL-1) j=0 ξ ji • βm b k j+mL γ j + mL, b k Γ k+1 γ -γ j + mL, b k Γ k γ (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where b k = g k γ + (i + 1)βm. Thus, the average PER can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">PER = K k=2 R k π k PER k K k=2 R k π k (5)</formula><p>where R k denotes the spectral-efficiency of the kth mode. We can numerically obtain the boundaries {Γ k } K k=2 such that the average PER satisfies the reliability QoS requirement. When taking the ARQ into account, the achieved spectral-efficiency of the kth mode, denoted by R k , can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R k = R k 1 -PER k . (6)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Service Process Modeling Using FSMC</head><p>In this paper, we employ the FSMC model to characterize the variations of the MIMO-diversity and AMC-based wireless-channel service process. The state of FSMC corresponds to the mode of AMC, where the effective transmission rate of the kth mode is R k . Let p i,j denote the transition probability of the FSMC from state i to state j. We assume a slow-fading channel model such that transition only happens between adjacent states <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Under such an assumption, we have p ij = 0 for all |i -j| &gt; 1. The adjacent transition probability can be approximated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p k,k+1 ≈ NΓ(Γ k+1 )T f π k , where k = 1, 2, ..., K -1, p k,k-1 ≈ NΓ(Γ k )T f π k , where k = 2, 3, ..., K<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where N Γ (γ) is the level-crossing rate (LCR) calculated at SNR value of γ <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Then, the remaining transition probability can be derived as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">⎧ ⎨ ⎩ p 1,1 = 1 -p 1,2 p K,K = 1 -p K,K-1 p k,k = 1 -p k,k-1 -p k,k+1 , k = 2, ..., K -1.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Thus, applying Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">8</ref>), we obtain the transition probability matrix of the FSMC, which is denoted by P = [p ij ] K×K . Correspondingly, the stationary distribution of the FSMC, denoted by π, is determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">π = [ π 1 , π 2 , ..., π K ],</formula><p>where π k is given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) for k = 1, 2, ..., K.</p><p>In order to obtain the transition probability matrix P, it is necessary to find the LCR N Γ (γ) in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. We obtain the unified closed-form expression for the LCR, N Γ (γ), which is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">N Γ (γ) = √ 2πf d M Γ(mL) M-1 i=0 (-1) i M -1 i • exp -(i + 1) βmγ γ i(mL-1) j=0 ξ ji βmγ γ j+mL-1 2<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where f d denotes the maximum Doppler frequency of the channel. Substituting Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">9</ref>) into Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">7</ref>), the transition matrix P is determined for different MIMO diversity schemes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Statistical QoS Guarantees</head><p>The real-time multimedia services such as video and audio require bounded delay, or equivalently, guaranteed service bandwidth. Once a received real-time packet violates its delaybound, it is considered as useless and will be discarded. However, over the mobile wireless networks, a hard delay-bound guarantee is not practically achieveable due to the impact of the time-varying fading channels. For example, over the Rayleigh or Rician fading channels, the only lower-bound of the system bandwidth that can be deterministically guaranteed is a bandwidth of zero. Therefore, we consider an alternative solution by providing the statistical QoS guarantees, where we guarantee the delay-bound with a small violation probability.</p><p>During the early 90's, the statistical QoS guarantees theories have been extensively studied in the contexts of so-called effective bandwidth theory, with the emphasis on wired ATM networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The asymptotic results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> showed that, for stationary arrival and service processes under sufficient conditions, the probability that the queue size Q exceeds a certain threshold B decays exponentially fast as the threshold B increases, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Pr{Q &gt; B} ≈ e -θB , for a large B (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>where θ is a certain positive constant called "QoS exponent" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For a small B, the following approximation is shown to be more accurate [9, eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">9</ref>)]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Pr{Q &gt; B} ≈ εe -θB (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where ε denotes the probability that the buffer is not empty, which can be approximated by the ratio of the average arrivalrate to the average service-rate [11, eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">9</ref>.184)]. Furthermore, when delay-bound is the main QoS metric of interest (i.e., when the focus is on delay-bound violation probability), an expression similar to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">11</ref>) can be obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Pr{Delay &gt; τ max } ≈ εe -θδτmax<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where τ max denotes the delay-bound, and δ is jointly determined by both arrival and service processes, which will be detailed below. From Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">12</ref>) we can see that the parameter θ plays an important role for the statistical QoS guarantees, which indicates the decaying-rate of the QoS violation probability. A smaller θ corresponds to a slower delaying-rate, which implies that the system can only provide a looser QoS requirement, while a larger θ leads to a faster delaying-rate, which means a more stringent QoS requirement can be guaranteed. Consequently, θ is called QoS exponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Effective Capacity and Cross-Layer Designs</head><p>Inspired by the effective bandwidth theory, Wu and Negi in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> developed the concept of effective capacity, which is a dual problem of the original effective bandwidth. The effective capacity function, denoted by E C (θ), characterizes the attainable service-rate as a function of the QoS exponent θ. Specifically, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> the effective capacity E C (θ) is defined as the constant arrival-rate that the channel can support in order to guarantee a QoS requirement specified by θ.</p><p>Although the original concept of effective capacity is proposed based on constant-arrival assumption, it actually can be generalized to investigate the QoS performance of any stationary arrival process. Under such a condition, the arrival process should be represented by its effective bandwidth while the service process should be characterized by its effective capacity, respectively. Note that for a constant arrival-process, the corresponding effective-bandwidth is equal to its constant arrival-rate. Thus, the problem discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> can be considered as the special case of our more general scenario addressed in this paper, where both arrival and service processes are time-varying. To help demonstrate the principles and identify the relationships between effective bandwidth and effective capacity, let us consider the case as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>For any given arrival process and service process, we depict their effective-bandwidth function, denoted by E B (θ), and effective-capacity function, denoted by E C (θ), in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, respectively. Let us define two limiting values as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">μ A lim θ→0 E B (θ) μ C lim θ→0 E C (θ).<label>(13)</label></formula><p>The effective bandwidth theory demonstrates that μ A is equal to the average arrival-rate of the traffic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Also, we will show in the next section that μ C is equal to the average service-rate of the service process. Therefore, using the approximation in [11, eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">9</ref>.184)], the buffer non-empty probability ε in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">12</ref>) can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">ε ≈ μ A μ C . (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>The effective-bandwidth function E B (θ) intersects with the effective-capacity function E C (θ) at the point where the QoSexponent is θ * and the rate is δ. In general, the delay-bound violation probability can be calculated in the following algorithm: Step 2: Approximate the buffer non-empty probability ε by using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">14</ref>).</p><p>Step 3: For any pre-determined delay-bound τ max and (δ, θ * ) obtained in Step 2, the delay-bound violation probability can be derived using Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">14</ref>) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Pr{Delay &gt; τ max } ≈ εe -θ * δτmax . (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> we can gain insights about how the statistical QoS performance changes according to the service and arrival processes. As shown by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, increasing the service-process bandwidth (as shown by the arrow at the lower position) results in higher effective capacity, which will lead to a larger QoS-exponent solution θ * . This implies that the higher bandwidth service-process can support a more stringent QoS for a given arrival process. On the other hand, increasing the arrival-process bandwidth (as shown by the arrow at the upper position) makes the effective bandwidth increase, which generates a smaller QoS-exponent solution θ * for a given service process. This implies that only a looser QoS can be guaranteed. When the bandwidth of the arrival process further increases such that μ A &gt; μ C , there is no solution for θ * &gt; 0 existing. Thus, the service process cannot support any QoS for the given arrival process, which is consistent with the queueing theory that if μ A &gt; μ C , both queue length and the queueing delay will approach to infinity. Inspired by the above analyses and observations, we propose to use the effective capacity as a bridge for the crosslayer modeling. The characterizations of the QoS performance guarantees are equivalent to investigating the dynamics of the effective capacity function, which turns out to be a simple and efficient cross-layer modeling approach. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the authors employed an experimental-based method to measure the effective capacity. In fact, it is feasible to formulate the effective capacity problem in a more systematic manner. In the next section, we analytically investigate the effective capacity function for our FSMC-based wireless-channel service process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EFFECTIVE CAPACITY FOR FSMC-BASED WIRELESS-CHANNEL SERVICE PROCESS</head><p>Analytically, the effective capacity can be formally defined as follows. Let the sequence {R[i], i = 1, 2, ...} denote a discrete-time stationary and ergodic stochastic service process and S[t] t i=1 R[i] be the partial sum of the service process. Assume that the Gärtner-Ellis limit of S[t], expressed as Λ C (θ) = lim t→∞ (1/t) log E e θS [t]  exists and is a convex function differentiable for all real θ <ref type="bibr">[12, pp. 921</ref>]. Then, the effective capacity of the service process, denoted by E C (θ), where θ &gt; 0, is defined as [9, eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Numerical Evaluations</head><p>We evaluate the effective capacity by numerical solutions under different physical-layer diversity schemes and parameters, where we set the total system spectral-bandwidth W = 100 KHz, the upper-layer packet-size N p = 1080 bits, and the data-link-layer frame time-duration T f = 2 ms. Unless explicitly stated on the legend of the figures, the other system parameters are set as follows: the fading parameter m = 1, indicating the Rayleigh fading channel, the average SNR γ = 10 dB, the Doppler frequency f d = 5 Hz, and the average packet-error rate PER = 10 -3 . To ease comparison with the spectral-efficiency, in the following discussions we plot the normalized effective capacity (which is defined as the effective capacity divided by the spectral-bandwidth W and the frame duration T f , and thus has the unit of "bits/sec/Hz").</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> plots the effective capacity against the QoS exponent θ under different spatial diversity schemes. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the physical-layer antenna infrastructures have significant impact on the effective capacity. The effective capacities of MIMO (i.e., Tx-2/Rx-2) or multiple-input-single-output (MISO, i.e., Tx-2/Rx-1) systems are significantly larger than those of the SISO systems. Also, different diversity schemes can achieve different effective capacities, depending on how much of the CSI information is utilized.</p><p>An interesting observation is that when the QoS exponent θ is small, the effective capacity of some MIMO systems (e.g., STBC/SC) is lower than that of the MISO systems (e.g., MRT/MRC), which is because STBC/SC does not efficiently  utilize the CSI while MRT/MRC fully utilizes the CSI. However, this situation changes as the QoS exponent θ increases. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, for a large θ, the effective capacities of all MIMO systems are larger than those of the MISO systems. This implies that even under the condition that the MIMO system has lower spectral-efficiency than the MISO system, it offers more significant advantages in supporting the stringent QoS requirement.</p><p>To further investigate the impact of antenna diversity on the effective capacity, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> plots the effective-capacity gain (defined as the ratio of the effective-capacity with antennadiversity-based systems to that with SISO-based systems) against the number of transmit antenna N t and the QoS exponent θ, where we employ MRT/MRC (Rx-1) to fully utilize the CSI. Notice from Proposition 2 that as the QoS-exponent θ approaches to 0, the effective-capacity converges to the average service-rate. Furthermore, the average spectral-efficiency is the average service-rate normalized by the spectral-bandwidth W . Therefore, the boldface line highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> is actually the average spectral-efficiency gain achieved by antenna diversity. We observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> that the effective-capacity gain with large θ is significantly higher than the average spectral-efficiency gain (indicated by the boldface line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> as θ → 0). Thus, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> implies that the superiority/gain of employing antenna diversity in terms of QoS-guarantees is even more significant than that in terms of the spectralefficiency.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>(a) plots the effective capacity of SISO system against the QoS exponent θ with different channel distributions. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>(a), we can observe that as the fading parameter m increases (the channel quality gets better), the effective capacity increases correspondingly, which is expected since the stabler channel can support a more stringent QoS. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>(b) plots the effective capacity against the QoS exponent θ when the SNR varies. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>(b), increasing the SNR of the wireless channel, or equivalently, increasing the transmission power, can improve the effective capacity. When the SNR γ = 20 dB, we can see from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5(b</ref>) that the effective capacity gets saturated at spectral-efficiency of 4.5 bits/sec/Hz, which is because 4.5 bits/sec/Hz is the highest spectral-efficiency that can be obtained by the underlying AMC scheme. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5(c</ref>) depicts the effective capacity versus the QoS exponent θ with different reliability-QoS requirements of PER's, where the more stringent reliability-QoS results in the lower effective capacity. In summary, from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> we can observe that the physical-layer variations have significant impact on the effective capacity, and thus on the QoS provisioning performance of wireless networks at higher-protocol-layers.</p><p>It is well known that there exists a diversity-multiplexing tradeoff over fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where high diversity is achieved at the expense of losing throughput/rate, and vice versa. Being consistent with the above fact, from Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> we also observe that there is a tradeoff between throughput (effective capacity) and QoS (θ), where the channel can support lower rate as QoS becomes more stringent. This observation can be considered as a cross-layer assessment for the impact of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff on QoS at the network layer in terms of queuing delay. From the information theoretic point-of-view, for the fast fading channel, we can adapt the rate and apply ergodic capacity, which essentially assumes an infinite buffer model. On the other hand, for slow fading channel, we cannot adapt the rate and need to apply the outage capacity, which assumes a zero buffer model. In fact, increasing the diversity makes the output process/rate more deterministic, which in turn requires less buffering, implying the more stringent QoS. This also agrees, from a different angle, with our observation that the channel can only support lower throughput when the delay constraint QoS is more stringent, which is shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. IMPACT OF POWER CONTROL AND FEEDBACK DELAY ON THE EFFECTIVE CAPACITY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Impact of Power Control on the Effective Capacity</head><p>In previous sections, we employ the AMC scheme which uses constant power. However, it is well known that the optimal power-control, i.e., water-filling-based scheme, can   achieve higher spectral-efficiency than the constant-power schemes. A natural question to ask is whether the water-fillingbased power-control is still optimal when we include QoSguarantees? We will show via our effective capacity analysis that this is not true. In [3, eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)], the authors provided the time-domain water-filling power-control strategy for un-coded adaptive QAM modulation. We integrate the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> with our adaptive-modulation-based FSMC and analytically derive the corresponding effective capacity, which is numerically plotted against θ as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. We employ un-coded adaptive modulation instead of coded scheme used in previous sections because the un-coded scheme is analytically convenient for water-filling-based power-control. We can see from Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> that the effective-capacity of the scheme with optimal powercontrol is larger than that of the constant-power scheme when the QoS-exponent θ is small, which is due to the fact that the water-filling scheme always has better average spectralefficiency than the constant-power scheme. However, as θ increases, the effective-capacity of the scheme with optimal power-control is lower than the constant-power scheme. This implies that the optimal power-control that maximizes the spectral-efficiency is not necessarily optimal for QoS guarantees. The reason behind this counter-intuitive observation is because the water-filling scheme increases the variation (instability) of the service-rate, which is undesired in terms of QoS-guarantees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Impact of Feedback Delay on the Effective Capacity</head><p>In previous sections, we assume that the CSI is reliably fed back to the transmitter without error and delay. However, in practical wireless networks, this assumption does not hold. In particular, the CSI feedback delay is un-avoidable in most of the situations.</p><p>Denote the feedback delay by τ . After the delay τ , the original SNR γ changes to a new value denoted by γ. Given γ, the pdf of γ can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">p Γ|Γ ( γ|γ) = 1 (1 -ρ) m γ γ ργ m-1 2 • exp - m(ργ + γ) (1 -ρ)γ I m-1 2m ργ γ (1 -ρ)γ (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>where I ν (•) denotes the modified Bessel function of the first kind with order ν and ρ represents the correlation coefficient between γ and γ, which is given by ρ = J 2 0 (2πf d τ ) [19] with J 0 (•) denoting the zero-th-order Bessel function of the first kind.</p><p>In order to guarantee the reliability QoS requirement, the system needs to maintain the same PER or bit-error-rate (BER) as the case without feedback delay. As a result, the boundary points for the AMC should be re-calculated. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the authors analyzed the impact of CSI feedback delay on BER performance for the adaptive modulation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we also investigated the feedback delay issue for SC/MRC scheme from BER perspective. Using the similar approach to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we derive analytical expressions for the effective capacity when considering CSI feedback delays, where the normalized effective capacity of the AMC-based SISO system is numerically plotted as a function of θ and f d τ in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. We can observe from Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> that as long as the normalized feedback delay, measured by f d τ , is within certain threshold (e.g., f d τ ≤ 10 -2 ), the effective capacity is virtually unchanged with f d τ . When the normalized feedback delay further increases, the effective capacity decreases accordingly. Note that in our system model, we have T f ×f d = 10 -2 . Thus, over the Rayleigh fading channel with Doppler frequency of f d = 5 Hz, our system can tolerant CSI feedbackdelay with approximately one frame's time-duration while still maintaining virtually the same statistical QoS performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We proposed the cross-layer design approach to study the interactions between physical-layer AMC and MIMOdiversity and higher-protocol-layer on the statistical QoS performance of the mobile wireless networks. We identified the critical relationships between effective bandwidth and effective capacity. Our numerical results showed that the AMC and MIMO-diversity employed at physical-layer have significant impact on the statistical QoS performance at upperprotocol-layers. The proposed cross-layer modeling accurately characterize the influence of physical-layer infrastructure on statistical QoS performance at higher-protocol layers.</p><p>While in this paper, we only investigate the single user QoS provisioning, our developed cross-layer modeling technique can be readily extended to the scenarios with multiple users sharing the wireless media in, e.g., dynamic TDMA-based wireless networks. More importantly, our developed crosslayer modeling technique also offers a practical and effective approach to develop highly-efficient admission-control, packet scheduling, and adaptive resource-allocation schemes to guarantee the QoS for real-time multimedia traffics over mobile wireless networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
