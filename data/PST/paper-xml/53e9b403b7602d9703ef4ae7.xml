We present a new perspective that emphasizes the importance of understanding where potential value lies and how best to relate it contextually to the measurement of the finn's realized value across multiple levels of analysis. We develop the idea that complementary assets (especially business process design and human capital) influence the finn's realization of value, using concepts such as locus of value and value conversion contingencies. Expanding beyond earlier process models of IT value, which begin with IT expenditure, our analysis of IT value emphasizes the consideration of potential value for an IT investment both in ex ante project selection, and ex post investment evaluation. We illustrate and validate the application of our framework using IT investments in a variety of business domains.</p><p>KEy WORDS AND PHRASES: business-process design, business value of infonnation technology, conversion contingencies, decision-support systems, IT value, potential value, realized value.</p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) VALUE HAS BEEN MEASURED AT VARIOUS LEVELS of analysis, including the economy, fInn, business process, and individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>]. Yet few authors would contend that the search for value has reached a point where pmctitioners and theoreticians are satisfIed with its outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In fact, understanding where potential value lies and how best to contextually measure the fInn's realized value that results from IT investment remain important concerns for managers and scholars alike.</p><p>Recent research suggests that investments in complementary assets (e.g., management skills, user troining, and application of standards) are critical to understanding the return on IT investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. In this research, we expand on this perspective using the concepts of locus of value <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and value conversion contingencies to explore how the potential value of an IT investment turns into a realized payoff for an organization. Going beyond earlier process models ofIT value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>) that begin with IT expenditure, our analysis of IT value emphasizes the considemtion of potential value for an IT investment both in ex-ante project selection and ex-post investment evaluation. (See fIgure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, whose elements we develop more fully throughout the paper.) In addition to considering IT expenditures and return on investment, we argue that it is diagnostic, both ex ante and ex post, to compare the potential value of an IT project and its realized value. Furthennore, analyzing the potential value of an IT investment, in addition to related expenditures, is useful both for researchers developing theories of IT value creation and for pmctitioners who must evaluate IT projects and strotegies.</p><p>We present a new theoretical framework for understanding the enablers of potential value and the extent to which such value is actually obtained by the fInn across mUltiple levels of analysis. We suggest that the critical level of analysis within an organization for understanding how the payoff from IT is realized may be quite different from the level at which the potential value was observed. This is an issue of locus of value, the point in a business process at which the value of an IT investment accrues for the organization, and it confounds efforts among researchers and pmctitioners alike to portmy accurately how IT investments payoff. Thus, thinking about IT investments in their appropriate business process context is an important point of departure for our perspective.</p><p>In the next section we develop our theoretical perspective and offer defmitions for tenns that fIgure importantly in our framework. We discuss the background of our core concepts, locus of value, and conversion contingencies, with reference to prior litemture. We also layout the theoretical framework for this work and identify core elements that enable its use to provide relevant insights for researchers and managers.

The IT Value Creation Process: From Potential to Realized Value and Return work. Our methodology in this section of the article involves the use of a simplified conceptual illustration, followed by additional analyses that are intended to map out more closely the issues that must be dealt with in real-world IT investment and IT valuation settings. We conclude the paper with a critical assessment of the extent of the contribution our work offers to the literature.</p><p>The key illustrations of the application of our theoretical framework are taken from fieldwork that we are conducting on IT investments and business process engineering approaches for decision support system (DSS) applications in contexts that involve revenue yield management. Our illustrative and confirmatory approach is appropriate in this kind of exploratory theoretical research for two reasons. First, multiple instances of a specific kind ofIT investment context enable us to assess with some confidence the validity of the new theoretical framework for understanding potential value and realized payoff from IT investments. This kind of preempirical assessment sets us up for stronger application of the ideas in interesting empirical settings later. Second, our approach offers an opportunity to identify specific business settings in which significant future research efforts that extend the current one--whether analytical, empirical, or experimental----are likely to provide useful normative guidance for managers who face repeated investments in IT. Although our in-principle checks for validity will focus on just a small part of the spectrum of IT investments, we nevertheless provide arguments that show why our theoretical framework is quite general. In fact, we believe that it is applicable in many IT investment settings: from infrastructure investments, to business-specific software applications, to multiuser systems and even highly customized single user systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concepts, DefInitions, and Theoretical Framework</head><p>WE NOW DEFINE THE KEY TERMS THAT WILL BE USED AND OUTLINE the bases for our theoretical framework on the potential and realized value of IT investments. Expanding on prior models ofIT value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>), our conceptualization begins with the potential value of an IT investment, similar to theoretical approaches in informa-Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 tion economics, rather than with the cost of the investment in an IT project (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). To appreciate the significance of the distinction between potential and realized value, we begin with a discussion of conversion contingencies, which act as intervening and moderating factors in the process by which potential is transformed, or fails to be transformed, into realized value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conversion Contingencies and IT Value</head><p>One of the difficulties that any investor faces in justifying an investment in IT is dealing with the spectrum of things that are likely to influence the value that can be appropriated by the fIrm once an application or infrastructure is built and implemented. These issues have been referred to as conversion-effectiveness problems within the fIrm in prior research <ref type="bibr">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr">31]</ref>. The primary emphasis was to understand those factors that are internal to the organization, especially the extent to which management is able to promote the effective implementation and utilization of the resulting systems, that act as contingencies for the appropriation of IT value. Influences of this sort that involve the actions and the demeanor of senior management in a fIrm are controllable to a large extent, compared with external influences. These include, for example, the actions of competitors, changes in technology in the marketplace, and the actions of government regulators. A senior management team that makes up its mind to promote or champion a specific IT project can galvanize support within the fIrm, setting the stage for success to be achieved on the technical and usability merits of the resulting application. In this sense, certain aspects of conversion effectiveness are managerially controllable, even though the control itself may be imperfect.</p><p>In this paper, we recognize moderators for IT value that are internal to the fum, as well as external to it. We refer to them as value-conversion contingencies following Lucas <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and recognize that they influence the accrual of IT value in different ways.</p><p>For example, within the fIrm senior management involvement will have a positive influence on the appropriation of value from an IT investment. Another beneficial contingency that often complements an IT investment is an appropriate level of training on the part of staff members who will use a newly installed software application. In these cases, the flow of value will depend to some extent on the presence of these beneficial moderators.</p><p>When we analyze influences that are external to the fIrm, the emphasis shifts somewhat. Externally, the primary influences that draw the attention of senior management tend to have a negative influence on the flow of value. These may include, for example, a competitor's adoption of a similar technological innovation, pressure on the pricing of IT-based services, or the emergence of a new technology that may substitute for the current generation solution. However, it is also possible that the presence of an external contingency will promote the flow of value associated with an IT investment, instead of inhibiting it.</p><p>A good example is the adoption of well-known software solutions. For example, Oracle and Microsoft corporate IS networking solutions have network externalities Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 associated with them, with the result that a firm can rely on the market for trained Oracle and Microsoft solutions professionals if it needs to hire additional staff to maintain newly implemented applications. Hiring experienced professionals early in the software development life cycle is likely to have beneficial effects for the success of a project. In contrast, utilizing XML (Extensible Markup Language), a less widely diffused metadata-modeling and semantics-capturing approach to formatting web pages and Internet-delivered documents, to develop a business-to-business interorganizational information system for electronic commerce limits the value that can be obtained. Relatively few skilled developers are available to build nextgeneration solutions with this emerging approach to developing websites, making it difficult for firms to reap the full potential value of XML's data-modeling capabilities.</p><p>The Relationship Among Potential Value, Conversion Contingencies, and Realized Value Many senior managers who invest in IT projects fail to appreciate the pervasive impacts of conversion contingencies within their organizations. A lot has to go "righf' for the potential value of an IT project to be achieved following implementation. The firm's ability to realize this potential ought to be of considerable interest.</p><p>Consider the following situation that is analogous to benchmarking IT investments. Imagine that you would like to know about the true qualities of the performance of a high-powered sports car that you own. Further imagine that you are sitting blindfolded as the car speeds down the highway (not recommended, by the way), and that you are simply being told how fast you are going, as well as the average speed of the other vehicles around you. Unfortunately, though this information is useful relative to the overall context, it tells you little about the qualities of the car itself. Like so many other sports car enthusiasts, you actually are interested in knowing its maximum performance. It already may be going fast, but what is the car's potential for going even faster? Is the full power of the engine available? Is the handling precise, allowing for greater, but manageable speed? Does the environmental context--the road itself-{)ffer the potential for going faster in a car with the characteristics of your sports car? Importantly, this better understanding of potential provides guidance about appropriate actions or interventions that can be taken with the car (e.g., tuning the car, choosing a road that better matches the characteristics of the car).</p><p>And so it is with IT investments. We argue that an appropriate assessment methodology is one that leads to an understanding of the potential value ofan IT investment. But the investment decision also must be based on a comparison of the potential value that management saw in the project with respect to the realized value following implementation, in light of the value conversion contingencies that intervene. <ref type="bibr">Fig</ref>  For the practitioner, the potential value of IT projects should be the first piece of information that is of interest-not their subsequent realized values. Assessing potential value and then sorting out what kinds of complementary investments need to be made to ensure that potential value can be obtained is crucial. Once a project's potential value has been established, then an estimate of its costs and expected return can be made, with care given to incorporating the effects of value conversion contingencies in the projection. (See Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for examples of value conversion contingencies across a range of levels of analysis.)</p><p>Extensions to the "Locus of Value" Concept Kauffman and Weill <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> introduced the concept of locus of value as that primary level of analysis at which flows ofIT value become discernible for the investing ftrm.  Business process (process design choices, system adoption subsidies, local management of change) Individual user (Individual differences, experience, risk-aversion, acceptance of change, professional level)</p></div>

However, the primary locus of value of electronic banking systems is often split across branch operations (which benefit from technological substitution for labor), transaction processing operations, and retail banking customers (who experience higher service quality and, through fees, are willing to pay for it). Depending upon where the primary locus of value occurs relative to the location of ''the system," value will be either easier or more difficult to measure. For example, in contrast to electronic banking systems, the locus of value of decision technologies is often more immediately measurable, since the value flows can be captured directly by examining the quality of the user's decision in the presence of the system. This observation prompts an extension of the concept of locus of value by distinguishing between how it relates to potential value and how it relates to realized Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016</p><p>value. The locus of potential value occurs where the opportunity to obtain returns from IT investments exists for an organization. This can occur at the level of the individual user, the work group, the business process, the fIrm, or the marketplace. In contrast, the locus of realized value is where value from an investment is actually appropriated by the fIrm. Importantly, the two loci (potential and realized) are not necessarily the same. For example, one might surmise that the locus of potential value for a World Wide Web-based electronic storefront for an existing department store is at the market level of analysis, where consumer purchases occur. At the consumer-market level, the potential exists to attract new business, to sell via this "fourth channel," and to generate new revenues from existing customers at a lower operating cost. However, the locus of realized value occurs at the business-process level, since it is at the business process level that the means by which a customer transacts with the store are operationalized. The operational effectiveness or fulfIllment capabilities of the Web-based solution will determine the quality of the customer's "shopping experience, " thus having an impact on both new and repeat sales.</p><p>As we hinted earlier with the electronic banking example, any given IT project may have more than one locus of potential value. For example, if the department store had been running a mail-order catalog, there may have been some switching of customers from mail-order to Web-based shopping. Although this business should be excluded from the assessment of market-level potential value, there is potential value at the individual and business-process level of analysis with respect to gains in orderprocessing efficiency. Since web orders arrive in electronic form, unlike mail orders, productivity and accuracy in fIlling orders will improve as customers switch from mail orders to Web-based orders.</p><p>Thus, one IT project may have multiple loci of value nested within different levels of analysis from the market down to individual users of the system. The existence of nested multiple loci of value requires a summation of the value potential across the different loci to assess the full potential of a project. Since an IT project's potential can arise at multiple levels of analysis, it is possible for conflicts to arise among levels of analysis. A project that has positive potential value at one level of analysis may have negative potential at another level of analysis, or even another instance of a given level of analysis. For example, a new supply-chain management application may offer potential value through lowering inventory levels and reducing costs for a production department, but may simultaneously have negative potential value through increased opportunity cost of sales. At a production locus, the project has potential value, at a sales locus it has negative potential, and at a fIrm level the two may effectively cancel out.</p><p>By explicitly encouraging a consideration of multiple loci of potential value across levels of analysis, our approach helps uncover these heterogeneous valuation perspectives. Furthermore, by summing potential value across multiple loci when there are no such conflicts among the different stakeholders and perspectives, our approach serves to highlight projects that have the greatest potential from the perspective of the organization as a whole, rather than a single department or other organizational unit. Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016</p><p>The concept of the locus of potential value is important for both practitioners and researchers. Moreover, identifYing both the locus of potential and where IT value gets realized is critical to how we, as researchers, understand the measurement of value contribution from IT investments in organizational settings. It is also important to decision-makers in the fum, who wish to improve their understanding of what managerial controls can be exercised to improve IT value outcomes. The challenge to the fum is to design technology-enhanced business-processes and to implement technology solutions effectively so that potential value can be realized. One might argue that the level of the individual user in a business-process context is the one that involves the fewest complications for the firm; however, we do not believe this is the case in general. In other research, we have learned that, despite the individual level of analysis, as many value conversion contingencies are due to the human qualities of individual users <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> as are due to sources associated with more aggregated levels of analysis. In addition to the ''usage barriers" associated with the individual, there are also barriers on the level of knowledge, resources, the organization, and the industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Taken together, these multilevel conversion contingencies act as barriers to the appropriation of potential value into realized value. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a methodology for analyzing the "limits to value" of IT investments. Such an approach will enable the firm to appropriate greater value from IT investments. But first we must show that the basic constructs that we have proposed are useful in this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying and Validating the Theoretical Framework</head><p>WE HAVE ARGUED THAT DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN POTENTIAL VALUE and realized value is critical for both obtaining accurate measures of a project's value and understanding how that value is realized. However, for this framework to be useful, we must demonstrate that the constructs of potential value and realized value are measurable. While prior IT value research has extensively studied the measurement of realized value or payoff, measurement of potential value is a new concept and it has not been examined previously. In this section, we discuss the application of this theoretical framework and demonstrate how the potential value of an IT investment can be measured. Furthermore, while potential value can arise at multiple levels of analysis, we demonstrate the importance of a business-process perspective when moving from simply identifYing potential to its specific measurement in context, and assessments of conversion contingencies and ultimately the realized payoff obtained by the firm.</p><p>Obtaining measures of the potential value of IT is perhaps most straightforward with DSS, as much of the value of such systems derives from the value of the information they provide for decision making under uncertainty. Thus, our illustrations draw primarily on IT-based decision systems, because they provide the greatest expositional clarity for our application of the concepts in our framework. However, the ideas we present are clearly applicable to a broad range of IT investments that offer potential value in forms other than the decision-making value of the information they provide (e.g., through productivity gains, price recovery impacts, product/service quality and relationship effects, and network externalities).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valuing an IT-Based Decision System</head><p>The field of information economics provides a rich literature on the decision-making value of a theoretical information system I and thus offers a formal approach that can be applied to measuring the potential value of an IT-based decision system. Following the information economics approach, we distinguish among three broad theoretical levels of quality of information that can be provided by a system: perfect information, imperfect information, and no information. Perfect information is a theoretical extreme, which completely specifies the payoff-relevant aspects of the future states of the world that will affect the decision-maker's choice from the available alternative actions. Perfect information provides a perfect predictor of the future state that will ensue <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. At the other extreme is no information, where decision-making is based entirely on prior expectations regarding future payoff-relevant uncertainties. Between these two extremes is imperfect information, which has the potential to be valuable because it can influence expectations regarding future payoff-relevant uncertainties.</p><p>While perfect information is an extreme, the expected value of perfect information for a given decision nonetheless provides an upper bound on the value of any ITbased system designed to support the decision. The expected value of perfect information is calculated as the expected value outcomes with perfect information less the expected value outcomes with no information. Thus, we can assess the potential value offered by an IT-based decision system by reference to the expected value of perfect information for the decision problem, and then discount appropriately to estimate the potential value offered by a system that provides less than perfect information. The appendix provides a detailed illustration of this approach for a simplified scenario.</p><p>While, in principle, the calculation of this upper bound on the value of an IT-based decision system is straightforward, it highlights one of the key determinants of potential value: what the organization already knows. The expected value of perfect information depends on prior expectations about payoff-relevant future events. Thus, in assessing potential value, in general, for various IT applications, it is important to consider the value outcomes that are expected without the IT investment as the baseline for determining potential value. Furthermore, assessing potential value requires an assessment of substitute assets (e.g., human intellectual capital, organizational routines, etc.) that may diminish the remaining potential value available across different organizations and contexts. (Complementary assets become important in the realization of the IT value payoff as well; these include appropriate levels of training, effective policies and procedures relative to system use, and so on.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifying Potential Value in Business Process Contexts</head><p>The potential value of an IT investment can arise at multiple levels of analysis ranging from the market level all the way down to the individual user in a business-Downloaded by <ref type="bibr">[</ref>  process context. One can discover potential value either through a technology push or through a business pull. When a technology push occurs, a technology solution is discovered that can address a previously undiscovered business problem or opportunity. In contrast, when a business pull occurs, a business problem or opportunity is the first thing to be identified, and only then is the impetus provided for the devel'Opment of a technology-based solution.</p><p>Potential value is the business payoff expected from an ideal technology solution. In reality, however, technology investments arise imperfectly from a mix of business pulls and technology pushes according to what Lucas <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Cohen, March, and Olsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> refer to as a "garbage can model." As the latter authors describe it, "an organization is a collection of choices looking for problems, issues and feelings looking for decision situations in which they might be aired, solutions looking for issues to which they might be the answer, and decision-makers looking for work" (p. 2).</p><p>While the technology push or business pull--driven potential value of an IT solution may exist at multiple levels of analysis----each of which must be measuredmeasuring potential value always requires a consideration of the business-process context in which the IT is to be deployed. For it is at the business process level that the underlying mechanics of an organization's production function becomes concrete, with a process that turns organizational resources and investments into business value. It is at the business-process level that the baseline value outcomes that are obtained without the IT investment can be assessed. Furthermore, it is through an understanding of bus iness processes that useful context-specific data and methods for measuring potential value may be identified and the accuracy of the data properly determined.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> depicts these ideas as it illustrates moving from discovering value potential to measuring involves working down from the market level to the individual user Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 in a business process context. Converting that potential into realized value requires careful IT planning to ensure that the implementation and associated business-process design efforts handle the conversion contingencies that can arise at multiple levels of analysis.</p><p>We now consider a more complex illustration of IT value-potential measurement that demonstrates these ideas: DSS for revenue yield management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential Value of Decision Support Systems in Revenue-Yield Management</head><p>Revenue yield management (RYM) involves forecasting demand and optimizing pricing and product availability to maximize revenue using market segmentation and multiple rate pricing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">29]</ref>. It is a strategic activity of substantial economic significance to firms in a variety of industries including airlines, hotels, car rental companies, and television networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Further, RYM typically involves sizable investments in information technology both for capturing large volumes of transaction data and for facilitating decision support with that data. For example, USAir Inc. (now US Airways) won a 1994 Computerworld Smithsonian Innovation Network Award for its successful investment in its Excalibur Revenue Management System, which processed over 12,000,000 items of information each night to set the next day's reservations availability and pricing policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. More recently, a new revenue yield management system at National Car Rental of Edina, Minnesota, generated $56 million in incremental revenue in the frrst year of its nationwide deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>The objective of RYM is to maximize sales at the highest possible prices. But, given the perishable nature of the products to which RYM applies (e.g., airline seats, hotel rooms, freight ladings, etc.), it is often desirable to sell some in the low-rate market segments rather than not make any sales at all. Thus, in times of oversupply, a firm practicing RYM increases its low-rate sales. In times of high demand, however, a firm may be better off if it turns away low-rate customers. The expectation is that a sufficient number of high-rate customers will turn up before the product perishes and the revenue opportunity is lost. In other instances, it may be economically rational to overbook in anticipation of cancellations to maximize the revenue opportunity realized, even though some customers may not be served as a result <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>.</p><p>RYM DSS aid in both forecasting demand and optimizing pricing. Their potential value is limited by the total demand in the market from which a firm can ''yield away" consumer surplus through optimized market segmentation and pricing. Of course, in practice not all the consumer surplus is available because complete market segmentation is not possible and the multiple-rate pricing scheme must be readily understood by consumers. (Overly complicated pricing schemes are a proven "turnoff' because they confuse consumers.) Nonetheless, the market demand curve is a critical boundary. (The other critical boundary is the amount of product available for sale, e.g., the capacity of the hotel, the number of airline seats, the size of the rental car fleet at a given automobile size, etc.)</p><p>In one hotel chain with which we are familiar, revenue manager performance was evaluated on the basis of realized revenue opportunity. Revenue opportunity is de-Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 fmed as the difference between revenue outcomes that could have been obtained using an (ex-post-determined) optimal pricing scheme for the actual market demand less the revenue outcomes obtained using fIrst-come, fIrst-served reservation acceptance and pricing. This is akin to the difference between the perfect-information scenario and the no-information scenario discussed earlier. Thus, at least in this hotel chain, existing operating procedures already facilitated the calculation of an upper bound on the value potential offered by IT-based RYM efforts.2</p><p>As with any IT project, measuring the potential value of an IT-based RYM system requires a consideration of existing organizational knowledge and performance (i.e., of the value that would be obtained given prior expectations and no IT solution). For example, suppose that a hotel's revenue manager can obtain, on average, 40 percent of the revenue opportunity, based on her expertise and managerial acumen in interpreting demand and setting prices. This 40 percent performance becomes the baseline for assessing the value offered by RYM DSS. A system that yields only 35 percent of the revenue opportunity would be valueless to such a manager for the hotel. In contrast, for a manager achieving only 20 percent of the revenue opportunity, the very same system could offer substantial value potential. Thus, we see that value potential is clearly context-specifIc. This issue can be problematic for a hotel chain trying to estimate the potential value of an RYM DSS, given a range of levels of performance of revenue managers in different hotel properties. Revenue manager skill (within a set of enabling business processes) and the RYM DSS are partial substitutes for one another in this context. Thus, one might argue that the potential value of an RYM DSS might need to be framed on a hotel-by-hotel basis, especially given that many hotels operate as franchises of brand-name chains and have heterogeneous operating and management policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principles Demonstrated</head><p>Clearly, then, at least in the area of hotel revenue management systems (and certainly in other RYM settings, such as airline and rental car operations), it is feasible in principle to estimate the potential value available from such systems. Indeed, one vendor ofRYM DSS begins by analyzing the value of its DSS solution with respect to the potential it offers each hotel in a chain. This vendor, Integrated Decisions and Systems Inc., of Eagan, Minnesota, goes so far as to guarantee in product literature on its Web site that its IT-based RYM solution will "increase [hotel property] revenues by at least 4 percent for all room inventory." (See the ftrm's Web site at www.idealyield. com for additional details and illustrations.)</p><p>Our own illustrations demonstrate two other key principles. First, it is important to consider performance without the IT investment at the level of the individual decision-maker in a business-process context (e.g., the revenue opportunity realized by the revenue manager without an IT aid). Second, by observing existing business processes in place, it becomes possible to identify context-specifIc data and methods for measuring the potential ofIT investments (i.e., in the case ofRYM, the estimation of market demand and calculation of revenue opportunity).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conversion Contingencies and Realized Value</head><p>An understanding of value at the level of the business process becomes even more critical as we move from measuring potential value to measuring realized value and attempt to consider the role of intervening conversion contingencies. Consider again the case ofRYM. While the potential value of an IT-based RYM exists primarily on a market level of analysis (i.e., it is bounded by market demand), the realization of the payoff from this potential is affected by factors down to the level of the individual user in a specific business-process context. Hotel property managers---not systems-are typically the fmal arbiters ofRYM DSS value, and they often override the recommendations ofthese systems. This opens up the possibility oflimits to the amount of potential value of the system that can be realized by the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This limits-to-value perspective is evident with a user who is unable (say, because of his own cognitive limits) or unwilling (say, due to organizational norms or incentives) to recognize the value of the recommendations from a system. This person will be unable to realize the full payoff from the system. For example, during our ongoing program of research in RYM systems in the hotel industry, we encountered a property manager who actually resisted using a state-of-the-art RYM system, despite the fact that there was clear evidence that the system had the potential to outperform her. In this case, some portion of the system's potential went unrealized because effective use, by her assessment, required too much of her time---time she believed could be employed more effectively in reducing her property's operational costs. Although from an IT value perspective this is problematic, the property manager's behavior was rational, given the reward structure under which she was working: she was rewarded for increasing profits, not just revenues. Unfortunately, it appeared that, although the hotel chain had invested in a state-of-the-art RYM DSS, it had ignored the incentives and rewards of the key users, a critical conversion contingency.</p><p>To illustrate that these principles apply beyond the case ofRYM DSS to IT investments, the reader should consider a final illustration. Collaborative technologies, such as Lotus Notes and other groupware solutions, have become widely adopted by management consulting firms. They offer potential value to firms through increased sharing of knowledge, improving both the quality of the work performed for clients (and consequently revenues gained) and the efficiency with which the work is completed (and consequently reducing costs). Yet realizing this potential is dependent on the firm's investment in human intellectual capital. It is required to create the knowledge in the first place and to provide the appropriate organizational incentives and culture for promoting the sharing of the knowledge. (For example, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for a case study of a Lotus Notes implementation that encountered some difficulties with encouraging knowledge sharing.)</p><p>In terms of measuring realized value, measurement below the business process level is inappropriate because value is realized in a business-process context. Measurement above the business process level is inappropriate because it becomes more difficult to isolate the critical user-level contingencies. Thus, it is at the business process level that the critical conversion contingencies often materialize, such as Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 with the hotel revenue management system discussed earlier. At the firm level, rewarding hotel managers based on profit makes good sense, but at the business-process level we have seen that it can have adverse impacts on the realization ofIT value. Furthermore, from a managerial perspective the business-process level is also the most appropriate level of analysis as it is the level at which managerial controls can become operational in ensuring value realization. It is also at this level that system and process design innovations can be put in place to overcome the limits to value realization imposed by users <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Consequently, we argue, it is at the businessprocess level that we can both measure and explain realized value relative to potential value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The foregoing discussion and illustrations have demonstrated how the potential value of an IT project can be measured using methods inspired by information economics, together with subjective expectations and existing business process level performance data (e.g., for estimating demand and revenue opportunity in the RYM illustration). Both the rock-concert example that we present in the appendix and the RYM illustrations revealed the importance of establishing a baseline of value outcomes without IT. By specifically considering potential IT value, we have demonstrated how to measure the potential value available in an IT solution to a business problem, over and above the value already being realized by substitute assets owned by a firm (e.g., the human intellectual capital apparent in revenue managers' unaided performance). Indeed, our approach serves to remind IT investors of the need to consider substitutes and illuminates how information about substitute assets needs to be incorporated into the IT investment evaluation process.</p><p>By distinguishing between potential value and the payoff realized, our framework highlights the critical role of conversion contingencies in limiting and enabling the realization of potential--and demonstrates the power of analysis on the business process level. Moreover, our illustrations that apply our framework reveal the two different ways in which complementary assets can come into play: through the creation of potential value and in influencing conversion processes to maximize the potential realized. Specifically, we saw complementary assets enabling value potential in the RYM illustration through the availability of transaction data from which demand can be estimated and consumer behavior can be illustrated. Similarly, in the example of Lotus Notes groupware, we saw the investment by management consulting firms in human intellectual capital. This investment created the individual knowledge that the collaborative technologies could facilitate sharing and leverage into organizational knowledge. Further, with respect to the realization of IT value payoff, we saw the importance of investing complementary assets to ensure conversion of the potential into payoff. In the RYM situation this involved investing in user training, business process design and organizational reward systems that ensure the individual revenue manager was equipped and motivated to recognize the value of following system recommendations (when appropriate). In the groupware illustration, we also saw Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ex-ante IT investment decision-making questions:</head><p>What is the potential value of the IT project (across multiple levels of analysis) and how does it compare with the potential offered by other projects? What substitute assets already exist in the firm that would reduce the potential value available to the IT project (or alternative that may be more prudent to invest in than an IT-based solution)? What complementary assets exist in the firm, or could be invested in that could enhance the potential value of the IT project? What conversion contingencies may arise that could limit realization of potential value of the project?

Was there an error in the ex ante assessment of potential value? Or, did we fail to consider critical value conversion contingencies in making our investment decision? Did we make a mistake in the execution of the project? Did we neglect controllable value conversion contingencies? Did we fail to invest in critical complementary assets? Could we have done better? Was there unrealized potential? If so, can we do better in the future?

In summary, our framework and approach provides not only guidance about how and where to measure value potential and value payoff but also a way of thinking about IT investments and the associated conversion contingencies that can limit the realization of an IT investments potential. More specifically, our framework makes it possible to address the kinds of questions in relation to IT investments, depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p><p>These questions are of interest to both practitioners selecting and managing IT projects and researchers trying to develop theories of IT value creation. In the next section we further discuss the generality and limitations of our approach and the directions for future research it suggests. Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 Conclusion THIS RESEARCH OFFERS SEVERAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CURRENT UNDERSTANDING of the business value ofIT. First, we expanded concepts in prior research oflocus of value and conversion effectiveness relative to IT value on a range of levels of analysis. In contrast to prior research, our analysis began with potential value rather than with IT expenditures or investment. We presented arguments about how the proposed perspective allows for a richer set of managerial and research questions to be addressed. Second, as a basis for claiming that this contributes to knowledge in this area, we illustrated how measuring potential value potential is feasible and useful both in a simple example and in rich real-world settings such as decision technologies for hotel revenue yield management. Third, our analysis also illustrated how an analyst might go about mapping out the impacts of IT applications from their locus of potential value to the fIrm's locus of realized value. In so doing we demonstrated how the potential and payoff of an IT application can arise at distinctly different levels of analysis.</p><p>Our focus on potential value and our arguments in favor of a business-process level of analysis for assessing realized value emphasize the key role of value conversion contingencies (including complementary assets) in understanding how and why realized value often differs in practice from potential value. Furthermore, our approach both more clearly defmes the potential offered by IT investments and highlights the role of managerial controls that can be put in place to ensure that the potential is realized.</p><p>Our perspective also recognizes the larger strategic issues of substitutable assets and complementary assets that must be considered when examining IT investments. Assessing the potential value that IT projects can deliver requires a baseline measurement of the value accruing to existing substitute solutions. This way of thinking about valuation is inspired by information economics theory, where the idea is to assess the value of information by reference to performance with the information provided by the system versus performance without the aid of the system. This perspective also prompts us to assess whether it makes sense to invest in other assets that can substitute for an IT solution---and possibly do a better job at a lower cost. We saw this problem arise in prior research by Banker, Kauffman, and Morey <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> on order processing and workflow coordination systems in the fast food industry. In this instance, a quasi-experimental empirical research design showed that the value of technology deployed in a regional chain of locations had less value the larger the operational scale size of the restaurant. Why? Because the presence of a substitutable asset, a workflow coordinator, at the larger restaurants provided workflow coordination, a role that was intended for the system. In the presence of the workflow coordinator, the impact of the system----and hence its value-was diminished. Our illustrations from revenue yield management decision support systems demonstrated how human intellectual capital (e.g., the skill of an experienced revenue manager) can be a substitute for an IT system. With different observed levels of experience and competency at revenue yield management tasks among the revenue managers of a hotel chain, one would expect to see heterogeneous levels of system value, driven by the substi-Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 tutable human intellectual capital. Our illustrations point out how a baseline measure highlights the importance of using systems in place of people specifically for those tasks that people do not do well.</p><p>Other IT investments may enable organizations to obtain value by leveraging co~plementary assets that are held by a firm, such as buy-in to some technology standard, human intellectual capital, or knowledge of trade partners' business procedures. However, as our discussion has illustrated, IT value conversion contingencies can arise that limit the firm's ability to leverage complementary assets in the manner expected (as in the example of Lotus Notes). This often leaves potential value unrealized. Strategically, our results point out that frrms also need to make investments in key complementarities (e.g., business-process design, user training) to actively •'manage" conversion contingencies that otherwise might limit the realization of the full potential of an IT application. In particular, our illustrations from revenue yield management and groupware exemplified how potential value could be lost in conversion processes when appropriate complementary assets were not present (e.g., organizational reward and incentive systems).</p><p>Although our research highlights the importance of investing in complementarities to IT investment such as business-process design, further research is required to understand the optimal trade-off between investing in IT directly and investing in its complements. For example, we expect to fmd diminishing marginal returns to investing in IT without a concomitant investment in complementarities. (Similarly, one cannot expect optimal returns from simply investing in the complementarities; balanced investment must be the goal.) Future research also needs to examine the processes managers actually employ in making IT investment decisions, so that we can encourage behavior that is closer to the optimal balance between IT investment and complementarities to IT. This will lead to improved normative assessments of potential value and realized value.</p><p>While we believe that this general approach is likely to be a useful way of thinking about IT investments, it is also necessary to empirically examine the differences in IT investment strategies that the approach may engender compared with existing approaches. For example, managers often underestimate the expected return from an IT project, in part because their assessments are anchored so heavily on cost issues and in part because they fail to recognize the option value inherent in most IT projects. In contrast, our approach focuses on the assessment of potential value, an idealized extreme, and hence expected returns are likely to be overestimated, if anything. More specifically, having begun with an assessment of potential value, decision-makers must discount for potential already obtained with substitutes (what we earlier referred to as •&lt;the baseline'') and then further discount for the conversion contingencies that may diminish realized value. Interestingly, the underestimation of value associated with existing approaches and the possible overestimation of value associated with our approach are consistent with the well-established psychological fmding that people typically overemphasize anchors and underadjust in making judgments.</p><p>From a managerial perspective, our research argues that the analysis of future IT projects and the evaluation of past projects must begin with consideration of the Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 potential value ofIT. Once it has assessed potential value, management must account for the effects of both controllable and uncontrollable conversion contingencies. Only then can they hope to make a realistic assessment of the value the fInn can expect from an IT investment, explain the payoffs it obtains, and learn how to improve the realized value of IT projects in the future.</p></div>

Of course, estimating market demand ex post is not as simple as referring to the hotel rooms sold. This ignores sales that could have been made because the customer was not willing to pay the price offered (i.e., the lower portion of the demand curve), or because all the rooms were sold out. However, a variety of approaches exist, and the estimate of market demand is a routine business practice for hotels. For example, hotels routinely track denials or "tum-downs": customers who wish to make a reservation but were unable to do so because of lack of availability or unsatisfactory price. The business processes of reservation-taking typically require a reservation agent to "close out" a customer call recording why, if appropriate, no reservation was made (e.g., availability, price, or just an informational call requesting directions to the hotel, etc.). By tracking these denials, it is possible to estimate market demand on an ex-post basis. Alternatively, some hotels estimate demand for a given reservation night by extrapolating from similar reservation nights (e.g., same night of the week, similar season, and so on) in which price controls or capacity constraints did not lead to any customers being turned away. This "by analogy" approach apparently provides workable comparison estimates for practitioners. 29. Weatherford, L.R., and Bodily, S.E.

Operations Research. <ref type="bibr">40</ref> Appendix: An Illustration of Potential Value Assessment IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE A MUSIC IMPRESARIO PLANNING A LARGE one-night rock concert in an urban setting. You have two stadium choices: a 20,000-seat, covered stadium that costs $20,000 to rent, and a 25,000-seat, open-air stadium that costs $15,000 to rent. You sell your tickets for $10 each, and you know from past experience that you can sell at least 25,000 tickets without too much difficulty. The band and support crew cost $50,000. Since the band has alternative engagements it can play, you must pay the band and support crew their $50,000, even if rain causes a cancellation of an open-air stadium concert. However, you would not have to pay the stadium rental. Based on past experience, you anticipate a 67 percent (two-thirds) chance of rain for any given date around the time you plan to hold the concert.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision-Making Process</head><p>Clearly, the open-air stadium has the greater potential for making you money, but going that route also exposes you, the concert promoter, to greater risk. The standard approach suggests that this problem should be conceptualized in the following manner:</p><p>• The Decision Problem. Which stadium do you choose?</p><p>• The Solution. Choose the stadium that yields the highest expected value.</p><p>• Problem Representation. The problem can be represented as a probabilistic decision tree with expected value outcomes. (See figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.)</p><p>Given prior expectations of rain, the rational profit-maximizing decision in this scenario is to choose the covered stadium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing the Potential Value of Decision Support Information</head><p>How valuable would information about the likelihood of rain be? Suppose you had an information system that provided perfect information, that is, a perfect prediction about rain versus no rain on the concert night. With perfect information you could then make the appropriate profit-maximizing stadium choice. Thus, you would make $130,000 when the system predicts rain (covered stadium), and $185,000 (open-air stadium) when the system predicts that it is not going to rain. Over a series of decisions, the actual value you would obtain remains dependent on the frequency with which rain occurs, but with perfect information you would have an accurate prediction of when it would rain. Assuming, for simplicity, that your prior expectations were correct, then you would expect the system with perfect information to predict rain 67 percent of the time, and Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016 purchased for $16,500 = $18,15011.1, or less. Of course, in practice, systems do not provide perfect information, and hence one ought to further discount these amounts to make the example realistic. However, the reader should be clear about one thing: We have established an upper bound on value---the potential value of the forecasting system. Furthermore, the potential value increases as we begin to consider recurring decisions in which the $18,150 expected payoff can be realized multiple times.</p><p>Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 22:09 16 March 2016</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
