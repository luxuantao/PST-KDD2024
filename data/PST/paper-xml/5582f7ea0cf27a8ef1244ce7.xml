<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shape-Based Interpolation of Tree-Like Structures in Three-Dimensional Images</head><p>W. E. Higgins, Senior Member, ZEEE, C. Morice, and E. L. Ritman, Member, ZEEE Abstract-  images obtainable from many medical-imaging scanners typically have lower resolution in the z direction than in the x or y directions. Before extracting and displaying objects in such images, an interpolated 3-D grayscale image is usually generated via a technique such as linear interpolation to fill in the "missing slices." Unfortunately, linear interpolation and related schemes produce a 3-D image having blurred object structures. Thus, when objects are extracted and displayed from the interpolated image, the objects often exhibit a blocky and generally unsatisfactory appearance. This problem is particularly acute for thin tree-like structures such as the coronary arteries. Recently, workers in the field have proposed a strategy referred to as shape-based interpolation that offers an improvement to linear interpolation. In shape-based interpolation, the object of interest is first segmented (extracted) from the initial 3-D image to produce a low-z-resolution binary-valued image. Then, the segmented image is interpolated to produce a high-resolution binary-valued 3-D image. These techniques, however, do not use the original gray-scale information and have difficulties with images containing tree-like structures, such as the coronary arteries. We describe two shape-based interpolation methods that generate improved results for tree-like structures. The first method incorporates geometrical constraints and takes as input a segmented version of the original 3-D image. The second method builds upon the first in that it also uses the original gray-scale image as a second input. Tests with 3-D images of the coronary arterial tree demonstrate the efficacy of the methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION ANY medical imaging scanners are able to generate</head><p>M three-dimensional (3-D) images of the anatomy [ 11, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. A 3-D image, formed by stacking a contiguous series of two-dimensional (2-D) digital images (slices), can be used to visualize complex objects in three dimensions. Unfortunately, a 3-D image generated by a typical scanner tends to have a slice spacing greater than the spacing of individual samples on a slice. Hence, the 3-D visualization of objects in such images generally requires three processing steps:</p><p>1. Interpolate the known 2-D slices to give a 3-D grayscale image that has equal spatial resolution in all three dimensions. The most prevalent interpolation method is linear interpolation <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Perform some form of image segmentation <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> to extract the objects of interest from the new high-resolution 3-D image. Typical image-segmentation approaches used for 3-D medical images are thresholding, manual sliceimage editing, and region growing <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[51-[71.</ref> Generate a 3-D shaded-surface display (SSD) of the extracted objects, using a technique such as volume rendering <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. If the objects of interest are extracted and displayed from the original uninterpolated 3-D image without going through the three-step process above, the resulting SSD will exhibit discontinuities. The displayed objects tend to look like a stack of thick "slabs." Such displays are not only distracting, but they may also be anatomically unreasonable. Thus, some form of interpolation is necessary.</p><p>Unfortunately, linear interpolation and similar higher-order schemes, such as cubic convolution <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, assume that the known image data "fit a smooth curve"-these interpolation methods can be modeled as low-pass filters <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. Object edges, though, are largely determined by high-frequency components <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Hence, 3-D images interpolated via these schemes will contain objects having a blurred structure. Thus, after the interpolated image is segmented, the resulting objects still exhibit artifacts and even create new artifacts. This effect is particularly severe for anatomical entities such as the coronary arterial tree, which consists of thin branching structures distributed over a large volume <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Shape-based interpolation, a recently proposed strategy, offers an improvement over linear interpolation <ref type="bibr">[lo]-[ 151.</ref> Instead of first interpolating the original 3-D gray-scale image, this approach assumes that the original 3-D image is first segmented, to give a low-resolution binary-valued 3-D image only containing the objects of interest. It then interpolates the segmented image to give a high-resolution binary-valued 3-D image that contains objects suitable for display. An additional benefit of this strategy is that one need only segment a low-resolution 3-D image versus a high-resolution 3-D image-segmentation is often a tedious task in 3-D medical image analysis <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>.</p><p>The procedure of Lin et al. interpolates object contours [lo]-[ 131. For the segmented, uninterpolated 3-D image, contours are defined for each object cross-section on a slice. A contour is defined as a set of connected line segments that define the topological boundary of a cross-section. To interpolate a high-resolution binary-valued 3-D image, Lin et al. use a complex mechanism, relying upon the "force-field" tensions between adjacent known contours, to interpolate new 0278-0062/93$03.00 0 1993 IEEE contours. These contours must then be translated into sample values on the desired sampling lattice for the 3-D image. Lin et al. cleverly introduce geometrical criteria that enable their method to work satisfactorily in complex cross-sectional branching situations. (Liang et al. have performed some preliminary work on interpolating a high-resolution gray-scale 3-D image, given the original 3-D image and corresponding segmentation [ 161, [17]. Their approach uses heuristics and the contour-based approach of Lin et al. They have noted some undesirable gray-scale artifacts in the interpolated results.) The method of Raya-Udupa, which is considerably simpler than the method of Lin et al., uses the concept of a distance transform to interpolate high-resolution binary-valued 3-D images <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Section I11 gives more detail on this method. Herman et al. suggested improvements to computing the distance calculations needed in the Raya-Udupa approach [ 151.</p><p>It is important to realize that interpolation technically cannot increase the spatial resolution of a 3-D image-i.e., give new information-as is well known from the sampling theorem. Interpolation can only increase the sample density of the image, per the desired image sampling lattice. This increase in sample density, though, brings about the desired result of enabling higher-resolution object displays to be made. The shape-based interpolation approach essentially greatly reduces the amount of information that must be interpolated by only focusing on the objects of interest and their shapes. This still technically does not result in new information. But by focusing only on object shape, the shape-based interpolation approach typically generates better "high-resolution" results than the standard linear-filtering approaches.</p><p>We present two methods that build upon the basic shapebased interpolation strategy. These methods were motivated by the problem of interpolating the coronary arterial tree <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. Coronary artery disease is a major cause of death and disability in westem society. There is need for early detection so that preventive measures can be started. Up until recently the major emphasis has been on detecting and quantitating the geometric severity of localized narrowings in coronary arteries as an index of disease severity. If the stenosis is marked, mechanical interventions such as surgical bypass or balloon dilatation of the local stenosis are used to overcome this stenosis. A stenosis, however, is a late manifestation of coronary artery disease and its discovery and treatment is somewhat like "locking the barn door after the horse has bolted." Consequently, there is increasing emphasis on detection and quantitation of the disease prior to formation of these hemodynamically significant stenoses.</p><p>Coronary arterial disease often manifests as diffuse lumenal narrowing, and hence a vessel segment's diameter must be compared against the expected normal diameter-a value that cannot be obtained directly from the image in any one individual nor, with adequate accuracy, from population averages. However, an estimate of the normal local lumen diameter can be derived from the 3-D geometry of the coronary arterial tree [18], <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. This requires the ability to estimate lengths of coronary arterial branches; i.e., from source at the aorta to the microvasculature. Consequently, the specific long-term biomedical goals of the methods proposed here are to help provide accurate estimates of the relationship between coronary-artery interbranch segment lengths and lumenal cross-sectional area. Interpolation is needed to aid in reducing the measurement noise in the segment lengths.</p><p>The basic characteristics of the coronary arterial tree are the following: 1) branches are continuous; 2) the branches have a sparse arrangement within a volume, i.e., branches do not come close to each after they bifurcate from a branch point; 3) the amount of significant branching is limited; and 4) the cross-sections typically have a relatively small area. Although coronary arteries are often serpentine in their course over the surface of the heart wall, they are almost always single (i.e., not in pairs) over most of their course from branch point to branch point. In addition, the bifurcation of vessels greater than approximately 1 mm lumen diameter generally branch in a plane coplanar with the outer surface of the heart wall. These constraints can be used as a priori knowledge in resolving ambiguities in an interpolation scheme.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref> depicts how the coronary arterial tree may be sampled by the known slices in a 3-D image. Notice that depending on interslice spacing, large spatial changes can occur in object cross-section position on adjacent slices. Unfortunately, the existing shape-based interpolation methods introduce severe artifacts when structures such as this are interpolated "blindly." Raya-Udupa's approach, since it does not exploit geometrical criteria, is not completely suited for interpolating a 3-D image containing such structures <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. As another complicating factor, structures such as the coronary arteries may have small cross-sectional areas, on the order of 5x5 sample points. This small size seems to preclude the use of Lin et al.'s complex contour-based scheme, unless one were to extend their scheme to subpixel resolution accuracy [lo], <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Further, the existing shape-based methods do not draw upon the known gray-scale information in the original 3-D image. This information is useful for resolving topological irregularities, such as when one artery branches into several.</p><p>The two methods we present are particularly well suited to interpolating images containing tree-like structures. The first method, referred to as Algorithm 1, incorporates geometrical information into the basic Raya-Udupa scheme. It takes as input a low-resolution segmented 3-D image to produce a high-resolution binary-valued 3-D image. The second method, Algorithm 2, draws upon Algorithm 1. It uses as inputs both the original 3-D gray-scale image and associated segmentation, and it outputs a high-resolution binary-valued 3-D image. The basic problem is set up in Section 11, Section I11 presents the methods, and Section IV provides results. For the sake of a consistent context, the discussion and results focus on the coronary arterial tree, but we believe the methods have more general applicability, within the prescribed constraints, to other tree-like structures such as the bronchial tree.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">METHODS</head><p>The beginning of this section summarizes Raya-Udupa's basic approach, since our methods build upon it. The latter parts of this section discuss our methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Raya-Udupa Shape-Based Interpolation</head><p>Raya and Udupa began the discussion of their shape-based interpolation approach in a general n-dimensional framework [ 141. For tractability, they later simplified their discussion to the 3-D and four-dimensional (4-D) cases. In the context of problem (4), they devised an interpolation method that draws upon the known presegmented 3-D image I , as do the methods Assume for now that 0 has one cross-section C( 1; Z ~A ) on each known slice at z = Z k A of I . Further, assume that we wish to interpolate A -1 new equally spaced slices of I between z = a and z = b, where b = a + AA; i.e., the slices at z = a and z = b are adjacent known slices of I. The Raya-Udupa method is the following:  for their results.) If Zzy(z) 2 0 for a point (2, y, z), it implies per (5) that the point lies within the extent of 0-hence, "1" is assigned to I ( z , y, 2). There are many ways to compute the distances D <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1. Compute a distance transform D for slices z = a , b, of I : of [lo]-[13], [15].</formula><p>[151. we give one approach. Computing Raya-Udupa first find the minimum-bounding parallelepiped that contains 0 on slices z = a and z = b; 0 is given by C(1;a) and C(1;b) on these slices. By assuming that 0 must lie within this structure, they greatly limit the number of points where D ( z , y, z ) needs to be computed and tacitly assume that 0 cannot make drastic shape deviations between z = a and z = b. Note, though, that for many points within the parallelepiped large, and effectively useless, distances may be computed for points well away from any object crosssection-this adds needless computation. For our needs, we will limit the maximum distance considered by a parameter R d : if, at a point (z,y,a), d ( z , y , a ) begins to exceed R d , d ( z , y, a) is set to R d and the distance calculation goes on to the next point. (All parameters will be discussed further in Section IV.) If the cross-sections of 0 stay relatively stationary in z and y from one slice to the next, the Raya-Udupa method is an effective and computationally efficient technique for interpolating new slices of 0. Unfortunately, if cross-sections of 0 on consecutive slices undergo a large z-y translation, as they often do for structures such as the coronary arteries, then the method gives anomalous results-this will be true regardless of the method used for distance calculation. For example, consider Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>(a). The first known slice of I contains a disk and the second known slice contains a rectangle. The centroids of the two cross-sections are separated by a distance greater than the radius of the disk. The results of interpolating eight new slices show that the object is fragmented on four of the interpolated slices and totally disappears on four others. Assuming that the disk should be connected smoothly to the rectangle, the desired result would be to have a smoother transition in shape from one slice to the next. None of the interpolated slices in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>(b), though, reflect this. Below, three augmentations to the Raya-Udupa method are described. The first, discussed in Section 111-B, compensates for slice-to-slice object cross-section translation; we caution that this method is not generally applicable as is, but instead serves as a building block for Algorithm 1. The second method, referred to as Algorithm 1 and discussed in Section 111-C, permits the object 0 to consist of multiple distinct cross-sections on each slice. Finally, Algorithm 2, presented in Section 111-D, also draws upon the original gray-scale volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Incorporation of Centroid Registration</head><p>The method discussed in this section augments Raya-Udupa's approach by accounting for slice-to-slice object translation. It incorporates the concept of centroid registration used by Lin et al. to compensate for large shifts in object position <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. Let P(m; z ) denote the centroid of cross-section C ( m ; z ) relative to the scan plane. P ( m ; z ) is specified as a 2-D ordered pair in the scan plane. The method, which still assumes one object cross-section per slice, is summarized below:  The centroid registration of step 2 removes this translational component from the known slices before new slices are interpolated in step 3. Thus, the cross-sections interpolated in step 3 arise only from slice-to-slice shape change. After interpolation, all cross-sections must be moved to "proper" spatial locations. Steps 4 through 6 do this. These steps assume that between slices z = a and z = b, the object fits within a narrow tube. A cross-section of this tube relative to the scan plane equals the smallest-radius circular disk that encloses both registered cross-sections C(1; U ) and C(1; b). The central axis of the tube is a line segment connectiig P(1; U ) and P(1; b). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Multiple Object Cross-Sections Per Slice</head><p>The method of Section 111-B has two severe limitations: 1) i.. does not account for the case when 0 has more than one cross-section on a slice; 2) it assumes that 0 ' s 2-D crosssections on consecutive slices are connected in 3-D regardless cf how far apart the cross-sections are from each other relative t o3 the scan plane. In general, 3-D objects can have many 2-D cross-sections on a slice. This is especially true for complex branching 3-D structures such as the coronary arteries; cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>. Thus, the method proposed in Section 111-B is not widely applicable without further enhancement.</p><p>Algorithm 1, given below, builds upon the method of Section 111-B by allowing 0 to have more than one cross-section cm a slice. It also introduces a user-selected parameter Md that constrains the maximum permissible distance between crosssections on consecutive slices. Pairs of cross-sections that are farther apart than Md are assumed to be unconnected in 3-I); hence, no interpolation of new cross-sections is performed between such cross-sections.</p><p>(Note that Raya-Udupa do not use our formal definition of an object cross-section as being a 2-D connected component. They allow an object to consist of many disjoint connected components on each known 2-D slice. Since we use cross-section centroid information to interpolate new crosssections and are interested in interpolating a structure made of many small and widely disjoint connected components on each slice, we require a more stringent definition of crosssection.) Equation (9) ensures that interpolated points already set to "1" (as a result of a computation between two different cross-sections) are not reset to "0." This allows one to "reuse" the new slices (8) of I being built up by the interpolating process. on slice z = use (9) for (6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Z ~( k -1 ) and C ( m , ; z ~k ) On Slice Z = ZAk and</head><p>Since Algorithm 1 is applicable to a general binary-valued volume I, a step for locating all cross-sections is included.</p><p>Cross-sections can be located using 2-D connected components analysis [4].</p><p>Step 4 allows several cross-sections on slice z = ZAk to be connected to the same cross-section on slice z = Z A ( k -l ) , but it does not permit several cross-sections on slice z = ZA(k-1) to be connected to the same cross-section on slice z = ZAk.</p><p>Step 5, a second pass at interpolation, permits such connections. For example, for the situation of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, step 4 can find that C(2;2) and C(3;2) are both connected to C(2; 1).</p><p>Step 4, however, does not permit new interpolated cross-sections to be generated between the pair C(1; 2) and C(1; 3) and also between the pair C(2; 2) and C(1; 3).</p><p>Step 5</p><p>will generate these connections.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref> illustrates the method. The first known slice contains three disks of varying radii. The second known slice contains one large disk. As Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref> shows, Algorithm 1 produces a smooth branching from three disks to one.</p><p>Note that Algorithm 1 is subject to error from pathological cases. For example, consider the situation of Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Suppose the known object cross-sections are C(1; l ) , C(1; 2), C(2; l), and C(2; 2). Assume cross-sections C(1; 1) and C(1; 2) are both a distance d from the two cross-sections C(2; 1) and C(2; 2). Algorithm 1 will form connections between C(1; 1) and both C(2; 1) and C(2; 2); it will also form connections between C(1; 2) and both C(2; 1) and C(2; 2). But, this may not be the desired result, as the figure illustrates. The situation occurs, because the known data is too undersampled to enable a resolution of the ambiguity. We have not observed this problem in our experiments with the coronary arterial tree. This may be, because the coronary arteries tend to "fan away" from each other as one traverses down the tree. Also, major branches typically lie coplanar to the surface of the heart wall, preventing such crossover phenomena. Further, it is important to realize that all other previously proposed shapebased interpolation methods would also "fail" for the situation illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Incorporation of Gray Scale Information</head><p>The methods above do not use the known gray-scale information w to perform interpolation. As Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows, this can lead to anomalous results. The cross-section of 0 on slice 1 should be connected to 0 on slice 2 somewhere in the vicinity of point A. Yet, Algorithm 2 will produce interpolated cross-sections that connect C( 1; 1) to C( 1; 2) through the centroid C. A similar circumstance occurs for C(1; 3). If Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> represented a branch of the 3-D arterial tree, the gray-scale image for slice 2 would be brighter near points A and B than near point C: blood would exhibit a greater concentration near these points. Thus, points A and B act as centroids for locally bright areas. Hence, since C( 1; 1) is closer to point A than B, C( 1; 1) should be connected to C( 1; 2) through a local region centered about point A. Similarly, C( 1; 3) should be connected to C(1; 2) through a local region centered about point B. These connections can only be ascertained if the available gray-scale information in w is used. Algorithm 2 incorporates gray-scale information.</p><p>Algorithm 2 Binary interpolation using object shape, location, and gray scale 1.

Method (13) performs gray-scale equalization by forcing all cross-sections to have the same maximum gray-scale value G. Also, the nonlinear gray-scale assignment rule (13) introduces a much greater gray-scale difference between bright and dark points (n = 4 for the results of this paper). This tends to enhance bright areas and suppress dark areas. Thus, a cross-section breaks apart into smaller isolated regions focused about local gray-scale maxima. Our suggestion for steps 5 and 6 isolates these newly defined regions. For our tests, we found that one threshold was suitable for an entire 3-D image (all results use T = 100). We believe this for three reasons: 1) all tests were performed on images containing bright coronary arteries;</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">I ( x , Y, z ) = (I(x, Y, z)/vma,(m; z ) ) ~ .

If one wished to interpolate relatively dark or gray structures (as opposed to bright structures), Steps 4-6 would have to be adjusted, so that these structures are brought out. Results for this method are given in Section IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head><p>This section gives two sets of experimental results and a discussion on parameter selection.</p><p>For the first set of results, the original 3-D image used contains a heart within a radiologically realistic phantom of an adult thorax and contents. The scan was made with a Picker 1200 CT scanner and the image has size 156x 156x 164 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. Individual points in a slice of the image represent an area of (0.78 mm)2. Individual slices, which represent approximately a 1-mm thick cross-section of tissue, are spaced A =0.75 mm apart. We simulated a low z-resolution situation by saving every Ath slice of the image and discarding the others. For the results, the parameter A took on the values 2,3, and 4. (A is equivalent to the interpolation factor referred to by Raya and Udupa [14].) Thus, the input data had a z-direction slice spacing AA varying from 1.5 mm to 4.5 mm.</p><p>Given a low z-resolution volume, the goal was to extract and display the 3-D coronary arteries. We tested the following interpolation schemes: linear, cubic convolution (CC), and Algorithms 1 and 2 (Algorithm 1 results discussed later). For the linear and CC schemes, the output was generated using the three-step procedure outlined in Section 1: 1) interpolation; 2) segmentation; and 3) display. The inputs to Algorithm 2 were the original low-z-resolution 3-D gray-scale image and corresponding segmentation. Segmentations for the linear and CC interpolated images and for the original low-z-resolution image were done using the scheme described in the Appendix. Hence, the final extracted coronary arteries can differ on all slices for the various methods, but the largest differences tend to occur on the interpolated slices.</p><p>We give pictorial (SSD's) and numerical results. For the numerical results, we computed the following measures:</p><p>The subscript i refers to the ith slice, 0; is the segmentation of the original high-resolution image before any slices are removed, I; is an interpolated binary-valued 3-D image, V(.)</p><p>gives the volume (# of voxels) of the indicated quantity, the operation A / B gives the points in A not in B (set difference), and the operation A @ B gives those points that are in A or B but not both; i.e., A @ B is the XOR (exclusive-or) operation.</p><p>The measure E E gives the percentage error per slice of points that are only contained in one of the two compared images; it is similar to the metric used by <ref type="bibr">Raya and Udupa [14]</ref>. The measure t~ gives the percentage error per slice for points in the original high-resolution 3-D image that are not contained in the interpolated 3-D image. Since A @ B = { A / B } U {B/A}, EE 2 ES. Because the segmentation is done at different times for the various interpolation schemes, we use all slices in computing the metrics C E and E S . <ref type="bibr">(Raya-</ref>Udupa omitted the known 3-D image slices in computing numerical comparisons, since all of the interpolation schemes they tested started with the same segmented binary data-no error would appear in the final object in the known segmented slices.)</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref> and Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I1</ref> present the results for the Picker volume. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(a) depicts the original high-resolution data (after segmentation) for reference. For A = 2, cubic convolution performs the best numerically; the SSD's of the various methods, not shown for this case, are indistinguishable. Clearly, at least for this image for A = 2, z-direction undersampling is not so severe as to hamper the performance of the lowpass-filter-based schemes. As A increases, Algorithm 2 outperforms the other methods. For both linear interpolation and cubic-convolution interpolation, severe "stairstep" artifacts appear in many branches and sections of some branches are missing-see Figs.    <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I1</ref> should not be taken as the primary evidence of a method's effectiveness. It is important to realize that a typical artery cross-section is on the order of 20-30 points (i.e., has a size on the order of 5 x 5 voxels)+ven a 2 or 3 point difference per cross-section, which can arise from partial volume effects, would give an E E on the order of 0.10. We also tested Algorithm 1, which does not use gray-scale information, on the Picker phantom example. The results tend to be strongly similar to those of Algorithm 2. Differences arise near the bifurcations of larger arteries. These differences tend not to be perceptible in the SSD's, nor do they produce large numerical differences. A close examination of interpolated slices near the bifurcations, though, shows that Algorithm 2 produces more sharply defined bifurcations than Algorithm 1; i.e., for Algorithm 2, a large branch bifurcates into two branches more cleanly and quickly than Algorithm 1. As a point of comparison, for the case A = 4, Md = 10 and Rd = 15, = 0.100 and 6s = 0.049 between the Algorithm For the second set of results, Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> depicts interpolation results for a 3-D angiogram generated by the dynamic spatial reconstructor (DSR) <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. The DSR is a high-speed x-ray CT scanner, capable of generating 3-D images of the in vivo heart. Consult reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> for more information on the DSR. The original image contains a background-corrected 128 x 128 x96 3-D image of the opacified coronary arterial tree. Each voxel represents a tissue volume of (0.931nm)~. To generate the interpolation results, we started with a 3-D image having three of every four slices removed (A = 4). The segmented coronary arterial tree for parts (axe) were generated as follows [7]: a) apply a 3 x 3 x 3 sigma filter (o = 10) to reduce noise and artifacts; b) perform 3-D seeded region growing (threshold=64, TOLERANCE 10, MIN_VALUE=32). Consult <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> for details on this procedure. Linear and cubic-convolution interpolation [Figs. 9(b) and 9(c)] exhibit stairstep artifacts and missing branch sections. Also, because of the lowpass "blurring" characteristics of these interpolation techniques, they also generate overly wide cross-sections over much of the tree. Algorithm 2, on the other hand, generates a result largely free of artifacts.</p><p>An issue in using Algorithms 1 and 2 is the selection of Rd and Md. We give guidelines for selecting these parameters below. Rd, the maximum distance calculated in (9, is used to limit the computation expended on the distance transformations. Because of the centroid registration step, this parameter generally need not be larger than the maximum expected crosssection radius. Picking this parameter small, though, limits the magnitude of the distances and can result in points either being added to or missing from interpolated cross-sections. In general, if Rd is pickedslarge, it has no impact on the results.</p><p>Unlike Rd, Md can have a significant impact on results. Md, the maximum distance allowed between centroids of connected cross-sections on adjacent slices, is picked based on the following ideas: 1) Suppose c, and c b are cross-section5 on slice 1 and C is a cross-section on slice 2; if C, is "much closer" to C than cb is, then C, is more likely to be connected to C than c b is. 2) Suppose C, overlaps C in the xy scan plane; i.e, c, is definitely connected to c; then, if cb is "close" to C,, then c b is also probably connected to C. When choosing Md, a balance must be made between allowing crosssections to be connected and preventing false connections. Factors that influence this balance are the complexity of the structures to be interpolated, the spacing of known slices Az, and the orientation of the structures within the image. For example, for the coronary artery images used in this paper, difficulties arise for branches that are nearly parallel to the scanning plane. For example, for A = 4, notice the breaks that occur in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(e) (Md = 3) versus the clean result in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7(d</ref>) (Md = 10). For Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>(c), even for Md = 10, breaks occur, because of the large slice spacing (A = S), but, as noted earlier, trying to compensate for this spacing problem by using Md = 20 begins to result in incorrect interconnections. For the A = 4 case, we tested the sensitivity of Algorithm 2 to the variation of Md (Rd fixed at 15). For 18 5 Md 5 4, the result was virtually unchanged with a few small pieces lost (net increase in AEE: = 0.0007). For Md = 3, the change as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(e) occurs (net additional increase in AEE = 0.0008). Finally, at Md = 1, several branch breaks occur (net additional increase in ACE = 0.0023). Thus, for this example, Md could be varied widely without adversely affecting the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION</head><p>The proposed methods, Algorithms 1 and 2, offer useful enhancements to the existing shape-based interpolation techniques. The methods show particular utility for interpolating thin tree-like structures, such as the coronary arterial tree. But they can be used for any structures exhibiting the following characteristics: 1) they consist of thin, continuous branches and 2) the branches are relatively well separated from each other (although branches can bifurcate). Certainly, our methods could still produce artifacts in unusual cases (as do other previously proposed methods), as mentioned earlier. The primary cause of these artifacts, though, is the large interslice spacing, and hence inadequate sampling, of the known slices.</p><p>Algorithms 1 and 2 assume that the given 3-D image consists of parallel slices. By adjusting the distance transformation in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) so that z is allowed to vary, we believe our methods c'an also handle 3-D images consisting of nonparallel slices, hut we have not tested this situation. Finally, we caution that image segmentation, a requirement in our methods, as well as the methods of [lo]-[15], is a major issue. Further work is possible. A major improvement would be to devise a method that interpolates a high-resolution gray-scale volume from a given low-z resolution gray-scale 3-D image. One could conceivably use image-registration techniques to locate matching areas and differing areas between known pairs of dices to assist this process. For such a method to be useful, it would probably have to place emphasis on inherent object structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. APPENDIX</head><p>This appendix describes the semiautomatic segmentation scheme used to segment the coronary arteries from a highresolution 3-D image. The original, BL, and CC results of Figs. 7 and 8 were generated using the segmentation scheme described here.</p><p>Remove background: Zero out points below gray-scale value T1 (= 120 for the example of this paper). The input data has virtually no noise corruption and exhibits a strong separation between the bright areas (the angiographically opacified coronary arteries, left ventricular [LV] chamber, and the naturally radiodense spinal column) and the dim areas (heart muscle and other surroundings). Thus, this threshold can be chosen over a wide range of values without greatly affecting the outcome.</p><p>Remove spinal column: Using a manual mask-editing tool in a 3-D image-analysis package [5], we manually removed a region corresponding to the spinal column. This left the coronary arteries and LV chamber.</p><p>Separate the LV chamber from the coronary arteries: The following operations were performed on the 3-D image for those image slices near the aortic root (the area where the arteries become connected to the angiographically opacified aorta and LV chamber):</p><p>Letting the input 3-D image be referred to as V1, copy V1 to a scratch image V2.</p><p>Zero out points in V2 with V 2 ( z , y , z ) &lt; T2, where T2 &gt; TI. T2 is picked so that the arteries break apart from the LV chamber, without obliterating any object cross-sections. Much leeway exists for picking this parameter (T2 = 140 for the example of this paper.) This operation changes the topology of the image to the desired form (arteries separated from the LV chamber). Unfortunately, it also removes many points belonging to the arteries (and LV chamber). Perform a 2-D conditional homotopic thickening on V2, conditioning the thickening on the contents of V l <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. This restores the shapes of the artery and LV cross-sections without reconnecting these structures. 3-D image V2 is retained for further processing. Copy V2 to a scratch image V3.</p><p>Using 2-D connected-components analysis, find and save the largest cross-section (connected component) on each slice of the image V3. All other cross-sections on the slice are deleted.</p><p>Compute the set difference V2/V3. This retains the cross-sections of V2 (the arteries) not contained in V3.</p><p>c.</p><p>Since the LV chamber is always by far the largest structure (cross-section) on each slice, deleting the largest cross-section on each slice effectively deletes the LV chamber. Since the spinal column is situated well away from LV chamber and coronary arteries, the manual deletion in step 2 is easily accomplished. Hence, given T1 and T2, the above segmentation approach is fully reproducible.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Schematic of geometry for angiographically opacified coronary arterial tree in a typical low z-resolution 3-D image.
