<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Linear precoding consists in multiplying by an matrix a -dimensional vector obtained by serial-to-parallel conversion of a symbol sequence to be transmitted. In this paper, new tools, borrowed from the so-called free probability theory, are introduced for the purpose of analyzing the performance of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receivers for certain large random isometric precoded systems on fading channels. The isometric condition represents the case of precoding matrices with orthonormal columns. It is shown in this contribution that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the equalizer output converges almost surely to a deterministic value depending on the probability distribution of the channel coefficients when + and 1. These asymptotic results are used to analyze the impact of orthogonal spreading as well as to optimally balance the redundancy introduced between linear precoding versus classical convolutional coding, while preserving a simple MMSE equalization scheme at the receiver.</p></div>

After serial-to-parallel conversion, the -dimensional received vector can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is an white additive Gaussian noise such that , and where is the diagonal complex matrix bearing on its diagonal the channel gains. The role of matrix is to introduce diversity so that it allows to transmit each component of over a duration times longer than if were reduced to . Note that the model proposed for describing the system is broad enough to capture a multiplicity of transmission schemes. These include the following.</p><p>• Multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) downlink transmissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this case, the elements of represent different streams of symbols destined to different users, coincides with the number of subcarriers, and each column of represents the code allocated to each user. The vector is sent to an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulator, and (1) represents the signal received after guard interval suppression and Fourier transformation. In the frequency domain, the received vector signal can be seen as resulting from a transmission over parallel flat-fading channels. Diagonal entries of represent the frequency-domain channel gains for data frame .</p><p>• Precoded OFDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> or spread OFDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> in a single-user context. In this case, matrix acts as a means for spreading 0018-9448/03$17.00 © 2003 IEEE each component of over all carriers. This increases the overall frequency diversity of the modulator, so that deeply attenuated carriers can still be recovered by taking advantage of the subbands enjoying a high SNR.</p><p>An important problem lies in the choice of the amount of redundancy introduced by linear precoding, i.e., the ratio , and also in the choice of matrix . Giraud and Belfiore <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Boutros and Viterbo <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> considered the case where , i.e., is unitary. They assumed the entries of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and proposed to derive an upper bound of the error probability for the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector of . They discovered that, at least for high SNRs, has to be chosen in such a way that the minimum so-called -distance product of the constellation , where denotes the set of possible values taken by vector , be maximum. But the optimization of the coefficients of is hardly trivial and entails the use of sophisticated mathematical tools from algebraic number theory. Moreover, the high computational cost of the ML detector prevents its use in practical contexts.</p><p>Actually, due to its lower complexity, minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection is often preferred. In our context, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is a natural figure for evaluating the MMSE detector performance. For reasons related to calculus, the analysis will be conducted in the asymptotic regime . We note that this is especially relevant in the precoded OFDM case since in usual wireless OFDM systems, a high number of carriers ( 64) are involved.</p><p>The output of the MMSE detector is and is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> Each component of is corrupted by the effect of both the thermal noise and by the "multiuser interference" due to the contributions of the other users . It has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, that this additive noise can be considered as Gaussian when and are large enough. Therefore, the SINR at the output of each component of the MMSE detector characterizes entirely the performance of the modulation scheme equipped with an MMSE receiver. Several papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have recently analyzed the behavior of the SINR at the output of the MMSE detector in the case where the entries of are i.i.d. random variables (referred to in the sequel as the i.i.d. case), the matrix is reduced to , and the various users can have different powers. In this case, it has been shown that this SINR converges almost surely toward a well-defined deterministic value which does not depend on the particular realization of . These results have been used by several authors to better understand the performance of the chosen transmitter/receiver chain. In particular, Biglieri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and Shamai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> showed how to use these results to find the optimum value of the parameter via the analysis of the system throughput. We also note that Müller <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> considered the case where the columns of are i.i.d. -dimensional random vectors uniformly distributed on the unit sphere of . In this paper, we also study the behavior of the SINR at the output of the MMSE detector assuming that is a random matrix and use the corresponding results to discuss the choice of . However, we address the case where is isometric. In the sequel, this will be called the isometric case. The choice of an isometric spreading matrix is usual in systems where synchronization is ensured such as signal space diversity systems or precoded OFDM or downstream MC-CDMA systems, since it provides much better results than the choice of an i.i.d. matrix. Moreover, we stress the fact that in our models, the matrix is not reduced to identity. To our knowledge, the problem we address here has not been considered in previous works.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, the i.i.d. case study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> leans on mathematical results that concern the "limiting distribution of eigenvalues" of some large random matrices with i.i.d. entries (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). As for the isometric case, a considerably more involved material will be needed. The results given here rely on the so-called free probability theory initially developed by Voiculescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in order to solve deep problems of operator algebras classification. At the end of the 1980s, Voiculescu realized that this theory could also be used to analyze the eigenvalue distribution of sums or products of certain independent large random matrices. This will be the starting point of our analysis. Note that Evans and Tse already introduced free probability theory in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>This paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we descibe in detail the way we generate the random isometric-valued matrices under consideration. Then, we present our main result (Theorem 1), which asserts that the SINR at the output of the MMSE detector converges almost surely to a deterministic value. At the end of this section, an asymptotic result for the i.i.d. case is also given for the purpose of comparison. In Section III, we confirm by simulations the fact that our asymptotic analysis allows to predict the performance of the MMSE detector for relatively small values of . Section IV starts with the evaluation of the whole system throughput (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) with respect to for a fixed allocated bandwidth. The purpose of this computation is to determine the optimal amount of redundancy that should be spent on the linear precoder in a system where linear precoding is combined with convolutional encoding. This analysis is sustained by a performance comparison between the linearly precoded system and a system equipped with a classical convolutional forward error-correcting code in addition to linear precoding, the overall coding rate being the same for both systems. We shall confirm, by practical examples, the fact that the redundancy tradeoff between linear precoding (through the choice of ) and coding (through the choice of the rate of the convolutional code) can be given a priori by the throughput analysis. This discussion was motivated by the recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Sections V and VI contain the most technical part of the paper. As we believe that free probability theory is an important and promising tool, we propose to give in Section V a comprehensive introduction to its most important aspects concerning our purpose. In Section VI, we show how to apply an important lemma of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) to our particular situation, and, finally, use the almost-sure asymptotic freeness result presented in the recent monograph <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to prove Theorem 1.</p></div>

Hypotheses and Preliminary Properties</head><p>In this section, we first describe in detail the properties of the matrix and of the diagonal entries of .

As a typical example, if the coefficients are complex Gaussian<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> (resulting in a Rayleigh fading), then , which corresponds to a distribution with two degrees of freedom. It is important to notice that random variables are not assumed to be independent. However, we assume that the following assumption holds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A2: For each almost surely (3)</head><p>Assumption A2 implies some kind of asymptotic independence between the random variables and if . This hypothesis is quite realistic in the context of signal-space diversity schemes or in precoded OFDM systems if large-size interleavers/deinterleavers are inserted in the scheme represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Interleavers are needed in precoded OFDM systems because without interleaving, the coefficients coincide with the values taken by the transfer function of a multipath Rayleigh-fading channel at frequencies , . If the number of paths remains fixed when , the sequence depend on a finite number of independent random variables, and the hypothesis A2 cannot, of course, be fulfilled. However, in such a context, the tools developed in this paper can still be applied, but the main results have a different form. The reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for more details.</p><p>We now explain how the random matrix is generated. For this purpose, some notations and definitions need to be introduced. Denote by the multiplicative group of unitary matrices, and by a random unitary matrix. is said to be Haar distributed if the probability distribution of is invariant by left multiplication by constant unitary matrices. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> Since the group is compact, this condition is known to be equivalent to the invariance of the probability distribution of by right multiplication by constant unitary matrices. In order to generate Haar distributed unitary random matrices, let be an random matrix with independent complex Gaussian centered unit variance entries. The unitary matrix is Haar distributed. To see this, notice that for each constant unitary matrix Since the probability distribution of and coincides, matrices and have the same distribution. The above equality thus implies that and are identically distributed.</p><p>There is another way for building Haar distributed unitary matrices that will be useful to our purpose. Instead of multiplying by the inverse of the Hermitian square root of , one can introduce the uniquely defined upper triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements defined by</p><p>The unitary matrix defined by ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)</p><p>is also Haar distributed. To see this, we first remark that for each constant unitary matrix , the probability distribution of and of coincide. But, it is obvious that , so that . Therefore, the probability distribution of and of coincides. Remark that the columns of are obtained by a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the columns of .</p><p>Finally, we state an interesting property of Haar-distributed unitary random matrices. being one such matrix, its probability distribution is also invariant under right multiplication by unitary matrices, hence this distribution coincides with the distribution of for any permutation matrix . This shows that the isometric matrices obtained by extracting any subset of columns from have the same probability distribution.</p><p>In the following, we will make the following assumption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Statement of the Main Result</head><p>Let us first recall the expression of the SINR at one of the outputs of the MMSE detector. Let be the column of associated to some element of , and the isometric matrix which remains after extracting from . The SINR at the output of the MMSE detector is easily shown to be expressed as (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> Writing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I E E E P r o o f</head><p>and invoking the matrix inversion lemma, we get, after some simple algebra, another useful expression for this SINR <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> We are now in position to state the main result of this contribution.</p><p>Theorem 1: Assume that matrices and are chosen according to assumptions A1-A3, and moreover, we have the following assumption.</p><p>A4: The probability density of the random variables has a compact support included in the interval , which implies that almost surely. When grows toward infinity and , the SINR at the output of an MMSE equalizer converges almost surely to a value that is the unique solution of the equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> This theorem is proved in Section VI. In order to give some insights to the reader, we just briefly justify the result when for each , which, of course, implies . The case is easy to handle because has a simple expression. Indeed, when , the matrix is unitary, so . Therefore, can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where denotes the th component of vector . Using the fact that and if and if (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>), it is rather straightforward to show that converges in the mean-square sense to the quantity defined by This shows that converges in probability to the value defined by as expected. The proof of the almost-sure convergence for is a little bit more complicated, but is a consequence of an important lemma in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> already used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> (see Section VI for more details).</p><p>Before proceeding, let us give some additional remarks on Theorem 1.</p><p>Remark 1: It is asserted that (8) has a unique solution. As a matter of fact, the left-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is a positive decreasing function of which converges to when , while the right-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is an increasing function of which is at .</p><p>Remark 2: When the measure is replaced by the Dirac measure at point , the matrix is reduced to . By direct computation, the receiver output SINR in this situation (called the Gaussian channel situation) is easily shown to be . This value is also given by ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) when is replaced by .</p><p>Remark 3: In the statement of Theorem 1, is assumed compactly supported. This hypothesis is important from a technical point of view because the most powerful results of free probability theory (in particular, the asymptotic freeness of independent large random matrices, see later) require compactly supported measures. Although the usual probability distributions of the coefficients , like the Rayleigh or the Rice distributions, do not meet this requirement, this restriction is, of course, not very important in practice. In particular, the use of ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) with (for the Rayleigh-channel case) allows to predict quite well the performance of our precoded modulation scheme using MMSE detection.</p><p>Remark 4: One key information provided by Theorem 1 is that the SINR does not depend on the particular realization of the isometric matrix sequence if and , provided it is extracted from a Haar-distributed random unitary matrix. However, usual precoded OFDM or MC-CDMA systems use quite different precoding matrices, e.g., Walsh-Hadamard matrices, which, of course, do not coincide with realizations of Haar-distributed random matrices. It is, therefore, important to check if, in practice, the most common precoding matrices provide the same asymptotic performance as the realizations of Haar-distributed random unitary matrices. When , ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) immediately shows that if the matrix is replaced by a deterministic isometric matrix whose entries have the same modulus (the Walsh-Hadamard matrices, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) matrices, of course, satisfy this condition), then , and thus converge to the value predicted by Theorem 1. The case is studied by simulations in Section III.</p><p>We now address the i.i.d. case. In the next section, the performance of systems having large isometric precoder matrices will be compared to the performance of systems with i.i.d. matrices, and the impact of the precoder column orthogonality will be quantified. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I E E E P r o o f</head><p>Then, when grows toward infinity and , the SINR at the output of an MMSE equalizer converges almost surely to a value that is the unique solution of the equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> As this paper is essentially devoted to the isometric case, this result will be justified briefly in the Appendix. The proof is a direct consequence of [12, Corollary 1] and of the main result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Note that in this theorem is not restricted to but belongs to .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 5: Comparison With the Tse-Hanly Formula:</head><p>The so-called Tse-Hanly formula for the MMSE receiver [13, Formula 4] gives the asymptotic SINR value for CDMA systems with random i.i.d. codes in a flat-fading channel, which in our context amounts to for each , or equivalently . As the powers allocated to the various components of vector all coincide in our context, this equation is written <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Recall that Tse and Hanly interpreted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> the factor as the effective interference of component of on the desired component at the desired target SINR . The term thus represents the total amount of multiuser interference at the output of the MMSE receiver (the term is multiplied by , the number of users, while the coefficient is due to the spreading gain provided by the precoder).</p><p>We remark that (10) of Theorem 2 can be rewritten as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> It is interesting to note that the right-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) coincides with an averaged version (on the square of the amplitude of the channel coefficients) of the inverse of the sum of the multiuser effective interference term and of the term which represents the contribution of a thermal noise of variance in a flat-fading channel of complex gain . This shows first that the diversity provided by the precoder is, of course, due to the averaging on the values taken by in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. More importantly, (12) also indicates that the important concept of multiuser effective interference introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is still relevant if is not a multiple of .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 6: It is clear that for each</head><p>This implies that for a fixed value of , the SINR in the i.i.d. case is always less than the SINR in the isometric case. Moreover, the performance gain induced by the use of isometric codes instead of i.i.d. ones grows when grows toward . Conversely, the SINR in the i.i.d. case is nearly equal to the SINR in the orthogonal case if is close to . It is also interesting to note that the second term of the right-hand sides of ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) are similar. The multiuser interference term appears in both formulas, while the term , representing the effect of the thermal noise in the i.i.d. case, is multiplied in the isometric case by , which is, of course, less than . In other words, for a given target SINR of , an isometric precoded system corrupted by thermal noise of variance provides the same performance as an i.i.d. precoded one corrupted by thermal noise of variance .</p><p>Remark 7: The Case of Non equal Powers: In this paper, we just consider the case where the components of have the same power. This is because we are mainly motivated by the study of single-user precoded systems, i.e., all the components of are to be sent to the same user. The nonequal power case is nevertheless quite relevant in the context of multiuser systems. However, the approach used in the present paper cannot be generalized to this context because the calculation of relies on the equal power assumption (see Section VI). The nonequal power case requires the use of more sophisticated tools. The interested reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for more details.</p><p>Remark 8: The Case Where : Theorem 2 remains valid when . Although not intuitive, the use of an precoder with may improve the performance in the i.i.d. case for low values of SNR (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in the context of a frequency flat-fading channel). Of course, the case does not make sense in the isometric case. However, instead of using a precoding matrix the columns of which are orthogonal, one may use for a matrix whose rows are orthogonal. In this context, we model the precoding matrix as a random matrix obtained first by extracting rows from a Haar-distributed unitary matrix, and second by multiplying the resulting matrix by the scaling factor . Therefore, satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> The scaling factor in (13) normalizes the power allocated to each component of . Derivation of the MMSE output SINR in the asymptotic regime is similar to the case where . To be precise, as , is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> As in the case , it is easy to check that converges to defined by Therefore, the SINR converges toward the unique solution of the equation In Section IV, devoted to the choice of , we show that in contrast with the i.i.d. case, it is not relevant to use fat precoding matrices in the Haar-distributed case, even for low SNRs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATION</head><p>In this section, we first study in a more precise manner the influence of on the theoretical asymptotic SINR as well as on the bit-error rate (BER) in a scenario where no convolutional encoding is implemented. These results will then be confirmed by simulation. Symbols for all users have their values in a quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) constellation. The channel is assumed to be a Rayleigh-fading channel, in other words, . Although this hypothesis does not meet the technical assumption A4, we shall nevertheless make use of ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> to predict the asymptotic performances of our precoded systems.

We notice that there is an important performance gap between systems with and systems with . This gap is clearly reduced when we pass from to . In order to verify the practical relevance of these evaluations, we also represent experimental results obtained by numerical simulations for in the context of a single-user precoded system: by single-user system, we mean that all the components of are to be sent to the same user.

A relatively close match between the two types of curves is observed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CHOICE OF</head><p>In this section, we tackle the problem of finding the value of that maximizes the system's throughput. As said earlier, the  purpose of this analysis is to determine the amount of redundancy that should be spent on the linear precoder. The need for an optimum can be justified intuitively. On the one hand, at fixed bandwidth, choosing close to or even greater than (see Remark 8) allows us to use low-rate error-correcting codes but the effect of the "multiuser interference" significantly de-creases the SINR at the output of the MMSE detector. On the other hand, a small value of increases the SINR at the output of the MMSE detector, but higher rate error-correcting codes are then needed. Biglieri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and Shamai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> have already used the spectral efficiency as a tool for answering the coding versus spreading issue in uplink CDMA with random  i.i.d. codes. They have shown in particular that a nonnegligible amount of spreading should be spent when using MMSE receivers if is large enough while should be chosen greater than for 3 dB. We look for an extension of such a result to the case where random Haar matrices are used.</p><p>as well as (see again Remark 8) will be considered.</p><p>In the context of this paper, the throughput is the total number of bits per second per hertz (b/s/Hz) that can be reliably transmitted with our precoded system equipped with an MMSE receiver. Our throughput analysis will be confirmed by simulations. Practical convolutional coding schemes of rates are considered with rates satisfying for different values of .  </p></div>

Throughput Analysis</head><p>The throughput is defined by where is solution of the equation SINR <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> It is understood that , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for more details.</p><p>We compare the throughput of the current systems to the maximum of the throughput in the Gaussian (nonfading) channel case, which is, of course, reached for . This upper bound will be called the Gaussian channel bound in the following. It obviously coincides with the capacity of the standard Gaussian is fixed to 10 dB and we plot the throughput versus in the Haar-distributed and in the i.i.d. code matrices cases. We confirm that Haar precoding outperforms i.i.d. precoding. The performance gap becomes clear when . 3  In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>, is fixed to 2 dB and we plot the throughput versus for Haar-distributed and for i.i.d. code matrices. In contrast with the case where 10 dB, the optimum value of in the i.i.d. case is greater than . Note, however, that the gain between and the optimum value of is not significant. In contrast, the throughput in the Haar-distributed case is optimum for . This observation is confirmed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> which shows the behavior of the optimum value of (i.e., for which the throughput is maximum) with respect to for both Haar-distributed and and i.i.d. cases. In the Haar-distributed case, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows that nearly no redundancy should be spent on the precoder to maximize the throughput. In contrast, in the i.i.d. case, a significant amount of redundancy is needed when 3 As it can be easily shown, the throughput of i.i.d. and Haar precoders converges as ! 1 to the same value. It is solution of the equation</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Performance of Practical Coding Schemes</head><p>Our throughput analysis is sustained in this part by simulations. The input bit stream is first serial to parallel converted to produce substreams (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Each substream is convolutionnally encoded with a code of rate and time-interleaved. It is assumed that the same code is used for each substream. The resulting bits of substream are then mapped onto a QPSK constellation to produce component of symbol vector to be processed by the precoding matrix . It is assumed that a soft-output Viterbi algorithm is used at the receiver to decode the transmitted bits. The same decoder is applied on each component of vector and processes the real and imaginary parts of each component of the deinterleaved output of the MMSE detector. We note that we encode each bit substream by the same code independently in order to implement a reasonably simple Viterbi decoder (to be in accordance with the low computational cost of an MMSE detector). Otherwise, the metrics calculation  could not be processed on a per-component basis due to the intercomponent noise correlations introduced by the application of the MMSE equalizer on the received samples. This would exponentially increase the number of states of the Viterbi algorithm trellis. Note that Schramm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> conducted a sim-ilar analysis in the case of uplink CDMA with i.i.d. random spreading.</p><p>In our simulations, different values of are considered and each of them is associated to a convolutional code of rate .

The easy case has already been considered in Section II, so we just concentrate on the case where . We first recall the following useful result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>: Lemma 1: Let be an random vector and an random matrix independent of . Assume that the elements of are centered i.i.d. random variables with unit variance and a finite eighth-order moment and that , where denotes the spectral norm (this spectral norm is said to be uniformly bounded).

Therefore, and have the same asymptotic behavior. This, in conjunction with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, allows to evaluate the limit of the SINR. Details are given in the Appendix.</p><p>The main technical problem encountered in the case where is isometric follows from the observation that, in contrast to the i.i.d. case, and are no more independent. Therefore, and are not independent. It is, however, possible to show that and have the same behavior. This result can be used to address the more general case where the components of have different powers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for more details). The equal power context of the present paper permits actually to use a simpler method. 5 Instead of studying , we rather consider the asymptotic behavior of given by ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and related to by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The idea here is to remark that the matrix defined by (32) is unitarily invariant, thanks to the fact that is extracted from a Haar-distributed random unitary matrix. Let be a Haar-distributed unitary matrix independent of and . Then, and have the same distribution. Let be the column selection vector such that , and denote by the vector . Then, because and have the same distribution, so do and . In particular, the following identity holds:</p><p>It is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> that vector is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere of , and can, therefore, be written as for some complex -dimensional random vector, where stands for the normal distribution.  <ref type="bibr">THEOREM 2</ref> In this appendix, we briefly justify Theorem 2. Recall that the SINR is given by where is defined in (31). This matrix can also be written</p><p>Using Assumption A4, it is easily seen that As and are independent, Lemma 1 implies that converges to almost surely when . In order to evaluate the behavior of , we use the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. We first recall that if is a probability measure, its Stieltjes transform is the function defined by Assumption A2′ implies that the empirical eigenvalue distribution of converges weakly to the distribution of random variable , i.e., the measure defined by . The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> immediately imply that the empirical eigenvalue distribution of converges weakly almost surely to a probability measure whose Stieltjes transform is defined by</p><p>Moreover, as the eigenvalues of are greater than (recall that is the upper bound of the ), the measure is carried by . The function is bounded and continuous on . The weak convergence of the empirical eigenvalue distribution of thus implies that almost surely. Therefore, the SINR converges almost surely to , which coincides with . Equation ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) follows directly from (36).</p></div>
