<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Molecular communication (MC) is a promising bioinspired paradigm, in which molecules are used to encode, transmit and receive information at the nanoscale. Very limited research has addressed the problem of modeling and analyzing the MC in nanonetworks. One of the main challenges in MC is the proper study and characterization of the noise sources. The objective of this paper is the analysis of the noise sources in diffusion-based MC using tools from signal processing, statistics and communication engineering. The reference diffusion-based MC system for this analysis is the physical end-to-end model introduced in a previous work by the same authors. The particle sampling noise and the particle counting noise are analyzed as the most relevant diffusion-based noise sources. The analysis of each noise source results in two types of models, namely, the physical model and the stochastic model. The physical model mathematically expresses the processes underlying the physics of the noise source. The stochastic model captures the noise source behavior through statistical parameters. The physical model results in block schemes, while the stochastic model results in the characterization of the noises using random processes. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the capability of the stochastic model to express the diffusion-based noise sources represented by the physical model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>nanomachines, the definition of channel models and the development of architectures and protocols for nanonetworks are new challenges that need to be addressed in the research world.</p><p>Molecular communication (MC) is a promising paradigm for communication in nanonetworks. Unlike classical communication techniques, we believe that the integration process of molecular transceivers in nanomachines is more feasible due to their size and natural domain. MC follows a bio-inspired approach, in which molecules are used to encode, transmit and receive information at the nanoscale. Several techniques to propagate information molecules have been proposed so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, ranging from molecular motors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, to bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or free diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We focus on the diffusion-based architecture, as it represents the most general and widespread MC architecture found in nature. Pheromonal communication, when pheromones are released into a fluidic medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, such as air or water, is an example of diffusion-based architecture. Another example is calcium signaling among cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Different mathematical models have been formulated for the diffusion of molecules in a fluid. As an example, the theory of turbulent diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> can be applied to the diffusion of pheromones, while the theory of electro-diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is applicable to the diffusion of calcium ions in calcium signaling. The most general model of molecular diffusion in fluids, which underlies all the other models, is based on the Fick's diffusion theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In this paper, we consider only Fick's diffusion in order to maintain the maximum possible generality for our diffusion-based MC system. Further specifications of the system for the pheromonal communication case or the calcium signaling case stem from the general case treated in this work.</p><p>Up to date, very limited research has addressed the problem of the analytical modeling of diffusion-based MC from an information theoretical point of view. While in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> some open questions about nanoscale information theory are outlined, concrete mathematical solutions for specific diffusion-based MC architectures are not provided. Two main different diffusion-based MC architectures have been studied by the research community under an information theoretical point of view, on the basis on how information is encoded in the diffusing molecules. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the information is encoded in the time of release of each molecule in the diffusion channel, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the information is encoded into variations in the concentration of molecules in the space. The first type of architecture is theoretically analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where the authors focused on the mathematical modeling of the diffusion channel as a probabilistic contribution in the time of arrival of molecules at the receiver. The model of this system is focused on the diffusion channel, while the transmitter is an ideal emitter of one or more molecules at precise time instants, and the receiver ideally computes the molecule time of arrival at its location. Moreover, a drift velocity is added on top of the diffusion process. The results of simulations from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in terms of achievable information rate show that, due to the high uncertainty in the propagation time, this architecture is characterized by very low capacity. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is focused on developing an MC receiver model based on molecule concentration encoding, while the transmitter and the diffusion-based propagation theory are not taken into account. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a simplified receiver model that receives one molecule at a time is coupled with a diffusion-based channel model, while the transmitter is an ideal molecule rate emitter. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, a physical model of the diffusion-based MC is developed in terms of end-to-end information delivery at the nanoscale and models are provided for the transmitter, the channel and the receiver. A third possible diffusion-based MC architecture is proposed and analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, where information is encoded in each single molecule and only the diffusion channel part is modeled, together with other types of channels. As a consequence, the information carried by a certain molecule is received only if that molecule reaches the receiver location.</p><p>The proper study and characterization of the noise is one of the main challenges in the information theoretical analysis of diffusion-based MC. Most of the works from the literature do not provide stochastic models for the noise sources in terms of random processes. The results of these works are expressed in terms of system capacity computed on numerical results from large sets of simulations. A non-Gaussian noise is observed through numerical results from simulations of the system proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, even if it is not analytically modeled with a closed-form expression of a random process. Also in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the noise effects on the diffusion-based MC are resulting only from simulations and there is no analytical model of diffusion-based noise and no stochastic study of its underlying physical phenomena. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the noise analysis stems from a formulation of the ligand-receptor reaction kinetics at the receiver side, without accounting for diffusion. A numerical evaluation of the system capacity is here provided in terms of probability of having erroneous digital reception, but only under the assumption of a binary squared pulse code modulation signal. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, a mathematical equation for finding the system capacity is provided and it is evaluated with numerical methods.</p><p>In this paper, we aim at the analysis of the most relevant diffusion-based noise sources affecting MC. We use tools from signal processing, statistics and communication engineering, with the aim to obtain stochastic models of the sources in terms of random processes. The reference diffusion-based MC system for this analysis is the physical end-to-end model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Contributions from the biochemistry literature provide descriptions of some physical processes underlying the noise sources in diffusion-based MC systems. Seminal works in biochemistry, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, analyzed how free space diffusion of molecules impairs the proper measurement of the molecule concentration. A more recent contribution to the physical analysis of molecule diffusion and reception in biochemical signaling can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. However, these contributions tend to focus on the explanation of natural phenomena and do not provide suitable models for MC engineering. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> stems, on the contrary, from the simulation of a biological signal transduction mechanism and its associated noise using tools from communication engineering. However, the analysis of the system is limited to a numerical evaluation of the simulation results using communication engineering parameters [e.g., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]. No stochastic models are provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for the noise sources, but the results are coming from numerical simulations. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the authors develop only a preliminary information theoretic model applied to the study of intracellular communication with the diffusion of calcium ions.</p><p>The noise sources considered in this paper are modeled in a twofold fashion: the physical model provides a mathematical analysis of the physical processes which generate the noise, while the stochastic model aims at capturing those physical processes through statistical parameters. The physical model contains all the physical variables which contribute to the generation of the noise. The stochastic model summarizes the noise generation using random processes and their associated parameters. While the physical model provides a means to simulate the generation of noise in MC, the random nature of the diffusion processes does not allow for a deterministic knowledge of the noise signal. Noise impairments on MC can be studied only statistically through the parameters of the stochastic model. Sets of noise data realizations are generated through simulation of the physical model. The sets of noise data are then used to test the stochastic model ability to capture the behavior of the physical processes which generate the noise.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, some assumptions for the proposed noise analysis are introduced, and the diffusion-based noise sources are briefly defined with reference to the end-to-end model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The first noise source, namely, the particle sampling noise, is analyzed in Section III, whereas the second noise source, namely, the particle counting noise, is treated in Section IV. The physical models for the two noise sources are introduced in Sections III-A and IV-A, while the stochastic models are outlined in Sections III-B and IV-B, respectively. Simulations are provided in Section V for each noise source with the objective to test the stochastic model ability to capture the behavior of the physical models. Finally, in Section VI, we conclude the paper and present some future open research problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE DIFFUSION-BASED NOISE IN THE END-TO-END MODEL</head><p>The end-to-end (including channel) model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> describes the diffusion-based MC in terms of transmission, propagation and reception of particles, as sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The three-dimensional space S is here indexed through the Cartesian axes X, Y, and Z. The transmitter is placed at the axes origin. The emission process modulates the particle concentration rate at the transmitter according to an input signal. The modulation is achieved through the release/capture of particles into/from the emission gaps. The modulated particle concentration rate is the output of the transmitter and the input of the propagation. The propagation relies on the diffusion process of the particles in the space S to output the particle concentration at the receiver. The receiver senses the variations in the particle concentration at its location as input and it recovers the output signal. The reception process generates the output signal by means of chemical receptors. A mathematical analysis of the communication channel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> by comparing the input and the output signals. The normalized gain and delay between inputs and outputs are  computed as functions of the frequency and the transmission range for the three underlying physical processes, namely, the particle emission, diffusion and reception, as well as for the overall end-to-end model. However, the analysis from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> does not account for diffusion-based noise effects on the information signal as it propagates through the end-to-end model. In this paper, we complete the model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> by providing an analysis of the possible diffusion-based noise sources.</p><p>The analysis of the diffusion-based noise sources stems from the assumptions defined for the end-to-end model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>:</p><p>‚Ä¢ All the processes take place inside the space , with reference to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which contains a fluidic medium and it has infinite extent in all three dimensions. ‚Ä¢ A particle is an indivisible object that can be released into, or collected from, the space . ‚Ä¢ When a particle is not being released or collected, it is subject to the diffusion process in the fluidic medium contained in the space . ‚Ä¢ The shape, size and mass of a particle are considered negligible. Two type of noises are identified and studied in this paper, namely, the particle sampling noise and the particle counting noise. The particle sampling noise and the particle counting noise are analyzed as the most relevant diffusion-based noise sources affecting the physical end-to-end model in Sections III and IV, respectively. In the following, we define each noise source with reference to the block scheme in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The "PARTICLE SAMPLING" is related to the Emission Process at the transmitter. During the emission process, particles are emitted from the particle transmitter according to the input signal , which modulates the particle concentration rate at the transmitter location:</p><p>(1)</p><p>According to the transmitter model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the modulation of the particle concentration rate does not follow any specific digital modulation scheme. The signal can be in general any continuous function of the time and the modulated particle concentration rate , output of the transmitter, is a function of . The particle sampling noise is expressed as . The effect of is an unwanted perturbation on the output of the emission process , which results in :</p><p>(2)</p><p>The particle sampling noise is generated by the "PARTICLE SAMPLING," which occurs when the particle concentration rate is being modulated through the emission of the particles. The noise effects arise from the discreteness of the particles that compose the particle concentration rate . The particle concentration rate in output from the emission process is caused by a particle flux between the transmitter and the external space. Given the discreteness of the particles, the particle concentration rate is sampled by the particles themselves, resulting in the particle concentration rate . Further details on the analysis for this type of noise are provided in Section III.</p><p>The "PARTICLE COUNTING" is related to the signal propagation due to the Diffusion Process. The signal contained in the particle concentration rate propagates due to the particle diffusion from the transmitter location to the receiver location. The particle concentration value , a measure of the particle concentration at the receiver location, is the output of the diffusion process:</p><p>(3)</p><p>According to the signal propagation model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the modulated particle concentration rate creates differences in particle concentration across the space . These differences cause a nonhomogeneous particle concentration inside the space which, due to the particle diffusion, causes variations in the particle concentration at the receiver location. The particle counting noise is expressed as . The effect of is an unwanted perturbation on the output of the diffusion process , which results in :</p><p>(4)</p><p>The particle counting noise occurs when the particle concentration value is being measured at the receiver location ("PARTICLE COUNTING"), and it is due to the randomness in the movement and to the discreteness of the particles. The particle concentration at the receiver location is computed by counting the number of particles present in the reception space. Fluctuations and imprecisions in counting the particles impair the proper computation of the concentration . The actual computed concentration differs from . The analysis for this type of noise is provided in Section IV.</p><p>During the Reception Process, the particle concentration at the receiver location is sensed by means of chemical receptors and an output signal is generated accordingly:</p><p>(5)</p><p>According to the analysis presented in this paper, the particle reception process at the receiver is not associated to diffusionbased noise sources. Other types of physical phenomena, which stem from the ligand-receptor kinetics of the chemical receptors, contribute as noise at the receiver. Due to the complexity of these phenomena and to their heterogeneity with respect to the present work, a thorough analysis of the noise sources in the reception process will be presented in a separate future work. The analysis of the noise sources results both in physical models and stochastic models. With the former we aim at the mathematical expression of the physical processes underlying the noise sources (Sections III-A and IV-A), while with the latter we model the noise source behaviors through the use of statistical parameters (Sections III-B and IV-B).</p><p>The physical models are expressed through the block schemes in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>, which expand in detail the blocks and from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, respectively. The particle sampling noise physical model is further detailed through ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, and (16), while the particle sampling noise physical model is detailed in (34), ( <ref type="formula">35</ref>), (37), (38), (39), (40), (41), and (42).</p><p>The stochastic models are analyzed in terms of random processes, such as in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">22</ref>) and (49), and their effects on the end-to-end model are expressed in terms of root mean square (RMS) perturbation of the noise on the signal, as in ( <ref type="formula">31</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">65</ref>). The RMS of the perturbation on the signal (which is or , respectively) corresponds to the square root of the average of the squared noise process :</p><p>where corresponds to or , respectively, and denotes the ensemble average operator. The stochastic noise modeling for the aforementioned noise sources is therefore focused on the proper determination of the statistical parameters of their perturbations in relation to the processes expressed by the physical models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE PARTICLE SAMPLING NOISE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Physical Model</head><p>The particle sampling noise affects the physical end-to-end model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> at the transmitter. When a signal has to be delivered through the physical end-to-end model, the transmitter modulates the particle concentration rate at the transmitter location according to the value of itself. The modulation of the particle concentration rate is achieved by means of the particle emission process, sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, which is based on the following assumptions:</p><p>‚Ä¢ The transmitter has a spherical boundary that divides the space in proximity of the transmitter into two areas: the inner area and the outer area. ‚Ä¢ The inner concentration is the concentration of particles lying in the inner area, whereas the outer concentration is the concentration of particles lying in the outer area.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The inner area and the outer area are spatially connected by means of emission gaps. An emission gap is an opening in the spherical boundary which allows particles to move through due to their diffusion. The size of an emission gap allows only one particle to pass through at each time in- stant. Whenever a particle is traversing the emission gap, its movement has only components along the radius of the spherical boundary. As a consequence, the movement of a particle through the emission gap can only be outward (from the inner area to the outer area) or inward (from the outer area to the inner area). The emission gaps are many and homogeneously distributed on the surface of the spherical boundary. The present noise analysis does not depend on their precise number. We believe it will be important to discuss the impact of the number of emission gaps on the end-to-end model in our future work. ‚Ä¢ Whenever there is a difference between the inner concentration and the outer concentration , a movement of particles is stimulated between the inner area and the outer area through the emission gaps.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The movement of particles between the inner area and the outer area causes a variation in the outer concentration, whose first time derivative is the particle concentration rate at the transmitter location . ‚Ä¢ Particles can be created/destroyed in the inner area in order to reach a desired inner concentration , with reference to the model of the particle emission process from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The creation/destruction of particles in the inner area is supposed to be ideally perfect and instantaneous. As a consequence, we do not account for the randomness that can derive from the creation/destruction of particles. We believe that this is a reasonable approximation that allows us to analyze the noise contributions coming only from the emission process. Further analysis can be conducted by specifying the processes involved in the creation/destruction of particles. As an example, the creation/destruction of particles could be realized through a cascade of chemical reactions or by the emptying/filling of particle reservoirs located in the inner area.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The transmitter is supposed to be able to adjust the inner concentration in order to obtain a particle concentration rate proportional to the signal (modulation of according to ).</p><p>Those assumptions are inspired by biochemistry principles related to the living cells and to the mechanisms in cell biosignaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. According to this, the spherical boundary is a simplification of the cell plasma membrane, which separates the interior of a cell from the outside environment. The emission gaps are inspired by the channels that permit the selective passage of molecules through the plasma membrane of a cell. As an example, the gated ion channels in the plasma membrane are openings that allow the passage of specific ion molecules between the interior of a cell and the outside environment and, amongst others, they serve for cell-to-cell communication purposes. As stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, those ion molecules, while traversing the gated ion channels, are driven by a force that is a sum of two terms. The first term of the force is a function of the difference between the inside and the outside concentration of the same molecules and it depends on the diffusion. The second term of the force is a function of an electrical potential and it is related to the electrostatic charge carried by the ion molecules. Since, according to our assumption, the particles in our system do not carry any electrostatic charge, when they traverse an emission gap they are driven only by the first term of the force. For this, the difference in the concentration of particles between the inner area and the outer area stimulates the driving force that permits their movement through the emission gaps either outward or inward, as explained above.</p><p>The model of the emission process provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> does not take into account the discrete nature of the particles when there is a flux between the inner area and the outer area of the spherical boundary. As a consequence, the relation between the input signal and the resulting particle concentration rate is a continuous function: <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where expresses the Emission Process block shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We have the additional following assumption for the particle emission process:</p><p>‚Ä¢ The particle flux between the inner area and the outer area of the spherical boundary is composed of discrete particles. As a result, the relation between the input signal and the resulting particle concentration rate, denoted by , is no longer a continuous function. The overall process that takes the input signal as input and returns as output is called "PARTICLE SAMPLING" and it is graphically sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The "PARTICLE SAMPLING" is composed of the Emission Process block and the particle sampling noise block , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. During the "PARTICLE SAM-PLING," single particles flowing between the inner area and the outer area contribute to the concentration rate with a value at discrete time instants . These discrete time instants are not equally spaced, due to the random nature of the particle movements between the inner area and the outer area. As a consequence, the resulting particle concentration rate is nonuniformly sampled at randomly spaced time instants , where it assumes values equal to , and it is zero for any other time instant: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where is a Dirac delta function. According to the Nyquist theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, since the time instants are randomly spaced, the continuous particle concentration rate can be reconstructed from the nonuniform sampled particle concentration rate if the bandwidth of is limited up to frequency  , where is the average interval between two consecutive samples of . As a consequence, given a fixed bandwidth for the system, the degradation caused by the particle sampling noise on the particle concentration rate, output from the transmitter depends on the average rate of the events of single particles flowing between the inner area and the outer area. This event rate corresponds to the particle concentration rate and the system bandwidth depends on the parameters defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This result is confirmed through the stochastic model of the particle sampling noise, outlined in Section III-B.</p><p>The "PARTICLE SAMPLING" physical model is represented though the block scheme shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. The signal is the input of the Emission Process block, whose output is the particle concentration rate . The physical model of the particle sampling noise takes as input the particle concentration rate that the emission process would produce in output in the absence of noise. The particle sampling noise is composed of a decision block and a nonuniform sampler, which have as input the transmitter kinetic state , and a divisor. The output of the particle sampling noise is the particle concentration rate affected by noise, namely, . The transmitter kinetic state , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, is a set composed by the location and the net velocity of each particle at time present in the surrounding of the transmitter spherical boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where is the number of particles in the system and varies as a function of the time . The net velocity is here defined as the nonisotropic component of a particle speed, in contrast to the Brownian motion in free space which has isotropic components. In order to realistically simulate the transmitter kinetic state , we consider two different contributions to the particle displacement, namely, the Brownian motion and the time integral of the particle net velocity from time instant to time instant . The time instant corresponds to the beginning of the emission process. The expression of the particle location is written as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where the Brownian motion components, namely, , and , are random variables with normal distribution, zero mean value and variance equal to , according to the expression of the Wiener process <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> along the versors of the Cartesian axes, namely, , and . is the diffusion coefficient and is the simulation time step and it depends on how the transmitter kinetic state is sampled during the physical model simulation. The smaller is the time step , the closer is the simulation to the real physical phenomenon of particle diffusion. The value of the time step defines the time resolution with which we model events concerning particles changing their space area. According to the Nyquist theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, if the value of the time step is smaller than , where is the bandwidth of the particle concentration rate , then we can have a perfect simulation of the sampling noise generation as it happens in reality. When the particle is located inside the inner area or the outer area, it is only subject to the Brownian motion. In these cases, the particle speed has only the isotropic components due to the Brownian motion in free space, and its net velocity is equal to zero. When the particle is traversing an emission gap, its movement can only be outward incase of positive rate or inward in case of negative rate along the radius of the spherical boundary. In order to quantify the particle net velocity , we consider that the particle concentration rate is given only by the contribution of the particles traversing the emission gaps. Given a particle concentration rate , the number of particles traversing the emission gaps in a unit time is given by the transmitter inner concentration in case of positive rate and by the transmitter outer concentration in case of negative rate , multiplied by their average velocity. When they traverse the emission gap, the particle average velocity corresponds to the net velocity . As a consequence, the particle net velocity is proportional to the particle concentration rate , divided by the transmitter inner concentration in case of positive rate , or divided by the transmitter outer concentration in case of negative rate :</p><p>if in inner or outer if in emission gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where is equal to 1 when condition is true and 0 otherwise. is the versor along the radius of the transmitter spherical boundary.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Stochastic Model</head><p>The particle sampling noise can also have another formulation, through statistical parameters, which is suitable when theoretical studies require an analytical expression of the noise. For this, the particle sampling noise is generated by a random process , whose contribution corresponds to the difference between the particle concentration rate affected by noise and the expected particle concentration rate , where denotes the ensemble average operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> The expected particle concentration rate corresponds to the time-continuous particle concentration rate that we would expect in the absence of the particle sampling noise: <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> In other words, is an unwanted perturbation on the particle concentration rate around its expected value due to the particle sampling noise. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, we show the main block scheme of "PARTICLE SAMPLING" when the stochastic model is applied for the particle sampling noise. The random process , as it is proved in the following, depends on the value of the particle concentration rate , output from the Emission Process block which receives the signal to be transmitted as input. The sum of the random process and the particle concentration rate is the particle concentration rate affected by the particle sampling noise, namely, . In order to properly model the random process , we consider the following assumptions:</p><p>‚Ä¢ The outer particle concentration at the transmitter increments/decrements its value whenever a single event concerning a particle changing its space area occurs. ‚Ä¢ The probability of having two simultaneous events concerning particles changing their space area is zero. In other words, it is unlikely to have two particles crossing the spherical boundary of the transmitter at the same exact time instant. With reference to the physical model of the particle sampling noise from Section III-A, this assumption translates into the statement: the probability of having two samples from the nonhomogeneous sampler at the same time instant is zero. In the equation, it becomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> This assumption is justified by the independency of the Brownian components in the movement of different particles in the space. This assumption directly translates into the property of orderliness for the outer particle concentration increments/decrements. The property of orderliness states that the probability that the difference between outer particle concentrations time apart from each other is higher than the contribution from a single particle, tends to zero as tends to zero: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where is defined through <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>‚Ä¢ An event concerning a particle changing its space area (passing through an emission gap) occurring after time is independent of any event of the same kind occurring before time . This assumption is justified by the property of the Wiener process underlying the particle Brownian motion of having independent increments. As stated in Section III, particles are subject only to the contribution of the Brownian motion when they are located inside the inner area or the outer area. An event concerning a particle passing through an emission gap takes place whenever a particle, due to the Brownian motion, reaches the location of an emission gap: If there is a nonzero particle concentration rate in the outer area, the particle traverses the emission gap with net velocity , given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In other words, given a particle concentration rate in the outer area, which controls the average rate of occurrence of an event of this kind, the statistics of the event is solely dependent on the Brownian motion of the particles. As a consequence, the distribution of the time interval between an event at time and another event at time is independent from the distribution of the time interval between an event at time and an event at time . The two distributions have the same expression from ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>): <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> where is the motion component along the versor at time is the diffusion coefficient and is positive. Equation ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) is valid also for the motion components and along the versors and , respectively. This implies that a particle motion from time is independent from any motion of the particle occurred before time . Being all the particles independent among each other, events concerning a change in the particle space area show the same independence. As a consequence, the events concerning particles changing their space area have the property of memorylessness.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The occurrence rate of events concerning particles changing their space area is proportional to the flux of the particles between the inner area and the outer area.</p><p>The flux of the particles is proportional to the expected particle concentration rate at the transmitter location .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Physical Model</head><p>The particle counting noise affects the physical end-to-end model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> at the signal propagation. When the particle concentration rate is being modulated at the transmitter location , the signal propagates until reaching the receiver location , where the particle concentration value is measured through the quantity . The propagation of the signal is achieved by means of the particle diffusion process, sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, which is based on the following assumptions:</p><p>‚Ä¢ The linear size of the transmitter (radius of the spherical boundary) is considered negligible with respect to the distance between the transmitter and the receiver.

Therefore, the measured particle concentration is considered equal to the true particle concentration at the receiver location :</p><p>(32) In the present analysis, we introduce the following assumptions:</p><p>‚Ä¢ The receptor space contains a discrete number of particles.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Particles may enter/leave the receptor space due to the diffusion process, even when the concentration at the receiver location is maintained at a constant value. As a result, the measured particle concentration suffers from two effects. The first effect is given by the quantization of the concentration measure due to a discrete number of particles inside the receptor space. The second effect is given by fluctuations in the concentration measure due to single events of particles entering/leaving the receptor space. The overall process that takes the particle concentration rate as input and returns as output is called "PARTICLE COUNTING" and it is graphically sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The "PARTICLE COUNTING" is composed of the Diffusion Process block and the particle counting noise block , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. During the "PARTICLE COUNTING" particles present inside the receptor space at time instant are counted, and their number is divided by the size of the receptor space :</p><p>(33)</p><p>where is a discrete integer number. The "PARTICLE COUNTING" physical model is represented though the block scheme shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>. The particle concentration rate is the input of the Diffusion Process block, whose output is the true particle concentration . The physical model of the particle counting noise takes as input true particle concentration that the diffusion process would produce in output in the absence of noise. The particle counting noise is composed of two branches, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>. The upper branch has a decision block and a nonuniform sampler, which have as input the receiver kinetic state , while the lower branch has a multiplier and rounder block and it takes as input the true particle concentration . The two branches are then added and the result is followed by  where is the number of particles in the system and varies as a function of the time .

The Stochastic Model</head><p>The particle counting noise, similarly to the particle sampling noise, can also have another formulation, through statistical parameters, which is suitable when theoretical studies require an analytical expression of the noise. Statistical parameters for the particle counting noise, such as the RMS value, are provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> without the definition of a complete stochastic model in terms of random processes. The derivation of these statistical parameters in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> stems from a formulation of the particle counting noise in terms of macroscopic thermodynamic fluctuations in the system, without accounting for a particle-by-particle analysis. In this paper, we detail the knowledge of the particle counting noise by providing a stochastic model of the noise source. This model is obtained by stemming from the physical model outlined in Section IV-A, where the system is modeled in a particle-by-particle fashion. As will be proved in the following, the statistical parameters computed through the stochastic model provided here are in agreement with those from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The particle counting noise is generated by a random process , whose contribution corresponds to the difference between the measured particle concentration and the expected particle concentration , where denotes the ensemble average operator:</p><p>(43)</p><p>The expected particle concentration corresponds to the true particle concentration that we would measure at the receiver in the absence of the particle counting noise:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(44)</formula><p>In other words, is an unwanted perturbation on the particle concentration measured at the receiver location around its expected value due to the particle counting noise.

The two distributions have the same expression from (36):</p><p>(48) This implies that the location of a particle is independent from the location of any other particle. As a consequence, the events concerning the location of particles in the space have the property of memorylessness. ‚Ä¢ The occurrence rate of particle location in the space is proportional to the particle concentration at the receiver location , equal to the expected true particle concentration .

The Particle Sampling</head><p>The simulations of the physical model for the particle sampling noise are computed by applying to the scheme in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> a sinusoidal signal in the particle concentration rate :</p><p>(66) where is the frequency of the sinusoid in hertz, is the value of the maximum particle concentration rate in particles m s , and is the simulation time index in milliseconds. The input of the physical model simulation is a sinusoidal particle concentration rate with frequency equal to 4 Hz and maximum particle concentration rate of 10 particles m s , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>. The radius of the transmitter spherical boundary is 1 m. The simulation runs for 1 s by steps of 1 ms. The output noisy particle concentration rate of the physical model simulation is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">14</ref>. During the simulation, particles are generated inside the transmitter spherical boundary at random locations whenever the particle concentration rate is positive. Particle deletion is randomly performed inside the transmitter spherical boundary whenever is negative. Through particle generation and particle deletion we control the number of particles in the system , which is a parameter of the transmitter kinetic state shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.

The final results in terms of particle concentration rate is achieved by applying <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. The particle sampling noise has two different effects on the sinusoidal signal, namely, signal sampling and signal amplitude distortion. Signal sampling is given by the nonhomogeneous sampling of the particle concentration rate in time, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">14</ref>. In nonhomogeneous sampling, samples are separated by a nonconstant time interval. Since in the simulations we apply a constant time step , for each time steps the contributions of samples which occur within are added. The signal amplitude distortion is given by the constant contribution that each particle gives to the concentration at the transmitter location, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, whenever a sample is generated by the nonhomogeneous sampling. Constant contributions in nonhomogeneous sampling cause sudden changes in the particle concentration rate value, which result in distortions of its amplitude.</p><p>The statistical likelihood test is applied in order to assess the stochastic model ability to capture the behavior of the physical processes which generate the noise. For this, we compute the likelihood, that is, the probability of the noisy data coming from the physical model simulation given the stochastic model of the particle sampling noise, as defined in Section III-B.

The Gaussian model, denoted by has the same expected value and the same variance as the particle sampling noise stochastic model. The likelihood formula is likelihood</p><p>where ranges from 0.1 to 10 particles m s for every time instant . The results in terms of Gaussian model likelihood are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref>. When the Gaussian model is applied, the likelihood shows higher values than when using the particle sampling stochastic model, but only at specific time instants. On average, the likelihood values shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref> are much lower than the values in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref> and this proves that the particle sampling stochastic model performs better than the Gaussian model.

The first effect is given by the quantization of the concentration measure by a discrete number of particles inside the receptor space. The second effect is given by fluctuations in the concentration measure due to single events of particles entering/leaving the receptor space. The latter is more accentuated for high values of the particle concentration. This behavior is a confirmation of the fact that the RMS value of the particle counting noise is proportional to the square root of the The statistical likelihood test is applied in order to assess the stochastic model ability to capture the behavior of the physical processes which generate the noise. For this, we compute the likelihood, that is, the probability of the noisy data coming from the physical model simulation given the stochastic model of the particle counting noise, as defined in Section IV-B. In order to evaluate the reliability of the particle counting stochastic model parameters in (52) and ( <ref type="formula">53</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">19</ref>, where it is clearly visible that the highest likelihood value corresponds, for every time instant , to the value of from (69), thus confirming that the best particle concentration model parameter is actually the particle concentration in input to the physical model of the particle counting noise.</p><p>This statistical likelihood test results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">19</ref> are compared to the results obtained through the use of a Gaussian model in place of the particle counting noise stochastic model. The Gaussian model, denoted has the same expected value and the same variance as the particle sampling noise stochastic model. The likelihood formula is likelihood (71) where ranges from 1 to 2000 particles m for every time instant and 1 m. The comparison between the Gaussian model likelihood and the particle counting stochastic model drives us to the same conclusions we had for the particle sampling noise. At specific time instants, the Gaussian model likelihood shows higher values than when using the particle counting stochastic model but, on average, the likelihood values shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">20</ref> are much lower than the values in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">19</ref>. This proves that the particle counting stochastic model performs better than the Gaussian model and it confirms the stochastic model ability to express the behavior of the physical processes underlying the particle counting noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we analyze the most relevant diffusion-based noise sources affecting MC. To date, little effort has been made to model the diffusion-based noise sources from the communication engineering perspective, while contributions from the biochemistry literature provide descriptions of some underlying physical processes. However, these contributions tend to focus on the explanation of natural phenomena and do not provide suitable models for MC engineering. The objective of this work is the analysis of the noise sources in diffusion-based MC using tools from signal processing, statistics and communication engineering, with reference to the diffusion-based MC system introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The particle sampling noise and the particle counting noise are identified in this paper as the most relevant diffusion-based noise sources affecting the MC physical end-to-end model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The analysis of the noise sources results both in physical models and stochastic models. With the former we aim at the mathematical expression of the physical processes underlying the noise sources, while with the latter we model the noise source behaviors through the use of statistical parameters. For both the two noise sources, the results of the physical models are summarized through block schemes, which expand the end-to-end physical model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The stochastic models of both the two noise sources result in their characterization in terms of random processes and in the analytical expression of the RMS perturbation of the noise on the information signal.</p><p>Simulations are shown to evaluate the capability of the stochastic models to express the diffusion-based noise sources represented by means of the physical models.</p><p>The results coming from this work will be used to have a better insight into the end-to-end diffusion-based MC, especially in terms of capacity and throughput. We believe that this paper provides a preliminary study on the noise affecting the end-to-end diffusion-based MC, and that further investigation on this topic is necessary.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
