<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The pharmaceutical industry is defined as a system of processes, operations, and organizations involved in the discovery, development, and production of drugs. The pharmaceutical supply chain network (PSCN) is a way through which pharmaceutical products with suitable quality are distributed at a suitable time and place to reach final customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. Accordingly, it is considered a global industry with a high impact on human life. Thus, disturbances in production or distribution can endanger the lives of humans by creating problems of access to drug items. The use of optimization tools in the PSCN domain has therefore remained a permanent interest for researchers and scientists <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2]</ref>. The growth of the drug market in the world over the past few years and the expansion of the range and variety of these products in the global market, together with the importance of its close association with human health, has led to an increase in the need to optimize the distribution methods of these products in order to reach consumers as easily as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Undoubtedly, one of the most important criteria for the advancement of the community is its state of health, which is directly linked to the timely and sufficient supply of crucial drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. The prediction of the need for drugs and the ordering of drugs to the necessary extent and at the time required is a basic principle of health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3]</ref>. The process of supplying and distributing drugs is not only affected by the functioning of an institution or organization, but to the smooth operation of a chain of organizations (the PSCN) that contribute to the efficiency of this process.</p><p>One of the most important segments of the drug distribution system is the distribution to pharmacies located in health centers (hospitals), since it is the pharmacy's responsibility to provide the necessary drugs for all the treatments in the health center. Henceforth, supply chain reliability is of great importance, related to the probability that the flow of products from supply points to demand points is less than the actual demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Furthermore, the problem that can impose many costs on the supply chain is the inadequacy of the various layers of the supply chain. The ability to perform the required tasks is defined under terms expressed as reliability. Thus, the importance and quality of reliability in the supply chain network design are highlighted <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In this regard, distribution performance indicates the effect of the displacement and the sphere of influence of manufactured products. Advancements in technical matters and management principles lead to improvements in load-displacement, speed, quality of service, operating costs, capacity utilization, and energy consumption. Multi-modal transportation is the most important branch in the economic system of the PSCN, given that most of the costs in the PSCN are related to the transportation system. In the PSCN, multi-modal transportation is one of the limiting factors in determining markets. Consequently, transportation plays a significant role in the product's benefits. In the PSCN, overall costs change by choosing different transportation modes; but in general, road transport reduces the total cost of the network, since there are no warehousing and storage costs in this type of transport and all costs are calculated along the exact route.</p><p>The multi-modal transportation system is not included in the PSCN problem in any papers and studies. Also, the reliability of the transportation system is important for the transportation of pharmaceutical products. Therefore, pharmaceutical items are of great importance for the successful performance of any health care system (such as pharmacies and hospitals) and any risk can instantly affect the entire PSCN. This problem can not only waste resources but also endanger the lives of patients due to lack of access to pharmaceutical products, which is considered for the first time in this network. In the examined problems, for example, in references <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, the problems of allocation-distribution, location-allocation-distribution, production-routing-inventory, productionrouting, and routing are considered simultaneously, but the problem of production-distributionpurchasing-ordering-inventory holding-allocation-routing in this paper is considered respectively. In this paper, we introduce a multi-period, multi-product and multi-level PSCN problem formulation to minimize both the total cost and the delivery time of pharmaceutical products and to maximize the reliability of the transportation systems and routings in the network. Moreover, a three-objective MINLP model with multi-modal transportation is extended.</p><p>Examination of uncertainty-related papers, for instance, in references <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> are considered a robust approach, a possibilistic-stochastic method, a probability strategy, and a fuzzy technique, but a new fuzzy-robust programming technique for the PSCN is considered for the first time in this work. Then, the model is extended employing robust fuzzy programming to assess the impacts of uncertainty in certain parameter values.</p><p>The methodology solutions of mathematical models in the investigated papers are considered exact methods and meta-heuristic algorithms. According to the NP-hard and the complexity of the presented model, exact methods are considered in small-sized problems. Then, it is practically impossible to solve them at a specified time and also their use along with many constraints in practice is not appropriate. Papers related to solving methods, the use of metaheuristic algorithms are considered. For example, in papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> have used meta-heuristic algorithms to solve the model. Further, to solve the proposed model in the large-sized problems several J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms including multi-objective social engineering optimization (MOSEO), multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA), multi-objective keshtel algorithm (MOKA), multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), and multi-objective firefly algorithm (MOFFA) algorithms are utilized and the outcomes are compared with each other. To summarize, the current paper demonstrates some concerns that cover the literature gaps and can be categorized as follows:</p><p> Integrating production, distribution, purchasing, inventory holding, ordering, allocation, and routing decisions in the PSCN problem for the first time according to the papers analyzed in the literature review,  Considering three objective functions focusing on total cost, time as the significant objective because of the significance to deliver some pharmaceutical amount of products within the shortest timeframe, and reliability of transportation systems and routes in the PSCN,  Considering uncertainty for the parameters related to order, transportation, purchase, and delivery costs and capacity of the warehouse, the distribution centers, and the vehicles,  Developing a novel robust fuzzy approach to manage uncertainty in PSCN parameters,  Formulating a linearization of the non-linear PSCN model,  Proposing multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms to reach fast high-quality solutions,  Providing several sensitivity analyses on the main parameters. The rest of the present paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses the literature review related to the PSCN, uncertainty, and metaheuristic algorithms; section 3 describes the problem as well as the mathematical formulation and assumptions of the developed model and fuzzy robust programming; section 4 introduces the proposed metaheuristic algorithms; section 5 provides quantitative analyses to evaluate the performance of the algorithms for a set of test problems with various complexities and sizes; section 6 reviews the main findings and managerial implications of the results; finally, the conclusions and suggestions for future studies are expressed in section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head><p>Over the recent years, along with the increasing significance in the industrial and academic sectors for the pharmaceutical supply chain, several general review papers have been published (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>). These review papers contain references to the available literature in the area, determine the observed research gaps, and propose future work paradigms and fields.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Problem definition and mathematical formulation</head><p>This paper considers a multi-period multi-product PSCN including several internal and foreign manufacturing centers, distribution centers (DCs), warehouses as well as pharmacies and hospital pharmacies as customers. Foreign manufacturing centers are considered due to the possible shortage of pharmaceutical products in the internal manufacturing centers. Pharmaceutical products from internal and foreign manufacturing centers are sent to the warehouses and DCs, from warehouses to DCs and customers and from DCs to customers via the multi-modal transportation system. This distribution is based on demands and orders of pharmaceutical products and routes specified between levels. Each vehicle can complete one route per period, and each customer can receive more than one delivery (vehicle) of pharmaceutical products at any period. Deliveries from the internal and foreign manufacturing centers to the warehouses and DCs, from warehouses to DCs and customers (i.e., pharmacies and pharmacies in hospital) and from DCs to customers are completed on specified routes and at different periods. Re-orders are possible in the supplying of customer demands (i.e., pharmacies and hospital pharmacies) from warehouses and DCs and to supply warehouse demands and DCs demands from internal and foreign manufacturing centers, but customers are prioritized depending on the costs faced by the re-order process. Each customer's demand to distribution centers and warehouses, each distribution center's demand and each warehouse's demand to manufacturing centers are allocated during the planning horizon. At each time period, only vehicles allocated to distribution centers, warehouses, and internal and foreign manufacturing centers at that time can deliver pharmaceutical products to those customers, distribution centers and warehouses. There are no routes between internal and foreign manufacturing centers. The transportation cost of pharmaceutical products is variable and multi-modal transportation systems are considered. Pharmaceutical products may be transported by plane when there are airports at the corresponding PSCN nodes, or by road elsewhere. As a general assumption, the delivery of pharmaceutical products from foreign manufacturing centers will only be possible by plane. On the other hand, to save on delivery costs, batch deliveries are considered. Travel times from internal and foreign manufacturing centers to warehouses and DCs, from DCs and warehouses to customers (i.e., pharmacies and pharmacies in hospital) and between customers on the different specified routes are considered. In the DCs, the cost of packaging and preparation of orders is considered. Capacity limitations are also considered for internal and foreign manufacturing centers, warehouses, and DCs. The formulation also takes into account the reliability rate of the multi-modal transportation system and the specified routes. The structure of the presented PSCN containing internal and foreign manufacturing centers, warehouses, DCs, and customers is indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.        </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Trapezoidal fuzzy programming technique</head><p>This section presents several fuzzy models, including chance constraint fuzzy programming, to tackle uncertainty in the parameters of the constraints and objective functions described above. This approach is based on the existence of ambiguity and vagueness in the objective function and constraints. The consideration of uncertainty in mathematical models uses different fuzzy number patterns like the triangular and the trapezoidal formulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. The trapezoidal approach can be used to display the basic fuzzy programming model and the exigency measure to control the degree of constraint satisfaction. The basic mathematical model is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">  1 TFP y x Z     1 min (78a) y x Z     2 min (78b) y x Z     3 max (78c) 𝑠. 𝑡. l i x i i ,..., 1 ,      (78d) n i x i i ,..., 1 ,      (78e) m i y x i i ,..., 1     (78f) . 0 ,  y x (78g)</formula><p>Suppose vector  (transportation and purchase costs) and  , (capacity of the warehouses, the distribution centers, and the vehicles) are the uncertain parameters of the model. Furthermore, to create its fuzzy programming model and to cope with the uncertain parameters, exigency measure and the required value are used in the constraints and objective functions, respectively. Therefore, the exigency measure is utilized to transform fuzzy chance constraints against their equivalent crisp ones. In addition, Eq. (79) shows the membership function of a trapezoidal fuzzy member,  ~, by four sensitive spots (i.e.  Furthermore, all the trapezoidal fuzzy parameters are examined by the fuzzy programming as described in the following equations (80a-80g):</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">        o ro rp p     , ,<label>,</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">  2 TFP y x Z t     min 1 (80a) y x Z     2 min (80b) y x Z     3 max (80c) 𝑠. 𝑡.   l i x TRA k i i ,..., 1 ,        (80d)   n i x TRA K i i ,..., 1 , ~       (80e)   m i y x TRA K i i ,..., 1        (80f) . 0 ,  y x (80g)</formula><p>This implies that the constraints of uncertain parameters should be satisfied with a compliance level of at least K  .

In the present paper, we propose several algorithms including MOSEO, MOSA, MOKA, MOPSO, and MOFFA algorithms for solving the designed PSCN. Since our formulation consists of a three-objective optimization model, we first outline the multi-objective optimization framework. Afterward, the solution representation of the presented model is investigated by the metaheuristic algorithms.</p></div>

The allocation variables containing the assignment of the warehouses to the DCs ( ) by different routes are illustrated in Figures <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">4</ref>. From Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the twelve warehouses are assigned to four DCs by rounding the numbers. For instance, the warehouses containing 𝑤 2 , 𝑤 5 , 𝑤 9 , and 𝑤 11 are allocated to DC 𝑑 1 . From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">4</ref>, the nine internal and foreign manufacturing centers are assigned to three DCs again by rounding the numbers. For instance, the internal and foreign manufacturing centers containing 𝑚 3 , 𝑚′  To represent the distribution, production, and ordering of the manufacturing centers in each time period, the used the number of pharmaceutical products for each manufacturing center in each warehouse, DC, and customer should be investigated first. This is achieved by means of an array with the length of 𝜌 for the number of pharmaceutical products. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">5</ref> shows an example with ten manufacturing centers. The numbers to determine the production, distribution, and ordering of the pharmaceutical products are sorted in ascending order. Then, according to the maximum desired number of distribution centers, manufacturing centers and warehouses, and according to the capacities of warehouses, DCs, and manufacturing centers, the different pharmaceutical products are allocated to them.  In addition, to design the delivery routes for each time period, the utilized vehicles allocated to each manufacturing center, warehouse, DC, and customer should be chosen first. The method uses an array of the same length as 𝑉. A uniform distribution of 𝑈(0, 𝑣&amp;𝑣 𝐴 ) is performed to create the initial values for 𝑅𝑣 and 𝑅𝑣 𝐴 , where 𝑣&amp;𝑣 𝐴 are the vehicle types. Then, by rounding the created numbers, the type of vehicles per manufacturing center is specified. This method is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">6</ref>, where manufacturing centers, 𝑉 1 , 𝑉 2 , 𝑉 4 , and 𝑉 6 are allocated to the first type of vehicle, and 𝑉 3 and 𝑉 5 to the second one.   </p></div>

The SEO algorithm was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, inspired by the rules of social engineering as an emerging phenomenon in today's real world. The algorithm starts with two random solutions called the attacker and the defender. Also, search phases are based on the rules of social engineering in which the attacker uses certain techniques to achieve his desired goals. In this section, we first introduce the concepts of social engineering and then describe the method inspired by this phenomenon with the description and steps related to it.</p><p>In the proposed method, each solution expressing each individual and his characteristics, including her/his abilities in mathematics, sports, business, etc., corresponds to the variables of the problem. As mentioned earlier, this algorithm starts with two random solutions, with the better solution called the attacker and the other the defender. Therefore, in order to simulate the learner's training and retraining from the attacker to the defender, a series of random tests are defined for each attribute in which the attacker tests an attribute of the defender, the amount of learning is calculated and the new defender has the highest re-training rate if there is a replacement for the current defender. Further, attacks from the defender are carried out according to the techniques that are available to him. During these actions, the defender is transferred to the attacker's points in order to respond to the attacks and the defender is assessed and this process is repeated until the end of the strike, and if the defender is more valuable than the attacker, they are replaced by each other and a new defender is generated to restart the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof procedure. In this algorithm, like other metaheuristic algorithms, different phases of the search are considered. Also, training and retraining of the defender and the attacker from each other forms a local search in the algorithm. Additionally, the attacker's attacks on the defender and the response to that focus phase are formed, and eventually, the choice of the new defender will correspond to the phase of diversity for this algorithm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm</head><p>The simulated annealing (SA) algorithm for optimization problems was introduced first by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. Contrary to gradient-based methods and other exact search methods, whose main drawback is the local optimum traps, the main advantage of the SA algorithm is in its ability to avoid getting trapped in local optimal solutions. The SA algorithm is a search method based on a Markov chain, which converges the transfer probability function in appropriate conditions. This approach not only accepts changes that improve the target function, but it also accepts even some of the changes that do not improve, with a specific probability, in order to not to fall into local traps. The probability of accepting such solutions is dependent on the temperature parameter. For example, in minimization problems, not only any move or change that reduces the value of the objective function will be accepted, but changes that increase the value of the objective function have a certain probability of being accepted.

In this algorithm, each of one member of the group of fireflies moves to a point where his/her best personal experience has taken place. This algorithm is inspired by studies and observations on fireflies. These studies have shown that fireflies are social insects that live in colonies. One of the most important and interesting behaviors about fireflies is their ability to find food and especially how to find the shortest route between food and nest. This kind of behavior of fireflies is supported by a kind of mass intelligence that has recently been considered by scientists. At this point, it is important to clarify the difference between mass intelligence (colony) and social intelligence. In social intelligence, elements have a degree of intelligence. In mass intelligence, elements have random behavior, and there is no direct relationship between them, and they only interact with each other indirectly and using signs.

Also, utilizing the Taguchi approach, the proper factors (primary parameters) were defined and the level of each factor was chosen. Hence, the design of the test was determined and the best combination of factors for the MOSEO, MOSA, MOKA, MOPSO, and MOFFA algorithms was defined. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_39">6</ref>, the value of the primary parameters used in the MOSEO, MOSA, MOKA, MOPSO, and MOFFA algorithms is shown. Then, each test was repeated 10 times per run, and the value of the objective function was recorded for each one of them. According to the number of parameters and their levels, there should be 5^4 trials for MOSEO, 5^2 trials for MOSA, 5^5 trials for MOKA, 5^6 trials for MOPSO, 5^7 trials for MOFFA which is 625, 25, 3125, 15625, and 87125 respectively, which adds up to a very high number.

The computational time required by the metaheuristic procedures is minimum for the multi-objective firefly algorithm and maximum for the multi-objective simulated annealing.</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">Trial A B C D E F 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 1 1 1 1 3 3</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Comparison of proposed multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms</head><p>In this section, we present a comparative analysis of the performance and effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms according to four evaluation metrics. These metrics are the assessment indicators of the Pareto optimum sets i.e., SNS, NPS, MS, and MID per proposed problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>. The outputs were averaged for a set of 25 runs, and the run times are in the same range for each problem size. The outputs are shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_43">11</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_44">12</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_0">13</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_36">14</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">19</ref> shows an example of the non-dominated solutions for instance LP4. This figure shows that there are several significant similarities between the presented metaheuristic algorithms, particularly between MOKA and MOPSO. According to this figure, MOSEO and MOSA show the worst performance and effectiveness between the proposed metaheuristic algorithms, whereas MOFFA dominates over the other algorithms. Besides, MOFFA achieves an area with the lowest delivery time and total cost and highest reliability of transportation systems. Generally, the rest of the proposed algorithms' solutions are close to each other.   Furthermore, to determine the best metaheuristic, we conducted a set of statistical comparisons between algorithms according to the Pareto optimum analyses. We did this by transforming, the outputs presented in Tables <ref type="table">8</ref> Min based on the nature of metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53]</ref>. It is clear that a lower value of RDI indicates a higher quality of the algorithm. As a result, we obtained the means plot and Least Significant Difference (LSD) for the proposed metaheuristic algorithms.</p><p>The mixed efficiency analysis by comparison of the metaheuristic algorithms is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">20</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">20</ref>(a), based on NPS, although MOFFA indicates the most reliable solution's quality, its performance range is rather wide. However, the other graphs show a robust behavior of MOFFA, whereas the quality of MOSEO shows a weak efficiency. <ref type="bibr">Figure 20(b)</ref> shows that MOFFA has a better robust behavior compared to other proposed algorithms in the MID metric. According to this figure, MOFFA demonstrates the best efficiency and the most confident outcome. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">20</ref> (c), MOSA has the weakest result in terms of the MS metric, while MOKA demonstrates a robust behavior and MOFFA shows the best efficiency. Finally, the results based on the SNS metric in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">20(d)</ref> show that MOFFA has the best efficiency and demonstrates better quality. Likewise, the quality of MOPSO is nearby to MOKA. Besides, MOSEO demonstrates a confident form of proposed metaheuristic algorithms, while MOSA is the worst algorithm according to the SNS metric. As an overall result, the above-mentioned metrics indicate that MOFFA guarantees better quality and performance than the other proposed metaheuristic algorithms. </p></div>

Since the MOFFA algorithm proved to be the most effective one in the comparisons, we used it for this sensitivity analysis, applied to the large-sized experimental problem LP3. The results of each test include the value of the total cost (𝑇𝐶), the delivery time (𝐷𝑇), and the reliability (𝑅).</p><p>The first experiment considers modifications in the parameter of the fixed cost of internal and foreign manufacturing centers </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and managerial insights</head><p>Generally, a PSCN model aims to optimize the production, distribution, allocation, location, ordering, routing, inventory, and transportation of pharmaceutical products utilizing multi-modal Journal Pre-proof main parameters contained in the present paper are important elements for investigation in practice, notwithstanding the fact that other parameters of equivalent importance could also be determined with further study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and future studies</head><p>In this paper, we have developed a comprehensive multi-period, multi-echelon, and multi-product MINLP model for a PSCN problem with considering multi-modal transportation under uncertainty. The second innovation contained in this paper is the development of a new robust fuzzy programming technique to investigate the effects and efficiency of uncertainty input parameters related to transportation cost, purchase cost, and capacity of the warehouses, distribution centers, and vehicles. Also, this extensive implementation of uncertainty in the parameters in our model makes it more realistic and closer to the real world. Nevertheless, there exist other different approaches and methods for coping with uncertain parameters in supply chain problems. The determination of how efficient each one of these approaches and methods may be requires a detailed comparison based on real case studies that could be suggested as one possible direction for future research.</p><p>With respect to our PSCN problem, exact algorithms are able to find the exact solution, but their solving time increases significantly with the size of the problem. Also, they are directly not applicable to large-size problems: some practical-size problems are so large that their optimal solution cannot be achieved within a reasonable timeframe. For this reason, near-optimal solutions can be found, in a way that their quality is acceptable and can be achieved with relatively low computational cost. Several approaches, including meta-heuristic algorithms, have been proposed to design acceptable solutions, and meta-heuristic algorithms including MOSEO, MOSA, MOKA, MOPSO, and MOFFA are used in this paper. The proposed metaheuristic algorithms were tuned through Taguchi's method and compared with GAMS and CPLEX in the small-scale problems, and their capabilities and performances were tested for large-scale problems. The results indicated that MOFFA was able to find an acceptable solution efficiently for a PSCN problem, and its required CPU time was considerably less than that of other algorithms for large-scale problem samples. To validate the presented model and methodology solutions, we also performed several sensitivity analyses on the main parameters.</p><p>Our work represents a step forward in the planning of pharmaceutical supply chains, covering the research gaps left by the most recent references on the subject. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> considers only capacities and network flows, within a deterministic framework. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, on the other hand, covers only stores and customers, and while uncertainty is included in the analysis only a decomposition approach is used to find the solution. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> only provides MILP solutions to a small-scale example taking into account only the pharmacy-hospital echelon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> deals with location and inventory issues and incorporates uncertainty with the subsequent sensitivity analyses, but the objective function is limited to cost. In one of the two approaches most similar to ours, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> takes into account procurement, production and distribution in a multi-objective approach with uncertainty, but the results are limited to the MILP solution for a small example, with no sensitivity analysis provided. The other one <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> compares three metaheuristic algorithms to solve the problem, but the only consideration of uncertainty is the use of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to express demand.</p><p>Besides the proposed meta-heuristic algorithms, other algorithms, such as neural networks, colony optimization, whale optimization, imperial competitive optimization algorithms, etc. could be used for comparison in PSCN optimization. Also, there are many problems such as sustainability, pricing, and regulations, etc. or other uncertainty approaches such as stochastic, probability, possibilistic, etc. that can be incorporated to improve the model and solution methodologies in future studies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .vt</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

In a similar procedure to other meta-heuristic algorithms, the KA begins with an initial population called 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙. 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 descend into the lake to find a good solution. A 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙 that finds the best food for the first time is called Lucky 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙 (LK). The Lucky 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙 searches to find more food, and also for attracting adjoining 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠. In addition, if a better food is found around a Lucky 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙, it and its adjoining 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 are rotated around the new and better source. Also, after eating food in that area, Lucky 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 and their adjoining 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 are identified and moved to a different location. After some time, Lucky 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 will remain in the lake in their hope to find food <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref>. Some of them go to places where no 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙 has ever been. Also, some others who do not have the hope of finding food fly into other lakes. Inversely, some new 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 will land in the lake.</p><p>In the algorithm, the 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙 location corresponds to a solution of the problem. The better food represents less cost in the minimization objective function or the maximum solution in the maximization objective function. The 𝐾𝐴 has two phases, namely intensification and diversification. In the intensification phase, Lucky 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 absorb adjoining 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 and rotate around the food source. In reality, in the intensification phase, the algorithm moves towards the local (or global) optimum. In the diversification phase, some 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠 move inside the lake to find intact places (solutions), and some other Keshtels go to other lakes and are replaced with new 𝐾𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑠.</p><p>For more information about the MOKA algorithm, the reader can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. The pseudo-code of the KA algorithm is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm</head><p>The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. It models and simulates the behavior of birds flying in a group or fish swimming in a school. Each member in this group is defined by its velocity vector and position vector in the search space. In each iteration, the new particle position is defined according to the vector of velocity and position vector in the search space. Also, the new particle position is updated according to the current velocity vector, the best position found by that particle, and the best position ever found by any particle in the group. For more information about the MOPSO algorithm, the reader can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> displays the pseudo-code of the MOPSO algorithm.  </p></div>

In many cases, although, and perhaps specifically in European countries where the management of PSCN is of specific concern, PSCN management is failing to deliver satisfactorily all the required decision support. In this regard, all the logistics factors included in the PSCN need to be carefully analyzed. This includes the following:  Allocations of internal and foreign manufacturing centers to warehouses, DCs, and customers, of the warehouses to the DCs and customers and the DCs to customers in the different routes.  Reliability of the transportation systems.  The existing costs such as tariff, transportation, ordering, purchasing, inventory holding, penalty, packaging, delivery, and stock keeping. The purpose of this paper is to extend an integrated structure for a PSCN optimization that is efficient. Efficiency needs a multi-objective optimization process that accommodates all production, distribution, ordering, allocation, transportation, purchasing, delivery, routing, and reliability decisions across a presented PSCN with intermediate facilities as well as an algorithm to better solve this complex problem that is computationally manageable and robust.</p><p>As a result, we have focused on the PSCN optimization with multi-objectives and complex constraints. According to the assumptions of multi-modal transportation, reliability of transportation systems, the delivery time of pharmaceutical products, tariff costs, and uncertainty of input parameters, we have provided a new complex PSCN formulation. This includes a MINLP model to solve small instances of the problem and five multi-objective metaheuristics algorithms. Moreover, due to the natural uncertainty of input parameters, we have developed a new robust-fuzzy procedure. Thus, the paper contains objective functions that accommodate the full domain of uncertainty for the optimization of the PSCN. The performance of the suggested multi-objective algorithms, particularly MOFFA, is promising for the specific problem considered here and also in terms of its successful application to similar supply chain problems.</p><p>Whereas the initial aim of our work was to extend an integrated network for a PSCN optimization that is efficient, some insights into the reliability of the PSCN have also emerged. The problem description as a multi-level, multi-product, and multi-period formulation makes the model more realistic. One important insight is that the conceptual alternation from supply chain management to PSCN requires a feasible solution to achieve better designs of pharmaceutical networks within a pharmaceutical supply chain. Our work shows that the incorporation of reliability issues through the use of multi-modal transportation, production, distribution, ordering, delivery, inventory holding, purchasing, transportation, allocation of pharmaceutical products during various period times, analyzing the biological instances in the manufacturing centers to update the pharmaceutical products records, generates the robust potential for added value across all pharmaceutical industries to cover the satisfaction of patients.</p><p>Other practical insights are related to the sensitivity analysis of the objective functions with changes in key parameters, as shown in Figures <ref type="figure">21</ref><ref type="figure">22</ref><ref type="figure">23</ref>. Specifically, the reduction of the total costs and delivery times of pharmaceutical products as well as the increase of the reliability of the transportation system and routes in the network indicated in Figures 21-23 calls for further attention. Intrinsically, analyzing the different proposed multi-objective algorithms by utilizing the SNS, MS, NPS and MID evaluation metrics of the Pareto frontier emphasize that MOFFA is typically more reliable than the other proposed metaheuristics, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">20</ref>.</p><p>Eventually, the fact that such pragmatic insights are possible when a more reliable PSCN is investigated forcefully encourages the further development and application of high-proficiency algorithms, such as MOFFA. The potential utility of an integrated structure of PSCN for transportation, production, distribution, ordering, delivery, inventory holding, purchasing, transportation, and allocation of the pharmaceutical products for more efficient decision-making is demonstrably high. The  Integrating production, distribution, purchasing, inventory holding, ordering, allocation, and routing decisions in the PSCN problem for the first time according to the papers analyzed in the literature review,  Considering three objective functions focusing on total cost, time as the significant objective because of the significance to deliver some pharmaceutical amount of products within the shortest timeframe, and reliability of transportation systems and routes in the PSCN,  Considering uncertainty for the parameters related to order, transportation, purchase, and delivery costs and capacity of the warehouse, the distribution centers, and the vehicles,  Developing a novel robust fuzzy approach to manage uncertainty in PSCN parameters,  Proposing multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms to reach fast high-quality solutions,  Providing several sensitivity analyses on the main parameters.
