<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In wireless sensor networks, time division multiple access (TDMA)-based MAC can potentially reduce the delay and provide real-time guarantees as well as save power by eliminating collisions. In this kind of MAC, a common energy-saving strategy is to allow the sensors to turn their radio off when not engaged. However, too much state transitions between the active and sleep modes would also waste energy. In order to save this part of energy and further improve the time performance, a multi-objective TDMA scheduling problem for many-to-one sensor networks is presented. An effective optimization framework is then proposed, where genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are hybridized to enhance the searching ability. Simulation results with different network sizes are given. Three algorithms are used for comparisons, which are PSO algorithm, max degree first coloring algorithm and node based scheduling algorithm. It is shown that the proposed hybrid algorithm is superior over these three algorithms on a specified objective, which can be the total time or the total energy for data collection. In addition, the results reveal that the proposed optimization framework can flexibly deal with a multi-objective optimization problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Large-scale networks of wireless sensors are becoming an active topic of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> due to their potential usage in defense, pervasive commercial, and scientific applications. In such networks, sensors are units with sensing, processing, and wireless networking capability. They can automatically collect the information and report the measurements to an access point. Up to now, many wireless sensor networks have been designed and deployed for kinds of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Although the promising applications enabled by wireless sensor networks are very attractive, there are many system challenges to resolve. First of all, energy is an essential problem since sensors are usually battery-powered. Second, in some emergency applications, a short time of data collection is also required. Towards such a data gathering sensor networks, TDMA is a good choice to satisfy the above requirements. First, TDMA can save energy by eliminating collisions, avoiding idle listening, or entering inactive states until their allocated time slots. Second, as a collision-free access method, TDMA can bound the delays of packets, guarantees reliable communication.</p><p>In sensor networks for data collection, the major challenge in adopting TDMA MAC is to allocate time slots for each pair of neighboring nodes, where the time and the energy consumption are considered. In this area, many works have been done. Some researchers have discussed the energy saving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for TDMA scheduling. Pei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> combined passive clustering and TDMA to dramatically reduce the power consumption of large wire-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> saved energy by minimizing the number of state transitions between active and sleep modes, where tabu search based technique was used.</p><p>In time aspect of TDMA scheduling, some references have studied how to minimize packet delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, how to improve fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, how to maximize parallel operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and how to shorten the total slots to finish a set of transmission tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> etc. By setting up a convex optimization model, Cui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> adopted relaxation methods to solve the problem, and got a pareto optimal energy-delay curves, where the power consumption on switching was neglected. Sridharan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> developed a linear programming formulation and presented a distributed solution, which outperformed random MAC in terms of fairness and delay etc. Kalyan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> used PSO algorithm to minimize the overall transaction time, which was modeled as a graph partitioning problem. To the similar problem, Gandham et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed a distributed edge-coloring algorithm. In order to save time for data collection, Ergen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed three algorithms based on coloring method in graph theory. However, these three references did not consider the energy saving problem in sensor networks.</p><p>Compare with the above works, we present a new multiobjective optimization framework for slot scheduling in many-to-one sensor networks, inspired by the scheduling model in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Two population based stochastic optimization techniques, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), are hybridized for searching the optimal solution. The desired objectives are to minimize the total time for collecting a set of data and to save the energy consumed on switching between the active and sleep states.</p><p>The main contributions of our work include: (1) we present a general optimization framework for TDMA scheduling in many-to-one sensor networks, which can optimize a number of targets. (2) we solve the TDMA scheduling problem by using a problem-specific hybrid algorithm including PSO and GA, which possesses a good searching ability to find the optimal slot allocation scheme.</p><p>The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: the problem statement is introduced in section 2. Section 3 describes the optimization framework, coding method and fitness function. The hybrid algorithm is described in Section 4 in details. In section 5, the computational results are given. Some concluding remarks are made in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Problem statement</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Network model and scheduling model</head><p>In this paper, we assume the sensor network is static. Access point is assumed to hold the information of network topology and the interference relationship, thus it can perform the slot assignment and then send it back to nodes in network.</p><p>From a network point of view, a sensor network can be represented by an undirected graph G = (V, E), where V represents the set of all sensors in the network and E Ì V • V represents the set of communication links between a pair of nodes. There is one access point (AP) in V. All traffic generated at sensors is destined for AP, thus a routing tree is formed. Such a network is called many-toone sensor network.</p><p>The distance d(i, j) between nodes i and j is defined as the minimum number of edges to go from one to the other. From this definition, the topology of the sensor network can be described by an N * N symmetric connectivity matrix C, which is defined as C ij = 1, if d(i, j) = 1; else C ij = 0. In addition, the conflict relationship in the network can be described by an interference matrix I N•N , where if d(i, j) 6 2, I ij = 1; else I ij = 0. As a result, node i and j can transmit in the same time if the communication distance d(i, j) is larger than 2.</p><p>In TDMA scheduling problem, time is split into equal intervals called time slots. Each time slot is designed to accommodate a single packet to be transmitted and received between pairs of nodes in the network. A basic principle of TDMA scheduling is to assign time slots to nodes so that collisions would not happen when they are transmitting packets.</p><p>In many-to-one sensor networks, as the sensor data are flowing toward AP, the TDMA scheduling problem may be formulated as followed. There is a set of sensor data packets which plan to transmit to AP over the routing tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Each data collection process that a packet flows to AP from its source node is called a task. According to the corresponding route, each task consists of a sequence of transmission actions called subtasks, where one subtask needs one slot occupation. The aim of the problem is thus to determine a sequence of the subtasks and the corresponding slots so that collisions would not happen, and some optimization criteria would be satisfied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Optimization objective description</head><p>Two optimization objectives are considered in this paper. The first one is to minimize the energy consumption, the other is to shorten the total time that is needed to finish a set of tasks.</p><p>In order to save energy, a common idea is just to switch off the radio when it is neither transmitting nor receiving. However, frequently turning off/on the radio also waste large amounts of power <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Hence, we take this part of energy into account, which is ignored in many TDMA researches. According to Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the energy consumption formula of a network is followed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">EC ¼ X N i¼1 ½P tx i Ã ðt tx i þ t sÀtx i Þ þ P rx i Ã ðt rx i þ t sÀrx i Þ</formula><p>where N denotes the number of nodes in the network,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P tx=rx i</formula><p>is the power consumption of transmitter/receiver at node i.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">t tx=rx i</formula><p>is the total work time of the transmitter/receiver at node i.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t sÀtx=rx i</formula><p>is the total transition time consumed between the sleep and active states.</p><p>As a performance metric, the total time is counted as the number of time slots. This metric should be as small as possible, since the less total time it takes, the faster the collection rate for a set of data is.</p><p>In the domain of multi-objective optimization, a common way is to transform the problem to a mono-objective one by combining those objectives into a weighted sum. Consequently we take the weighted sum of the two objectives in our problem as the objective function, shown as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min F ðsÞ ¼ a Ã EC þ ð1 À aÞ Ã Totlslots<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where s means a TDMA schedule. EC is the total energy consumption of the network, TotlSlots is the total number of the time slot under the schedule, a is a tradeoff factor between these two objectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Optimization framework for TDMA scheduling</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Optimization framework</head><p>In many-to-one sensor networks, assigning time slots for sensors to finish a couple of data collection tasks is an NP problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Furthermore, the energy constraints make this problem more difficult. As two stochastic optimization techniques, genetic algorithm and particles swarm optimization have been successfully applied to many NP-hard problems and many multi-objective problems, such as travelling salesman problems, multi-processor task scheduling etc. Thus we propose to apply them to the slot scheduling problem and present an optimization framework, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, one problem solution is encoded to one sequence code, namely individual. By this way an initial population including a number of individuals can be generated. Then this population evolves according to the hybrid algorithm of PSO and GA, where the fitness function provides the evolution direction. Finally a best individual can be found and decoded to an optimal TDMA scheduling solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Encoding and decoding</head><p>Encoding is a key step to use evolutionary algorithm. The aim is to represent a solution by a sequence code, which is an individual in population-based algorithms.</p><p>According to the scheduling problem description in Section 2.1, a data collection task can be divided into several hops called subtasks in sequence. Hence, a set of data collection tasks can be seen as a combination of all the subtasks.</p><p>Therefore, we first denote a subtask as (TaskID, Hop-No.), where the TaskID points out which task the subtask belongs to, the HopNo. gives the sequence number of this subtask in all the subtasks of task TaskID. For example, if task 1 includes 2 hops, then the two corresponding subtasks can be denoted as (1, 0) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1)</ref>. Observing this representation method, we take the TaskIDs out of a subtask sequence to form an individual.</p><p>To explain the above encoding approach, we give an example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. In this example there are two tasks, i.e., transmitting a packet from node 0 to AP and a packet from node 1 to AP. According to their routes, each task contains 4 subtasks, i.e., (0, 0)(0, 1)(0, 2)(0, 3) and (1, 0)(1, 1)(1, 2)(1, 3), respectively. There is a random combination of above subtasks, such as, ð0; 0Þð1; 0Þð0; 1Þð0; 2Þð0; 3Þð1; 1Þð1; 2Þð1; 3Þ then taking the TaskIDs out, the above sequence can be encoded as follow: 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Optimization framework of hybrid algorithm. To summarize the above process, the encoding rule is as follows. Given N tasks and each task i includes M i hops, an individual is a sequence composed of all the task ID numbers from 0 to N À 1, where each task number i appears for M i times. Obviously, the length of the individual is P N À1 i¼0 M i . According to this rule, an individual can be generated at random.</p><p>The decoding method of an individual is as follows. First, an individual is transformed to a sequence of subtasks. Then, from the first subtask to the last one we assign slots by sequence, at the same time, trying to assign those subtasks to one slot without rousing collisions. Take an individual from the above example network, i.e., 0 0 0 1 1 1 1, the corresponding sequence of subtasks is (0, 0)(0, 1)(0, 2)(0, 3)(1, 0)(1, 1)(1, 2)(1, 3). Then the slot allocation scheme is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.</p><p>From the decoding scheme, it can be seen that an individual can finally be decoded to a slot scheduling, which allows parallel operations. The mapping between an individual and a TDMA scheduling solution is now completely set up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Fitness function</head><p>During the evolution process, fitness is used as the performance evaluation of individual of population in both PSO and GA algorithms. Usually the selection of fitness function depends on the optimization goals. In this paper, we directly take the objective function in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">1</ref>) as the fitness function, i.e., FitðiÞ ¼ F ðsÞ ¼ a Ã EC þ ð1 À aÞ Ã TotlSlots where i represents an individual of the evolution algorithms, the schedule s is decoded from the individual i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Hybrid algorithm</head><p>Some hybrid algorithms of GA and PSO have been used for different optimization problems in other areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> [13] <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In TDMA scheduling problem, the main motivation of our hybrid algorithm is as follows. In the above TDMA scheduling problem which is in discrete domain, although PSO can generate a good population close to the optimal position, the real space operation make the particles keep distance with the discrete optimal solution. Therefore, using a good population generated by PSO, we adopt GA to get closer to the optimal solution as GA is good at solving discrete problems. Additionally, as both are population based algorithms, they can be combined seamlessly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Description of PSO part</head><p>Particle swarm optimization(PSO) is a new swarm intelligence technique proposed by Eberhart and Kennedy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling.</p><p>The main idea of PSO is as follows. There is a population of random solutions. Each potential solutions, called particles, fly through the problem space by following the current optimum particles. Flying in the search space, each particle has a velocity which is dynamically adjusted according to the experiences of its own and its colleagues, this makes the swarm have an intelligent ability of flying towards the optimal position.</p><p>The global model equations of PSO is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">V id ¼ W Ã V id þ C 1 Ã RandðÞ Ã ðp id À X id Þ þ C 2 Ã randðÞ Ã ðp gd À X id Þ ð<label>2Þ</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">X id ¼ X id þ V id<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where V id and X id are the velocity and position of particle i, respectively. p id and p gd represent the best position of ith particle and the swarm, respectively. W proposed by Shi <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is a inertia weight, it regulates the trade-off between the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of the swarm. Parameters C 1 and C 2 are the weights of the stochastic acceleration terms that pull each particle toward the local best and global best positions, which are usually set to 2. Rand() and rand() are random numbers between (0, 1). The process of implementing the PSO algorithm is as follows:</p><p>[1] Initialize a swarm of particles with random positions and velocities in the D-dimensional problem space, then evaluate their fitness function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> According to the Eq. (2), each particle begin to fly to its next position. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> For each particle, calculate its fitness value. If the fitness value is better than the best fitness value p id /p gd in history, set the current value as the new p id /p gd , and record this position. Then update particle velocity according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">3</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> If the maximal generation is not attained, go to step 2, or the iteration process is over, output the best result. According to our TDMA problem, some parameters in PSO are defined as follows. Given N tasks, each task i includes M i hops. The dimension of particles is set to the number of the total subtasks, i.e., P N À1 i¼0 M i . The border of the searching space is defined by X max , which is set to N À 1. Parameter V max determines the maximum change one particle can take during one iteration, which is set as N À 1. Under this setting, V id is a value in the range [À(N À 1),N À 1], thus the positions of the flying particles are under the control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Description of GA part</head><p>Genetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> in this paper is used to improve PSO solutions in discrete domain. The cores of GA algorithm are three operators including selection, crossover and mutation. Crossover and mutation provide exploration, compared with the exploitation provided by selection. The effectiveness of GA depends on the trade-off between exploitation and exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. These three operators implemented in our proposed algorithm are described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Selection operator</head><p>The selection process chooses the candidate individuals based on their fitnesses from the population in the current generation. In this paper, tournament selection method is adopted. In this method, an individual with fitness F i can be selected from K individuals by the probability P i , i.e., P i ¼ F i = P KÀ1 i¼0 F i . In addition, elite-preservation strategy is employed, in which the best individual are kept during the generations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Crossover operator</head><p>Crossover is the most significant operation in the genetic search strategy. In this paper, one-point crossover is used, i.e., a crossing site are selected randomly, then two new individuals are formed by exchanging alternate pairs of selection between the selected sites. Take two chromosomes for example, the crossover site is randomly given: 10100=101; 00110=011 After crossover, two children individuals are followed: 10100=011; 00110=101 Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Pseudo-code of hybrid algorithm.</p><p>Additionally, crossover operator is executed with crossover probability p crossover . A big p crossover may improve the exploration capability of GA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Mutation operator</head><p>The mutation operator is applied to each bit of an individual with a mutation probability p mutation . In this paper, we use swap mutation to avoid illegal solutions. Swap mutation exchanges the values of two positions randomly. Take an individual 1 0110 100, where the hats point out the mutation positions, the new individual after mutation is the following sequence: 11110000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Hybrid algorithm</head><p>Briefly, our hybrid algorithm can be summarized with the pseudo-code in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>After each iteration in the above hybrid algorithm, an illegal solution may be generated in two cases. (i) The first case is only happened in PSO, i.e., after the computation of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">2</ref>), some bits of a particle's position may appear real values such as 2.34, etc. It is meaningless under the encoding rule. Hence, in the algorithm we usually round off such real position value to its nearest integer number. (ii) The second one is that the number of TaskID in an individual may not equal to the setting value in the encoding rule. To this kind of illegal solutions, we need to adjust the number of TaskID in this individual: delete the extra TaskID and add the absent ones. By these two ways, an illegal individual can be transformed into a legal one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Simulation results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Settings</head><p>We run the simulations on a 1.5 GHz Pentium M laptop with 480 MB SDRAM memory in the C++ environment. In network settings, the capacity of the channel is set to 500 kbps. The packet lengths are 1 kbit. Some parameters in energy aspect are as follows: similar to Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the transition time between the sleep and active states is assumed to 470lsec. The power consumed in transmission and reception of a packet set to 81and 180 mW, respectively. The power consumed in idle state is set as same as the reception state. In addition, we assume that the clock drift can be ignored by lengthening the slot time slightly.</p><p>In this paper, our hybrid algorithm(HA) is compared with three algorithms: Max Degree First coloring algorithm (MDF, which is a common 2-distance coloring algorithm), Node Based Scheduling Algorithm (NBSA) proposed by Ergen and Varaiya <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the classical PSO Algorithm (PSO). The running parameters of the HA are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. All the parameters of PSO algorithm are as same as PSO part of HA but the generation time, which is set to 600. For fair comparisons, all these algorithms are running in energy efficient modes, i.e., a node with no packet to send keeps its radio off during its allocated time slots.</p><p>The setting of task amount in our simulations is a sampling round. A sampling round is defined as a data collection process, which starts when each sensor has generated one packet to send, and ends when all the packets have arrived at AP.</p><p>The following metrics are used to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm: (1) number of time slots to finish a sampling round. (2) total energy consumption of the network to finish a sampling round, this metric should be minimized to extend network lifetime; (3) slot utility, which is defined as number of empty slot divided by the number of total time slots. This metric reflects the channel efficiency of an algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Simulation on a simple network</head><p>The goal of this simulation is to show the slot allocation results in detail and to provide experimental basis for scheduling performance analysis.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> depicts the simulation network topology with 7 sensor nodes and 1 AP, where each node's ID is marked in the circles. Both the arrows and the dot lines mean links between two nodes, besides, the arrows show the routing direction. In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the coloring result of each node is also marked beside the corresponding circle, there are 4 colors in total: C0, C1, C2 and C3.</p><p>The slot allocation results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>, where the working nodes in each slot are given. In addition, the results of PSO are not shown because the problem scale is small and those are as same as the results of HA.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref> shows that MDF needs the largest number of total time slots, i.e., 18 slots. The figure shows that there are 5 empty slots in MDF, which degrades its slot utilization to 72.2%. This is due to the color sequence round (see the second line of the figure), under which there are nodes with the current color but without packet to send, such as node 1 and 5 in slot 7. These empty slots deteriorate the time performance of MDF. Compare with it, other algorithms do not waste slots, thus these algorithms can achieve 100% utilization of slots. All the time results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> also shows the energy performance results under the above slot allocation schemes. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, it can be observed that the total energy consumption of MDF is also the largest. In MDF, since the coloring rule does not allow   nodes to work in two sequenced slots, nodes have to make more state transitions and hence waste more energy.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows that NBSA can get better results than MDF on both time and energy aspects. The reason is that NBSA excludes those empty slots, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>, thus the number of total time slots is reduced. At the same time, the continuity of node state is improved, for example, node 3 can work in two sequenced slot 7 and 8 in NBSA (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>. Hence, NBSA can save more energy than MDF.</p><p>Compare with the above two algorithms, HA shows the best performance either on time or on energy aspects. Two extreme instances (a = 0,1) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> give the optimal bound values of the objectives. Since HA has no color limitation, it can flexibly adjust the sequence of subtasks to acquire the least time scheme(a = 0) or the least energy scheme(a = 1). In the former scheme, more non-conflict subtasks are assigned in a same slot. In the latter one, nodes can work in more continuous slots, such as node 3, it works in four sequential slots, i.e., 6, 7, 8 and 9, see HA(a = 1) results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>. Therefore, HA can get the best scheduling result on energy-saving aspect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Simulations on four random networks</head><p>The goal of this experiment is to evaluate the performance of the algorithms under the different network sizes.</p><p>The experiments are done with four random networks, which are problems 1-4, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>. Routers are computed based upon the GPSR algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, such that each sensor will transmit the information to its neighbor which is closest to the destination. The solid lines and the dot lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref> means links between two nodes, besides the solid lines show the routes of packets. AP node is set as the node in center of the square, shown as a triangle in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>. The specifications of problem 1-4 are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.</p><p>The time and energy results of finishing a sampling round are given in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, respectively, where a = 0 means the objective is the optimal time performance, a = 1 means the objective is the optimal energy performance.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows that HA(a = 0) (in bolt font) is the optimal, PSO(a = 0) is suboptimal, followed by others including MDF, NBSA, PSO and HA when a = 1. In Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, all the algorithms except MDF can keep 100% slot utilization, it can be seen that the slot utilization of MDF become worse when the network scale increases. This suggests that more and more slot resources are wasted in MDF, therefore, MDF is not suitable for data collection sensor networks with time limitation.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows that HA(a = 1) (in bolt font) is the optimal, PSO(a = 1) is suboptimal, followed by others. Both Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table">5</ref> also show that the two searching algorithms always get better performance than MDF and NBSA when the performance metric is the optimization objective. This is due to the encoding method, which can guarantee that there is no empty slot during scheduling, and that the sequence of subtasks can be flexibly adjusted. Thus these two algorithms can search the solution space effectively and get better results. In addition, the optimal results in HA indicate that the searching ability of HA is better than PSO.</p><p>Additionly, both Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table">5</ref> show that the time and energy performance cannot be optimized at the same time wherever in HA or in PSO. This suggests that there exists a tradeoff between these two metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Evolutionary performance</head><p>The goal of this part is to compare the evolutionary performance of PSO and HA. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> shows the best time fitness of PSO and HA over generations in problem 2. As shown in this figure, both PSO and HA can quickly converge to a stable value at the beginning, while HA can further improve the result when it enter the GA process after 400 s. Similar results can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, which shows the best fitness improvement on energy aspect, acquired in problem 2. Both the figures indicate that the GA's evolution mechanism in HA can improve the solutions of PSO in discrete space. Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> depicts the computation time of two algorithms at the four network scales. The results shows that the computation time of HA is a little higher than PSO. This suggests that the improvement of HA is at the price of the computation time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have discussed how to schedule TDMA time slots for saving time and energy in many-toone sensor networks. We have presented a multi-objective optimization framework for TDMA scheduling. In this framework, there are two highlights: problem-specific encoding method and a hybrid algorithm which combines PSO and GA algorithm. The former guarantees that there is no empty slot during scheduling, and that the sequence of subtasks can be flexibly adjusted. The latter ensures a powerful searching ability to find the optimal slot allocation scheme. Simulation results demonstrated that the hybrid algorithm outperforms the PSO algorithm and two coloring methods including MDF and NBSA. Moreover, the proposed framework can easily change the objective or make tradeoff between the time and energy objectives by a proper weight factor.</p><p>Our future works include studying other performance improvement techniques including adaptive tuning strategy in PSO and problem-specific operators in GA. In additional, more situations in TDMA scheduling problem will be considered, such as bi-direction transmission, multiple access points, and more constraints in sensor networks.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
