<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of output feedback control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with event-triggered input. The considered system contains not only unknown system parameters, but also general nonlinear functions which are not required to be globally Lipschitz, in contrast to most of the existing results in the area. Besides providing two different event-triggered strategies without input-to-state stable (ISS) assumption with respect to the measurement errors, we propose a new way to encode and decode the event-triggered control signals to further decrease the communication rate. With our newly-proposed encoding-decoding mechanism, each time when the triggering event is violated, only one-bit signal, either 1 or 0, is rendered to transmit through the communication channel between the controller and actuator. Clearly, this signal transmission mechanism is more effective and consumes less channel bandwidth. Through Lyapunov analyses, it is proved that the boundedness of all the signals is ensured and the output signal can be regulated to a compact set around zero which is adjustable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recently, network control has obtained much attention as it has the advantages in improving control efficiency and reducing the maintenance cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. One key problem brought about by network control is how to address the communication constraints as the network only has limited bandwidth. Eventtriggered control is an effective and well-studied tool which aims to reduce the communication burden while ensuring satisfactory system performance. Compared with traditional sample-data control, event-triggered control renders signals to be transmitted through the communication channel only when certain pre-defined condition is triggered. Thus, it has clear advantages over classical periodic control when taking communication constraints into consideration, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and references therein for more details.</p><p>Up to now, there are many results addressing event-triggered control design problems, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and references therein for examples. Among all these results, the study of event-triggered control for nonlinear systems is of particular importance as most of the physical systems contain nonlinear dynamics in nature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, an event-triggered scheduling scheme is presented to address the stabilizing control problems on embedded processors. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, a new class of event-triggering mechanism that uses an additional internal dynamic variable is presented. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, an event-triggered framework for stabilizing nonlinear systems using hybrid system tools is introduced for the first time, and also two different event-triggering conditions are derived. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a methodology for designing decentralized asynchronous event conditions which only depend on the local sensor information is presented. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, by taking advantage of the interconnection property of the event-triggered system, a small-gain theorem based tool is used to analyze the event-triggered system. Recently, many interesting results have been reported in event-triggered adaptive control for uncertain networked systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the problem of event-triggered L 1 adaptive control is investigated, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposes an adaptive control strategy which allows a desirable command performance with the proposed controller exchanging data with the physical system through a real-time network. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the problem of event-triggered control for uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems is addressed and a new switching threshold strategy is proposed.</p><p>Note that the above results are all based on state feedback control. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the event-triggered control problem for nonlinear systems with partial state and output feedback using ISS small-gain methods is studied and some interesting results are presented. Nevertheless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> has several limitations: 1) It needs the measurement error caused by the event-triggering mechanism to satisfy the ISS assumption for the closed-loop system. Such an assumption may not hold even for some affine systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. 2) The studied system is assumed to be exactly known. As a consequence, when system uncertainty is involved, which is very common in practice, the proposed method may not be applicable because the system uncertainty will make the ISS assumption even harder to check. Therefore, the results of event-triggered control with output feedback are still very limited, especially for uncertain nonlinear systems.</p><p>Another important issue we address in this paper is to explore whether there are any other ways to decrease the communication rate further, besides employing an eventtriggering mechanism. Typically, when a control signal is obtained in the controller, it needs to be encoded, transmitted and decoded before it is actually applied to the actuator. We would like to point out that, most of the existing results on event-triggered control have never taken the signal encodingdecoding mechanisms into consideration. They simply assume that the event-triggered control signal can be transmitted through the communication channel perfectly, which would demand a huge amount of the limited network bandwidth. In practical implementations, the control signals are first encoded into specified digital numbers, such as 8 bits or 16 bits, and then these bits of numbers are sent through the communication channels. The problem of this mechanism lies in that, if a signal is encoded into 16-bits, while the communication channel can only transmit 8-bits each time in a parallel communication strategy, then this signal needs to be transmitted twice to reach the other end of the communication channel. Clearly, in this case, time delay, data jam, or data package dropout could be involved which may affect the system performance. Besides, even for the serial communication, the more bits a digital number has, the more time it will take. Thus, how to decrease signal transmission bits when an event is triggered is also worth investigating. A pioneer work towards this direction is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where only the exchange of one bit of information (per controller update) is needed. However, the signal transmission mechanism requires careful design of the event conditions and cannot be applied directly to the considered problem in this paper.</p><p>In this paper, we study the problem of output feedback control for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with event-triggered input. Even though the system parameters are totally unknown, the nonlinear functions are known but can be non-globally Lipschitz. Clearly, there is still no solution to this problem. To solve this problem, we first design state observers to estimate the actual system states under the condition that the input signal is event-triggered. Then, we propose two different event-triggered control strategies, namely the fixed threshold strategy and the relative threshold strategy, both of which do not require any ISS assumptions. Moreover, inspired by our proposed event-triggering conditions, we propose a new encoding-decoding strategy to transmit the control signals.</p><p>With this new signal transmission scheme, each time the control signal is updated, only one-bit of digital numbers, either 1 or 0, is required to be transmitted through the communication channels. Clearly, this mechanism consumes much less communication channel bandwidth and thus more effective. It is shown that the proposed event-triggered controllers ensure the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals, and the system output signal can be regulated to an adjustable set around zero.</p><p>The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system model and gives the control objective. Section 3 proposes the event-triggered control design scheme, including the event-triggering mechanism, the design procedure of the controller, as well as the stability analysis of the closed-loop system. In Section 4, we introduce the event-triggered one-bit signal transmission mechanism, while a simulation example is presented in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.</p></div>

Since ∆ is related to the initial conditions of the system through , so is Ω 1 . As can be seen, when the convergence speed c and the system initial conditions are set, the size of 1 can be reduced by decreasing λ max (Γ -1 ), σ1 γ and ε or increasing d i . Now we show that the proposed controller has a semi-global event-separation property, i.e., ∀k ∈ z + , there exists a positive number t * satisfying {t k+1 -t k } ≥ t * . To this end, by recalling e(t) = ǔ(t) -u(t), ∀t ∈ [t k , t k+1 ), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">d dt |e| = d dt (e * e) 1 2 = sign(e) ė ≤ | u|.<label>(42)</label></formula><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> we obtain that</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">u = αζ -νm,ζ+1 - d2 żζ ε cosh 2 ( z ζ d ε ) .<label>(43)</label></formula><p>From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_49">43</ref>), u is a continuous function of x i , i = 1, ..., n, ξ, Ξ, λ, Θ and ρ.

Since e(t k ) = 0 and lim t→t k+1 e j (t) = d, it is obtained that the lower bound of inter-execution intervals t * must satisfy t * ≥ d ς such that the semi-global event-separation property holds.</p><p>Remark 3: Note that u is a nonlinear function of signals including x i , i = 1, ..., n, ξ, Ξ, λ, Θ and ρ, thus the initial conditions of the system must have an effect on the interexecution intervals. As the bounds of system states and initial conditions are unknown, it is not easy to give an explicit expression of ς. However, to exclude the Zeno behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, we only need that ς is bounded and can thus disregard its explicit expression.

Through simulation investigations, it is found that the relationship among the threshold d, the inter-execution time and the final stabilization error of y is not monotonic when d increases. Also, d cannot be set arbitrarily big as it will enormously increase the control expense. How to find an appropriate d is a nontrivial task which deserves further study. If no event-triggered control is required, by setting d = 0 and d = σ 1 = σ 2 = 0, y will eventually converge to zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Relative Threshold Strategy</head><p>that in (33), the event-triggering threshold d is a fixed constant which is not connected with the control signal. In this part, inspired by the idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, we set a varying threshold for the event-triggering condition as shown in (47) below. The advantage of this strategy can be interpreted in the following two aspects, which is also verified in the simulation example in Section 5: 1). When the system states are far away from the origin, the resulted control signal would be very big. In this case, though (47) makes the control coarse because of the big threshold, the system states would still continue to converge to the origin while the time intervals between two triggering events become longer; 2). When the system states are close to the origin, the control signal should also be around zero. Thus, a smaller event-triggering threshold in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_50">47</ref>) is produced such that more precise control can be applied to the system to get better stabilization performances. For our considered system, the relative threshold control strategy is given as below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">ǔ(t) = -(1 + δ)(α ζ -ν m,ζ+1 ) tanh z ζ (α ζ -ν m,ζ+1 ) ε -(1 + δ) d tanh z ζ d ε (44) Θ =Γτ ζ -Γσ 2 Θ (45) u(t) =ǔ(t k ), ∀t ∈ [t k , t k+1 ) (46) t k+1 = inf{t &gt; t k | |e(t)| ≥ δ|u(t)| + d},<label>(47)</label></formula><p>in which ε, σ 2 , 0 &lt; δ &lt; 1, d &gt; 0, and d &gt; d 1-δ are all positive constants. With the above control strategy, we have the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 2: By utilizing the relative threshold control strategy ( <ref type="formula">44</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_50">47</ref>), the results in Theorem 1 still hold.</p><p>Proof: From (47), it is obtained that</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">ǔ(t) = (1 + µ 1 (t)δ)u(t) + µ 2 (t)d,<label>(48)</label></formula><p>where |µ 1 (t)| ≤ 1 and |µ 2 (t)| ≤ 1 are time-varying variables.</p><p>As a result, we have u(t) = ǔ(t) 1+µ1(t)δ -µ2(t)d 1+µ1(t)δ . Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">Vζ = Vζ-1 + z ζ ( ǔ(t) 1 + µ 1 (t)δ - µ 2 (t)d 1 + µ 1 (t)δ + ν m,ζ+1 -k ζ ν m,1 -αζ-1 ).<label>(49)</label></formula><p>From ( <ref type="formula">44</ref>) we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">z n ǔ ≤ 0. As µ 1 (t) ∈ [-1, 1] and µ 2 (t) ∈ [-1, 1], we have z ζ ǔ 1+µ1(t)δ ≤ zn ǔ 1+δ and µ2(t)d 1+λ1(t)δ</formula><p>≤ d 1-δ . Therefore, substituting (44) and ( <ref type="formula">45</ref>) into (49), and similar to the analysis in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">35</ref>)-(36) we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">Vζ ≤ - ζ i=1 c i z 2 i - σ 1 |b m | 2γ ρ2 + σ 1 |b m | 2γ ρ 2 - σ 2 2 ΘT Θ + σ 2 2 Θ T Θ + ζ i=1 1 4d i T + 0.557ε.

Now we show that the semi-global event-separation property holds. Still, with e = ǔ(t) -u(t), ∀t ∈ [t k , t k+1 ), following the same analysis in Theorem 1, we obtain t * ≥ δ|u(t)|+d κ &gt; 0 in which κ is a positive constant. This completes the proof.</p><p>Remark 5: The relative threshold strategy reduces to the fixed threshold strategy when δ = 0, so (44)-(47) can also address the fixed threshold case by simply setting δ = 0.</p><p>Remark 6: Note that the sizes of Ω 1 and Ω 2 are very conservative, and the final stabilization error could be considerably smaller than the bounds defined by Ω 1 and Ω 2 . Yet, the explicit expressions of Ω 1 and Ω 2 do provide a guideline to set the design parameters λ max (Γ -1 ), σ 1 , γ, ε and d i . Compared with the fixed threshold strategy, when the output signal y is close to zero, the relative threshold strategy has a smaller threshold for e = ǔ-u leading to that the deviation between u and ǔ is also smaller. In this way, the relative threshold strategy can provide more precise control and guarantee smaller stabilization error. This will be illustrated in the simulation example below.</p><p>Remark 7: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, the minimum inter-execution intervals for several differen event-triggered scenarios are analyzed, and different event-separation properties subject to disturbances in both state-feedback and output-feedback cases are discussed. However, since the considered system in this paper is nonlinear and uncertain without any ISS assumptions, how to investigate the robust event-separation properties is a non-trivial task and thus needs further study.</p><p>IV. ONE-BIT SIGNAL TRANSMISSION Note that the above control scheme does not consider how the control signal u(t) is transmitted from the controller to the actuator. Typically, it needs to be encoded first, transmitted through the communication channel, and then decoded at the decoder side. In the existing results, each time when the control signal u(t) is updated, u(t) needs to be encoded into 8bits or 16-bits digital numbers, and then these digital numbers are transmitted through the network. However, with the help of our proposed event-triggering condition, we are able to design a new encoding-decoding mechanism which only requires onebit signal (either 1 or 0) transmission when u(t) is updated.</p><p>Here we only introduce the encoding-decoding mechanism for the relative threshold strategy, as it can be easily extended to the fixed threshold strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Encoder and Decoder Design</head><p>The basic idea of designing the one-bit signal transmission mechanism is inspired by the fact that at each time when the control signal is updated, the measurement error satisfies |e(t)| ≥ δ|u(t)|+d. Based on this observation, we first transmit the initial value of the control signal u(t 0 ) with the traditional encoder-decoder method. Then, supposing t</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">∈ [t k , t k+1 ), k = 0, 1, 2 • ••, the encoder is designed as below, i = 1, e(t) ≥ δ|u(t)| + d = δ|ǔ(t k )| + d 0, e(t) ≤ -δ|u(t)| -d = -δ|ǔ(t k )| -d<label>(51)</label></formula><p>Therefore, the output of encoder (51), namely i, is transmitted from the controller to the decoder. Accordingly, with the parameters of the triggering conditions and the latest control signal ǔ1 (t k ) stored, the decoder is designed as below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">u(t) = ǔ1 (t k+1 ) = ǔ1 (t k ) + δ|ǔ 1 (t k )| + d, i = 1 ǔ1 (t k ) -δ|ǔ 1 (t k )| -d, i = 0<label>(52)</label></formula><p>In summary, the mechanism of the one-bit signal transmission rule is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> B. Robustness Analysis Now we address the robustness of the one-bit signal transmission rule by considering the following three cases.</p><p>1). In the ideal case where the state signals can be measured continuously and precisely, the triggering condition would be = δ|ǔ(t k )| + d. In this case, the decoder (52) would yield the same values as those produced by the controller, i.e. ǔ(t k+1 ) = ǔ1 (t k+1 ). 2). In practice, the state signals are sampled on some time basis, it is more likely that the triggering condition becomes e(t) &gt; δ|ǔ(t k )| + d. In this case, some bounded errors would be resulted between the output of the decoder and controller by taking the one-bit signal transmission rule (51)-(52), i.e. ǔ(t k+1 ) = ǔ1 (t k+1 ) + d1 where d1 is a bounded number which can be either positive or negative. Now we show that, in this case, our proposed control strategy with the one-bit signal transmission rule can still guarantee the system stability.</p><p>Note that in this case the system model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">ẋ = Ax + Φ(y)θ + Ψ(y) + 0 b ǔ1 (t),<label>(53)</label></formula><p>and the filter ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>) is changed into</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">λ = A 0 λ + e n ǔ(t).<label>(54)</label></formula><p>with ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>) remain the same. Lemma 2: For system (53), the proposed filters (4), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>) and (54) guarantee that the state estimation error is always bounded.</p><p>Proof: The state estimation error satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">˙ = A 0 + 0 b (ǔ 1 (t) -ǔ(t)) = A 0 - 0 b d1 . (<label>55</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_62">)</formula><p>Since A 0 is Hurwitz, and d1 is bounded, it is easy to prove that the state estimation error must be bounded, which completes the proof. Now we are able to give the following proposition. Proposition: In the presence of the bounded error d1 caused by the sensor sampling, the control strategy (44)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_50">47</ref>) and the one-bit signal transmission rule (51)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_58">52</ref>) can ensure the results in Theorem 2 if the design parameter d is chosen to satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">d &gt; d + | d1 | 1 -δ . (<label>56</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_64">)</formula><p>Proof: From (48) we have ǔ1 (t) = (1 + µ 1 (t)δ)u(t) + µ 2 (t)d -d1 , ∀t ∈ [t k+1 , t k+2 ). As can be seen from the proof in Theorem 2, if we choose the parameter d satisfying (56), the results in Theorem 2 still hold.</p><p>3). In the worst case, d1 may grow with time to a very large value which degrades the system performance. How to avoid this case is interesting but challenging, which is still under investigation. In practice, it is reasonable to assume that the error caused by the one-bit signal transmission rule is small for one single transmission, and only after a number of signal transmissions d1 can be accumulated to a large value. To avoid this case, a compromising approach is that a traditional signal transmission rule, which sends the actual control signal to the system, could be utilized to calibrate the output of the decoder, after a number of triggering events have occurred. Therefore, d1 will be reset to zero before it becomes too large. This is illustrated in our simulation example in Section 5.</p><p>Remark 8: Note that [5] also adopts a one-bit signal transmission rule, and this rule can be made robust by increasing the design parameter ρ, which is consistent with the results in this paper. However, it is difficult to choose a suitable ρ as it should satisfy a very complicated condition, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. While in this paper, we present a simple rule (56) to set the design parameters, which makes the controller implementation much easier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In this part, we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed control schemes in controlling a ship. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the dynamics of a ship is modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">ÿ + Φ ẏ + b 0 (M y 3 + Ly) = b 0 u, (<label>57</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_66">)</formula><p>where y is the course angular velocity, u is the event-triggered control input, b 0 = 0, M and L are unknown constants related to the hydrodynamic coefficients and the mass of the ship. By setting</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">x 1 = y, x 2 = ẏ + Φy, θ = [Φ, b 0 M, b 0 L] T , b = [0, b 0 ] T , and Ψ(y) = -y 0 0 0 -y 3 -y</formula><p>, system (57) can be transformed into the form of system (1). The control objective is to make the output y = x 1 (t) converge to a bounded set around zero. For simulation studies, the systems parameters are set as Φ = 0.2, b 0 = 1.85, M = 0.12, L = 0.28. In the simulation, we choose k 1 = 3, k 2 = 2, y(0) = 2rad/s, ẏ(0) = 0rad/s 2 , and all the other initial conditions are 0. The other design parameters are set as c 1 = c 2 = 2, d 1 = d 2 = 0.5, Γ = 0.2I, σ 1 = σ 2 = 0.5, γ = 0.5 and ε = 10.</p><p>1). We first study the ideal case, in which the states can be measured continuously such that no error is caused by the one-bit signal transmission rule. We consider both the fixed and relative threshold strategies with their parameters chosen as below: (a). Fixed threshold strategy: d = d = 0.5; (b). Relative threshold strategy: δ = 0.5, d = 0.1 and d = 0.3.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> presents the trajectories of y(t), while the eventtriggered control signals for the two strategies are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>-Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> lists the time at which the events is triggered, and it is calculated that the number of triggered events for the fixed and relative threshold strategies in 50 seconds are 100 and 41, respectively. In practice, the bounds of Ω 1 and Ω 2 cannot be computed as they contain unknown system parameters. However, in this simulation example, we can obtain Ω 1 = {y|y ≤ 11} and Ω 2 = {y|y ≤ 13.3} by using the given parameters for simulation study. As can be seen, these bounds are conservative. By comparing the simulation results, it is obtained that the relative threshold strategy not only achieves smaller stabilization error, but also has less triggering events. Therefore, the relative threshold strategy achieve better system performances in stabilization problems.</p><p>2). We now examine a practical situation that is discussed in subsection 4.2. In this case, we assume once an event is   ] is produced between ǔ(t k+1 ) and ǔ1 (t k+1 ), i.e. ǔ(t k+1 ) = ǔ1 (t k+1 ) + d1 . To avoid that the measurement error is accumulated to a very large value, after the event is triggered for every 5 times, a traditional signal transmission rule is used to transmit ǔ(t k ) to calibrate the output of the decoder. Here we only consider the relative threshold strategy, and the parameters are set as δ = 0.5, d = 0.1 and d = 3.</p><p>The system output and control signal are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, respectively. From the simulation results, it is observed that though the extra error caused by the sensor sampling is introduced, the stability of the closed-loop system can still be guaranteed. Clearly, this verifies the effectiveness of our proposed control strategy. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we consider event-triggered output feedback control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. Two different event-triggering strategies, namely the fixed threshold strategy and the relative threshold strategy, are proposed.
