<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present a new class of blind cyclic-based estimators for carrier frequency offset and symbol-timing error estimation of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed approach exploits the properties of the cyclic prefix subset to reveal the synchronization parameters in the likelihood function of the received vector. In this paper, a new likelihood function for the joint timing and frequency-offset estimation is derived, which globally characterizes the estimation problem. The resulting probabilistic measure is used to develop three classes of unbiased estimators, namely, maximum-likelihood, minimum variance unbiased, and moment estimator. In comparison to the previously proposed methods, the proposed estimators in this study are computationally and statistically efficient, which makes the estimators more attractive for real-time applications.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A N ORTHOGONAL frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system is a viable modulation scheme for data transmission over slow-varying time-dispersive channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, performance of such a system is highly susceptible to nonideal synchronization parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Specifically, symbol timing and carrier frequency offset become increasingly important issues while implementing OFDM systems in practical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Carrier frequency offset introduces interference among the subchannels and deteriorates the performance of OFDM systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. To overcome this imperfection, various compensation methods for estimation and correction of synchronization parameters have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To compare the performance of these estimators, it is required to define a single number representing the goodness of the estimate. Assuming that all estimators are unbiased, that is, the expectation of the estimate is equal to the unknown parameter, the variance of the estimator is used as a global measure for comparing the performance of these estimators.</p><p>Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is a fundamental lower bound on the variance of the estimators and the unbiased estimator whose variance equals CRLB is called an efficient estimator. When the evaluation of an efficient estimator is not possible, it is desirable to obtain an estimator whose performance is as close as possible to the CRLB fundamental bound. The estimator whose performance is closest to the CRLB is known as the minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimator.</p><p>The previously proposed methods for synchronization of OFDM systems can be classified into two main subclasses: minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) estimators. In the MMSE approach, the estimator uses information provided by the reference signals (pilot tones or null subchannels) in order to minimize a cost function associated with the synchronization parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A salient feature of this approach is that no probabilistic assumptions are made about the data. Also, due to their inherent characteristic, MMSE estimators usually result in a tractable (globally stable) and easy to implement realization. However, MMSE estimators do not necessarily result in an unbiased and minimum variance estimate of the unknown parameter. On the other hand, classical probabilistic approaches, such as ML or MVU estimators, estimate the unknown parameter, subject to minimum probability of error or minimum variance criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Although not exactly efficient, ML estimators are asymptotically MVU, that is their variance approaches that of MVU estimator as the length of data record increases.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the authors use retransmission technique to reveal the frequency-offset parameter in the likelihood function of the received signal. Due to the redundancy introduced by repeating the data block, the data rate efficiency is decreased by a factor of 2. To avoid this imperfection, a new ML estimator based on cyclic prefix (CP) was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this approach, the additional information provided by the CP is used to obtain the likelihood function for joint estimation of symbol-timing error and frequency offset in an OFDM system.</p><p>The analysis presented in this paper reveals that the likelihood function proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> does not globally characterize the observation vector over the entire range of the timing offset and will result in a performance loss over a finite range of timing offset interval.</p><p>Motivated by the suboptimum performance of the proposed estimator in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a new likelihood function for joint estimation of carrier frequency offset and symbol-timing error in an OFDM system is introduced in this paper. Furthermore, a new optimum ML estimator for the joint estimation problem is presented which provides the global ML estimates of the synchronization parameters. In an attempt to reduce the variance of the ML estimator, we also investigate a new class of MVU estimators for frequency-offset estimation of OFDM systems. It is shown that there exists a unique function of sufficient statistic which provides the MVU estimate of the frequency offset. The proposed estimator provides a closed-form expression for the estimator as a function of data statistics. Consequently, it does not suffer from converging to multiple local minima, a problem which arises in ML technique with nonconvex loglikelihood function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The advantages of the proposed MVU estimator over the class of previously proposed estimators are twofold. First, it is MVU, and therefore its variance is minimum among the entire class of estimators, which use the same probabilistic measure. Secondly, it provides a closed-form expression for mapping the statistics to the estimation domain. The former property assures an optimum performance of the estimator, while the latter facilitates the closed-loop analysis of the system.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the timing and frequency-offset estimation problem and addresses the previously proposed estimation approach. Section III presents a new global likelihood function for joint estimation of timing and frequency offset. A new ML estimator for the joint estimation problem is proposed in Section IV. In Section V, the Neyman-Fisher factorization theorem and the Rao-Blackwell-Lehmann-Scheffe (RBLS) theorem are applied to obtain the new MVU estimator. Lower-bound and closed-loop performance of this estimator are also investigated in Section V. Section VI addresses a moment estimator for estimation of frequency offset under uncertain timing-offset knowledge. In Section VII, we propose a unified structure, which captures all the proposed cyclic-based estimators into a unified structure. Performance assessments of the estimators for an OFDM system are presented in Section VIII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES</head><p>This section presents an overview of cyclic-based estimation method for synchronization of OFDM system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In an OFDM system, an -point fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to divide the channel spectrum into a set of parallel subchannels. Due to the intersymbol interference introduced by nonideal channel, the OFDM symbols are subject to the interblock interference (IBI) among consecutive transmitted blocks, which results in considerable performance degradation in an OFDM system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. To mitigate this effect, the last samples in each data block of length are repeated at the beginning of the block as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This makes the input sequence look periodic and clears the channel memory at the end of each input block, making the successive OFDM symbols independent.</p><p>We denote the OFDM received signal by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is the transmitted sequence and is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Both signal and noise sequences are assumed to be uncorrelated, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with power of and , respectively. Throughout this paper, channel is assumed to be modeled with a constant delay. For time-varying channels, this assumption can be seen as frequency-nonselective fading environment. Generalization of the cyclic estimator to nonflat-fading channels can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Also, and are the frequency offset and symbol-timing error introduced by the synchronization mismatches in the carrier frequency and symbol timing, respectively. Let be a vector of previously received samples at time , known as observation vector. With the above notation, the th entry of this vector can be represented as</p><p>. The length of this vector is selected such that there are at least correlated symbols associated in the observation vector regardless of the synchronization parameters. Due to the timing-offset error at the receiver, the starting point of this vector is shifted by samples with respect to the beginning of the OFDM symbol block.</p><p>Under the i.i.d. assumption for both signal and noise, the autocorrelation function for the observation vector can be expressed by otherwise <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where is the cyclic set associated with the observation vector. Assuming an AWGN scenario, the probability density function (pdf) of the observation vector is in the form of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where is the autocorrelation matrix of the observation vector. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, authors use the Bayes theorem to obtain the pdf of the observation vector. However, as we show next, the resulting likelihood measure does not fully characterize the random observation vector over the entire range of the timing-offset parameter. In the next section, we derive a new likelihood function based on direct matrix inversion approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. LIKELIHOOD MEASURE</head><p>The question of optimal choice of likelihood function for joint estimation of frequency and timing offset in OFDM systems is considered next. The analysis developed here for computing the pdf is based on the standard matrix inversion approach. Depending on the timing-offset parameter , the autocorrelation matrix can be cast into one of the following forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Case I</head><p>In this case, there are two cyclic sets associated with the observation vector. This would partition the autocorrelation matrix and its inverse into the following forms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(4) (5)</formula><p>where is a tridiagonal toeplitz matrix of size as expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> The argument inside the Toeplitz operator is the first row of the toeplitz matrix with <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Due to the tridiagonal toeplitz property of the matrix , the th entry of its inverse can be obtained from ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), shown at the bottom of the page, where <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Substituting ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) into (3), and after some algebraic manipulation, the conditional pdf for this case can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where is the real operator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Case II</head><p>In this case, there are three cyclic sets associated with the observation vector and the autocorrelation matrix is partitioned into two tridiagonal toeplitz matrices as expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Substituting ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) into (3), and using (8), the conditional pdf for this case can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Combining this with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, we conclude that the pdf, which globally characterizes the observation vector, can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where is the discrete-time unit step function. We conclude this section by noting that the pdf given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is only the first term of the pdf given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ML ESTIMATOR</head><p>In this section, an ML estimator for joint estimation of carrier frequency and symbol-timing error is presented. The ML estimate for the unknown vector is defined to be the vector that maximizes the for fixed realization of the random vector as expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> or otherwise (8) The maximization is performed over the entire span of the estimation vector</p><p>. By taking the derivative of the likelihood function given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, it can be shown that the joint ML estimation of and becomes ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), shown at the bottom of the page.</p><p>The estimator proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> provides the likelihood function of the observation vector over a finite range of timing offset parameter. Thus, the resultant ML estimator is suboptimal and obtains the ML estimate by maximizing the conditional-likelihood function . To better visualize this difference, a typical realization of the log-likelihood measures for both suboptimum and proposed functions are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In this experiment, the DFT block size and CP are assumed to be 64 and 8. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), frequency offset , and timing offset are set to 25 dB, 0.5, and 70 samples, respectively. The upper plot indicates the log-likelihood function for the suboptimum metric proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and the lower plot provides the metric given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. By investigating these plots, it is inferred that the suboptimum metric achieves its maximum at . However, for the metric given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, the maximum is 70, which is exactly the unknown symbol-timing error. Knowing the fact that during the startup and initialization of the receiver, symbol-timing error is uniformly distributed between , the ML estimator proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, results in considerable estimation error with a probability of . ML estimators are asymptotically MVU, that is, the variance of the estimator achieves that of MVU estimator as the length of the observation vector goes to infinity. However, for many practical purposes, the length of the observation vector is constrained by physical limitations, and cannot be arbitrarily long. In the subsequent section, we investigate the MVU estimator, which has the minimum variance among the set of cyclic-based estimators.</p><p>(15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> V. MVU ESTIMATOR In this section, we find the MVU estimator by resorting to the theory of sufficient statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The first step in deriving the MVU estimator is to obtain the sufficient statistic for the pdf given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. The sufficient statistic is known to be a function of the observation vector, namely , such that the conditional pdf of the observation vector, given , does not depend on the unknown estimation parameters . Evaluating the sufficient statistic is a formidable task for the broad class of pdfs. However, the Neyman-Fisher factorization theorem can be used to identify the potential sufficient statistic. According to this theorem, if the pdf can be factored in the form , where is a function depending on only through , and is a function depending only on , then is a sufficient statistic for estimation of the parameters and . By reformulating the pdf given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> to one can verify that there is a direct dependency between the parameter and the statistics and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Based on this observation, the Neyman-Fisher theorem fails to provide a sufficient statistic for estimation of . However, for a deterministic realization of the parameter , we can factor the pdf into <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Clearly then, forms a sufficient statistic for estimation of the parameter .</p><p>Next, we apply the RBLS theorem to find the MVU estimator. According to this theorem, if is an unbiased estimator of and is a sufficient complete statistic for , then is a valid MVU estimator of .</p><p>In applying the above theorem, we need to obtain an unbiased estimator of , termed , and determine the conditional expectation of this estimator given the statistic . An appropriate candidate for the unbiased estimator of can be obtained from the statistical moments of the random vector . According to (2), the second moment of the random variable with satisfies the following identity:</p><p>(18)</p><p>Having this observation, we use the second moment estimator as an unbiased estimator for as given by (19)</p><p>Here, is the imaginary operator. In deriving the above estimator, we replaced by its natural estimator . It is straightforward to verify that this estimator is unbiased as it satisfies the condition (20) Next, we obtain the conditional expectation of given the sufficient statistic as follows:</p><p>(21)</p><p>It is important to emphasize that since the underlying pdf given in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) belongs to the exponential family of pdfs, the sufficient statistics forms a complete statistic for estimating of the parameter . Therefore, the mapping function obtained from applying RBLS theorem, namely , is but one function of the statistic , and no other estimator with the same statistic can result in a lower variance with respect to MVU estimator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. CRLB</head><p>Under broad conditions, the variance of any unbiased estimator of a nonrandom parameter satisfies the CRLB as <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref> where is the Fisher information given by ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>)</p><p>Using ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) with (23), after some algebraic manipulations, the CRLB of the MVU estimator becomes (24) where is the SNR at the receiving end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Closed-Loop Performance</head><p>The frequency recovery loop for estimation of frequency offset is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The closed-loop system is obtained by feeding back the information obtained from the estimator into the sampler block (bootstrap). The sampler updates its frequency at the beginning of the each observation vector (every samples). To match the various sampling frequencies used in the system, a down sampler block is used prior to the sampler. Also, a gain block is used to control the closed-loop characteristic of the system (stability, settling time, noise sensitivity). According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the frequency offset for the th observation vector can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x x x x<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where and x . The term inside the sum is a stochastic quantity and does not have a closed-form expression. However, for reasonably high SNR, it can be well approximated by its expected value x x . Therefore, the expression inside the sum can be written as ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) Using ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) with (25), after some algebraic manipulations, the frequency offset of the th observation vector becomes (27)</p><p>The above equation represents a second-order finite-difference system, in which its dynamical modes can be obtained by solving the following equation: where</p><p>. Clearly, the solution to the above finite-difference equation is the form of (28) where are two dynamic modes of the system. The smaller root (negative) results in a high frequency oscillation in the frequency-offset estimate. However, as we show in the computer simulation, this term is filtered out by the moving average filter. To assure stability, the gain block should be set such that both poles lie inside the unit circle. When the timing-offset parameter is not known to the receiver or if the the noise pdf differs from Gaussian distribution, finding the optimum estimator (ML, MVU, CRLB) may not be an easy task. However, as we show next, there exists a moment estimator, which provides a consistent estimate of frequency offset, regardless of noise distribution and timing offset values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Sensitivity to the Timing-Offset Parameter</head><p>To determine the approximate variance of the frequency offset due to uncertainuty in the symbol-timing parameter, we can use a first-order Taylor expansion of about the expected value of the timing offset parameters as defined by , shown in the equation at the bottom of the page. Here is the multicarrier (MC) sample period, and we have used the equivalent continuous-time signal to derive the partial derivative. The variance of frequency offset to small perturbations in timing offset is estimated as defined by , shown in the equation at the bottom of the next page. In general, a large deviation in the timing-offset parameter causes the denominator of the above term to be small. Thus, the necessity for estimating an accurate timing offset parameter in conjunction with the frequency-offset estimator is quite crutial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. MOMENT ESTIMATOR</head><p>Although there is no optimum criterion associated with the moment estimator, due to its simple structure, it is frequently used as an initial estimate for other estimators such as ML estimator. Consider a sequence of first samples of vector . Using (2), autocorrelation of th entry of this vector satisfies the following identity:</p><p>(31) Using the Base rule, the expected value of the above function (with respect to parameter ) can be expressed as (32)</p><p>Substituting the th autocorrelation lag with its natural estimator, the moment estimator for frequency offset under uncertain timing offset can be found as <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref> where the statistic is defined as (34)</p><p>Statistical assessment of moment estimator is a formidable task over the entire range of SNR. However, for relatively high SNR, the random observation vector is heavily concentrated about its mean. Using the statistical linearization, we can use a first-order Taylor expression of the estimator about its mean to obtain the variance of the estimate. In doing so, we substitute the random variable in (34) with the expression given in (1) and obtain (35), shown at the bottom of the page, where the signal and noise vector are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(36)<label>(37)</label></formula><p>By virtue of the above equation, the expected value of the observation vector for a fixed realization of signal vector would be . We then perform a first-order Taylor expansion of about the point to yield</p><p>Taking the derivative of (35) with respect to and setting , we obtain</p><p>The second term in (38) represents the contribution of noise to the estimate. Knowing that noise samples are i.i.d. with power of , variance of estimator can be obtained from (39) For sufficiently large block lengths , the above term can be well approximated as (40)</p><p>In the next section, we use the resemblance between the estimators to propose a unified structure that encounters all the proposed estimators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. UNIFIED STRUCTURE</head><p>In this section, we shall show how the proposed estimators can be unified into a single structure. This provides a unique framework for analysis of the proposed estimators. Moreover, it allows us to investigate the effect of symbol-timing error in the estimation of carrier offset for each individual scheme.</p><p>(35) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. MVU and Moment Estimator</head><p>Comparing the moment estimator given in (21) to the MVU estimator in (33) reveals some similarities in the structure of the estimators. Clearly, both moment and MVU estimators use the same mapping function, namely log function, to project the data statistics into the estimation domain. The only difference is in the form of statistics used for each scheme. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> depicts the block diagram of these two estimators. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, both estimators obtain the statistics by correlating the samples with their th delayed samples. This operation is performed by using a moving average (MA) filter in the structure of estimators. However, MVU and moment estimators use different upper and lower bounds for the MA filter. In a moment estimator, the averaging is performed over the first samples of the observation vector. This would remove the requirement of knowing the exact timing-offset parameter in the estimation of carrier frequency offset. However, the estimate obtained from using this scheme results in less accurate estimate (more variance) in comparison to the MVU estimate. On the other hand, the MVU estimator requires knowledge of symbol timing in the estimation of carrier frequency offset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. MVU and ML Estimator</head><p>Although the resemblance between MVU and ML estimators may not be as evident as that of the MVU and moment estimators, it can be shown that the ML estimator can also be classified into the same family. Knowing the fact that , the ML estimator can be expressed as (41)</p><p>where the parameters and are functions of and can be obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Thus, the ML estimator falls into the same family of estimators. The ML estimator provides the upper and lower limit of the moving average filter by extracting the timing parameter from the likelihood function. Although the ML estimator has the advantage of exploiting the entire bandwidth by removing the requirement for having pilot tones, the symboltiming estimate obtained from the ML scheme has larger confident interval. This may result in considerable performance degradation compared to the pilot based schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. DISCUSSION AND SIMULATION</head><p>This section presents the computer simulation used to assess the performance of the proposed estimator for synchronization of an OFDM system. We choose the variance of estimator as a performance measure throughout our study. The simulation parameters used are typical of the digital audio broadcast environment. More specifically, the chosen FFT size for OFDM is 64. Unless specified, the length of cyclic prefix , SNR, and frequency offset are set to 8, 20 dB, and 0.5, respectively. We carry out the Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators.</p><p>In doing so, we start with a comparison between the performance of the proposed ML estimator and the suboptimum ML estimator given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> over the range of timing-offset parameter . To clearly indicate the effect of timing-offset parameter in estimating the synchronization parameters, we use the likelihood function derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to estimate the timing and frequency offset in batch processing mode (note that running correlator would not clearly indicate the effect of timing offset as it averages out the estimate over the entire range of timing offset). Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> compare the variance of the proposed ML estimator with the suboptimum ML estimator. As expected, the suboptimum ML estimator exhibits anomalous statistical behavior over the range of . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the performance of the MVU estimator for frequency-offset estimation under perfect knowledge of timing-offset error. To decouple the effect of channel dispersion and channel dynamical variations on the performance of cyclic-based MVU, three scenarios are investigated here: fixed-delay channel, time-invariant multipath dispersive channel, and time-varying Rayleigh fading channel. In frequency-selective and multipath environment, we set the length of cyclic prefix to 8/16 and 16/32 samples, respectively. For the fading scenario, the channel consists of 16 independent multipaths with Rayleigh distribution. It is assumed that the multipath power has an exponentially decaying profile with a root-mean-square (RMS) width of two samples. Furthermore, the effective timing offset of the channel is assumed to be equal to the RMS value of the delay spread (two samples). For the fixed dispersive channel, we used a fixed channel with an exponentially decaying power identical to Rayleigh fading channel scenario. A careful examination of the variances reveals that in the fading environment, performance of the MVU estimator is not limited by a large-error floor, a problem that is observed in the cyclic-based ML estimator. Knowing the fact the under complete knowledge of timing offset, the ML and the MVU estimators are identical, we conclude that the large-noise floor in the frequency-offset ML estimator is mostly due to the considerable estimation error in the timing-offset parameter. More specifically, it is the timing offset and not the channel dispersion (multipath) that plays a dominant factor in degrading the performance of cyclic-based estimators, consolidating the effectiveness of cyclic-based estimators for dispersive channels. In the ML estimator, the estimation error of the timing-offset parameter propagates to the frequency-offset estimator and causes an inaccurate frequency-offset estimate. Therefore, in fading environments, it is quite crucial for the  receiver to estimate the timing offset using a robust estimator (MMSE timing estimator), thus avoiding the large variance in estimating the frequency-offset parameter. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, performance loss due to the multipath fading environment is about 3 dB for SNRs around 15 dB. Moreover, performance of MVU estimator can be improved by increasing the length of cyclic prefix. For the time-invariant dispersive channel, the performance degradation due to multipath is negligible (0.2 dB). As shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, increasing the length of cyclic prefix lowers the variance of the estimator especially at lower SNRs. Nevertheless, it could result in a considerable data-rate reduction due to the redundancy introduced by CP.</p><p>To verify the performance of the closed-loop model given in (28), a comparison is made between the frequency-offset estimate of the closed-loop MVU estimator and the analytical derivation given in (28) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have proposed a class of nondata-aided, cyclic-based, robust estimators for frequency-offset estimation of MC systems. We determined a likelihood function for joint estimation of symbol-timing error and carrier frequency offset in MC systems. As a result, it is used for deriving a maximum-likelihood estimator for the joint estimation problem. It was shown that the previously proposed ML estimator would result in a considerable performance loss over a finite range of timing-offset parameter. More specifically, for a given symbol length, the probability of false ML estimation approaches one as the length of CP increases. The key advantage of the proposed ML estimator over the previously proposed ML is its ability to compensate the estimation error. We also used the concept of sufficient statistics to obtain a new minimum variance unbiased estimate of the frequency offset under complete knowledge of the timing-offset error. In doing so, we applied the Neyman-Fisher factorization theorem and Rao-Blackwell-Lehmann-Scheffe theorem to identify the sufficient statistic and appropriate mapping functions. It is shown that there is a unique function of the sufficient statistics that results in the minimum variance estimate among the possible class of cyclic-based estimators. Also, a moment estimator is proposed to obtain a consistent estimate of the carrier offset under uncertain symbol-timing error. The moment estimator does not rely on any probabilistic assumptions. Thus, its performance is insensitive to the distribution of the additive noise. Finally, a unified structure for modeling all the estimators studied is proposed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
