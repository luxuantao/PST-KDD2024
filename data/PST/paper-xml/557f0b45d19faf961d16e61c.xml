<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Preliminaries</head><p>There has been much recent activity toward achieving systems of multiple mobile robots engaged in collective behavior. Such systems are of interest for several reasons: • tasks may be inherently too complex (or impossible) for a single robot to accomplish, or performance benefits can be gained from using multiple robots; • building and using several simple robots can be easier, cheaper, more flexible and more faulttolerant than having a single powerful robot for each separate task; and • the constructive, synthetic approach inherent in cooperative mobile robotics can possibly yield insights into fundamental problems in the social sciences (organization theory, economics, cognitive psychology), and life sciences (theoretical biology, animal ethology).</p><p>The study of multiple-robot systems naturally extends research on single-robot systems, but is also a discipline unto itself: multiple-robot systems can accomplish tasks that no single robot can accomplish, since ultimately a single robot, no matter how capable, is spatially limited. Multiplerobot systems are also different from other distributed systems because of their implicit "realworld" environment, which is presumably more difficult to model and reason about than traditional components of distributed system environments (i.e., computers, databases, networks).</p><p>The term collective behavior generically denotes any behavior of agents in a system having more than one agent. Cooperative behavior, which is the subject of the present survey, is a subclass of collective behavior that is characterized by cooperation. Webster's dictionary <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref> defines "cooperate" as "to associate with another or others for mutual, often economic, benefit". Explicit definitions of cooperation in the robotics literature, while surprisingly sparse, include: 1. "joint collaborative behavior that is directed toward some goal in which there is a common interest or reward" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>; 2. "a form of interaction, usually based on communication" <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>; and 3. " <ref type="bibr">[joining]</ref> together for doing something that creates a progressive result such as increasing performance or saving time" <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref>. These definitions show the wide range of possible motivating perspectives. For example, definitions such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> typically lead to the study of task decomposition, task allocation, and other distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) issues (e.g., learning, rationality). Definitions along the lines of (2) reflect a concern with requirements for information or other resources, and may be accompanied by studies of related issues such as correctness and fault-tolerance. Finally, definition (3) reflects a concern with quantified measures of cooperation, such as speedup in time to complete a task. Thus, in these definitions we see three fundamental seeds: the task, the mechanism of cooperation, and system performance.</p><p>We define cooperative behavior as follows: Given some task specified by a designer, a multiple-robot system displays cooperative behavior if, due to some underlying mechanism (i.e., the "mechanism of cooperation"), there is an increase in the total utility of the system. Intuitively, cooperative behavior entails some type of performance gain over naive collective behavior. The mechanism of cooperation may lie in the imposition by the designer of a control or communication structure, in aspects of the task specification, in the interaction dynamics of agent behaviors, etc.</p><p>In this paper, we survey the intellectual heritage and major research directions of the field of cooperative robotics. For this survey of cooperative robotics to remain tractable, we restrict our discussion to works involving mobile robots or simulations of mobile robots, where a mobile robot is taken to be an autonomous, physically indepen-dent, mobile robot. In particular, we concentrated on fundamental theoretical issues that impinge on cooperative robotics. Thus, the following related subjects were outside the scope of this work:</p><p>• coordination of multiple manipulators, articulated arms, or multi-fingered hands, etc. • human-robot cooperative systems, and userinterface issues that arise with multiple-robot systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[184]</ref> [8] [124] <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. • the competitive subclass of collective behavior, which includes pursuit-evasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref> and one-on-one competitive games <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Note that a cooperative team strategy for, e.g., work on the robot soccer league recently started in Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> would lie within our present scope. • emerging technologies such as nanotechnology <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> that are likely to be very important to cooperative robotics are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Even with these restrictions, we find that over the past 8 years (1987-1995) alone, well over 200 papers have been published in this field of cooperative (mobile) robotics, encompassing theories from such diverse disciplines as artificial intelligence, game theory/economics, theoretical biology, distributed computing/control, animal ethology and artificial life.</p><p>We are aware of two previous works that have surveyed or taxonomized the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is a broad, relatively succinct survey whose scope encompasses distributed autonomous robotic systems (i.e., not restricted to mobile robots). <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> focuses on several well-known "swarm" architectures (e.g., SWARM and Mataric's Behavior-based architecture -see Section 2.1) and proposes a taxonomy to characterize these architectures. The scope and intent of our work differs significantly from these, in that <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> we extensively survey the field of cooperative mobile robotics, and (2) we provide a taxonomical organization of the literature based on problems and solutions that have arisen in the field (as opposed to a selected group of architectures). In addition, we survey much new material that has appeared since these earlier works were published.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Towards a Picture of Cooperative Robotics</head><p>In the mid-1940's Grey Walter, along with Wiener and Shannon, studied turtle-like robots equipped with light and touch sensors; these simple robots exhibited "complex social behavior" in responding to each other's movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Coordination and interactions of multiple intelligent agents have been actively studied in the field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) since the early 1970's <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, but the DAI field concerned itself mainly with problems involving software agents. In the late 1980's, the robotics research community became very active in cooperative robotics, beginning with projects such as CEBOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, SWARM <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, ACTRESS <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, GOFER <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and the work at Brussels <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. These early projects were done primarily in simulation, and, while the early work on CEBOT, ACTRESS and GOFER have all had physical implementations (with ≤ 3 robots), in some sense these implementations were presented by way of proving the simulation results. Thus, several more recent works (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>) are significant for establishing an emphasis on the actual physical implementation of cooperative robotic systems. Many of the recent cooperative robotic systems, in contrast to the earlier works, are based on a behavior-based approach (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>). Various perspectives on autonomy and on the connection between intelligence and environment are strongly associated with the behavior-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, but are not intrinsic to multiple-robot systems and thus lie beyond our present scope. Also note that a recent incarnation of CEBOT, which has been implemented on physical robots, is based on a behavior-based control architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>The rapid progress of cooperative robotics since the late 1980's has been an interplay of systems, theories and problems: to solve a given problem, systems are envisioned, simulated and built; theories of cooperation are brought from other fields; and new problems are identified (prompting further systems and theories). Since so much of this progress is recent, it is not easy to discern deep intellectual heritages from within the field. More apparent are the intellectual heritages from other fields, as well as the canonical task domains which have driven research. Three examples of the latter are: • Traffic Control. When multiple agents move within a common environment, they typically attempt to avoid collisions. Fundamentally, this may be viewed as a problem of resource conflict, which may be resolved by introducing, e.g., traffic rules, priorities, or communication architectures. From another perspective, path planning must be performed taking into consideration other robots and the global environment; this multiple-robot path planning is an intrinsically geometric problem in configuration space-time. Note that prioritization and communication protocols -as well as the internal modeling of other robots -all reflect possible variants of the group architecture of the robots. For example, traffic rules are commonly used to reduce planning cost for avoiding collision and deadlock in a real-world environment, such as a network of roads. (Interestingly, behaviorbased approaches identify collision avoidance as one of the most basic behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and achieving a collision-avoidance behavior is the natural solution to collision avoidance among multiple robots. However, in reported experiments that use the behavior-based approach, robots are never restricted to road networks.) • Box-Pushing/Cooperative Manipulation. Many works have addressed the boxpushing (or couch-pushing) problem, for widely varying reasons. The focus in <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> is on task allocation, fault-tolerance and (reinforcement) learning. By contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> studies two boxpushing protocols in terms of their intrinsic communication and hardware requirements, via the concept of information invariants. Cooperative manipulation of large objects is particularly interesting in that cooperation can be achieved without the robots even knowing of each others' existence <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. Other works in the class of box-pushing/object manipulation include <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[175]</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The task is interesting because (1) it can be performed by each robot independently (i.e., the issue is whether multiple robots achieve a performance gain), and (2) as discussed in Section 3.2, the task is also interesting due to motivations related to the biological inspirations behind cooperative robot systems. There are some conceptual overlaps with the related task of materials handling in a manufacturing workcell <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. A wide variety of techniques have been applied, ranging from simple stigmergy (essentially random movements that result in the fortuitous collection of objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to more complex algorithms in which robots form chains along which objects are passed to the goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>[24] defines stigmergy as "the production of a certain behaviour in agents as a consequence of the effects produced in the local environment by previous behaviour". This is actually a form of "cooperation without communication", which has been the stated object of several foraging solutions since the corresponding formulations become nearly trivial if communication is used. On the other hand, that stigmergy may not satisfy our definition of cooperation given above, since there is no performance improvement over the "naive algorithm" -in this particular case, the proposed stigmergic algorithm is the naive algorithm. Again, group architecture and learning are major research themes in addressing this problem. Other interesting task domains that have received attention in the literature include multirobot security systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, landmine detection and clearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, robotic structural support systems (i.e., keeping structures stable in case of, say, an earthquake) <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, map making <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>, and assembly of objects using multiple robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[175]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organization of Paper</head><p>With respect to our above definition of cooperative behavior, we find that the great majority of the cooperative robotics literature centers on the mechanism of cooperation (i.e., few works study a task without also claiming some novel approach to achieving cooperation). Thus, our study has led to the synthesis of five "Research Axes" which we believe comprise the major themes of investigation to date into the underlying mechanism of cooperation.</p><p>Section 2 of this paper describes these axes, which are: 2.1 Group Architecture, 2.2 Resource Conflict, 2.3 Origin of Cooperation, 2.4 Learning, and 2.5 Geometric Problems. In Section 3, we present more synthetic reviews of cooperative robotics: Section 3.1 discusses constraints arising from technological limitations; and Section 3.2 discusses possible lacunae in existing work (e.g., formalisms for measuring performance of a cooperative robot system), then reviews three fields which we believe must strongly influence future work. We conclude in Section 4 with a list of key research challenges facing the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Research Axes</head><p>Seeking a mechanism of cooperation may be rephrased as the "cooperative behavior design problem": Given a group of robots, an environment, and a task, how should cooperative behavior arise? In some sense, every work in cooperative robotics has addressed facets of this problem, and the major research axes of the field follow from elements of this problem. (Note that certain basic robot interactions are not task-performing interactions per se, but are rather basic primitives upon which task-performing interactions can be built, e.g., following ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and many others) or flocking <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. It might be argued that these interactions entail "control and coordination" tasks rather than "cooperation" tasks, but our treatment does not make such a distinction).</p><p>First, the realization of cooperative behavior must rely on some infrastructure, the group architecture. This encompasses such concepts as robot heterogeneity/homogeneity, the ability of a given robot to recognize and model other robots, and communication structure. Second, for multiple robots to inhabit a shared environment, manipulate objects in the environment, and possibly communicate with each other, a mechanism is needed to resolve resource conflicts. The third research axis, origins of cooperation, refers to how cooperative behavior is actually motivated and achieved. Here, we do not discuss instances where cooperation has been "explicitly engineered" into the robots' behavior since this is the default approach. Instead, we are more interested in biological parallels (e.g., to social insect behavior), game-theoretic justifications for cooperation, and concepts of emergence. Because adaptability and flexibility are essential traits in a task-solving group of robots, we view learning as a fourth key to achieving cooperative behavior. One important mechanism in generating cooperation, namely, task decomposition and allocation, is not considered a research axis since (i) very few works in cooperative robotics have centered on task decomposition and allocation (with the notable exceptions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>), (ii) cooperative robot tasks (foraging, box-pushing) in the literature are simple enough that decomposition and allocation are not required in the solution, and (iii) the use of decomposition and allocation depends almost entirely on the group architectures (e.g. whether it is centralized or decentralized). Note that there is also a related, geometric problem of optimizing the allocation of tasks spatially. This has been recently studied in the context of the division of the search of a work area by multiple robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. Whereas the first four axes are related to the generation of cooperative behavior, our fifth and final axis -geometric problemscovers research issues that are tied to the embedding of robot tasks in a two-or three-dimensional world. These issues include multi-agent path planning, moving to formation, and pattern generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Group Architecture</head><p>The architecture of a computing system has been defined as "the part of the system that remains unchanged unless an external agent changes it" <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[165]</ref>. The group architecture of a cooperative robotic system provides the infrastructure upon which collective behaviors are implemented, and determines the capabilities and limitations of the system. We now briefly discuss some of the key architectural features of a group architecture for mobile robots: centralization/decentralization, differentiation, communications, and the ability to model other agents. We then describe several rep-resentative systems that have addressed these specific problems.</p><p>Centralization/Decentralization The most fundamental decision that is made when defining a group architecture is whether the system is centralized or decentralized, and if it is decentralized, whether the system is hierarchical or distributed. Centralized architectures are characterized by a single control agent. Decentralized architectures lack such an agent. There are two types of decentralized architectures: distributed architectures in which all agents are equal with respect to control, and hierarchical architectures which are locally centralized. Currently, the dominant paradigm is the decentralized approach.</p><p>The behavior of decentralized systems is often described using such terms as "emergence" and "self-organization." It is widely claimed that decentralized architectures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>) have several inherent advantages over centralized architectures, including fault tolerance, natural exploitation of parallelism, reliability, and scalability. However, we are not aware of any published empirical or theoretical comparison that supports these claims directly. Such a comparison would be interesting, particularly in scenarios where the team of robots is relatively small (e.g., two robots pushing a box), and it is not clear whether the scaling properties of decentralization offset the coordinative advantage of centralized systems.</p><p>In practice, many systems do not conform to a strict centralized/decentralized dichotomy, e.g., many largely decentralized architectures utilize "leader" agents. We are not aware of any instances of systems that are completely centralized, although there are some hybrid centralized/decentralized architectures wherein there is a central planner that exerts high-level control over mostly autonomous agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Differentiation We define a group of robots to be homogeneous if the capabilities of the individual robots are identical, and heterogeneous otherwise. In general, heterogeneity introduces complexity since task allocation becomes more difficult, and agents have a greater need to model other individuals in the group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> has intro-duced the concept of task coverage, which measures the ability of a given team member to achieve a given task. This parameter is an index of the demand for cooperation: when task coverage is high, tasks can be accomplished without much cooperation, but otherwise, cooperation is necessary. Task coverage is maximal in homogeneous groups, and decreases as groups become more heterogeneous (i.e., in the limit only one agent in the group can perform any given task).</p><p>The literature is currently dominated by works that assume homogeneous groups of robots. However, some notable architectures can handle heterogeneity, e.g., ACTRESS and ALLIANCE (see Section 2.1 below). In heterogeneous groups, task allocation may be determined by individual capabilities, but in homogeneous systems, agents may need to differentiate into distinct roles that are either known at design-time, or arise dynamically at run-time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Communication Structures</head><p>The communication structure of a group determines the possible modes of inter-agent interaction. We characterize three major types of interactions that can be supported. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> proposes a more detailed taxonomy of communication structures).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction via environment</head><p>The simplest, most limited type of interaction occurs when the environment itself is the communication medium (in effect, a shared memory), and there is no explicit communication or interaction between agents. This modality has also been called "cooperation without communication" by some researchers. Systems that depend on this form of interaction include <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction via sensing</head><p>Corresponding to arms-length relationships in organization theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, interaction via sensing refers to local interactions that occur between agents as a result of agents sensing one another, but without explicit communication. This type of interaction requires the ability of agents to distinguish between other agents in the group and other objects in the environment, which is called "kin recognition" in some literatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. Interaction via sensing is indispensable for modeling of other agents (see Section 2.1.4 below). Because of hardware limitations, interaction via sensing has often been emulated using radio or infrared communications. However, several recent works attempt to implement true interaction via sensing, based on vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>. Collective behaviors that can use this kind of interaction include flocking and pattern formation (keeping in formation with nearest neighbors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction via communications</head><p>The third form of interaction involves explicit communication with other agents, by either directed or broadcast intentional messages (i.e. the recipient(s) of the message may be either known or unknown). Because architectures that enable this form of communication are similar to communication networks, many standard issues from the field of networks arise, including the design of network topologies and communications protocols. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[168]</ref> a media access protocol (similar to that of Ethernet) is used for inter-robot communication. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, robots with limited communication range communicate to each other using the "hello-call" protocol, by which they establish "chains" in order to extend their effective communication ranges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> describes methods for communicating to many ("zillions") robots, including a variety of schemes ranging from broadcast channels (where a message is sent to all other robots in the system) to modulated retroreflection (where a master sends out a laser signal to slaves and interprets the response by the nature of the reflection). <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[174]</ref> describes and simulates a wireless CSMA/CD ( Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection ) protocol for the distributed robotic systems.</p><p>There are also communication mechanisms designed specially for multiple-robot systems. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref> proposes the "sign-board" as a communication mechanism for distributed robotic systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> gives a communication protocol modeled after diffusion, wherein local communication similar to chemical communication mechanisms in animals is used. The communication is engineered to decay away at a preset rate. Similar communications mechanisms are studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Additional work on communication can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[185]</ref>, which analyzes optimal group sizes for local communications and communication delays. In a related vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[186]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[187]</ref> analyzes optimal local communication ranges in broadcast communication.</p><p>Modeling of Other Agents Modeling the intentions, beliefs, actions, capabilities, and states of other agents can lead to more effective cooperation between robots. Communications requirements can also be lowered if each agent has the capability to model other agents. Note that the modeling of other agents entails more than implicit communication via the environment or perception: modeling requires that the modeler has some representation of another agent, and that this representation can be used to make inferences about the actions of the other agent.</p><p>In cooperative robotics, agent modeling has been explored most extensively in the context of manipulating a large object. Many solutions have exploited the fact that the object can serve as a common medium by which the agents can model each other.</p><p>The second of two box-pushing protocols in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> can achieve "cooperation without communication" since the object being manipulated also functions as a "communication channel" that is shared by the robot agents; other works capitalize on the same concept to derive distributed control laws which rely only on local measures of force, torque, orientation, or distance, i.e., no explicit communication is necessary (cf. <ref type="bibr">[153] [73]</ref>). In a two-robot bar carrying task, Fukuda and Sekiyama's agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> each uses a probabilistic model of the other agent. When a risk threshold is exceeded, an agent communicates with its partner to maintain coordination. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the theory of information invariants is used to show that extra hardware capabilities can be added in order to infer the actions of the other agent, thus reducing communication requirements. This is in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>, where the robots achieve box pushing but are not aware of each other at all. For a more complex task involving the placement of five desks in <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>, a homogeneous group of four robots share a ceiling camera to get positional information, but do not communicate with each other. Each robot relies on modeling of other agents to detect con-flicts of paths and placements of desks, and to change plans accordingly.</p><p>Representative Architectures All systems implement some group architecture.

The system is dynamically reconfigurable in that basic autonomous "cells" (robots), which can be physically coupled to other cells, dynamically reconfigure their structure to an "optimal" configuration in response to changing environments. In the CEBOT hierarchy there are "master cells" that coordinate subtasks and communicate with other master cells. A solution to the problem of electing these master cells was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>. Formation of structured cellular modules from a population of initially separated cells was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. Communications requirements have been studied extensively with respect to the CEBOT architecture, and various methods have been proposed that seek to reduce communication requirements by making individual cells more intelligent (e.g., enabling them to model the behavior of other cells). <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> studies the problem of modeling the behavior of other cells, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> present a control method that calculates the goal of a cell based on its previous goal and on its master's goal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> gives a means of estimating the amount of information exchanged between cells, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref> gives a heuristic for finding master cells for a binary communication tree.

In GOFER, a central task planning and scheduling system (CTPS) communicates with all robots and has a global view of both the tasks to be performed and the availability of robots to perform the tasks. The CTPS generates a plan structure (template for an instance of a plan) and informs all available robots of the pending goals and plan structures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Resource Conflict</head><p>When a single indivisible resource is requested by multiple robots, resource conflict arises. This issue has been studied in many guises, notably the mutual exclusion problem in distributed algorithms and the multiaccess problem in computer networks. With multiple robots, resource conflict occurs when there is a need to share space, manipulable objects or communication media. Few works have dealt specifically with object sharing or sharing of communication media (i.e., sharing of communication media is usually achieved using very basic techniques -wireless LAN, straightforward time-division multiplexing, or broadcast over an RF channel; recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[187]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[186]</ref> have considered some problems in sharing communications channels). We therefore center on the space sharing problem, which has been studied primarily via multiple-robot path planning (the "traffic control" formulation from above) and the collision and deadlock avoidance problems.</p><p>In a multi-robot system, each robot can conceivably plan a path that accounts for other robots and the global environment via configuration space-time, explicit models of other agents, or other techniques For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> proposes a "hierarchical prediction model" which essentially uses simulation to achieve collision avoid-ance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref> considers the problem of crossing an intersection: event transforms into the local spacetime coordinate frame of a robot are applied, and each robot (i) iteratively updates the local frame and its objects, (ii) evaluates collision risk, and (iii) generates a modified path depending on the collision risk. (See also Section 2.5). However, researchers considering real-world multi-robot systems typically conclude that planning paths in advance is impossible. Thus, robots are often restricted to prescribed paths or roads, with rules (much like traffic laws in the human world) and communications used to avoid collision and deadlock <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Grossman <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> classifies instances of the traffic control problem into three types: (i) restricted roads, (ii) multiple possible roads with robots selecting autonomously between them, and (iii) multiple possible roads with centralized traffic control. When individual robots possess unique roads from one point to another, no conflict is possible; when there is global knowledge and centralized control, it is easy to prevent conflict. Thus, the interesting case is (ii), where robots are allowed to autonomously select roads. Analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> shows that restricted roads are highly suboptimal, and that the autonomous road choice coupled with a greedy policy for escaping blocked situations is far more effective (cf. "modest cooperation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref>, where robots are assumed to be benevolent for the common good of the system).</p><p>Solutions to the traffic control problem range from rule-based solutions to approaches with antecedents in distributed processing. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>, robots follow pre-planned paths and use rules for collision avoidance. Example rules include "keep-right", "stop at intersection", and "keep sufficient space to the robot in front of you". <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> solves collision avoidance using two simple rules and a communication protocol that resolves conflict by transmitting individual priorities based on the task requirement, the environment, and the robot performance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[188]</ref>, the robots stop at an intersection and indicate both the number of robots at the intersection and the directions in which they are traveling. If deadlock is possible, each robot performs "shunting" (trying to obtain high priority) and proceeds according to the agreed-upon priorities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[166]</ref> takes a distributed computing approach to traffic control, where the particular problem solved is to keep the number of robots traveling on any given path below a threshold value. Robots use a mutual exclusion protocol to compete for the right to travel on each path. Wang and Beni <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref> adapt two distributed algorithms to solve two problems in their CRS/SWARM architecture. The "n-way intersection problem" is solved using an algorithm similar to mutual exclusion, and the "knot detection problem" is solved using an algorithm similar to distributed deadlock detection.</p></div>

An interesting research problem is to study how cooperation can arise without explicit human motivation among possibly selfish agents.</p><p>McFarland <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> distinguishes between two significantly different types of group behaviors that are found in nature: eusocial behavior and cooperative behavior. Eusocial behavior is found in many insect species (e.g., colonies of ants or bees), and is the result of genetically determined individual behavior. In eusocial societies, individual agents are not very capable, but seemingly intelligent behavior arises out of their interactions. This "cooperative" behavior is necessary for the survival of the individuals in the colonies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[177]</ref> studies the evolution of herding behavior in "prey" agents in a simulated ecology, where there is no a priori drive for cooperation. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref> have laid the initial groundwork to address the problem of emergent cooperation in an ecological system inhabited by actual mobile robots. In their ecosystem, individual robots are selfish, utility-driven agents that must cooperate in order to survive (i.e., maintain some minimal energy level).</p><p>On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> defines cooperative behavior as the social behavior observed in higher animals (vertebrates); i.e., cooperation is the result of interactions between selfish agents. Unlike eusocial behavior, cooperative behavior is not motivated by innate behavior, but by an intentional desire to cooperate in order to maximize individual utility.</p><p>Inspired by economics and game-theoretic approaches, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> [62] [142] <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref> and others have studied the emergence of cooperation in selfish rational agents in the field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Geometric Problems</head><p>Because mobile robots can move about in the physical world and must interact with each other physically, geometric problems are inherent to multiple-robot systems. This is a fundamental property that distinguishes multiple-robot systems from traditional distributed computer systems in which individual nodes are stationary. Geometric problems that have been studied in the cooperative robotics literature include multiplerobot path planning, moving to (and maintaining) formation, and pattern generation.</p><p>(Multiple-Robot) Path Planning Recall that multiple-robot path planning requires agents to plan routes that do not intersect. This is a case of resource conflict, since the agents and their goals are embedded in a finite amount of space. However, we note path planning separately because of its intrinsic geometric flavor as well as its historical importance in the literature.</p><p>Detailed reviews of path planning are found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Fujimura <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> views path planning as either centralized (with a universal path-planner making decisions) or distributed (with individual agents planning and adjusting their paths). Arai and Ota <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> make a similar distinction in the nature of the planner, and also allow hybrid systems that can be combinations of on-line, off-line, centralized, or decentralized. Latombe <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref> gives a somewhat different taxonomy: his "centralized planning" is planning that takes into account all robots, while "decoupled" planning entails planning the path of each robot independently. For centralized planning, several methods originally used for single-robot systems can be applied. For decoupled planning, two approaches are given: (i) prioritized planning considers one robot at a time according to a global priority, while (ii) the path coordination method essentially plans paths by scheduling the configuration space-time resource. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> is a typical decoupled approach where every robot is prioritized and robots plan global paths with respect to only higher-priority robots (e.g., the highest-priority robot plans only around the obstacles in the environment). Note that this is still a centralized method according to the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[183]</ref> presents a distributed approach (per Fujimura's taxonomy) where each robot initially attempts a straight-line path to the goal; if an interfering obstacle is seen, then the robot will scan the visible vertices of the obstacle and move toward the closest one. In general, this continues until the goal is reached. Dynamically varying priorities are given to each robot (based on current need) to resolve path intersection conflicts, and conflicting robots can either negotiate among themselves or allow a global blackboard manager to perform this function.</p><p>Some recent works have addressed some nontraditional motion planning problems. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> proposes an algorithm for path planning in tethered robots, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref> consider the problem of moving while grasping large objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Formation and Marching Problems</head><p>The Formation and Marching problems respectively require multiple robots to form up and move in a specified pattern. Solving these problems is quite interesting in terms of distributed algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>, balancing between global and local knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>, and intrinsic information requirements for a given task. Solutions to Formation and Marching are also useful primitives for larger tasks, e.g., moving a large object by a group of robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref> [37] <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> or distributed sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[170]</ref>.</p><p>The Formation problem seems very difficult, e.g., no published work has yet given a distributed "circle-forming" algorithm that guarantees the robots will actually end up in a circle. For this problem, the best known solution is the distributed algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>, which guarantees only that the robots will end up in a shape of constant diameter (e.g., a Reuleaux triangle can be the result). It is assumed that the i th mobile robot knows the distances D i and d i to its farthest and nearest neighbors, respectively; the algorithm attempts to match the ratios D i /d i to a prescribed constant. No method of detecting termination was given. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> extend the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> to incorporate collision avoidance when the robots are moving. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[180]</ref> approaches the shape-generation problem using systems of linear equations; starting at some initial location, each robot changes its (x, y) position according to a linear function of its neighbors' positions and some fixed con-stant. Simulations of the method show that a group of initially collinear robots will converge into the shape of an arc.</p><p>We observe that the circle-forming problem, while quite simple to state, reveals several pitfalls in formulating distributed geometric tasks. For example, the ability of an individual agent to sense attributes of the formation must be carefully considered: too much information makes the problem trivial, but too little information (e.g., returns from localized sensors) may prevent a solution (e.g., robots may never find each other). Information lower bounds, e.g., for robots to be able to realize that they have achieved the prescribed formation, are also largely unexplored in the literature. Interestingly, we note that the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> can be slightly modified: rather than each robot seeking to achieve a prescribed ratio D/d, each robot could seek to achieve a prescribed angle (close to 90 degrees) subtended by its farthest neighbor and its closest neighbor to the right. This uses very similar sensing capabilities but guarantees the desired circular shape.</p><p>For Marching, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> employs positional constraint conditions in a group of robots that makes turns while maintaining an array pattern. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> a leader-follower approach is used to solve a similar task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> studies the problem of keeping four marching robots in a side-by-side formation; this increases in difficulty when the leader has to perform obstacle avoidance or other maneuvers. Parker also defines the concepts of global goals and global/local knowledge. To study the effects of different distributions of global goals and global knowledge, four strategies are compared both in simulation and on mobile robots. Simplified instances of the Marching problem require robots to reliably follow each other and to move in a group (without tight constraints on their relative positions). Some works that address this problem (sometimes referred to as the herding/flocking problem) include <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>. A somewhat related problem is the problem of cooperative positioning (determining the locations of the robots in a group using limited information) <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>.</p><p>Related to the Formation problem is the pattern generation problem in Cellular Robotic Systems, multiple-robot systems which can "encode information as patterns of its own structural units" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Typically, one-or two-dimensional grids constitute the workspace, and sensing of neighboring cells is the only input. Within these constraints, a set of rules is devised and applied to all agents; a standard result is to show in simulation that convergence to some spatial pattern is guaranteed. The meaningful aspect of this work lies in providing a system with the capability of spatial self-organization: a CRS will reconfigure itself without intervention in certain situations or under certain conditions.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[170]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>, a CRS is characterized as an arbitrary number of robots in a one-or twodimensional grid. The robots are able to sense neighboring cells and communicate with other robots via a signboard mechanism. Protocols are presented for creating different patterns, e.g., alternating robots and spaces in a one-dimensional grid; covering the top row of a two-dimensional grid by robots; or covering the boundary of a twodimensional grid by robots. Egecioglu and Zimmermann <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> pose the "Random Pairing" problem, and seek a set of rules by which for any given number, a CRS will converge to a pattern such that there is a group of two robots with that number of vacant spaces between them (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). An analogous cellular approach is adopted by Genovese et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, who describe the simulation of a system of pollutant-seeking mobile robots. The simulation uses a potential field mechanism to attract robots to the pollutant and to repulse robots from each other. The combined effect of these two forces yields a gradient pattern that "points" toward the source of the pollutant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Perspectives</head><p>As an integrative engineering discipline, robotics has always had to confront technological constraints that limit the domains that can be studied. Cooperative robotics has been subject to these same constraints, but the constraints tend to be more severe because of the need to cope with multiple robots. At the same time, cooperative robotics is a highly interdisciplinary field that offers the opportunity to draw influences from many other domains. In this section, we first outline some of the technological constraints that face the field. We then mention some directions in which cooperative robotics might progress, and describe related fields that have provided and will continue to provide influences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Technological Constraints</head><p>It is clear that technological constraints have limited the scope of implementations and task domains attempted in multiple-robot research systems.</p><p>One obvious problem that arises is the general problem of researchers having to solve various instances of the vision problem before being able to make progress on "higher-level" problems. Often, difficulties arising from having to solve difficult perceptual problems can limit the range of tasks that can be implemented on a multiple-robot platform. For example, in cooperative robotics systems where modeling of other agents (see Section 2.1) is used, the lack of an effective sensor array can render the system unimplementable in practice. In addition, robot hardware is also notoriously unreliable; as a result, it is extremely difficult to maintain a fleet of robots in working condition. Again, collective robotics must deal with all of the hardware problems of single-robotic systems, exacerbated by the multiplicity of agents.</p><p>Due to the difficulties (such as those outlined above) encountered when working with real robots, much of collective robotics has been studied exclusively in simulation. Some researchers have argued (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>) that by ignoring most of the difficulties associated with perception and actuation, simulations ignore the most difficult problems of robotics. By making overly simplistic assumptions, it is possible to generate "successful" systems in simulation that would be infeasible in the real world. (Conversely, mobile research robots can also come to "look like the simulator", i.e., circular footprint, sonar ring, synchro-drive is a common configuration.) Nevertheless, simulation must inevitably play a role in multi-agent robotics at some level. Although it is currently possible for researchers to study groups of 10-20 robots, it is unlikely that truly large-scale collective behavior involving hundreds or thousands of real robots will be feasible at any time in the near future. Thus, cooperative mobile robot re-searchers have used a variety of techniques to simulate perception, while using physical robots. For instance, the use of a global positioning system can in part compensate for the lack of vision, but can place severe environmental constraints under which robots can operate (because many objects and acoustic features of the environment can interfere with the GPS). For the basic problem of differentiating between other agents and all other objects in the environment. some researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> use radio communication to solve this problem. In other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> interaction via sensing is done by explicit radio communication. There are recent attempts to perform recognition via vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>.</p><p>An approach taken by some researchers is to use simulations as prototypes for larger-scale studies, and small numbers of real robots as a proof-ofconcept demonstration <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. On the other hand, some researchers, citing the necessity of working in the real world domain, have chosen to eschew simulations altogether and implement their theories directly on actual robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> [116] <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref>. In studies of locomotion in large herds of (upto 100) one-legged robots and simulated human cyclists, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> [29] take an alternate approach of design a very physically realistic simulation. While this approach brings realism to actuation, the issue of perception is still simulated away; it is still unclear whether it will be feasible to realistically model sophisticated agents in more complex environments, or whether the effort will outweigh the benefits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Towards a Science of Cooperative Robotics</head><p>The field of cooperative mobile robotics offers an incredibly rich application domain, integrating a huge number of distinct fields from the social sciences, life sciences, and engineering. That so many theories have been brought to bear on "cooperative robotics" clearly shows the energy and the allure of the field. Yet, cooperative robotics is still an emerging field, and many open directions remain. In this subsection, we point out some promising directions that have yet to be fully explored by the research community. By way of a preface, we also point out three "cultural" changes which may come as the field matures: (1) Because of the youth of the field, cooperative robotics research has been necessarily rather informal and "concept" oriented. However, the development of rigorous formalisms is desirable to clarify various assumptions about the systems being discussed, and to obtain a more precise language for discussion of elusive concepts such as cooperation (there are some exceptions, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>, which presents a formalization of motivational behavior in the ALLIANCE architecture). ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) Formal metrics for cooperation and system performance, as well as for grades of cooperation, are noticeably missing from the literature. While the notion of cooperation is difficult to formalize, such metrics will be very useful in characterizing various systems, and would improve our understanding of the nature of agent interactions. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> has suggested parameters such as agent density for estimating interference in a multi-robot system, much more work in this area is necessary.</p><p>(3) Experimental studies might become more rigorous and thorough, e.g., via standard benchmark problems and algorithms. This is challenging in mobile robotics, given the noisy, system-specific nature of the field. Nevertheless, it is necessary for claims about "robustness" and "near-optimality" to be appropriately quantified, and for dependencies on various control parameters to be better understood. For example, we have noted that despite a number of claims that various decentralized approaches are superior to centralized approaches, we have not seen any thorough, published experimental comparisons between the major competing paradigms on a particular task. However, we note that recently, researchers have begun to empirically study quantitative measures of cooperation, trying to identify conditions under which mechanisms for cooperation are beneficial <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, several basic analogies remain incomplete, and must be revisited and resynthesized as the field matures. For instance, many multi-robot problems are "canonical" for distributed computation and are interesting primarily when viewed in this light. A typical example is moving to formation, which has been solved optimally in the computational geometry literature (it is the "geometric matching under isometry" problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>), but which is difficult in the distributed context due to issues like synchronization, fault-tolerance, leader election, etc. However, the distributed context can be selectively ignored, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> use "human intervention" to perform what is essentially leader election (breaking symmetry in a circle of robots to choose vertices of the desired polygonal formation). The introduction of such devices runs counter to the implicit assumption that it is the distributed problem that holds research interest.</p><p>More generally, it is likely that more structural and less superficial analogies with other disciplines will be needed in order to obtain "principled" theories of cooperation among (mobile) robots; integration of formalisms and methodologies developed in these more mature disciplines is likely to be an important step in the development of cooperative robotics. Disciplines most critical to the growth of cooperative robotics are: distributed artificial intelligence, biology, and distributed systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distributed Artificial Intelligence</head><p>The field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) concerns itself with the study of distributed systems of intelligent agents. As such, this field is highly relevant to cooperative robotics. Bond and Gasser <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> define DAI as "the subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with concurrency in AI computations, at many levels." Grounded in traditional symbolic AI and the social sciences, DAI is composed of two major areas of study: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Multiagent Systems (MAS).</p><p>Research in DPS is concerned with the issue of solving a single problem using many agents. Agents can cooperate by independently solving subproblems (task-sharing), and by periodically communicating partial solutions to each other (result-sharing). DPS involves three possibly overlapping phases: (i) problem decomposition (task allocation), (ii) subproblem solution, and (iii) solution synthesis. Of these, problem decomposition has attracted the greatest interest among DAI researchers. The critical issue in task sharing is finding the appropriate agent to assign to a subproblem. This is nontrivial, since if the most appropriate agent for a subtask is not obvious, then the system must try to determine which of the many eligible agents should be assigned the task, and often there are too many eligible agents to attempt an exhaustive search. Perhaps the best known scheme for task allocation is the Contract Net Protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>, which has been used in the ACTRESS <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> and GOFER <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> projects.</p><p>One important assumption in DPS is that the agents are predisposed to cooperate. Research in DPS is thus concerned with developing frameworks for cooperative behavior between willing agents, rather than developing frameworks to enforce cooperation between potentially incompatible agents, as is the case with multiagent systems and distributed processing.</p><p>Multiagent Systems (MAS) research is the study of the collective behavior of a group of possibly heterogeneous agents with potentially conflicting goals. In other words, researchers in MAS discard the "benevolent agent" assumption of DPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> states the central problem of MAS research as follows: "in a world in which we get to design only our own intelligent agent, how should it interact with other intelligent agents?" Therefore, areas of interest in MAS research include game-theoretic analysis of multiagent interactions (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>), reasoning about other agents' goals, beliefs, and actions (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>), and analysis of the complexity of social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>.</p><p>Work in MAS has tended to be theoretical and in very abstract domains. A common underlying assumption is that although the agents may be selfish, they are rational and highly deliberative. This is in stark contrast with research in swarm intelligence (see Section 2.5), in which individual agents are assumed to be relatively unintelligent.</p><p>However, the influence of DAI on cooperative robotics has been limited. This is in part because researchers in DAI have mostly concentrated on domains where uncertainty is not as much of an issue as it is in the physical world. Work in MAS has tended to be theoretical and in very abstract domains where perfect sensing is usually assumed; typical DPS domains are in disembodied, knowledge-based systems. Another assumption of DAI that has prevented its application in cooperative robotics is the assumption is that although agents may be selfish, they are rational and highly deliberative. However, achieving strict criteria of rationality and deliberativeness can often be prohibitively expensive in current robotic systems. Thus, it has been argued that DAI, while suited for unsituated, knowledge-based systems, will not succeed in the domain of cooperative robotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. However, we observe that direct comparisons of DAI and alternative paradigms are notably missing from the literature; such comparisons are needed to evaluate the true utility of DAI techniques in cooperative robotics. Also, as lower-level processes (perception and actuation) are better understood and implemented, and as computational power increases, the highlevel results of DAI research may become increasingly applicable to collective mobile robotics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distributed Systems</head><p>A multiple-robot system is in fact a special case of a distributed system. Thus, the field of distributed systems is a natural source of ideas and solutions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> describes cellular robotics as belonging to the general field of distributed computing. It is noted, however, that distributed computing can only contribute general theoretical foundations and that further progress needs to be made concerning the application of such methods to collective robotics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref> states, "a distributed computing system contains a collection of computing devices which may reside in geographically separated locations called sites." By noting the similarities with distributed computing, theories pertaining to deadlock <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[170]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>, message passing <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref> and resource allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[166]</ref>, and the combination of the above as primitives <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[169]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[173]</ref>, have been applied to collective robotics in a number of works.</p><p>In work done on multiple AGV systems and Distributed Robotic Systems, deadlock detection and resource allocation methods are applied to allow many robots to share the limited resource of path space <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[166]</ref>. Pattern generation in a CRS may also rely on distributed computing to resolve conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[166]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref>. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[167]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[168]</ref> describe a task allocation algorithm where the robots vie for the right to participate in a task. See also the discussion in Section 2.1 and Section 2.5.</p><p>Broadcast communication, which is widely assumed in cooperative robotics, exhibits poor scaling properties. As robots become more numerous and widely distributed, techniques and issues from the field of computer networks become relevant. A rich body of research on algorithms, protocols, performance modeling and analysis in computer networks can be applied to cooperative robotics. There is currently a great amount of effort being put into studying networking issues related to mobile/nomadic/ubiquitous computing (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[176]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). Results from this field could be applied in a straightforward way to multirobot systems.</p><p>Finally, distributed control is a promising framework for the coordination of multiple robots. Due to difficulty of sensing and communication, a parsimonious formulation which can coordinate robots having minimal sensing and communication capabilities is desirable. In an ideal scenario, maximal fault tolerance is possible, modeling of other agents is unnecessary, and each agent is controlled by a very simple mechanism. A distributed control scheme (known as the GUR game) developed originally by <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref> and recently studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref> provides a framework in which groups of agents with minimal sensing capability and no communication are controlled by simple finite state automata and converge to optimal behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref> describes possible cooperative robotics applications in moving platform control and perimeter guarding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology</head><p>Biological analogies and influences abound in the field of cooperative robotics. The majority of existing work in the field has cited biological systems as inspiration or justification. Well-known collective behaviors of ants, bees, and other eusocial insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[179]</ref> provide striking existence proofs that systems composed of simple agents can accomplish sophisticated tasks in the real world. It is widely held that the cognitive capabilities of these insects are very limited, and that complex behaviors emerge out of interactions between the agents, which are individually obeying simple rules. Thus, rather than following the AI tradition of modeling robots as rational, deliberative agents, some researchers in cooperative robotics have chosen to take a more "bottom-up" approach in which individual agents are more like antsthey follow simple rules, and are highly reactive (this is the approach taken in the field of Artificial Life). Works based on this insect-colony analogy include <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The pattern generation of CRS's can also be considered as bottom-up (see Section 2.5), since each robot is designed as a very simple agent which follows a set of prespecified rules.</p><p>A more general, biological metaphor that is often used in cooperative robotics is the concept of a self-organizing system <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[182]</ref>. (Note that researchers from many fields have studied self-organization; it is by no means an exclusively biological concept. However, in the field of cooperative robotics, references to selforganization have often been made in a biological context.) The behavior of insect colonies described above can be characterized more generally as that of self-organizing systems. Representative work that is based on this concept includes <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[170]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Self-organization in multi-cellular biological systems has been an inspiration for <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Hierarchical organization of biological multi-cellular organisms (i.e., from cellular to tissue to organism level) has been used as a guiding metaphor for cellular robotics in the CEBOT project <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Biological analogies have also influenced the choice of task domains studied in cooperative robotics. While foraging is a natural abstraction of some practical applications such as waste retrieval and search and rescue, one major reason that it has become identified as the canonical cooperative robotic task is that it is a natural task, given the group architectures resulting from analogies to insect colonies. Another example of this phenomenon is the flocking/herding task. It seems no accident that biological inspirations led to "natural" models of group motion, as opposed to more structured models of coordinated motion (such as moving in some arbitrary formation).</p><p>Finally, as we noted in Section 2.4, there have been some biological influences on the learning and optimization algorithms used to tune control parameters in multiple-robot systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>We have synthesized a view of the theoretical bases for research in cooperative mobile robotics. Key research axes in the field were identified, particularly with respect to achieving a "mechanism of cooperation", and existing works were surveyed in this framework. We then discussed technological constraints and interdisciplinary influences that have shaped the field, and offered some general precepts for future growth of the field. Finally, we identified distributed artificial intelligence, biology, and distributed systems as disciplines that are most relevant to cooperative robotics, and which are most likely to continue to provide valuable influences. Based on our synthesis, a number of open research areas become apparent. We believe that the following are among the major, yet tractable, challenges for the near future: 1. robust definitions and metrics for various forms of cooperation, 2. achieving a more complete theory of information requirements for task-solving in spatial domains, perhaps for the canonical tasks of pattern formation or distributed sensing (e.g., measures of pattern complexity, information lower bounds for pattern recognition and maintenance, abstraction of sensor models from the solution approach). The works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> have begun to address this issue, in the context of object manipulation tasks; interestingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> observes that given a robot system, some tasks are strongly cooperative -the robots must act in concert to achieve the goal, and the strategy for the task is not trivially serializable. 3. principled transfer of the concepts of faulttolerance and reliability from the field of distributed and fault-tolerant computing, 4. incorporation of recent ideas in distributed control to achieve oblivious cooperation, or cooperation without communication (e.g., when robots have minimal sensing and communication capabilities), 5. achieving cooperation within competitive situations (e.g., for robot soccer, or pursuit-evasion with multiple pursuers and evaders). An interesting open problem is how well solutions that have been developed in discretized abstractions of these domains (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>) translate to the physical world.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref> [126] [127] [125] [4] [5].</figDesc></figure>
