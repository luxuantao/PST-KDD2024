<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents a procedure for the analysis of left-right (bilateral) asymmetry in mammograms. The procedure is based upon the detection of linear directional components by using a multiresolution representation based upon Gabor wavelets. A particular wavelet scheme with two-dimensional Gabor filters as elementary functions with varying tuning frequency and orientation, specifically designed in order to reduce the redundancy in the wavelet-based representation, is applied to the given image. The filter responses for different scales and orientation are analyzed by using the Karhunen-Loève (KL) transform and Otsu's method of thresholding. The KL transform is applied to select the principal components of the filter responses, preserving only the most relevant directional elements appearing at all scales. The selected principal components, thresholded by using Otsu's method, are used to obtain the magnitude and phase of the directional components of the image. Rose diagrams computed from the phase images and statistical measures computed thereof are used for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the oriented patterns. A total of 80 images from 20 normal cases, 14 asymmetric cases, and six architectural distortion cases from the Mini-MIAS (Mammographic Image Analysis Society, London, U.K.) database were used to evaluate the scheme using the leave-one-out methodology. Average classification accuracy rates of up to 74.4% were achieved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>visual system decomposes retinal images into a number of filtered images, each of which contains intensity variations over a narrow range of frequency and orientation. Marcelja <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Jones and Palmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> demonstrated that simple cells in the primary visual cortex have receptive fields that are restricted to small regions of space and are highly structured and that their behavior corresponds to local measurements of frequency.</p><p>According to Daugman <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, one suitable model for the two-dimensional (2-D) receptive field profiles measured experimentally in mammalian cortical simple cells is the parameterized family of 2-D Gabor functions. Jones and Palmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Daugman <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> showed that a majority of cortical cells have 2-D receptive field profiles that can be well fit, in the sense of a statistical test, by members of the family of 2-D Gabor elementary functions. Another important characteristic of Gabor functions or filters is their optimal joint resolution in both space and frequency, which suggests that Gabor filters are appropriate operators for tasks requiring simultaneous measurement in the two domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Except for the optimal joint resolution possessed by the Gabor functions, the difference of Gaussian (DOG) and difference of offset Gaussian (DOOG) filters used by Malik and Perona <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have similar properties.</p><p>Gabor filters have been presented in several works on image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; however, most of these works are related to segmentation and analysis of texture. Rolston and Rangayyan <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed methods for directional decomposition and analysis of linear components in images using multiresolution Gabor filters.</p><p>Multiresolution analysis by using Gabor filters has natural and desirable properties for analysis of directional information in images; most of these properties are based upon biological vision studies as described previously. Other multiresolution techniques have also been used with success in addressing related topics such as texture analysis and segmentation and image enhancement. Chang and Kuo <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, for instance, developed a new method for texture classification which uses a tree-structured wavelet transform for decomposing an image. In their work, image decomposition is performed by taking into account the energy of each subimage instead of decomposing subsignals in the low-frequency channels. If the energy of a subimage is higher than a certain fixed threshold value , then the decomposition procedure is applied again; else, the decomposition is stopped in that region. The number of different tree structures used depends highly upon the value of the threshold .</p><p>Laine and Fan <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> presented a new method for computing features for texture segmentation based upon a multiscale representation. They used a discrete wavelet packet frame to decompose an image at different levels of resolution. The levels were analyzed by using two algorithms for envelope detection based upon: 1) the Hilbert transform and 2) zero crossings. Laine and Fan stated that the selection of the filters for feature extraction should take into account three important features: symmetry, frequency response, and boundary accuracy. However, it should be noted that the Gabor function is the only function that can achieve optimal joint localization (tradeoff between boundary accuracy and good frequency response).</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> performed analysis and comparison of the directional selectivity of wavelet transforms by using three different types of frequency decomposition: rectangular, hexagonal, and radial-angular decomposition. The methods were applied to detect spiculated breast masses and lung nodules. According to Li et al., the best results were achieved by using radial-angular decomposition with both mammographic and chest radiographic images. Qian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> presented three new image processing modules for mass detection in digital mammography; a tree-structured filter module for image noise suppression, a directional wavelet transform (DWT) technique for decomposition of mammographic directional features, and a tree-structure wavelet transform for image enhancement. By making the parameters of the three methods adaptive, Qian et al. improved the results obtained in their previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. In the DWT method, which is related to the technique proposed in this paper, the number of filter orientations was adaptively selected in the range 4-32, corresponding to angular bandwidth in the range 45 -5.63 . The adaptive DWT module provided the best results, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0.91. Chang and Laine <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> proposed a method designed with the goal of enhancing mammograms via oriented information. They used a set of separable steerable filters to capture subtle features at different scales and orientations spanning an overcomplete multiscale representation computed via a fast wavelet transform. By using the filtered output images, they generated a coherent image and phase information which were used by a nonlinear operator applied to the wavelet coefficients to enhance the directional information in digital mammograms. Finally, the enhanced image was obtained from the modified wavelet coefficients via an inverse fast wavelet transform.</p><p>Inspired by the studies on the Gabor function and the others mentioned above, we propose a new scheme based upon a bank of self-similar Gabor functions and the Karhunen-Loève (KL) transform to analyze directional components of images <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. The method is applied to detect global signs of asymmetry in the fibro-glandular discs of the left and right mammograms of a given subject. A brief review of asymmetry in mammograms is provided in Section II. The bank of Gabor filters is described in Section III. The procedure for directional analysis is presented in Section IV. Application of the method to mammograms is illustrated in Section V. The results are summarized in Section VI. Section VII provides some discussion and conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. ASYMMETRY IN MAMMOGRAMS</head><p>Asymmetry between the left and right mammograms of a given subject is an important sign used by radiologists to diagnose breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Analysis of asymmetry can provide clues about the presence of early signs of tumors (parenchymal distortion, small asymmetric bright spots and contrast, etc.) that are not evaluated by other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Several works have been presented in the literature addressing this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, with most of them applying some type of alignment of the breast images before performing asymmetry analysis. However, alignment procedures applied to mammograms have to confront many difficult problems such as the natural asymmetry of the breasts of a given subject, absence of good corresponding points between the left and right breast images to perform matching, and distortions inherent to breast imaging.</p><p>Procedures for systematic analysis were proposed by Lau and Bischof <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and Miller and Astley <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> to perform comparison of the corresponding anatomical regions between the left and right breast images in terms of shape, texture, and density. Lau and Bischof <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> also proposed a directional feature to quantify oriented patterns. In this paper, we propose a procedure based upon directional analysis using Gabor wavelets in order to analyze the possible presence of global disturbance between left and right mammograms in the normally symmetrical flow of breast structures. We focus our analysis only in the fibro-glandular disc regions of the mammograms segmented in a preprocessing step <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CONSTRUCTION OF GABOR WAVELETS</head><p>A 2-D Gabor function is a Gaussian modulated by a complex sinusoid. It can be specified by the frequency of the sinusoid and the standard deviations and of the Gaussian envelope as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> Despite this general form, there is no standard and precise definition of a 2-D Gabor function, with several variations appearing in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Most of these variations are related to the use of different measures of width for the Gaussian envelope and frequency of the sinusoid <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. Based upon neurophysiological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and wavelet theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, the Gabor function, normalized in an appropriate way, can be used as a mother wavelet to generate a family of nonorthogonal Gabor wavelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. However, as pointed out by Jain and Farrokhnia <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, although the Gabor function can be an admissible wavelet, by removing the dc response of the function, it does not result in an orthogonal decomposition, which means that a wavelet transform based upon the Gabor wavelet is redundant. A formal mathematical derivation of 2-D Gabor wavelets along with the computation of the frame bounds for which this family of wavelets forms a tight frame is provided by Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Despite the lack of orthogonality presented by the Gabor wavelets, the Gabor function is the only function that can achieve the theoretical limit for joint resolution of information in both the space and spatial-frequency domains.</p><p>In this work, we mean by "Gabor wavelet representation" a bank of Gabor filters normalized to have dc responses equal to zero and designed in order to have low redundancy in the representation. The Gabor wavelet representation used in this work was proposed by Manjunath and Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. The Gabor wavelets where center of the filter in the spatial domain; ; total number of orientations desired; and scale and orientation, respectively. The scale factor in ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is meant to ensure that the energy is independent of . Examples of Gabor wavelets used in this work are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) can be written in the frequency domain as</p><p>where and . The design strategy used is to project the filters so as to ensure that the half-peak magnitude supports of the filter responses in the frequency spectrum touch one another, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. By doing this, it can ensured that the filters will capture the maximum information with minimum redundancy.</p><p>Existing methods in the literature use either complex-valued Gabor filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> or pairs of Gabor filters with quadrature-phase relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In this work, the Gabor wavelet representation uses only real-valued, even-symmetric filters which are oriented over a range of 180 only, as opposed to the full 360 range commonly described in the literature. Since the Gabor filters are used to extract meaningful features from real images (and, hence, with Hermitian frequency response <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>), the response to the even-symmetric filter components will remain unchanged for filters oriented 180 out of phase and the odd-symmetric component will be negated. Thus, based upon this fact and also on psychophysical grounds provided by Malik and Perona <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Manjunath and Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> ignored half of the orientations in their Gabor representation, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In order to ensure that the designed bank of Gabor filters becomes a family of admissible 2-D Gabor wavelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, the filters must satisfy the admissibility condition of finite energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> which implies that their Fourier transforms are pure bandpass functions having zero response at dc. This condition was achieved by setting the dc gain of each filter as 0, which ensures that the filters do not respond to regions with constant intensity.</p><p>The proposed approach results in the following formulas for computing the filter parameters and :</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">)<label>4</label></formula><p>where and denote the lower and upper center frequencies of interest. The and parameters are, respectively, the number of orientations and the number of scales in the desired multiresolution decomposition procedure. The sinusoid frequency is set equal to , and . Because of the lack of orthogonality of the Gabor wavelets, the computation of the expansion coefficients becomes difficult. This task, however, is trivial when using a set of orthogonal functions, since the expansion coefficients, given by ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), are the projections of the image onto the same set of functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where denotes the inner product. In this case, the analysis and synthesis windows are the same and the original image can be reconstructed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> However, the joint localization and orthogonality of the set of functions are properties that cannot be met simultaneously. Much work has been done to overcome the problem of the lack of orthogonality of Gabor wavelets, with most of them using dual frames or biorthogonal functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, iterative methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, or adjustment of the phase-space sampling in order to obtain a reasonably tight frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. In the dual-frame approach, for instance, the set of projection coefficients of the dual frame can be obtained by minimizing the cost function <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Image of a natural texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</p><p>where is the dual frame. Regardless of the above, we would like to emphasize that, in this paper, we are only interested in image analysis without the requirement of exact reconstruction (synthesis) of the image. Therefore, instead of using the wavelet coefficients, we have used the magnitude of the filter response, computed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where indicates only the even-symmetric part of the complex Gabor filter and represents the convolution operator.</p><p>By adjusting the parameters and in the Gabor representation of Manjunath and Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, we can select only the range of the frequency spectrum to be used for multiresolution analysis. The area of each ellipse indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> represents the spectrum of frequencies covered by the respective Gabor filter. Once the range of the frequency spectrum is adjusted, the choice of the number of scales and orientation is made in order to cover the range of spectrum as required. The choice of the number of scales ( ) and orientations ( ) used in this work for processing mammographic images is based upon the resolution required for detecting oriented information with high selectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. The spatial-frequency bandwidths of the simple and complex cells in the mammalian visual system have been found to range from 0.5 to 2.5 octaves, clustering around 1.2 octaves and 1.5 octaves and their angular bandwidth is expected to be smaller than 30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Thus, by selecting 0.05, 0.45, 4, and 12 for processing mammographic images, we have indirectly adjusted the Gabor representation with a frequency bandwidth of approximately one octave and angular bandwidth of 15 . The effects of changing the , , , and parameters of the Gabor representation used in this work on frequency localization are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)-(c)</ref>.</p><p>IV. DIRECTIONAL ANALYSIS Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows a 256 256, 8-bit pixel image of a natural texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. The image will be used to describe and illustrate the method proposed for analyzing directional components.</p><p>The method starts by computing the Gabor wavelets using four scales ( 4) and 12 directions ( ). Two different sets of values for the lowest ( ) and highest ( ) center frequencies were used: 0.10 and 0.45 cycles/pixel for the texture pattern and 0.05 nd 0.45 cycles/pixel for the mammographic images. The parameters and were chosen according to the scales of the details of interest in the images. For the natural texture image, for instance, it can be seen that the directional structures appear at finer scales which are governed by higher frequencies. Thus, we have placed the lowest center frequency at a fairly high value, 0.10 cycles/pixel. For the mammographic images, the range of the frequency spectrum was adjusted around the maximum ( 0.05 and 0.45), since directional structures may appear at different scales in the image of which we may not have any prior knowledge. However, differing from other Gabor representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, it should be noted that the parameters , , , and have to be adjusted in a coordinated manner by taking into account the desirable frequency and orientation bandwidths. (In the Gabor representation of the Manjunath and Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, the filters are designed so as to represent an image with minimum redundancy; the ellipses as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> touch one another.)</p><p>The filter outputs for each orientation and the four scales were analyzed by using the KL transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. The KL transform was used to select the principal components of the filter outputs, preserving only the most relevant directional elements present in all the scales. Results were then combined as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> in order to allow the formation of an -dimensional vector ( ) for each pixel from each set of the corresponding pixels in the filtered images ( 4, as mentioned above, is the number of scales used in this work).</p><p>The vectors corresponding to each position in the filter responses were used to compute the mean vector ( ) and the covariance matrix ( ). The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix were then computed and arranged in descending order in a matrix so that the first row of is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue and the last row is the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue. The first principal components corresponding to 95% of the total variance were then selected and used to represent the oriented components in each specific orientation. The principal components were computed as . Analysis of the variance was performed by evaluating the eigenvalues of the matrix . The KL method is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the mean-squared error between the vectors and their resulting approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. The result of application of the KL transform to all orientations, as described above, is a set of images, where is the number of orientations.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> illustrates the principal components for the orientation 90 obtained for the test image in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> according to the pro- cedure described above. The eigenvalues of the matrix indicated in the caption of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> were used to select the components representing the strongest directional information. In this example, only the first three principal components with eigenvalues adding to 99.11% ( 95%) of the variance were used to compose the final component at direction 90 . Since Gabor wavelets are nonorthogonal functions, they do not have a perfect reconstruction condition. This fact results in a small amount of out-of-band energy interfering with the reconstruction, which is translated into artifacts in the reconstructed image. Although we are not performing reconstruction of the original image from the filtered images, we are interested in removing the effects of spectral leakage. To deal with this problem, the images resulting from the KL transform were thresholded by using the maximum of Otsu's threshold value <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> computed for the images.</p><p>Otsu's method is a nonparametric technique that provides a fast and simple way (derived from the zeroth-and first-order cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram) to select automatically an optimal threshold value by maximizing the following measure of class separability, commonly used in discriminant analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> (9) where is the between-class variance with the threshold being and is the total variance of the histogram. In the formulation of ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), Otsu regards the gray-level histogram, normal-Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Example of the vector filter response addition method <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> used to compute the phase and magnitude images. Only four directional components are illustrated for the sake of simplicity. ized to unit area, as a probability distribution. Only two classes are considered here: the background ( ) represented by the gray-level pixels from zero to and the objects ( ) represented by the gray-level pixels from to 255. The threshold value is then defined as the optimal gray-level threshold , in the sense of discriminant analysis, that maximizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> since is independent of the threshold level . Finally, the phase and magnitude images, indicating the local orientation, were composed by vector summation of the filtered images <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The phase and magnitude images for the test image in Fig. are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>. The algorithm for directional analysis based upon Gabor filis summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. The rose diagram or angle histogram is a graphical representation of directional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. In this representation, the area of each angle bin is proportional to the amount of information present in that specific direction. Rolston and Rangayyan <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> used such rose diagrams to characterize directional piece-wise linear objects in images. In this paper, the area of each rose diagram is normalized to unity and each bin is represented by an angular range of 15 (12 orientations). Normal-Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.

Selection of the Region of Interest</head><p>In this work, we use only the fibro-glandular disc as the region of interest (ROI) in order to compute the directional components, due to the fact that most of the directional components such as connective tissues and ligaments exist in this specific region of the breast. The fibro-glandular disc is commonly localized near the nipple, has the shape of a disc or cone, and spreads through the interior of the breast from the region near the chest wall toward the nipple <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Radiologists have noted that developing cancers are more often associated with glandular tissue than with fat <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. When a tumor occurs in the fibro-glandular disc region of the breast, the natural directional flow of the tissues converging to the nipple changes locally in terms of orientation. Thus, careful analysis of the directional components in the fibro-glandular disc can provide important information to radiologists.</p><p>In order to segment the fibro-glandular disc, we use a method that we have proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> based upon the information in the gray-level intensity distribution to estimate a statistical model representing the fat and glandular tissues in the image. The statistical method used is the maximum-likelihood method with the probability density function (p.d. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Feature Extraction</head><p>In order to characterize asymmetry in mammograms, we use three features of directional distribution obtained from a rose diagram that represents the difference between the rose diagrams computed for the left and right mammograms. Although the KL transform uses the magnitude information of the output filtered images, the features described below are based only on the phase information since the aim of this paper is focused on the analysis of directional information. a) Entropy ( ) is used to represent the scatter of the directional components in an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. If the image is composed of directional components with a uniform distribution, the entropy value will be maximum; on the other hand, if the image is composed of directional components oriented in a very narrow angle band, the entropy value will be small. The entropy measure is computed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where is the number of angle bins in the rose diagram ( in this work) and is the ratio of the area of the directional components in the direction to the total area represented by the rose diagram.</p><p>b) The first-order angular moment ( ) or mean orientation ( ) of an angular distribution is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where is the central angle of the th angle band. c) The second-order central moment ( ) is a measure of the angular dispersion or variance computed with respect to the mean orientation as ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Pattern Classification</head><p>Classification of the normal and asymmetric cases was conducted by using the Bayesian linear classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. The Gaussian distribution was assumed in order to model the p.d.f. and the parameters of the model (mean vector and covariance matrix ) were estimated by using the training samples. The prior probabilities of normal and asymmetric classes were assumed to be equal ( ) and the covariance matrix was calculated in a pooled manner by averaging the covariance matrices of the normal and asymmetric classes (</p><p>). Thus, the statistical decision is made as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(14)<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where are the p.d.f.s of the feature vector in the normal ( ) and asymmetric ( ) classes, respectively.</p><p>The leave-one-out methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> was used to estimate the classification accuracy since the number of samples used in this work is relatively small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. RESULTS</head><p>The directional analysis scheme proposed was applied to 80 images (20 normal cases, 14 asymmetry cases and six architectural distortion cases) from the Mini-MIAS database <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Although the Gabor filters were implemented to provide good computing performance, the filtering process involves the computation of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and inverse FFTs, where and are, respectively, the number of scales and orientations used in the filters. In this paper, 4 and 12, and all the filters were initially created in the spatial domain. Processing an image with a resolution of 512 512 pixels (size of the ROI) on a 450-MHz Pentium processor with 184 MB of memory took about 20 min. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">12</ref> shows the principal components obtained by applying the KL transform to the filter outputs at the orientation of 135 and four scales for the mammogram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11(d</ref>). It can be seen that the relevant information is concentrated in the first two principal components. This is evident based upon an evaluation of the eigenvalues, listed in the caption of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">12</ref>. In this example, only the first two principal components were used to represent the oriented components in the 135 orientation, since their eigenvalues add to 99.34% ( ) of the total variance. After thresholding the filtered images with Otsu's method in order to eliminate the effects of spectral leakage, the magnitude and phase images were composed by vector summation, as illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">14</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13</ref>(a)-(d) shows the magnitude and phase images for the normal case in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. From the phase images, it is readily seen that the left and right views have almost the same dominant orientation. Some artifacts may be noticed in the chest wall region, caused by the gray-level transitions (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(c)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(d))</ref>; the artifacts need to be removed in future works. The rose diagrams in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13(e</ref>) and (f) shows the distribution of the tissues in the fibro-glandular discs of both the left and right views. An inspection of the rose diagrams shows that the results obtained are in good agreement with visual analysis of the filtered results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13(c</ref>) and (d) and the corresponding ROIs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(c</ref>) and (d). The most relevant angular information indicated in the rose diagrams are very similar.</p><p>The results of the filtering process for the architectural distortion case (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>) along with the respective rose diagrams are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">14</ref>. By analyzing the magnitude and phase images we can notice a modification of the tissue pattern caused by the presence of a high-density region. An important characteristic of the Gabor filters may be seen in the result: the filters do not respond to regions with nearly uniform intensity, i.e., to regions without directional information (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11(c</ref>) and 14(c)). This is an important point and should be used in future works to detect asymmetric dense regions and local foci of architecture distortion. In the present example, the global distortion of the tissue flow pattern is readily seen by comparison of the rose diagrams. The rose diagrams in Figs. 13 and 14 present a strong visual association with the directional components of the phase images obtained with the proposed method and may be used by radiologists as an aid in mammogram interpretation.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">15</ref> shows the distributions of the three features ( , , and ) defined in Section V-B. The values of the features were normalized to unity by the maximum of the features values and plotted by using the same axis limits for the sake of visualization.</p><p>Since we have used a small number of features, we applied an exhaustive combination approach in order to select the best set of features. The selection was conducted based upon the classification results obtained by using the leave-one-out method. Preliminary results of the directional analysis procedure applied to differentiate pairs of normal mammograms from pairs of mammograms with asymmetry and architectural distortion are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. The best result, by using only one feature in the classification process, was achieved by the first-order angular moment ( ), with the sensitivity, specificity, and average accuracy values equal to 77.3%, 71.4%, and 74.4%, respectively. When using two features, the best result was achieved with the combination of the first-order angular moment ( ) and the entropy ( ) features, indicating that 80% of the asymmetric and distortion cases and 65% of the normal cases were correctly classified. The average rate of correct classification in this case was 72.5%. The rate of 80% of correct classification for the asymmetry cases can be considered to be a good result since we have used only two features in this work to perform the classification of the images. However, the rate of 65% for the correct classification of normal cases is relatively low. This low rate may be explained  by the fact that even normal cases present natural signs of asymmetry; the imaging procedure may also distort left-and right-breast tissues in different ways. By using all three features together ( , and ), the sensitivity rate achieved was the highest, at 81.8%. However, the corresponding specificity of 52.4% means that about half of the normal cases were incorrectly classified. The first-order angular moment ( ) has proven in this work to be an efficient measure for classifying asymmetric/distortion and normal cases, presenting good classification rates in both classes. However, the features characterizing dispersion ( and ) have not demonstrated good performance, especially in recognizing the normal class. Due to the global behavior of the proposed approach, the feature proved to be effective in characterizing the amount of directional information in the mean orientation between the left and right breasts. Usually, the mean orientation is in agreement with the straight line perpendicular to the pectoral muscle and passing through the nipple. Asymmetric cases are expected to present different distributions of directional structures, with reference to the mean orientation, between the left and right mammograms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>The directional analysis procedure proposed in this work has proven to be an effective method for characterization of linear oriented components of images. Although the KL transform has been used to extract the most important components over multiple scales, the problem of automatic selection of the number of scales and orientation angles based upon some optimality criterion needs to be investigated. Further investigation should also be conduced to determine a more effective set of features for characterization of directional information. Application of other classification techniques, especially nonlinear and nonparametric methods, may improve the results.</p><p>The classification results are encouraging, considering the small number of features (first-and second-order angular moment and entropy) used in this work to differentiate between normal and asymmetric mammograms, and also considering the fact that the analysis was performed on a global basis. We believe that further optimization of the directional analysis procedure along with an extensive investigation of new features derived from the rose diagrams can improve the results significantly. In particular, we will be investigating the use of the pectoral muscle edge or the dominant orientation of the fibro-glandular disc ROI to align the left and right rose diagrams before subtraction. The same angles may also be used as references to define the orientation ranges of the Gabor filters to be used for directional decomposition.</p><p>A more complete approach for the analysis of asymmetry must take into account other important characteristics, such as the shape of the fibro-glandular disc, asymmetric brightness (density), and texture differences. Features should also be investigated for the measurement of local asymmetry and local foci of architectural distortion. The method proposed in this work may also be extended for application to mammograms taken at different times of the same subject in a screening program to detect interval cancer.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
