<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we analyze various critical transmitting/sensing ranges for connectivity and coverage in three-dimensional sensor networks. As in other large-scale complex systems, many global parameters of sensor networks undergo phase transitions: For a given property of the network, there is a critical threshold, corresponding to the minimum amount of the communication e ort or power expenditure by individual nodes, above (resp. below) which the property exists with high (resp. a low) probability.</p><p>For sensor networks, properties of interest include simple and multiple degrees of connectivity/coverage. First, we investigate the network topology according to the region of deployment, the number of deployed sensors and their transmitting/sensing ranges.

For a given transmission range r Trans , what is the minimum (resp. maximum) degree of the network? What is then the typical hop-diameter of the underlying network?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>Advances in micro-electro-mechanical systems technology, wireless communications and digital electronics have enabled the development of multi-functional sensor nodes. Sensor nodes are small miniaturized devices which consist of sensing, data processing and communicating components <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref>. These inexpensive tiny sensors can be embedded or scattered onto target environments in order to monitor useful informations in many situations. We categorize their applications into law enforcement, environment, health, home and other commercial areas. Moreover, it is possible to expand this classi cation with more categories including space exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref> and undersea monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[51]</ref>. We refer here to the survey paper [1, <ref type="bibr">Section 2]</ref> for an extensive list of possible applications of sensor networks. These critical applications introduce the fundamental requirement of sensing coverage that does not exist in traditional ad hoc networks. In a sensing-covered network, every point of a targeted geographic region must be within the sensing range of at least one sensor.</p><p>In general, networked sensors are very large systems, comprised of a vast number of homogeneous miniaturized devices that cooperate to achieve a sensing task. Each node is equipped with a set of sensing monitors (light, pressure, humidity, temperature, etc.) accordingly to their designated tasks and uses radio transmitters in order to communicate. We refer, for example, to the web-sites [7], <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[58]</ref> of some research institutions dedicated to the study and development of these networks. Typically, a sensor node is able to sense events within a given radius (the sensing range). Similarly, any pair of sensors are able to communicate if they are within a distance less than their transmitting range of each other. Wireless sensor networks are usually multihop networks as opposed to wireless LAN environments.</p><p>A commonly encountered model of sensor network is de ned by a pair n and R where n homogeneous sensor nodes are randomly thrown in a given region R of volume V = jRj, uniformly and independently. This typical modeling assumption is commonly used by many researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[55]</ref>. In particular, the initial placement of the nodes is assumed to be random when the sensors are distributed over a region from a moving vehicle such as an airplane. As opposed to traditional ad hoc networks, a sensor network is normally composed of nodes whose number can be several orders of magnitude higher than the nodes in an ad hoc network. These sensor nodes are often deployed inside a phenomenon. Therefore, the positions of the nodes need not be engineered or pre-determined. Note that many existing results focused on planar networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref> while three-dimensional settings re ect more accurately real-life situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref>. Three-dimensional networks arise for instance in building networks where nodes are located in di erent oors.</p><p>The aim of this paper is two-fold: (a) to study the role that randomness plays in sensor networks and (b) to investigate the design and analysis of appropriate protocols for these networks. These issues are motivated by the following simple reasons. On rst hand, the random placement of the nodes allows rapid deployment in inaccessible terrains. On the other hand, this implies that the network must have self-organizing capabilities. Therefore, we start deriving analytical expressions to characterize the topological properties of sensor networks. Next, we discuss how to use these fundamental characteristics in order to design <ref type="bibr">October 16, 2007</ref> DRAFT and analyze fundamental algorithms such as those arising frequently in classical distributed systems. To name a few, these algorithms include the broadcasting and gossiping protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the leader election algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref> and distributed code assignments protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Related work</head><p>Study of random plane networks goes back to Gilbert <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref> in the early 60's. In comparison to the well-known and well-studied random Bernoulli graphs 1 G(n; p) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[30]</ref>,</p><p>only few papers considered the probabilistic modeling of the communication graph properties of wireless sensor or ad hoc networks and the theory of random geometric graphs (RGG) is still in development with many problems left open (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref>). In contrary to the Bernoulli graphs, in random geometric graphs the probability of edge occurrences are not independent making them more di cult to study. In RGG, a set of n points are scattered, following a given distribution, in the deployment region R. Penrose studied the longest edge of the Euclidean minimum spanning trees (MST) and the longest nearestneighbor link <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref>. The same author established also that if the region of deployment is a d-dimensional cube then the graph of communication becomes k-connected as soon as its minimum degree reaches k <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref>. In a slightly di erent setting, Gupta and Kumar <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref> stated that when n nodes are distributed uniformly in the disk of unit area and their transmitting range is set to r = q ln n+c(n) n then the resulting network is connected with high probability 2 if and only if c(n) ! 1. Their results are obtained making use of the theory of continuum percolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>, which is also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref> to investigate the connectivity of hybrid ad hoc networks.</p><p>As far as we know, the critical transmitting range and the critical coverage range have been investigated rst in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref> for the case when the nodes are distributed in a square according to a Poisson point process of xed intensity.

Furthermore, our results are illustrated with two fundamental distributed protocols intended for the neighborhood discovery and the code assignment problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref>. In particular, our results permit to do the average-case based analysis of the code assignment problem which has been investigated empirically in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 4]</ref>.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 3 presents formal descriptions of the models used throughout the paper. Section 4 o ers results about the relationships between the sensing (resp. transmitting) range, the number of nodes and the volume of the region to be monitored. In particular, we show how to quantify the minimum and maximum degrees of the network. We also show how to compute the hopdiameter of the underlying graph (de ned as the maximum number of hops between any pair of sensor nodes), when the transmitting range is slightly greater than the one required to have a connected network. In Section 5, we present general algorithmic schemes for distributed protocols related to our settings. In particular, we consider how to design a polylogarithmic protocol to allow the nodes to discover their neighborhoods asymptotically almost surely. Next, we turn on the design and analysis of a protocol to assign codes in such random networks. The code assignment problem consists to color the nodes of a graph in such a way that any two adjacent nodes are assigned two di erent colors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Preliminaries and models</head><p>To analyze the topology of sensor networks, three fundamental models are needed: (a) a model for the spatial node distribution, (b) a model for the wireless channel of communication between the nodes and (c) a model to represent the region monitored by a particular sensor. Throughout this paper, nodes are randomly deployed in a subset R of R 3 following a uniform distribution. To model the wireless transmission between the nodes, a radio link model is assumed in which each node has a certain communication range, denoted r Trans .</p><p>Two nodes are able to communicate if they are within the transmitting range denoted r Trans of each other. Only bidirectional links are considered. Clearly, one imposes a graph structure by declaring any two of the stations that lie within a given transmission range to be connected by an edge. The resulting graph is called the reachability graph and is denoted G( ; r Trans ) where = n V represents the (expected) density of the nodes per unit volume. The network coverage is de ned as follows. For a node located at a point p, its monitored region is represented by a sphere, the sensing sphere, of radius r Sense and centered at p. A region R is said covered if every point in R is at distance at most r Sense from at least a node. We assume that every node has the same sensing range r Sense and the same transmitting range r Trans . Given the increasing interest in sensor networks, our purpose is to design a solution where the nodes can maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity.</p><p>Throughout this paper, V always represents the volume of the region R to monitor and we allow both n, V ! 1, in such a way that n=V ! (dense networks). Concretely, = n V represents the expected number of nodes per unit volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notations</head><p>Degrees of the reachability graph. The degree of a node v represents the number of its neighbors in the graph G( ; r Trans ) and is denoted d v . We consider here questions such as: What is the required value of the transmitting range r Trans to have a reachability graph with a given minimum (resp. maximum) degree (resp. )?</p><p>Diameter. The hop distance between two nodes u and v is de ned as the length of the shortest path (with respect to the number of hops) between them. The diameter (or Throughout this paper, we will use standard mathematical notations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref> concerning the asymptotic behavior of functions.

We also say n occurs with high probability (w.h.p.) as n ! 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Fundamental characteristics of random sensor networks</head><p>To generate the network, the n sensor nodes are distributed in the xed region of volume</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V . If = n V tends to some constant (i.e., = O(1)</formula><p>), this process is well approximated by a Poisson point process of nite intensity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref>). Note that this assumption is well suited for both theoretical point of view and in practice since by a suitable rescaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref> all the properties obtained in this paper can be reformulated. For instance, any realization G( ; r Trans ) using a transmission range r Trans and with expected number of nodes per unit volume coincides with another realization G( 0 ; r Trans 0 ) with a transmission range r 0 Trans and intensity 0 provided that 0 = (r Trans =r 0 Trans ) 3 . This model is also well suited for faulty nodes since if each node is independently faulty with some probability p, the properties obtained here remain valid with n replaced by p n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Connectivity regime and minimum transmission range</head><p>As a warm-up, we begin with a natural question that often arises concerning the minimum value of r Trans required to achieve connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>. We have the following theorem :</p><p>Theorem 1: Let R be a bounded and connected set of R 3 of volume V . Suppose that n nodes are placed in R according to the uniform distribution and assume that = n V = O(1). The network formed by adding edge between nodes of distance at most</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">r Trans = 3 p 3(ln n + !(n))=4<label>(1)</label></formula><p>is connected if and only if lim n!1 !(n) = 1.</p><p>Proof: By assumption, the distribution of the nodes can be approximated (see <ref type="bibr">[26,</ref> Section 1.7]) by a Poisson point process of intensity = n V which has the following property.</p><p>The probability p ' (i) that a randomly chosen node i has ' neighbors is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p ' (i) = (4=3 r 3 Trans ) ' '! exp 4=3 r 3 Trans :<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Thus, if</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r Trans = 3 p 3(ln n + !(n))=4 , as n ! 1 no sensor node is isolated with proba- bility close to n Y i=1 (1 p 0 (i)) = 1 e 4=3 r 3 Trans n = 1 e !(n) n n = exp n ln 1 e !(n) n = exp e !(n) + O e 2!(n) n :<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Therefore, there is a.a.s. no isolated nodes if and only if !(n) tends to in nity with n. To prove that the graph is also connected, we argue as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>. More precisely, we make use of results from continuum percolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>. In percolation theory, nodes are distributed with Poisson intensity and as in our model, two nodes are connected i the distance between them is less than r( ). Denote by G Poisson ( ; r( )) the resulting in nite graph. (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 3]</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref>), the probability that G Poisson R ( ; r( )) is disconnected is asymptotically the same as the probability that it has at least one isolated node. For large n, the di erence between the G Poisson R ( ; r( )) and our model can be neglected. Thus, to ensure connectivity it su ces that there is no isolated vertex. By (3), this is only achieved</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">upon setting r Trans = 3 p 3(ln n + !(n))=4 , with !(n) ! 1.</formula><p>Remark.

For a given sensing range r Sense , to ensure the total coverage of the region R (that is every point of R is within the sensing range of at least one sensor), it su ces to have N (R) 1. The following result establishes the relation between r Sense , V and n :</p><p>Theorem 3: Let R be a bounded set of R 3 of volume V .

For randomly deployed sensor nodes, these results show that if the transmission/sensing radius can be \compared", connectedness arises slightly before sensing coverage. It is also important to note that the arguments used to prove these Theorems show that both connectivity and coverage properties are subject to abrupt change known as phase transition phenomena. From an engineering standpoint, these formulae are crucial:</p><p>For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> indicates that there is a critical transmission e ort required to each individual node to ensure with high probability that any pair of nodes in the network can communicate with each other through multihop paths. We refer here to the paper of Goel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref> and to Krishnamachari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[32]</ref> for results about phase transition phenomena in wireless networks and random geometric graphs. In particular, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref> proved that monotone properties for random geometric graphs have sharp thresholds (we refer to Friedgut and Kalai <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref> for the classi cation of critical thresholds phenomena in random graphs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Degrees and coverage</head><p>In various networking problems, multiple-paths between any pair of two nodes are of importance. On one hand, the existence of multiple independent paths plays crucial role (e.g. in ooding or in gossiping protocols).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Distributed protocols</head><p>In this section, we consider some distributed protocols which are built on the top of the previous results concerning the main characteristics of random sensor networks. As emphasized by the fundamental papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, to cite only a few, the number of nodes n, the diameter D and the maximum degree of the networks can play crucial role when designing distributed protocols for radio networks. In fact, the executions of these algorithms are often measured in terms of n, D and . Theorem 7: Suppose that n sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a region of volume V following a uniform distribution. If their transmission range satis es r Trans</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">3 q 3 4 n [ln (n) + !(n)] V , with !(n) 1 but r Trans = O 3 q 3 ln (n) V 4 n</formula><p>, then after one execution of ExchangeID(n, V , r Trans ), with probability tending to 1 as n ! 1, every node has received correctly all the identities of all its neighbors.</p><p>Proof: The proof of Theorem 7 relies on two facts, viz., (1) the main characteristics of the random Euclidean network and (2) the number of iterations T = C ' ln (n) 2 in the main loop of ExchangeID is su cient for the nodes to send its ID at least once to all its neighbors. For the rst point (1), we have seen that for any node v of the network, the degree of v (d v = j (v)j) satis es w.h.p. (cf. Corollary 5 equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_45">38</ref>)) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">d v ' ln n W 0 ' e (1+') + o (ln n) :<label>(43)</label></formula><p>Therefore, at the regime considered in the hypothesis of Theorem 7, the maximum degree of the graph is (with high probability) bounded by c ' ln n (where c ' satis es e.g. c ' = 2 W 0 ( '=e (1 + ')).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Coloring and codes assignment</head><p>According to the rules of distributed protocols given above, when a node is transmitting, all the nodes within its transmitting range must be silent. Moreover in multihop environments, collisions can also occur when two non-adjacent nodes are trying to transmit to a common neighbor (hidden collisions). To circumvent these problems, researchers use to assign orthogonal codes to the nodes, a problem equivalent to that of coloring the graphs associated to the physical network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref>.</p><p>To assign codes to the nodes of the network, let us consider the following simple and intuitive randomized protocol called AssignCode. Each vertex u has an initial list of colors (also referred as palette) of size d u + 1 = j (u)j + 1 and starts uncolored. We can assume that each node knows its neighbors (or at least a great part of them) by using the previous algorithm, viz. ExchangeID. Then, the protocol AssignCode proceeds in rounds. In each round, each uncolored vertex u, simultaneously and independently picks a color, say, c from its list. Next, the station u attempts to send this information to his neighborhood denoted by (u). Trivially, this attempt succeeds i there is no collision.</p><p>Before attributing the color c de nitely to u, its neighbors has to sent one by one a message of reception. Note that this can be done deterministically in time O(ln n) since u can attribute to its active neighbors in (u) a prede ned ranking ranging from 1 to j (u)j.</p><p>Therefore, u sends a message of con rmation and its neighbors undergo an update of their On the top of these typical behaviors of random sensor networks, two distributed mechanisms are proposed. The rst one concerns the dissemination of the identi ers of the nodes to their neighbors while the second protocol solves the code assignment problem.</p><p>With high probability, both protocols are shown to achieve their tasks in polylogarithmic time slots.</p><p>While performance evaluations of algorithms intended for networks have been employed</p><p>for mainly simple and regular graphs, our results show that current mathematical tools are available to design and analyze protocols intended to sensor networks.</p><p>Finally, we brie y point out a remark related to some real-life situations. A possible way of future investigations could be to search for similar results as those presented here whenever the communication radii of the nodes do not degrade immediately but rather in a continuous fashion.

A distributed protocol for multihop networks is a protocol executed at each node in the network in the following way :</p><p>The time of execution is considered to be slotted and are subdivided into time slots or rounds.</p><p>In each round, a node acts either as transmitter or as receiver. A node u receives a message m sent by one of its neighbors in a given round if and only if (a) it acts as a receiver and (b) exactly one of its neighbors acts as a transmitter. If two or more neighbors of u are sending at the same time-slot the node u does not receive nothing. That is, nodes are unable to distinguish between collision and the lack of message.</p><p>The nodes are assumed to be distinguishable, that is each node has an unique identi er, ID for short, ranging from 1 to n. In our settings, we assume also that the nodes are aware of their number n as well as the volume V of the region of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark.</head><p>In what follows and without loss of generality, we assume that the nodes can transmit messages up to a distance of order O( 3 q ln n V n ). We note that if the (common) transmission range of the nodes is such that r Trans 3 ln n V n , the results presented in the following paragraphs can be easily extended using the same global ideas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. A simple protocol for neighborhood discovery</head><p>The rst distributed protocol which will be discussed is a protocol called ExchangeID.</p><p>This algorithm allows each node u to discover the set of its neighbors, denoted (u). This protocol appears to be useful since as already stressed the nodes are deployed in a random fashion and therefore, they do not have any a priori knowledge of their respective neighbors. The neighborhood discovery is done using a simple randomized greedy algorithm whose pseudo-code is given in the following :</p><p>Compute ' verifying : r Trans Theorem 8: Suppose that n sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a region of volume V following a uniform distribution. If their transmission range satis es r Trans</p><p>, then after one execution of AssignCode(n, V , r Trans ), with probability tending to 1 as n ! 1, every pair of nodes at distance at most r Trans from each other have received two distinct codes (colors).</p><p>Proof: Although more complicated, the proof of Theorem 8 is very similar to the one of Theorem 7. For any distinct node u, recall that (u) represents the set of its neighbors and denote by p u the size of its current palette. Now, de ne the random variable Y u as follows:</p><p>1 if and only if the node u;</p><p>remains uncolored after the D ' ln n 2 steps of AssignCode</p><p>Denote by</p><p>u the set of active neighbors of u at any given time t during the execution of the algorithm. Suppose that we are in such time slot t. Independently of its previous attempts, u remains uncolored with probability</p><p>There is at least a collision due to one neighbor v 2</p><p>October 16, 2007 DRAFT Since 8t; j (t) u j and 8v; 1 jp v j + 1, we have</p><p>Therefore, with probability at most</p><p>u remains uncolored during the whole algorithm. Thus, the expected number of uncolored vertices at the end of the protocol AssignCode is less than</p><p>Since by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(38)</ref> we have</p><p>It is now easy to choose a constant D ' such that</p><p>in order to have E[Y ] 1 as n ! 1. After using the well known Markov's inequality (cf.</p><p>[2]), the proof of our Theorem is now done.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Conclusion</head><p>The main purpose of this paper has been that of investigating the fundamental characteristics of a randomly deployed set of sensor nodes. First of all, with respect to the communications, the characteristics of interest include the diameter and the degrees (minimum and maximum) of the reachability graph generated by the nodes. Next, taking the sensing range of the nodes as a parameter, several degrees of coverage have been characterized with rigorous proofs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix</head><p>The Lambert W function. In this paragraph, we give some properties of the function satisfying W (x)e W (x) = x. We remark here that the function W , in particular the principal branch W 0 , already plays a central key role when studying the random graph model G(n; m), i.e., the random graph built with n vertices and m edges which is the \enumerative counterpart" of the G(n; p) random graph model (see, e.g., the \giant paper" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[29]</ref>).</p><p>In fact, W 0 ( x) is the exponential generating function that enumerates Cayley's rooted trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> and we have</p><p>We plot in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> the two real branches of the Lambert W function considered in this paper. This function has been recognized as solutions of many problems in various elds of mathematics, physics and engineering as emphasized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>. The Lambert W is considered as a special function of mathematics on its own and its computation has been implemented in mathematical software as Maple. </p></div>			</div>
