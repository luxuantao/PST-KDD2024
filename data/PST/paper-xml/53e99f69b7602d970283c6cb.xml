<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N THE LAST decade, the study of hybrid systems has re- ceived considerable attention. One reason for this growing interest is the increasing number of engineering systems that is controlled by computers, thus creating an interaction between the continuous dynamics of a physical system and the discrete dynamics of a computer. But also the dynamics of many engineering systems is inherently discontinuous, or becomes so after modelling. Examples of hybrid control systems include electric power networks, car engines, air traffic control, chemical processes, robots, etc.</p><p>Recently, a specific subclass of hybrid systems, so-called piecewise-affine hybrid systems, introduced by Sontag in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, has been studied quite extensively (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and several papers in the conference proceedings <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). A piecewise-affine hybrid system consists of a discrete automaton, with a continuous-time affine system on a polyhedral set at each mode, and a switching mechanism between discrete and continuous dynamics. In the control of this type of hybrid systems one is concerned with the design of control laws such that the closed-loop system meets certain control objectives, like stability, safety, performance optimization, and robustness. In these control problems, the notion of reachability often plays a central role: does there exist an input trajectory that guarantees that the system transits from a given initial state to a required terminal state? Unfortunately, the reachability problem for piecewise-affine hybrid systems is, in full generality, undecidable (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>).</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to present a set of sufficient conditions for the reachability of a subclass of piecewise-affine hybrid systems whose continuous state sets are assumed to be full-dimensional simplices. At the same time a procedure is developed to synthesize feedback control laws for the problems of reachability and stability while guaranteeing safety. Note that the approach proposed in this paper is conservative, because it is based on sufficient conditions for reachability. Nevertheless the method can be useful for many control engineering problems.</p><p>The approach to control synthesis presented in this paper is to decompose the problem into two reachability problems, one at the continuous level and one at the discrete level. The reachability problem at the continuous level reduces to determining a control law for an affine system on a simplex such that from any initial state a particular exit facet or a subset of exit facets is reached in finite time. Conditions for the existence of such a control law are stated in terms of linear inequalities on the continuous inputs at each vertex of a state simplex. These results are based on ideas from affine geometry; especially the convexity of the problem plays an important role. In this way computation of state trajectories by integrating the continuous dynamics can be avoided. At the discrete level, the reachability problem is to determine a path from the initial discrete state to the terminal discrete state in a (non-deterministic) finite state automaton. Both the conditions at the continuous and at the discrete level can be checked using elementary algorithms.</p><p>A comparison of the proposed control synthesis approach with the literature follows. The approach to reachability analysis and control synthesis for piecewise-affine hybrid systems based on the idea of decomposition originates from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The same idea also led to an increased interest in some detailed control problems for affine systems on polytopes that appeared useful in a hybrid systems context (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). The procedure described in this paper seems somewhat related to the bisimulation approach to verification of hybrid systems proposed by Henzinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, in those papers no control is involved, whereas control synthesis is an essential part in the approach presented in this paper. In this respect, the approach is related to the procedure to compute the reachable set for a nonlinear system on the basis of optimal control in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. A different approach to control of hybrid systems has been developed by Morari e.a. (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). In these papers, the main emphasis is on performance optimization by computational methods for discrete-time piecewise-affine hybrid systems. Although the results in the present paper are not concerned with optimization issues, they also do not require a time-discretization step, and work directly in continuous time. Also, unlike in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, simulation is not involved.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the class of piecewise-affine hybrid systems on simplices is introduced, and the problems of reachability and control synthesis are formulated. In Section III some technical results are presented concerning fixed points of autonomous affine systems. Section IV is concerned with the continuous control problems of steering an affine system to a facet of a simplex or to a fixed point. Section V presents an algorithm to compute a feedback control law for steering a hybrid system to the required target state, while guaranteeing a priori specified safety conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this paper, reachability and control synthesis is studied for a class of piecewise-affine hybrid systems. Before presenting a formal definition of a piecewise-affine hybrid system, we first introduce some terminology.</p><p>A polyhedral set is a subset of , , described by a finite number of linear inequalities. A bounded polyhedral set is called a polytope. A polytope can alternatively be characterized as the convex hull of a finite number of points, the vertices of the polytope. An -dimensional polytope with exactly vertices is called a simplex. A face of a polyhedral set is the intersection of with one of its supporting hyperplanes. If a polyhedral set has dimension , the faces of of dimension are called facets. We now define piecewise-affine hybrid systems, based on a formalism in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 2.1: A (continuous-time) piecewise-affine hybrid system consists of an automaton in combination with a -tuple of affine systems , defined on polytopes , , with input in the polytope . The automaton and the affine system interact via guard sets, , each of which is a union of finitely many facets, and affine reset maps . The hybrid system is therefore characterized by the tuple If, additionally, each continuous state set is a simplex, then is a piecewise-affine hybrid system on simplices. The evolution of the hybrid system is defined in the following way:</p><p>Given a discrete location , the continuous state satisfies the affine differential equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with and . Whenever the continuous state leaves the polyhedral set , a discrete event will occur, corresponding to the guard set that is crossed, and a dis-crete transition takes place according to the transition function :</p><p>if then</p><p>In the new discrete location , the evolution of the new continuous state is described by differential equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), with replaced by , and with initial value determined by the affine reset map :</p><p>The precise definition of "crossing a guard set" is technical, and is deferred to Definition 4.5.</p><p>In order to make trajectories of hybrid system well defined, we assume that: 1) On any finite time interval only a finite number of discrete transitions can occur (non-Zenoness). 2) The system is non-blocking, i.e. all points on the boundary of a continuous state set , through which it is possible to leave by a suitable choice of , belong to a guard set for some . An admissible piecewise-affine control law is a family , where each is an affine function characterized by . At first sight, studying problems like reachability and control synthesis for piecewise-affine hybrid systems seems hopeless because it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> that for this class of systems, the reachability problem is undecidable, in general. We therefore restrict ourselves in this paper to only finding sufficient conditions for reachability, leading to some conservatism in the results obtained.</p><p>As defined, the next event occurring in the evolution of a piecewise-affine hybrid system only depends on the facet through which the state simplex is left. However, the definition does raise a difficulty: what happens if the state simplex is left through a face that belongs to two or more different facets? One option to overcome this difficulty is to allow the interior of each face of to have a different event. In this paper we choose for another possibility, and allow some non-determinism in the hybrid system. If a point belongs to more than one guard set, the event occurring upon leaving by crossing the guard sets is not determined uniquely, but can be any of the events . An explicit description of the exact switching condition will be given in Property 4.8.</p><p>Remark 2.2: In general frameworks for hybrid systems, e.g. in the formulation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, one distinguishes between two different types of discrete events: discrete events generated by the continuous dynamics and input events that can be applied by an operator at any time-instant. In Definition 2.1 only events generated by the continuous dynamics are considered. This limitation is only made to focus attention on control of hybrid systems using continuous inputs. Note however that in the approach described in this paper, input events can be incorporated without any problem.</p><p>The main results derived in this paper are concerned with reachability problems and control synthesis for piecewise-affine hybrid systems on simplices. These problems can be stated in different ways; especially the level of detail may be varied considerably. So, instead of defining exactly one control problem, we introduce a class of related control problems.</p><p>Problem 2.3: (Reach-avoid problem) Consider a piecewiseaffine hybrid system on simplices , and assume that denotes the automaton underlying . Let be the subset of unsafe locations, that should be avoided during operation. Let be a set of possible starting locations, and a target location. The problem is to find an admissible piecewise-affine control law that guarantees that in the resulting closed-loop hybrid system every hybrid state trajectory , starting in a location in reaches the target location in finite time, after a finite number of discrete transitions, and without visiting any unsafe location . One may further require constraints on the affine control law at the target location. a) (Stabilize): Find an affine control law at the target location that guarantees that the continuous state never leaves the target location. b) (Stabilize to given fixed point): Find an affine control that stabilizes the target location, and additionally guarantees that the continuous state converges to a given fixed point. Problems 2.3, 2.3(a) and 2.3(b) are motivated by many engineering problems, such as in chemical process control, automotive, and robot control (in particular motion planning). The strategy to solve Problem 2.3, of reaching a target location while avoiding unsafe locations, using continuous state feedback on each state simplex is based on the idea of decomposition as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In the latter paper the notions of arrival and departure sets were introduced to describe the control objective for the continuous state at one discrete location. To solve this problem, integration of the continuous dynamics is required, in combination with a refinement technique. This is a difficult computational problem, which involves nonlinear equations and a possibly non-terminating iteration. In general, this even leads to undecidable problems, unless the hybrid system satisfies some additional properties, such as O-minimality <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The approach developed in this paper considers reachability from a rather pragmatic point of view. Since integration and refinement lead to intractable problems, we avoid the use of these techniques. Instead, we consider conditions under which it is possible to block trajectories from crossing certain facets, which can be studied purely in terms of affine conditions.</p><p>The main advantage of the approach presented in this paper is its computational tractability. The necessary computations are limited to finding solutions of sets of linear inequalities, in combination with elementary dynamical programming at the discrete state level.</p><p>The main disadvantage is that the result is conservative. The method is based on sufficient conditions, and if these are satisfied, it leads to the construction of a piecewise-affine control law that realizes the control objective. However, if the sufficient conditions are not satisfied, the problem may still be solvable, e.g. by taking the affine reset maps and the initial values of the continuous state at each discrete location into account. Since this technique requires integration of the continuous dynamics, it is not further considered in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXISTENCE OF FIXED POINTS OF AFFINE SYSTEMS ON POLYTOPES</head><p>In this section, an autonomous affine system on a polytope is considered. It is shown that all state trajectories of the affine system leave the polytope in finite time if and only if the polytope does not contain a fixed point for the given affine dynamics. In a hybrid systems context this result is used to guarantee whether at a given discrete location a discrete event will occur in finite time, transferring the hybrid system to the next discrete location.</p><p>Theorem , and denote by the affine space of lowest dimension that contains the trajectory . Since the dynamics is affine, the affine space is invariant under these dynamics, i.e. for all and all we have . Let</p><p>. Then is a compact convex set. Furthermore, and the trajectory for all . Hence is a subset of , and, according to Lemma 3.2, is a positively invariant set with respect to the differential equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). Obviously, the closure of is a compact convex set, contained in . Moreover, is positively invariant with respect to the dynamics (2). Indeed, since the affine function satisfies the Lipschitz condition, solutions of (2) on finite time intervals depend continuously on their initial conditions (see e.g. [19, Section 3.1]).</p><p>Since is a convex compact positively invariant set in the affine space , the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem guarantees the existence of a point such that (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">[8, p. 82</ref>] or <ref type="bibr">[10, pp. 202-203]</ref>).</p><p>In [26, Section 1.6] a result similar to Theorem 3.1 was obtained for the special case that the polytope is a hyper rectangular region, and the matrix is a diagonal matrix with strictly negative eigenvalues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONTROL OF THE CONTINUOUS STATE</head><p>In this section we focus on the affine dynamics of a hybrid system at one discrete location , and study how affine feedback can be used to steer the continuous state to one or more specific facets of the state simplex. In a hybrid setting this corresponds to the enabling or disabling of certain events in the discrete automaton.</p><p>Throughout this section, let , and let denote a closed full-dimensional simplex in with vertices . Let denote the facets of , and assume that the facets are numbered in such a way that for , is the only vertex of not belonging to facet . For , let denote the outward unit normal vector of facet . Define</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Description</head><p>We consider the affine system given by ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) on the full-dimensional simplex , with state , and input</p><p>, where denotes a polytope in . In particular it is assumed that the differential equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), described by the matrices , and the vector remains valid as long as the state is contained in the state simplex . We attempt to construct admissible affine control laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where and , such that, independent of the initial state , the closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> solves one of the following control problems. Problem 4.1: Given a subset of the index set , find an admissible affine control law (5) which guarantees that all trajectories of the closed-loop system (6) leave the simplex in finite time, and do so by crossing one of the facets , . The facets , , are called admissible exit facets. In a hybrid system, a solution to Problem 4.1 guarantees that in location one of the events corresponding to an admissible exit facet will occur in finite time.</p><p>We additionally consider the following problems Problem 4.2: a) Find an admissible affine control law (5) such that for every initial state , the corresponding state trajectory of closed-loop system (6) satisfies . b) Given , solve (a), and additionally guarantee that . A solution to Problem 4.2a) guarantees that the continuous state never leaves the state simplex . Hence, in the hybrid system no discrete event can occur, and the discrete automaton remains in location forever. A solution to Problem 4.2b) additionally guarantees that the continuous state is stabilized to the given fixed point .</p><p>Remark 4.3: Problem 4.1 looks similar to the control problem that was solved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, but there are two major differences. First of all, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> the exit facet is assumed to be unique, whereas in Problem 4.1 the set of admissible exit facets may contain more than one element. Secondly, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> it is required that every state trajectory starting on the exit facet leaves the state simplex instantaneously. In Problem 4.1 this assumption is dropped; statetrajectories starting on an exit facet are allowed to enter the interior of the simplex first, and leave the simplex later through one of the admissible exit facets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Crossing a Facet</head><p>Up to now, we have been rather vague about the meaning of "crossing a facet". The reason for this is that when a trajectory leaves the simplex through a face which is the intersection of two or more facets, it is not necessarily clear which facet has been crossed, and hence which event is triggered. We now rectify this situation by giving a precise definition of when a trajectory crosses a facet.</p><p>Definition 4.4 (Exit Set): Let be an autonomous affine system on a simplex , and let be a facet of . Then the exit set of is the set <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where is the outward unit normal vector of . We say that a facet is blocked if its exit set is empty.</p><p>It is trivial that is a blocked facet if and only if ; 2)</p><p>, . The point is an exit point of the dynamics. We say crosses facet at time if additionally: 3) is in the exit set of . Remark 4.6: A trajectory may leave the simplex by crossing more than one facet. Also, it is not necessarily the case that every point of an exit set is an exit point, as the boundary of an exit set may contain points through which the state simplex is entered instead of left. The next lemma shows that every exit point is in the exit set of at least one facet.</p><p>Lemma 4.7: If the state trajectory of an autonomous affine system on leaves through the point , then there exists a facet of for which is in the exit set of .</p><p>Proof: Suppose is an exit point and that for all facets of , is not in the exit set of . . Then for all with , the vector field of the perturbed system points strictly into . Choose , such that whenever and . Then whenever and . Since is continuous in , , and since is closed, whenever and . In particular, for all . Hence is not an exit point, a contradiction. Definitions 2.1 and 4.5 in combination with Lemma 4.7 imply that the discrete switching of a closed-loop piecewise-affine hybrid system on simplices satisfies the following property: Property 4.8: Let be a discrete location of a piecewiseaffine hybrid system on simplices in closed-loop with an admissible piecewise-affine controller . Let be a continuous state trajectory at location , leaving simplex through the exit point . Then the event that is triggered at that time instant corresponds to a facet of that is crossed by the state trajectory, i.e. is an element of the exit set of .</p><p>If the exit point belongs to exactly one facet , Lemma 4.7 and Property 4.8 guarantee that at the event corresponding to this facet does occur. If is on the boundary of several facets, Property 4.8 restricts the events which may occur to those which correspond to facets through which it is possible to leave the state simplex in a neighborhood of by crossing the facet transversely. Note that the switching condition described in Property 4.8 is non-deterministic, because an exit point may belong to the exit set of more than one facet. According to Property 4.8, an event corresponding to a blocked facet cannot occur, since a blocked facet has an empty exit set, and so cannot be crossed.</p><p>Remark 4.9: The switching condition described in Property 4.8 enhances the robustness of the hybrid behavior, by making the event that is triggered upon leaving a state simplex through a point not solely dependent on the exit point , but also on boundary points of in a neighborhood of .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Disabling Exit Through a Facet</head><p>In Problem 4.1, a state trajectory of the closed-loop system is not allowed to leave by crossing a non-admissible exit facet . In Problem 4.2, a state trajectory is not allowed to leave at all. Before solving these two problems, we first consider the following question.</p><p>Problem 4.10: Given a (possibly empty) subset of the index set , find an admissible affine control law (5) such that every facet , is a blocked facet of the closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>A solution to Problem 4.10 does not guarantee that every trajectory of the closed-loop system leaves simplex in finite time. However, if the simplex is left, the exit point does not lie in the exit set of a non-admissible facet. So, although it is allowed that the exit point belongs to the boundary of a blocked facet, Property 4.8 assures that blocked facets cannot be crossed and that the event that is triggered upon leaving the state simplex always corresponds to an admissible exit facet.</p><p>The equivalence stated in (8) immediately yields necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of Problem 4.10.</p><p>Lemma 4.11: An admissible affine control law (5) solves Problem 4.10 for index set if and only if <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> The necessary and sufficient condition of Lemma 4.11 is stated in terms of the affine feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In order to make these conditions on the solvability of Problem 4.10 easier to verify, they are reformulated in terms of the inputs at the vertices of the simplex. For this, we use the fact that an affine function is uniquely determined by its values at the vertices of a full-dimensional simplex.</p><p>Theorem 4.12: Let be a (possibly empty) subset of the index set . There exists an admissible affine control law (5) that solves Problem 4.10 with admissible exit facets if and only if there exist inputs at the vertices of such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Furthermore, if satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, then a solution of Problem 4.10 is given by , with and the unique solution of the equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Proof: If ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is an admissible affine feedback that solves Problem 4.10, then condition (9) of Lemma 4.11 implies that the inputs , , satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. To prove sufficiency, let be such that condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>  , then the same control law also solves Problem 4.10 for index sets that contain . Remark 4.14: It is for existence and uniqueness of the solution of (11) that we only consider affine systems on simplices, and not on more general polytopes. Other -dimensional polytopes have more vertices, leading to a linear system like <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> with more equations than unknowns. In this case it is better to restrict the inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> to the vertices of every facet. In this way, one large system of linear inequalities in the coefficients of the feedback matrix and the vector is obtained, that has to be solved for and .</p><p>Remark 4.15: By interchanging the universal quantifiers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, it is possible to reorganize the inequalities in such a way that the inequalities for input at vertex are completely decoupled from the inequalities for all other inputs. For we define the polytopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Then condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> of Theorem 4.12 can be restated as for all .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Ensuring Departure Through an Admissible Exit Facet</head><p>Throughout this subsection it is assumed that the index set is non-empty; otherwise Problem 4.1 is not solvable.</p><p>Since a trajectory cannot leave through a blocked facet by Lemma 4.7, and every trajectory of an autonomous system on a polytope leaves in finite time if, and only if, there are no fixed points by Theorem 3.1, we have the following theorem. . Both for the question of existence of a solution to Problem 4.1, and for the construction of a solution, the result of Theorem 4.16 is not directly applicable. In order to obtain verifiable conditions, we again reformulate the necessary and sufficient conditions into requirements on the inputs at the vertices of the state simplex.</p><p>As in Theorem 4.12, condition i) of Theorem 4.16 is equivalent with the linear inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> on the inputs at the vertices of , yielding the polytope of admissible controls at vertex as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.

Proof: Assume that for there exist such that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">14</ref>) is satisfied. Then , , and according to Theorem 4.12, the feedback , obtained by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> with right-hand side replaced by satisfies condition i) of Theorem 4.16. At the same time, this feedback satisfies condition ii) of Theorem 4.16. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> implies that the inputs satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and therefore closed-loop system (6) has no fixed point in . So, according to Theorem 4.16, this feedback solves Problem 4.1.</p><p>Next, assume that is an admissible feedback that solves Problem 4.1. By taking , , condition i) of Theorem 4.16 implies that , . According to condition ii) of Theorem 4.16, closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> has no fixed points. Hence (13) holds, indicating that . Then there exist and such that the hyperplane separates 0 from the polytope , i.e. . Every polytope , contains at least one point , such that is located in the halfspace . This implies that each polytope , has a vertex such that is contained in the halfspace . Since 0 does not belong to this halfspace, this choice of , satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. The result of Theorem 4.17 yields a constructive method for the design of an affine feedback solution to Problem 4.1. In principle, the vertices of the polytopes , can be computed using existing software for polyhedral sets, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Subsequently, the necessary and sufficient condition in Theorem 4.17 can be checked in finitely many steps. For any combination of vertices , , it has to be verified whether the following system of equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> has a solution</p><p>. If for at least one combination of vertices <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> has no solution , then ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">14</ref>) is satisfied and Problem 4.1 is solvable; an affine control law is obtained by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> with right-hand side . If for all possible combinations of vertices , , system (15) has a solution in , then Problem 4.1 is not solvable. Note that the procedure described above may not be very efficient. Especially the computation of all vertices of the polytopes may become very time-consuming. Also checking the solvability of (15) for every possible combination of vertices is a possible bottleneck, although this computation can be stopped as soon as a linear system has been found without solution</p><p>. To enhance robustness it may also be preferable to replace the inputs , at the vertices by suitable inputs from the interior of , before constructing the affine feedback law with <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. More research is required to find efficient algorithms for checking the necessary and sufficient conditions of Theorem 4.17.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONTROL OF THE HYBRID SYSTEM</head><p>In this section we show how to use the solutions to Problems 4.1, 4.2a) and 4.2b) to solve Problems 2.3, 2.3a) and 2.3(b) for the original hybrid system. Let be the underlying discrete event system of the hybrid system . The trajectories of simulate the discrete behavior of , but do not take into account the continuous dynamics. We cannot control directly, but instead control indirectly by choosing an appropriate affine control law in location . By considering all possible control laws in each discrete location, we can obtain a supervisory controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for . A more efficient approach to solving the reach-avoid problem is to use dynamic programming to construct affine controllers . Using Theorem 4.17, we can restrict the possible events which can occur, and also guarantee that the solution does not remain stuck in a discrete state.</p><p>Problem are not needed by Algorithm 5.2, since they do not occur in the construction of the control laws , and are irrelevant at the discrete-event level. Therefore, if Algorithm 5.2 succeeds in finding a piecewise-affine control law , then is valid independently of the reset maps . Remark 5.6: Algorithm 5.2 is conservative, in that it may be possible to solve Problem 2.3 even if the algorithm finds no solutions. This happens when the reset maps ensure that the hybrid state trajectory enters a location in a set , and all continuous trajectories starting in can be made to leave through the desired guard sets, but not every trajectory can be made to do so.</p><p>In the worst possible case, we need to check all states in each time we perform step 1 of Algorithm 5.2, giving a total of attempts to solve Problem 5.1, where . Hence the algorithm is quadratic in the number of safe discrete states. The difficulty of Problem 4.1 decreases as the number of admissible exit facets increases. The overall cost is likely to be dominated by the difficulty of finding control laws without fixed points in the state simplex, as described in Theorem 4.17.</p><p>The next example illustrates the use of Algorithm 5. The reset maps are not needed by the algorithm, so we do not give them here. Consider the reach-avoid-stabilize problem 2.3(a) with , and . To stabilize the continuous dynamics in discrete location , we need to prevent exit from all the facets , and . Taking to be the input at vertex , by Theorem 4.18 we have the inequalities A solution to these inequalities is given by , and , giving control law and closed-loop dynamics</p><p>There is a unique fixed-point in at (11/21,2/7). We now try to drive the system to discrete state without passing through . It is to reach in one step from . In discrete mode , the system reaches if the trajectory leaves through facet . However, there is no control in this discrete mode, and we cannot prevent the system leaving through facet and reaching . In location , we arrive at on exiting through facet . To block facet and , we have the inequalities It is easy to see that the control law solves these inequalities, giving closed-loop system Since the unique fixed point <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> does not lie in , by Theorem 3.1, all trajectories leave in finite time by crossing , hence .

There are other control laws, such as , for which only facet is blocked. In this case, the initial condition of the continuous state in discrete location determines whether facet or is reached first, and hence whether the hybrid system transfers to discrete location or to . We now give an example of a piecewise-affine hybrid system for which Problem 2.3 has a solution as a piecewise-affine control law, but the solution is not found by Algorithm 5. This problem is clearly solvable; every initial point in leaves through and is reset to . In , we can take , yielding the closed-loop system .

CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>The contribution of the paper is an algorithm to construct a control law for the problem of reaching a target state from a starting location for the class of piecewise-affine hybrid systems defined on simplices. The algorithm depends only on the solution of a finite set of linear inequalities in a finite-dimensional space, and on the solution of a control problem for a discrete-event system. The algorithm is conservative, in that it may fail to find a control law even if one exists. Hence the conditions under which the algorithm succeeds in finding a control law are sufficient, but not necessary, for the existence of such a control law.</p><p>There are a number of possible directions for further research. Of particular importance are generalizations to piecewise-affine systems defined on polyhedra which are not necessarily simplices, and on generalizations to particular classes of nonlinear hybrid systems, such as piecewise multi-affine hybrid systems on rectangles (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). The development of algorithms which can compute control laws under weaker reachability conditions is also of interest.</p><p>The authors plan to implement the algorithms to allow the synthesis of control laws for realistically-sized piecewise-affine hybrid systems of practical interest.</p><p>Luc Habets received the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree, both from Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, in 1989 and 1994, respectively.</p><p>He spent three years at the Institute for Dynamical Systems at Bremen University, Germany, and returned to Eindhoven in 1997 to become a Lecturer with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science.
