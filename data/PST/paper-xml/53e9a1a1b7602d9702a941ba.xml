<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>We propose a simple reliable ultrasonic sensor system to be used for obstacle avoidance on an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle. To optimize the system with respect to reliability and robustness we reduced its output to what it is strictly necessary for obstacle avoidance: the sensor delivers a two-dimensional (2-D) vector pointing to the gravity center of the nearest obstacles. This gravity center is calculated with weights that depend on distance, such that close objects get larger weights than distant objects. The size of the vector is a measure for the distance between sensor and objects. When developing the sensor we had one particular application in mind: a joystick controlled vehicle, i.e., the electronic wheelchair shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> with a sensor mounted on its front, consisting of three ultrasonic transducers, and where each transducer has an aperture angle of 170 degrees in the horizontal plane. To keep the driver from hitting obstacles, we use the information delivered by this sensor to partially correct the joystick's steering vector instead of letting it directly control the motors.</p><p>The sensor system that we propose is based on the idea of artificial potential fields (APF's). The use of APF's for robot navigation has been introduced and studied by several authors motivated by the wide range of possibilities: integration with robot dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, avoidance of local minima <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and path planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In this paper we discuss how we can design an ultrasonic sensor system that can measure such a potential field in a direct way, either by employing the natural attenuation of sound in air, or by using a slightly more complicated design that computes an APF from the traveling times of reflected pulses.</p><p>Since the sensor is designed to collect very specific information of direct use for navigation, it can be optimized for its task. In fact, the criteria that we used differ considerably from the criteria that are in order when developing a more general ultrasonic localization system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or a system that can recognize the shape of an obstacle <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>On the one hand, our approach can be seen as an alternative for the potential field approach discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and for the so-called Vector Field Histogram method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.

Furthermore, this gradient can be measured without angular quantization of the space around the robot and with the use of only three wide beam ultrasonic transducers as opposed to the ring of transducers employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, where one would need 12 transducers to cover a field of view of 180 degrees.</p><p>On the other hand, our sensor can also be seen as a simplification of the tri-aural sensor proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which also uses only three transducers to gather information appropriate for navigation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRINCIPLE OF AN APF SENSOR</head><p>Our sensor is based on the idea of APF's. Several workers have made various propositions regarding the most appropriate form of such fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. For example, Rimon and Koditscheck propose potential functions of the form r 2 g =(r g + i r 2 i )</p><p>1= , where rg denotes the distance from the robot to a goal position, and ri the distance to the ith obstacle <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Independent of the precise form of the field, we propose a sensor that measures that part of the field responsible for obstacle avoidance, e.g., by measuring the value of log i r 2 i = 2 i log r i in the above potential. In fact, to illustrate the ideas in this paper, we consider a simple potential of the form f(q) = f o (q) + f g (q) = i 1 jp i 0 qj + jp g 0 qj 2 (1)</p><p>1042-296X/99$10.00 © 1999 IEEE which consists of an obstacle avoidance part f o and a goal seeking part fg, and where jq 0 pij denotes the distance between the robot q and the obstacle p i ; jp g 0 qj is the distance between the robot and its goal position p g , and is some appropriate parameter, with &gt; 0. In our application of a joystick controlled vehicle, we discard the goal potential f g , and use the manual steering vector from the joystick v g directly to control the vehicle. At the same time, the sensor measures the gradient of fo(q) due to the obstacles, from which it derives an obstacle avoidance vector v o . A combination of both the manual steering vector vg and the obstacle avoidance vector vo is then used to steer the vehicle. Note that the field (1) was chosen for its simplicity. The technique that we proposed can be easily extended to more complicated laws, which in fact is done in Section VI.</p><p>To derive an obstacle avoidance vector from the gradient of f o , we have studied two different maneuvering schemes. The most obvious approach is to move in the opposite direction of rfo, the other is to move perpendicular to it. The first, i.e., moving along 0rf o , in most cases means moving away from the closest object. This scheme poses, however, some major drawbacks. When close to an object, the vehicle often reacts by turning over large angles. In particular, when the vehicle has to pass through a narrow passage, this often results in large oscillations of the obstacle avoidance vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, the vehicle may trap itself in a local minimum of the potential field f o . We found that a better way of deriving an obstacle avoidance vector vo from the potential field fo is to move perpendicular to rf o . This gives us two opposite directions along an equipotential field line, which means the vehicle has to turn over smaller angles. In addition, as it moves perpendicular to the gradient, there is a lower probability that the vehicle will be trapped in a local minimum, as it strives to remain on an equipotential field line.</p><p>To measure the obstacle avoidance gradient rf o , the most obvious approach would be to determine first the positions p i of the obstacles with a range sensor and then to compute the potential fo(q) and its gradient from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In fact, we implemented this scheme by using the tri-aural sensor of Peremans et al., which calculates the positions by triangulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Triangulation involves, however, an ill-posed correspondence problem, also described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> which is often difficult to solve. We therefore propose a second, more straightforward approach where the obstacle avoidance component is measured directly by an appropriately designed ultrasonic sensor system, and where the objects do not have to be localized separately.</p><p>In fact, because the potential fo(q) is a function of distances only, it can be derived directly from the range data obtained with an ultrasonic transducer, without computing the individual obstacle positions. To be precise, to measure fo(q) we only have to measure the value of the sum i 1=jp i 0qj , and not the precise locations p i of the obstacles.</p><p>Furthermore, once we are able to measure fo(q), the gradient of fo(q) can be easily approximated by finite differences. Consider the sensorhead shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, which consists of three ultrasonic range sensors located at positions u; v and w, respectively. Assume that there are n obstacles and that the sensors measure the distances r ui ; r vi ; r wi , respectively, where r xi denotes the distance between the sensor at position x and the ith obstacle. By using the following approximation of the gradient:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">@f o @x ; @f o @y 1 2d (f o (w) 0 f o (v); 2f o (u) 0 f o (v) 0 f o (w))</formula><p>relative to an xy-coordinate frame attached to the sensorhead, this gradient can be approximated directly by the measured distances Thus, since there is a direct relation between distance and traveling time of the reflected pulse, we can use a simple time of flight sensor with a detection threshold to derive the gradient of the APF. We could have simplified the design even further by using a sensor that exploits the diffraction of the radiated acoustical energy. Suppose an obstacle is located at a distance r from an ultrasonic transducer that transmits a pulse and subsequently receives its reflection. Then if we increase r, the amplitude of the received pulse decreases as r 0 with good approximation, where is some positive real parameter, which depends on the acoustical properties of both transmitter/receiver and obstacle. For example, for a common type of ultrasonic sensor we have = 3/2 when the obstacles are edges [11]. This natural atten- uation due to diffraction could be exploited for obstacle avoidance, by simply choosing a potential of the form fo(q) = i 1 jq 0 p i j 3=2 :</p><p>(2) If we let s(q) denote the strength of the received signal as measured by an ultrasonic sensor located at q (e.g., the RMS value of the signal), then we could use (s(w) 0 s(v); 2s(u) 0 s(v) 0 s(w))=2d as a good approximation for rf o , up to a scalar multiple. As we will discuss later, this scheme, albeit simple, does not render satisfactory results since the strength of the reflected signal is not only a function of distance, but also depends on the acoustical properties of the obstacle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. TRAVELING TIME BASED APF</head><p>To measure the gradient of the potential field f o , we make use of three wide beam ultrasonic transducers. Each transducer has a relatively large bandwidth (45-55 kHz), and an in-plane viewing angle of 170 . Out of the sensor's xy-plane the view is restricted to 40 . The three transducers are positioned as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, all transducers facing forward, with the distance d equal to 10 cm. As we show later, the choice of d limits the range of the sensor to a minimal distance of 3d, in our case 30 cm. We emit short pulses of 1 ms or less. The reflected signals are sampled at 200 kHz with 8 b resolution, and processed by DSP's.</p><p>For the traveling time APF it is necessary that the signal strength of the reflected pulses always exceeds the noise level. Signal strength measurements on different types of reflecting obstacles showed us that it is possible to choose a detection threshold l t well above the noise level that still allows us to detect all obstacles at a range of almost 2 m.</p><p>Once the parameters d and l t have been chosen, we use the signals received by each transducer to compute the value of an APF at positions u; v and w. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the absolute value of a digitized signal received by one of the transducers after a pulse    Every sample above the detection threshold l t is treated as an individual obstacle i at a distance corresponding to the traveling time of the sample. The obstacle i is then allocated an artificial repulsive potential r 0 i . Thus, the total potential due to all samples above l t is the sum of the individual potential fields r 0 i . This makes the total potential field subject, however, to relatively large fluctuations caused by samples that are near threshold level. We will therefore take the average of the individual potentials. The APF is then approximated as f o (u) = ( i r 0 i )=n, where the sum is taken over all distances r i for which the amplitude of the received signal exceeds the threshold l t , and where n denotes the number of samples for which this occurs. If a pulse reflected by the jth obstacle exceeds the threshold n j times, then the obstacle appears to the sensor as if composed of nj slightly displaced copies as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. These shadow copies occur over a distance equal to the length of the reflected pulse. However, since all obstacles possess such a shadow, and since a shadow always lies along line passing through the center of the sensor, the shadowing effect barely influences the direction and size of the gradient.</p><p>We further improved the traveling time APF sensor by restricting its active range to the nearest obstacles. The distance to the nearest obstacle is derived from the first signal sample that exceeds the detection threshold. This distance sets a lower range limit of observed obstacles. The upper limit is then set to twice the lower limit. Experiments show that a vehicle with a traveling time APF performs better with this kind of active range adaptation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ATTENUATION BASED APF</head><p>In this section we briefly discuss the basic features of an APF sensor system based on the natural attenuation of ultrasonic sound due to diffraction. As before, the APF sensor consists of three ultrasonic transducers, i.e., a transmitter/receiver at position u and two receivers at positions v and w. The signal strength in each transducer is now used as a measure for the distance to the obstacles, and directly used as an APF.</p><p>We assume that the attenuation of the wavefront amplitude of a transmitted pulse can be described by a simple attenuation law of the form r 0 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, for a more detailed analysis). For example, it can be shown that the amplitude of a spherical wavefront decreases as r 01 , where r is the distance the wavefront has traveled <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Similarly, when the pulse is reflected, the attenuation of the amplitude of the reflected wavefront decreases according to a second law r 0 where depends on the acoustical properties of the reflector. The attenuation of the received pulse therefore has the form r 00 = r 0 . For instance, for a common type of transducer the amplitude of the pulse received from an edge decreases as r 00 = r 03=2 , and from a plane or corner as r 01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. (To avoid confusion, note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> an attenuation of + = 1/2 is given for edges, and + = 0 for planes and corners. The authors assume, however, that the receiver includes a time-controlled amplifier whose gain increases linearly with the traveling distance r.) More generally, for real obstacles the value of ( + ) lies, typically, between 1.0 and 2.0, depending on the precise shape of the object and of the transducer. For a small, cylindrical reflector we found, experimentally, that the amplitude decreases as r 01:86 .</p><p>We must take into account, however, that for different transducers we may have to use different diffraction laws for the reflected signals, that is, different values for . This may be due to different viewing angles, or to different distances to the obstacle. For example, because of the finite vertical viewing angle, one transducer may observe a short pole as an infinite cylinder, while another, located at a greater distance, may perceive it as a truncated cylinder, with stronger attenuation. Therefore, for one transducer to the other the obstacle can exhibit different diffraction laws, which causes the transducers to read different APF's with respect to one another. Taking the gradient amplifies these differences. Experiments showed that a sensor calibrated for an obstacle at a given distance lost its accuracy when obstacles were placed at other angles or distances, sometimes leading to the reversal of the y-component and yielding a gradient pointing backward while the obstacle was in front.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NAVIGATION WITH AN APF SENSOR</head><p>The wheelchair with the APF-sensor mounted on it, is controlled by a joystick. The joystick generates a manual steering vector v g , which has to be combined with an obstacle avoidance vector vo to form the steering vector v t . As stated previously, there are two ways of using an APF gradient to generate v o . We use an obstacle avoidance vector that is perpendicular to the gradient of the APF, such that to avoid an obstacle the vehicle moves along an equipotential field line. With the vehicle's maneuverability in mind, we implemented two obstacle avoidance schemes, depending on the distance to the obstacle. When the vehicle is not too close to the obstacle, it has enough room to circle the obstacle along an equipotential field line. We refer to this as "forward evasion." When the obstacle gets too close, however, the vehicle has to move backward until it has enough space to execute a forward evasion maneuver. We call this "backward evasion."</p><p>When designing both forward and backward evasion, we took into account three major criteria:</p><p>1) the obstacle avoidance should not be active when the driver is steering away from the obstacles; 2) the obstacle avoidance should take gradual control as the vehicle moves closer to the object and; 3) the driver should have total control of the speed of the vehicle, i.e., the magnitude of the total steering vector v t should be equal to that of vg. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(a)</ref>, for forward evasion we choose vo to be the vector perpendicular to the gradient and with a positive y-component, i.e. the vector that is facing forward. The vector v o is first scaled down proportional to the magnitude of vg, and then added to it. The resulting vector is then scaled down to the magnitude of v g , i.e., v t = jv g j j(v g + jv g jv o )j (v g + jv g jv o ):</p><p>When an obstacle is too close for forward evasion, we pick the backward pointing vector 0vo perpendicular to the gradient, and move the vehicle backward along that vector [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(b)</ref>]. Since in most cases the driver steers in the opposite direction, the steering vector vg is not added to vo. However, the driver still controls the speed of the vehicle, and the total steering vector v t is scaled down to the magnitude of vg, i.e., vt = jv g j jv o j vo:</p><p>The vehicle moves forward again when forward evasion becomes available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>We compare the proposed techniques to measure gradients experimentally. Fig. <ref type="figure">6(a)-(c)</ref> shows the gradient as measured by three different kinds of sensors when they move along a straight line and observe six obstacles. Each part of this figure also shows the theoretically computed gradient vectors, and the uncertainty ellipses for each of the measurements. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a) shows the gradient as measured from the natural attenuation of the received pulses. Fig. <ref type="figure">6(b)</ref> shows the gradient as measured by the traveling time method, and Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Sensor performance in a relatively complex environment. Fig. <ref type="figure">6(c</ref>) shows the gradient as computed from the obstacle locations measured by the tri-aural sensor described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The traveling time technique yields the most stable and accurate results. Note, however, that the data shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6(c</ref>) do not show all capabilities of the tri-aural sensor. In fact, only in relatively complicated environments such as the one shown here, the tri-aural does not succeed in solving the correspondence problem as it is fooled by too many spurious echoes. For simple environments containing at most three obstacles, the tri-aural sensor yields results comparable to those of the traveling time APF sensor. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the course of a joystick controlled vehicle, i.e., an electronic wheelchair, moving toward a fixed goal position from two different initial positions. The joystick vector v g was always pointing toward the goal. The steering vector v s was computed using forward and backward evasion and active adaptation was enabled. When no obstacles were close, the wheelchair traveled at a maximum speed of 0.5 m/s. The gradient rf o was measured six times per second. This and similar experiments showed that the data provided by the potential field sensor were reliable even in complicated situations, and that it could be used to navigate between densely spaced obstacles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Comparison with the Tri-Aural Sensor</head><p>We found that as far as it concerns obstacle avoidance, the traveling time APF sensor yields more reliable results in complicated environments than the tri-aural sensor discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and that an APF sensor has two important advantages in comparison to sensor systems that try to localize obstacles individually by triangulation. In fact, although both approaches share many of the problems common to all ultrasonic range sensing systems, i.e., the effects due to the specularity of the reflectors, two important problems are handled differently. First, with the APF sensor we restrict the output of the sensor to a single vector pointing to some kind of gravity center, thereby avoiding the difficult correspondence problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Second, the detection of reflected pulses in the received signal involves a peak or edge detection algorithm whose design is subject to the compromise described by Canny's criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Without going into details, these criteria are the following:</p><p>1) all peaks must be detected and all nonpeaks refused; 2) detected peaks must be localized accurately;</p><p>3) a single response for a single edge (in Canny's mathematical formulation, this covers some issues not handled by the first criterion). It is impossible to design a peak detector that is optimal for each of these criteria separately. We believe, however, that with regard to the foregoing criteria the traveling time APF sensor makes a compromise that is better suited for obstacle avoidance than that made by the triaural sensor or other triangulation based sensors. On the one hand, our localization of obstacles is less accurate and informative than with a triangulation based sensor. In particular, we have many responses to a single edge, which results in shadowing effects. On the other hand, however, by allowing moderate performance for the second and the third criterion, we can score much better with respect to the first of Canny's criteria. For an APF sensor we can use a peak detection algorithm that is less sensitive to noise, and that accepts all reflection peaks that are due to real obstacles. In fact, due to spurious and missing echoes, the tri-aural sensor often fails to localize objects (or places objects at wrong positions) as soon as there are four or more reflecting objects within its field of view. The problem gets even worse when the sensor is mounted on a moving robot, because the correspondence algorithm requires that distances are measured with a resolution of 1 mm or less. Even with sophisticated signal processing and subsample interpolation, this remains a very difficult task for ultrasonic sensors on a moving robot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Limitations of APF Sensors</head><p>Instead of letting each transducer transmit its own pulse, we used only one transmitter/receiver at position u in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and used the transducers at v and w as additional receivers. Suppose the transducer at position u transmits a short ultrasonic pulse. In this case the traveling time from transmitter to reflector and back to one of the other transducers differs from the situation where each transducer transmits its own pulse. Since the traveling time is a measure for the distance to the obstacle, and is used to calculate an APF, errors in the traveling time induce errors in the APF, and therefore in the collision avoidance vector vo. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows a plot of the angular deviation of v o in the plane of the sensor. We see that the deviation is less than 7 degrees for obstacles at a distance of more than 3d from the nearest transducer. The use of one transducer poses a lower limit to the sensor range, or inversely an upper limit to the dimensions of the sensor. Using one transmitter has its advantages, however. The traveling time APF sensor does not allow for the individual transducers to transmit simultaneously, as the signal from each transmitter will be received by all transducers. Alternating use of each transducer would eliminate the error, but it reduces the possible measurement speed with a factor 3.</p><p>Attenuation poses an upper limit to the range of an APF sensor.</p><p>To detect obstacles at a greater distance, the detection level lt has to be lowered in order to detect weak pulses from distant obstacles.</p><p>When l t is brought too close to the noise level, noise spikes can give rise to nonexistent obstacles both at close range and at a distance. Furthermore, lowering the threshold could mean that distant reflections from the previous measurement cycle are regarded as close-by objects. These factors limit the upper range of the traveling time APF sensor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>Several issues have not been considered in this paper. We have not given much consideration to the fact that the reflections of multiple objects may interfere. In principle this problem can by solved to a large extent by using multiple frequencies, i.e., frequency modulated pulses. In fact, we used the Barker code pulses described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> so that the emitted pulses share many of the spectral properties of FMsweeps. Nor did we discuss the directivity of the transducers. It turns out however, that for the wide angle transducers that we were using, the influence of the directivity pattern is almost negligible.</p><p>Apart of the performance of an APF sensor, Koren and Borenstein list several limitations of the potential field approach when used for obstacle avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We have found that these problems can be partially removed by incorporating some modifications in the control of the robot. First, oscillations in narrow passages, or in the presence of obstacles, are less annoying when we use a vector perpendicular to the gradient to steer the vehicle. In our case oscillations of the gradient resulted mainly in oscillations on the velocity of the vehicle and not on its direction. Second, the inability to pass between closely spaced obstacles has been removed to some extent because we measure a nonquantized and therefore more accurate value for the direction of the gradient. One possible technique that addresses the problem of passing between closely spaced obstacles in a more fundamental way, is to design a more sophisticated APF sensor that gives different weights to distinct objects, as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div>

Specifically, we utilize a nonlinear, hybrid dynamic system model (the model is hybrid in the sense that it is comprised of a distributed parameter, dynamic field equation coupled to discrete, dynamic boundary equations) to design a model-based control law which asymptotically stabilizes the link displacement while driving the actuator hub's position to a desired setpoint. We then illustrate how the control law can be redesigned as an adaptive controller which achieves the same control objective while compensating for parametric uncertainty including unknown payload mass. The control strategy is composed of a boundary control torque applied to the actuator hub and a boundary control force at the link's free-end. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control laws.</p><p>Index Terms-Boundary control, distributed parameter system, flexible link robot, Lyapunov analysis, nonlinear control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Over the last ten years, the effects of link flexibility in robot manipulator systems have received much attention among robotics and controls researchers. The design of flexible link robot arms is primarily motivated by the need for lightweight robot systems. For example, due to the prohibitive cost of placing equipment into outer space, the use of standard rigid link robot manipulators is impractical. As a result, space-based robot manipulators are more likely to be characterized by long links manufactured from lightweight metals or composites. Unfortunately, the use of long lightweight links greatly complicates the corresponding position control problem since the links are subject to deflection and/or vibration.</p><p>Mathematically, a flexible link robot manipulator is modeled by a set of distributed parameter field equations (i.e., partial differential equations (PDE's) describing the dynamics of the flexible links) coupled to a set of finite dimensional equations (i.e., ordinary differential equations (ODE's) describing the actuator dynamics). Often, this infinite dimensional, hybrid dynamic model for flexible link robots is approximated by a set of finite dimensional equations (i.e., the standard dynamic model of rigid link robots is augmented with a finite number of vibration modes). For control design purposes, this approximation techniques facilitates the application of finite dimensional control strategies. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Paden et al. proposed a control law composed of a feedforward compensation term plus a passive feedback term that was shown to be exponentially stable for sufficiently stiff links. In [19], Yuan et al. proposed a model reference adaptive tracking controller for a single flexible link robot.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
