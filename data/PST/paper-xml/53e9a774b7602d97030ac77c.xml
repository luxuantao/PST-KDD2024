<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Motivated by the attractive MIMO communication theory, the multiple-input multiple-output radar (MIMO radar) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> has recently become a hot research topic owing to its potential advantages over the conventional phased-array radar. MIMO radar emits independent waveforms using multiple antennas, which causes the whole space to be covered by the electromagnetic waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. At the receive site, it also uses multiple antennas to receive the reflected signals which are processed for all the transmitted waveforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. According to the configuration of transmit and receive antennas, two kinds of MIMO radars are formed. One in which the transmit and receive antennas are widely spaced is called as statistical MIMO radar <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The other in which the transmit and receive antennas are closely spaced is named as monostatic or bistatic MIMO radar <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The former aims at resisting the ''scintillation'' effect encountered in radar systems by capitalizing on the spatial diversity. The latter can form receive beam and virtual transmit beam jointly at the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, achieve flexible spatial transmit beam pattern design <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and provide high-resolution spatial spectral estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>A bistatic MIMO radar scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is proposed to identify and locate multiple targets, in which both the transmit array and the receive array are uniform linear arrays. Thus, the direction of arrivals (DOAs) and the direction of departures (DODs) of targets can be synthesized by processing the received signals. The Capon estimator needs two-dimensional (2-D) angle search when used for multiple targets identification and location in bistatic MIMO radar <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In order to avoid angle search, ESPRIT algorithm is applied to bistatic MIMO radar by exploiting the invariance property of the transmit and receive arrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, an additional pair matching between the DOAs and DODs of targets is required. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the interrelationship between the two 1-D ESPRIT is exploited to obtain automatically paired DOAs and DODs estimation without debasing the performance of angle estimation. The methods proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> are used for angle estimation in the presence of spatial Gaussian white noise. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the ESPRIT method is also applied to bistatic MIMO radar to estimate target angles with utilization of the rotational factor produced by multi-transmitter. Although this method can cancel spatial colored noise, it is only effective for three-transmitter configured system. Owing to the restriction of the number of transmit antennas, both the angle estimation performance and the maximum number of identified targets of the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> would not depend on the number of transmit antennas.</p><p>In this paper, we present an angle estimation method for bistatic MIMO radar using both singular value decomposition (SVD) of cross-correlation matrix and ESPRIT. By partitioning the transmit array into two subarrays and matching the received data with the transmitted signals of two subarrays, the two received data from two transmit subarrays are obtained, respectively. Then, from the signal subspace matrix acquired by SVD of cross-correlation matrix of the two received data, the DOAs and DODs of targets can be solved in closed form and paired automatically by using the ESPRIT-based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This method could be effective for a system with three-or more-transmitters to eliminate the influence of spatial colored noise. In the case of threetransmitter configuration, the performance of our method is similar to that of the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and so is the maximum number of identified targets. With increase of transmitters and receivers, the performance of angle estimation can be improved, and the maximum number of identified targets can also be increased by using our method.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. The bistatic MIMO radar signal model is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, a new method for DOA and DOD estimation is proposed. The maximum number of identified targets is analyzed in Section 4. Some simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Maximum number of targets</head><p>The maximum number of targets that can be identified by our method is dependent on Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) and ESPRIT-based method. The array structure can be configured to ensure full column rank of B and A. To ensure the maximum number of identified targets, the matrix R F should be full rank, which may be guaranteed by the different Doppler frequencies of targets. When B and A are full column rank and R F is full rank, the maximum number of identified targets depends on the maximum rank of R z . Obviously, the maximum rank of R z is M 1 N. On the other hand, by using ESPRIT-based method, the DODs and DOAs of targets are estimated from the signal subspace matrix U 1 , whose columns span the same signal subspace as the column vectors of B. If U 1 is considered as the signal subspace matrix obtained from SVD of auto-correlation matrix of the receive data in ðM À M 1 ÞN-element array, the maximum number of targets that can be identified by the ESPRIT method mentioned in Section 3 is ðM À M 1 À 1ÞN. So the maximum number of targets that can be identified by this scheme is min½M 1 N; ðM À M 1 À 1ÞN. Because of the relation M 1 ðM À 1Þ=2, this maximum number can be simplified to be M 1 N, which is different from that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and is determined by not only the number of transmitters but also the number of receivers. The proposed method for the systems with three-and four-transmitter configuration can estimate the same number of targets as that of receive antennas, which equates to the maximum identifiable number of the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for three-transmitter configured system. However, the MIMO system, in which the number of transmitters is more than four, can identify more targets by using our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Simulation results</head><p>Some simulations are conducted in the presence of spatial colored noise to evaluate the estimation performances of the proposed method and the ESPRIT-based method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the latter is named Jin method for short. We select the Gold sequences as the transmitted baseband signals of bistatic MIMO radar, which are nearly orthogonal binary codes with good autocorrelation and intercorrelation. The duration of one code is assumed to be 4 ns and the period length of Gold-sequence is 1023. Thus, the repetition interval of the transmitted signals is 4.092 ms.</p><p>The carrier frequency of the transmitted waveforms is f 0 ¼ 10 GHz. A bistatic MIMO radar with M ! 3 transmitters and N ¼ 4 receivers is adopted. The array structure is same as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, and with half-wavelength space between adjacent elements used both for transmit array and receive array. To enable fair comparison between the MIMO radar systems with different number of transmitters, the signal transmitted from each transmitter in the simulations is scaled such that the total transmitted power E T is constant, irrespective of the number of transmit antennas. The spatial colored noise model is chosen as a spatial complex AR model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> of order 2 with coefficients a ¼ ½1 À 1 0:2. More specifically, the noise vector vðkÞ 2 C NÂ1 for the kth sampling point at the receive site is generated as v j ðkÞ ¼ v jÀ1 ðkÞ À 0:2v jÀ2 ðkÞ þ o j ðkÞ; j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; N (15) where v j ðkÞ is the jth element of vðkÞ 2 C NÂ1 , E½v j v H j ¼ s 2 v and o j ðkÞ is the jth element of the spatial white noise vector xðkÞ 2 C NÂ1 . The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as SNR ¼ 10 lgðE T Á jbj 2 =s 2 v Þ, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of angle estimation is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">RMSE ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 1 LC X LC i¼1 ½ð ĵi À jÞ 2 þ ð ŷi À yÞ 2 v u u t , (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where LC is the number of the independent trials, ĵi and ŷi are the DOD and DOA estimates results of the same target for the ith-trial, and their actual values are j and y, respectively. P ¼ 3 targets locate at ðj 1 ; y 1 Þ ¼ ð40 ; 35 Þ, ðj 2 ; y 2 Þ ¼ ðÀ30 ; À20 Þ, ðj 3 ; y 3 Þ ¼ ð10 ; 10 Þ and their RCSs are given by b</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">1 ¼ b 2 ¼ b 3 ¼ 1.</formula><p>The sums of two radial velocities with respect to the transmit array and the receive array for three targets are given by 240 m=s, 100 m=s and 170 m=s, respectively. The number of snapshots is selected as L ¼ 100. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the RMSE of angle estimation of the first target versus SNR with the number of independent trials LC ¼ 200. The number of transmitters M is selected as 3, 4 and 5, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> that the performances of the proposed method and Jin method are similar for three-transmitter configuration. However, the Jin method is only effective for three-transmitter configured system, while the proposed method is effective for three-or more-transmitter configured system. It is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> that the angle estimation accuracy of the proposed method with the transmit array partitioned can be improved or maintained as the number of the transmitters increases, and the different partitions of transmit array for the proposed method may cause different accuracies of angle estimation. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, we observe that the proposed method with M 1 ¼ 1 has lower RMSE than that with M 1 ¼ 2 for M ¼ 5 and N ¼ 4 bistatic MIMO radar due to the fact that the former exploits more virtual sensors than the latter to estimate DODs and DOAs of targets from the signal subspace matrix U 1 , although the latter can identify more targets than the former. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows the estimation result of eight targets for M ¼ 5 and N ¼ 4 bistatic MIMO radar under the condition SNR ¼ 0 dB, which is estimated by using the proposed method with M 1 ¼ 2 antennas in the first subarray. The number of Monte Carlo trials is 100. The locations, RCSs and the velocities (sum of two radial velocities) of eight targets are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, we can observe that the targets' 2-D angles can be identified and paired automatically in our scheme. And the maximum number of targets can be identified is M 1 N ¼ 2 Â 4 ¼ 8, which is consistent with the conclusion in Section 4. </p></div>
