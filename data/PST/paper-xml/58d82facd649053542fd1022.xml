<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the dense deployment of small cell networks, the powering and backhaul problem of small cell base stations (SBSs) has attracted great attentions, and energy harvesting technology as well as self-backhaul technology have been proposed as promising solutions. Although some excellent works have been done on energy harvesting and self-backhaul in small cell networks, most existing works do not consider them jointly. In this paper, we aim at green small cell networks by jointly achieving self-backhaul and energy harvesting. In addition, fullduplex (FD) and massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technologies are also exploited to enhance the system performance. In order to improve the energy efficiency (EE) further, a novel precoding scheme is designed to eliminate both the inter-tier and multi-user interference. Based on the proposed precoding scheme, we formulate the cell association and power allocation problem as an optimization problem to optimize the system EE performance, with the energy arrival rate and remaining battery energy in SBSs involved. The formulated optimization problem implies a sleep mechanism to control the on/off of SBSs, which will further reduce the energy consumption of small cell networks. In addition, to reduce the computation complexity to solve this non-convex problem, we propose to transform the original problem into a difference of convex program, which can be efficiently solved via a constrained concave convex procedurebased algorithm. Extensive simulation results are presented to justify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme that with different system configurations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION</head><p>With the explosive demand for improving mobile data rate as well as reducing the capital expenses (CapEx) and operation expenses (OpEx), small cell networks have been considered as a promising technology of next generation cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In particular, dense small cell networks have attracted great attentions, where a mass of small cell base stations (SBSs) are deployed to improve user experience further <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, with the dense deployment of massive SBSs, the powering and backhaul problem becomes increasingly severe. On one hand, the energy consumption and the cost of optical backhaul will increase sharply with the increase of the number of SBSs. On the other hand, since SBSs are densely and irregularly located, some of them may be inaccessible to the traditional power grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Therefore, solving the powering and backhaul problem is critical to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) of users and reduce the CapEx and OpEx.</p><p>Energy harvesting technology, which can harvest ambient renewable energy (e.g., solar and wind energy), has been proposed as a promising alternative solution to green wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. It is estimated that applying energy harvesting technology to small cell networks can achieve a 20 percent CO 2 reduction in the information and communication technology industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Furthermore, due to the high CapEx and OpEx of traditional fibre backhaul, researchers pay more attention on wireless backhaul, which further facilitates the deployment of SBSs. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed the microwave backhaul scheme and the mmwave backhaul scheme is researched in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The microwave and mmwave, with a significantly wide bandwidth, can provide high-capacity backhaul link. However, both of them can only perform well in line-of sight (LoS) environments, which leads to more demands for the deployment of SBSs (e.g., the location of SBSs and the height of antennas). Those demands can hardly be satisfied in urban or mountain environments because of massive obstructions. Moreover, the equipment of microwave and mmwave is typically heavy and expensive, which prevents the fast deployment of SBSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Another wireless backhaul candidate is the cellular communication technology (e.g., LTE), which uses the cellular spectrum to access and backhaul, and is suitable for the non-LoS environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. With the cellular communication technologybased backhaul (called self-backhaul in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>), the SBSs do not necessarily require extra backhaul hardware or spectrum, and consequently, self-backhaul is regarded as promising technology in future small cell networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the previous work on energy harvesting and selfbackaul, there is still a lack of study that jointly considers these two issues in small cell networks. Moreover, most existing works do not consider the recent advances of full-duplex (FD) technologies enabled by self-interference cancellation and massive multiple-input and multiple-output <ref type="bibr">(MIMO)</ref>. FD enables the radios to transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band, which nearly doubles the spectrum efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Nevertheless, the FD technology originates from the time division duplex (TDD) system, which makes it unsuitable for access links in the frequency division duplex (FDD) system <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this paper, we use the FD technology for backhauls, in which FD communication hardware is equipped in SBSs. Consequently, SBSs can receive data from the macro base station (MBS) and transmit data to SBSs in downlink (DL), transmit data to MBS and receive data from their users in uplink (UL) in the same frequency simultaneously, which is termed as FD self-backhaul. As another promising technology, massive MIMO can achieve simultaneous multi-user transmission in the same frequency band by utilizing the large degree of spatial freedom, and also can improve the spectrum efficiency as well as energy efficiency (EE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Due to the fact that the MBS is also responsible for the transmission to SBSs in our proposed FD self-backhaul scheme, the MBS with massive MIMO can transmit data to or receive data from SBSs as well as its users together simultaneously in the same frequency band. This is different from our previous works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, where the spectrum is segmented to avoid the co-channel interference among SBSs and the users of MBS. In this way, the spectrum efficiency and EE of backhaul and access link will be improved significantly. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, the authors analyzed the gain of incorporation of massive MIMO into small cell networks, but did not take into account the backhaul challenge and simplified the power allocation of MBS and SBSs by equal power allocation.</p><p>Although jointly considering self-backhaul and energy harvesting technologies can bring many benefits to small cell networks, it is challenging to study them jointly, as the energy arrival and the battery capacity are limited in energy harvesting systems. Moreover, since the self-backhaul typically consumes extra energy of MBS to support backhaul links, the cell association and power allocation in energy harvesting small cell networks with self-backhaul will be more challenging than that in the traditional energy harvesting small cell networks, especially in our proposed FD self-backhaul scheme with massive MIMO, because it involves power allocation in multiuser MIMO systems. Furthermore, the inter-tier interference in small cell networks and the multi-user interference caused by multi-user MIMO channel in massive MIMO system make the cell association and power allocation in our proposed FD self-backhaul and energy harvesting small cell networks more complex. The distinct features of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>• We propose an architecture of FD self-backhaul and energy harvesting small cell networks with massive MIMO.</p><p>In our proposed scheme, the MBS is equipped with massive MIMO antennas, while the SBSs with multiantenna array are powered by renewable energy and have the FD capability. By treating the SBSs as special macro users, we can achieve the concurrent transmissions of the access link of users and the backhaul link of SBSs at the same time-frequency resource block. • Furthermore, to avoid the multi-user and inter-tier interference, we propose a precoding scheme of MBS and SBSs, where an advanced Block Digitalization (BD) precoding method is proposed to project the transmission signal into the null space of interference channel matrix. • Then we formulate the cell association and power allocation as an optimization problem from the EE perspective, which implies a SBS sleep problem, while taking into account the lowest QoS requirement of users, the energy arrival rate, and the remaining energy of SBSs. In addition, the residual self-interference of FD communications is involved in the formulated problem. • Since the formulated problem is non-convex, its computational complexity is prohibitively high. To solve it efficiently, we transfer the original problem into a difference of convex program (DCP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> by appropriate variable substitution, and then solve it via a constrained concave convex procedure (CCCP)-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> iterative algorithm. Furthermore, the convergence of the proposed iteration algorithm is proved. • Extensive simulations are conducted with different system configurations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FD self-backhaul and energy harvesting scheme for small cell networks with massive MIMO. It can be shown that our proposed scheme achieves good performance in terms of EE, energy consumption and cost. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the framework of our proposed FD self-backhaul and energy harvesting small cell networks with massive MIMO. Section III presents the precoding scheme design and problem formulation. After that, we solve the optimization problem in Section IV and demonstrate the simulation results in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes this study.</p><p>Notation: We use boldface upper and lower case symbols to denote matrices and column vectors, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>In this paper, we consider a two-tier small cell network consisting of one MBS with MIMO antennas array and N SBSs with multi-antenna array, where the MBS uses the conventional grid power while the SBS is capable of harvesting energy from renewable energy (e.g., solar and wind), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The energy arrival rate in SBSs is defined by λ EH . Let A m and A s denote the number of antennas in MBS and SBS, respectively. K users with single antenna can access to MBS or any SBS. The user accessed to either MBS and SBS is named by MU and SU, respectively. It should be noted here that MU located in the interference area <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> of SBSs (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) will suffer the inter-tier interference from SBSs. Let U m and U s n be the set of users associated to MBS and SBS n, respectively, and U = U m U s n be the set of all users. Considering that some SBSs may be shut off because of the lack of remaining energy, we define B s as the set of SBSs in which U s n is non-null, U v n as the set of MUs (i.e. victim MUs) located in the interference area of SBS n, and B s u as the set of the SBSs interfering MU u. If B s u is null, it indicates that MU u is not a victim MU and does not suffer any intertier interference from SBSs. For ease of analysis, full buffer traffic model is assumed in both MBS and SBSs. Note that we focus on the DL transmission of the considered networks in this paper. The proposed FD self-backhauling scheme of small cell networks with massive MIMO is introduced in Subsection II-A and the MIMO DL signal is described in Subsection II-B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. FD Self-backhauling Scheme of Small Cell Networks with Massive MIMO</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, SBSs are equipped with FD hardware in our proposed scheme, enabling in-band backhaul capacity for themselves. In the DL, a SBS can receive data from the MBS while simultaneously transmitting to its users in the same frequency band. In this mechanism, the small cell can effectively backhaul itself, eliminating the need for a separate backhaul solution or frequency band. Therefore, selfbackhauling can significantly reduce the cost and complexity of rolling out small cell networks. Due to the limitation of self-interference cancellation technologies, nevertheless, the backhaul DL of SBSs will suffer self-interference from access DL of SUs.</p><p>Moreover, with the massive number of antennas in MBS and and multi-antennas in SBSs, both MBS and SBSs can transmit data to multiple users simultaneously in the same frequency band via the multi-user MIMO technology. In this paper, we study the FD self-backhaul in massive MIMO-equipped small cell networks with the SBSs acting as special MUs. In our proposed scheme, not only the MBS transmits data to MUs and SBSs, but also SBSs could transfer data to their users simultaneously in the same frequency band. In other words, by jointly considering FD and massive MIMO technologies, we achieve not only the concurrent transmission of MUs and SUs in a same frequency band, but also the simultaneous access and backhaul of SBSs in the same frequency band. Therefore, this scheme will improve the spectrum efficiency and EE, and meanwhile decrease the cost of backhaul infrastructure. To reap the benefits of massive MIMO antennas, perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be available at transmitters, and the TDD protocol is adopted for the exploitation of the channel reciprocity, which allows the MBS to estimate its DL channel from UL pilots sent by the users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. MIMO DL Signaling</head><p>In this subsection, we take a typical user u as an example to analyze the access DL signal of MUs and SUs, and a typical SBS n to analyze the backhaul DL signal of SBSs, with the assumption that all channels follow independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) CN (0,1).</p><p>1) Access DL of MUs and SUs: As described in Subsection II-A, the MBS with massive MIMO serves MUs for accessing and the SBSs for backhauling at the same time-frequency resource block. The received signal at MU u can be given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y m u = (h m u ) H w m u x m u + (h m u ) H K u ∈Um,u =u w m u x m u + (h m u ) H n∈B s W b n x b n + n∈B s u (h s,n u ) H W s n x s n + n m u , (1)</formula><p>where the first term is the desired signal, in which h m u ∈ C Am×1 , w m u ∈ C Am×1 and x m u are defined as the channel vector, precoding vector and transmitting signal of user u at MBS, respectively; the second term is the multi-user interference from other MUs; the third term is the multi-user interference from backhaul signals of all SBSs, in which W b n ∈ C Am×As and x b n are the precoding matrix and the transmitting signal of SBS n at MBS, respectively; the forth term is the inter-tier interference from some SBSs, in which h s,n u is the channel vector from SBS n to user u, and W s n ∈ C As× U s n and x s n are the precoding matrix and transmitting signal symbol vector of all SUs associated to SBS n, respectively; the last term is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with E{n m u (n m k ) H } = σ 2 . With respect to SBS n, it utilizes its antennas to support multi-user MIMO transmission. For SUs, they suffer not only the inter-tier interference from the MBS but also the multiuser interference from other SUs in the same SBS, then the received signal of user k associated to SBS n is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y s,n u = (h s,n u ) H w s,n u x s,n u + (h s,n u ) H û∈U n s ,û =u w s,n û x s,n û + (h m u ) H u ∈Um w m u x m u + (h m u ) H n∈B s W b n x b n + n s,n u , (2)</formula><p>where the first term is the desired signal, in which w s,n u ∈ C As×1 and x s,n u ∈ C 1×1 are the elements of W s n and x s n , representing the precoding vector and transmitting signal intended for user u in SBS n, respectively; the second term represents the multi-user interference from other SUs in SBS n; the third and forth term are the inter-tier interference from MBS; and the last term is the AWGN with E{(n s,n u ) 2 } = σ 2 . 2) Backhaul DL of SBSs: In our proposed FD self-backhaul scheme of small cell networks with massive MIMO, the MBS is responsible for achieving the access DL of MUs as well as backhaul DL of SBSs at the same time-frequency resource block. For the SBS n, the received signal from the MBS can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y b n =(H b n ) H W b n x b n + (H b n ) H k∈Um w m k x m k + (H b n ) H N n ∈B s ,n =n W b n x b n + χ b n + n b n ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the first term is the desired signal and H b n ∈ C Am×As is the channel matrix from MBS to SBS n; the second and third term are the multi-user interference from MUs and other SBSs, respectively. The last term is the AWGN with E{n b n n b n H } = σ 2 I As . Different from the access DL, the backhaul DL of SBSs suffers the self-interference besides the multi-user interference.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the self-interference can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">χ b n = √ γ(H s,n SI ) H W s n x s n ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where H s,n SI ∈ C As×As is the self-interference channel matrix among antennas in SBS n, γ is the self-interference cancellation factor, which is determined by specific self-interference cancellation technologies. Any self-interference cancellation technology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>) can be applied at SBSs, and the analysis in this paper is a general case.</p><p>For the simplification of our model, the intra-tier interference in small cell tier is neglected in (1)-(3) due to the low transmission power of SBSs. In addition, even though the intra-tier interference is considered, it also can be cancelled completely by the proposed precoding scheme design in next section, but will increase the complexity of our model drastically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PRECODING SCHEME DESIGNS AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>From the perspective of EE, the multi-user and inter-tier interference in (1), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), (3) lead to more power consumption in access DL and backhaul DL, and then decreasing the EE performance. Specially, inter-tier interference cancellation is always a non-trivial challenge for wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. In this paper, we cancel the multi-user interference and inter-tier interference by designing precoding schemes of both MBS and SBSs. In this way, the inter-tier interference problem, regarded as the traditional challenge of small cell networks, can be solved perfectly, which is another benefit of the combination of massive MIMO with small cell networks. In this section, we first introduce the precoding scheme of MBS and SBSs in detail, and then formulate an optimization problem maximizing the EE of the consider system with some constraints. Note that we make an assumption that the cell association scheme of all users has been decided in the precoding scheme design section III-A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Precoding Scheme Designs</head><p>We propose an advanced Block Digitalization (BD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> [37] precoding scheme to cancel both the multi-user and inter-tier interference. The traditional BD precoding scheme is utilized to cancel multi-user interference for the MIMO multiuser DL channel by constraining the precoding scheme of each user to lie in the null space of the aggregated channel matrix of other users. In our proposed advanced BD precoding scheme, the precoding scheme of each user is constructed to lie in the null space of the aggregated channel matrix of all interfered links (including not only multi-user interference links but also inter-tier interference). In this way, not only the inter-tier interference but also the multi-user interference can be eliminated completely simultaneously. In the following, the joint precoding scheme will be introduced in detail.</p><p>1) Precoding Scheme in the MBS: As described in Subsection II-A, the MBS is responsible to transmit data to MUs and SBSs, so we need to provide the individual precoding schemes of MUs and SBSs. We define U u,b = U B s as the set of all users and SBSs. According to the traditional BD precoding scheme, we further define by H </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H m u = U m u Λ m u 0 0 0 V m u (1) V m u (0) H ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">H b n = U b n Λ b n 0 0 0 V b n (1) V b n (0) H , (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">+ A s × N -1 &lt; A m is satisfied, the precoding matrix of SBS n and MU u can be constructed by W b n = V b n (0) W b n and w m u = v m u (0) P m u 1/2</formula><p>respectively, where W b n is the candidate precoding matrix to be decided for SBS n, v m u</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(0) is one column vector of V m u (0)</formula><p>and P m u is the allocated transmission power to MU u, and then the multi-user interference among all SBSs and MUs and inter-tier interference from MBS to SUs will be eliminated completely.</p><p>Proof: Since the precoding schemes of MUs and SBSs are similar, we take the proof of SBSs as an example. According to the theory of SVD in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the column vectors belonging to </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V b n (0) locate in the null space of H b n , which means H b n V b n (0) = 0. From the definition of H b n , it can be observed that H b n = [H m SU , H m SBS , H m MU ] H ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">obvious that (H m SU ) H V b n (0) = 0, (H m SBS ) H V b n (0) = 0,</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(H m MU ) H V b n (0) = 0 hold. If the precoding matrix of SBS n is constructed by W b n = V m s (0) W b n , it can be observed that (H m SU ) H W b n = 0, (H m SBS ) H W b n = 0, and (H m MU ) H W b n = 0 2 .</formula><p>In this way, the transmission signal from MBS to SBSs will not interfere with SUs, MUs and other SBSs, implying the inter-tier interference to SUs and multiuser interference are cancelled.

For w m u , the vector v m u (0) is not related to the cell association scheme since the aggregated DL channel matrix H m u includes the DL channel of all users and SBSs except for MU u, so we can obtain the vector v m u (0) of all users by regarding them as MUs. For w s,n u , the vector v s,n u is up to the aggregated channel matrix H s,n u which only depends on the coverage area of SBS n. In the coverage area of SBS n, the users will be served by either SBS n or MBS and the users associated to MBS will be victim users, so the vector v s,n u of all users in the coverage area of SBS n can be obtained by treating those users as SUs. Similarly, for W b n , it is calculated by two steps but the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">V b n (0)</formula><p>in the first step and V b n (1) in the second step are also not related to the cell association scheme, so the matrix Λ b n of all SBSs can be acquired independently.

Problem Formulation</head><p>In this paper, we jointly optimize the cell association and power allocation scheme from the EE perspective in one time period taking into account the QoS requirement of users, energy arrival rate as well as remaining battery energy of SBSs.

Similarly, when user u is associated with SBS n, a s,n u = 1; otherwise, a s,n u = 0. Moreover, let A and let P denote the cell association and power allocation scheme, respectively.

C4 and C5 specify the lowest QoS requirements for MUs and SUs. C6 and C7 indicate that all users only can access to one BS.

As a consequence, the sequence {U([A] t , [ P] t )} monotonically increases as the iteration number t grows. Since the sequence {U([A] t , [ P] t )} is upper-bounded by transmission power limit in C2 and the energy limit in C3 , the convergence of the sequence {U([A] t , [ P] t )}, and thus the convergence of Algorithm 2 is guaranteed for any initial feasible point. Moreover, since the objective function U(A, P) is concave as we have proven in subsection IV-C, the point ([A] t , [ P] t ), i.e., the solution of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, is unique <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> (Sec. 4.2).

Since the considered original problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> is a combinational and non-convex problem and it still is non-convex even though the constant association variables are assumed, it is difficult to solve this problem effectively.

The main computational complexity of the proposed solution algorithm consists in solving L 1 × L 2 × L 3 times the convex optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> in inner loop. CVX software is applied to solve the problem ( <ref type="formula">31</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, and CVX employs GP with interior-point method.

Considering the good convergence performance and low iteration times (we investigate it in simulation section) of our proposed algorithm, the computational complexity of original problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">19</ref>) is reduced largely by our proposed algorithm comparing to the brute force search algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>In this section, the effectiveness of our proposed FD selfbackhaul and energy harvesting small cell network architecture with massive MIMO and the proposed cell association and power allocation algorithm will be demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations. In order to show the performance of our proposed network architecture clearly, two simulation scenarios are identified: multi-cell scenario and single-cell scenario. The multi-cell scenario focuses on the performance in terms of energy and cost saving while the single-cell scenario pays attention to evaluate the gains brought by FD and massive MIMO technologies. In the multi-cell scenario, we consider a classical model with seven cells and the distance of different MBS is 1000m. In the single-cell scenario, we consider a 500m × 500m square area covered by one MBS located in the center. Both in the two scenarios, users and SBSs are uniformly distributed. Other simulation parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">I</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Influence of the Maximum Self-interference Temperature and Self-interference Cancellation Factor</head><p>In this section, we focus on the impact of the value of Q on the system EE in single-cell scenario. As can be seen from ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>), the self-interference temperature Q, which is the key for transforming problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> into a solvable optimization problem, plays an important role in the proposed cell association and power allocation algorithm. The value of Q imposes a limit on the spectrum efficiency of the backhaul link and access link of SBSs by controlling the amount of interference temperature. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3</ref> shows the EE of the proposed algorithm versus the value of Q under different self-interference cancellation factor γ, different numbers of SBSs N and different numbers of users K. The x-axis is the interference temperature-to-noise ratio, Q/σ 2 . It can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3</ref> that the EE remains unchanged with the variation of Q if perfect self-interference cancellation technology is adopted, i.e., γ = 0. This is because problem (24) will be a convex optimization problem and the constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> does not exist when γ = 0. When we set γ = -30dB, the EE will go up first and then go down with the increase of the value of Q. It can be explained as that the power allocated to SUs is limited by constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> when Q is small but the rate of backhaul link will be limited when Q is large. In addition, it can be observed that the choice of Q is dependent on the number of users. This is because a higher value of Q can be tolerated for a larger number of users as the self-interference can be better coped with due to the multiple user diversity gain. On the other hand, as expected, the optimal value of Q is also sensitive to the number of SBSs since the multiple access gain is potential when there are more SBSs. In the following, we follow the assumption that the self-interference can be cancelled completely in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to simply the simulation progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Performance of Our Proposed Network Architecture 1) Multi-cell Simulation Scenario:</head><p>In this scenario, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed network architecture in terms of grid power consumption, cost and outage probability by comparing it with the traditional fiber backhaul and grid power scheme. The fiber backhaul is based on the 10 GPON (gigabit capable PON) technology providing sustainable bandwidth per SBS. We evaluate the cost of networks via the sum of the CapEx and the OpEx during 20 years, where the CapEx includes equipments purchase, installation and backhaul infrastructure cost, the OpEx includes energy cost, spectrum and fiber leasing, maintenance cost, fault management and space rental fee <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. For detailed parameters with respect to the cost, please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. And user density in this area is 1 × 10 -3 /m 2 . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cost</head><p>Grid power with fiber backhaul scheme Energy harvesting with fiber backhual scheme Grid power with self-backhaul scheme Energy harvesting with self-backhaul scheme As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, the grid power consumption of all schemes will decrease significantly with the increase of SBS deployment density. The reason is that more users will be offloaded to SBSs when there are more SBSs and then the grid power consumption in MBS will reduce because of the low energy consumption of SBSs. Meanwhile, the increase of the number of SBSs offers a opportunities for users to access some closer SBSs and then the grid power consumption in SBSs will decrease accordingly. Unfortunately, with the further increase of SBS deployment density, the off-load and multiple access point gain will be weaken, which causes that the decrease rate of the grid power consumption of all schemes goes down. However, it can be observed that the schemes with energy harvesting strategy always outperform the schemes with grid power strategy. This is because that the schemes with energy harvesting strategy can harvest energy from the environment to power SBS and thus save vast grid energy. Outage probability</p><p>Energy harvesting with self-backhaul scheme Energy harvesting with fiber backhaul scheme Grid power with self-backhaul scheme Grid power with fiber backhaul scheme Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Outage probability versus SBS deployment density(R min = 0.5bps/Hz, λ EH = 60mW/s, and γ = 0).</p><p>Form Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, we can find that the self-backhaul scheme will consume more power than fiber backhaul scheme. This is due to the fact that some energy must be consumed in the MBS to support the transmission of backhaul data to SBSs in our proposed self-backhaul scheme. This weakness can be remedied by its great advantage in reducing the network cost. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref>, the cost of our proposed FD selfbackhaul and energy harvesting scheme is lowest compared to other schemes. On one hand, the energy harvesting strategy reduces the energy cost. On the other hand, the self-backhaul will reduce the backhaul infrastructure cost tremendously. At the same time, our proposed self-backhaul scheme will decrease the use of fiber and then the carbon dioxide emission will reduce in the progress of producing fiber. As a result, the proposed self-backhaul and energy harvesting small cell architecture is helpful to achieve green communication in small cell networks.</p><p>2) Single-cell Simulation Scenario: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">8</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">9</ref> show the effectiveness of introducing FD and massive MIMO technology into self-backhaul strategy. As shown in the three figures, our proposed FD self-backhaul scheme with massive MIMO is superior to other single-antenna scheme or half duplex (HD) scheme, which can be explained as follows. First, massive MIMO improves the spectrum efficiency and EE by utilizing the free degree of space. In this way, the access of users and the backhaul of SBSs can be operated at the same time frequency resource block, rather than at time division or frequency division pattern. Second, the multiantenna deployment in MBS and SBSs broadens the backhaul link by achieving multiple data streaming transmission. In single-antenna system, the single data stream transmission limits the backhaul link rate and then reduces the number of users associated to SBSs, resulting in the decrease of spectrum efficiency and EE. Third, the application of FD technology in the backhaul of SBS enables the simultaneous reception and transmission instead of the HD pattern (the first phase for transmission and the second phase for reception), which nearly doubles the spectrum efficiency. Based on these three reasons, our proposed FD self-backhaul scheme with massive MIMO always performs better in terms of EE and the capacity. Furthermore, after the inter-tier interference cancellation (ITIC) by exploiting our proposed precoding scheme, the performance of our proposed FD self-backhaul scheme with massive MIMO will be enhanced further. In this case, not only the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of users but also the SINR of the backhaul links will be enhanced once the intertier interference is eliminated completely. Then, the lowest rate requirement of users can be satisfied with less power consumption, which will improve the EE and capacity further. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7</ref>, the EE keeps increasing with the number of SBSs rising, which is because the multiple SBSs gain is obtained and the sleep strategy is adopted. With the sleep strategy, the SBS with no users attached will be shut off, leading to less circuit power consumption. When the number of users is small, there will be sufficient power resources, then the EE will increase with the increase users as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">8</ref>. However, the power resource will be exhausted when there are too more users and then some users will be refused to access. Nevertheless, the EE will still increase since the multi-user diversity gain is obtained.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">10</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">11</ref>, we show the effectiveness of introducing sleep mechanism into energy harvesting strategy with different numbers of SBSs. In both figures, it can be observed that the performance of energy harvesting scheme with sleep mechanism outperforms the scheme without sleep mechanism; and the performance gap gets more broadened with more SBSs. The reason is that the sleep mechanism contributes to save energy and store those energy into battery of SBSs to serve for next time slot, which improves the probability that the SBSs have enough energy to support the operation of the SBSs and then rise the ratio of SUs to all users. It is obvious that the influence is more arresting when there are more SBSs since the probability that the SBSs  have enough energy to support the operation of the SBSs is improved further. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">10</ref>, it can be founded that the ratio of MUs to all users will decrease with the increase of the arrival rate, but with a decreasing change rate. The reason is that there are more SBSs can provide service to users when the SBSs can harvest more energy, but the number of SBSs will become the dominant factor when all SBSs have enough energy. Based on the same reason, the EE will go up with the increase of the average energy arrival rate but the increase rate is reducing gradually.   feasible points. Meanwhile, the optimal solution obtained by the brute force searching (BFS) algorithm is presented as a benchmark, in a single-cell simulation scenario with 40 users and 5 SBSs. Both the good convergence and robustness can be observed from this figure. No matter where the initial point is, our algorithm will converge. In addition, the gap between Algorithm 2 and BFS algorithm gets more narrow after sufficient iterations, although our solution is not a global optimal solution. Furthermore, it can be observed from this figure that a significant decrease of gap between Algorithm 2 and BFS algorithm can be found from the first iteration to the 10-th iteration. After the 10-the iteration, the gain of more iterations is still increasing but with less rate. Thus, a tradeoff exits between the acceptable utility value and iteration steps.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a self-backhaul and energy harvesting small cell network architecture and introduced FD and massive MIMO to enhance the performance of the considered network. In this way, the access of users and backhaul of SBSs can be achieved simultaneously in the same frequency band, improving the spectrum efficiency and EE. Furthermore, in order to decrease the power consumption further, we designed the precoding scheme of MBS and SBSs to mitigate the multiuser and inter-tier interference. Considering the energy limit of SBSs and the QoS requirement of users, we formulated the cell association and power allocation problem as an optimization problem, in which EE was taken as the optimization objective. Considering the high computation complexity for solving the non-convex optimization problem, we introduced some appropriate transformations to transform equivalently the original problem into a DCP, which can be efficiently solved with local optimality using a CCCP-based algorithm. Simulation results showed that the proposed self-backhaul and energy harvesting small cell networks are able to reduce the energy consumption and the cost of networks effectively and the FD and massive MIMO technologies promoted the increase of network performance in terms of EE and the number of acceptable users. In addition, simulation results also demonstrated the effectiveness and good convergence performance of our proposed CCCP-based cell association and power allocation algorithm. Future work is in progress to consider the spectrum resource allocation and non-perfect CSI in our proposed scheme.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: The network model.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,314.75,58.85,204.86,93.38" type="bitmap" /></figure>

This procedure is carried out iteratively until convergence or the maximum number of allowable iterations is reached. We summarize the proposed low-complexity solution as Algorithm 2, where we assume that an initial feasible point ([A] 0 , [ P] 0 ) of the DCP ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) is available (how to obtain an initial feasible point will be introduced in the following subsection).

In other words, the feasible set in problem ( <ref type="formula">31</ref>) is a proper subset of the feasible set in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. As a result, provided that the initial point ([A] 0 , [ P] 0 ) is feasible for the DCP (29), then  Dr. Leung has co-authored more than 500 technical papers in international journals and conference proceedings, and several of these papers had been selected for best paper awards. His research interests cover broad areas of wireless networks and mobile systems.</p></div>			</div>
