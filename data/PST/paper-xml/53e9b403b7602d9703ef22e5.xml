<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Adaptive mesh refinement methods for variational problems have been the object of intense study in recent years. The main objective of these methods is to reduce the computational cost in the numerical approximation of PDE solutions. Their usefulness is especially apparent when the exact solution has strong, geometrically localized variations or exhibits singularities. A posteriori estimates have proved to be a particularly successful mathematical tool in devising efficient adaptive versions of many numerical schemes. In addition, a posteriori estimates provide a new point of view in the theoretical investigation of a scheme's behavior. This is especially important for problems where "reasonable discretizations" do not always perform as expected.</p><p>In the context of finite element methods (FEM), the theory of a posteriori estimates for linear stationary problems is by now rather mature <ref type="bibr">[2, 30, and references]</ref>. The situation for nonlinear and time dependent problems, however, has not yet been as thoroughly explored. Even for the linear parabolic equation, in spite of important advances made in the early '90s <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> and subsequent ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, many issues have yet to be tackled. Such issues are, for instance, the derivation of optimal order estimates in various norms via the energy or other direct methods, the use of nonresidual based estimators to control the elliptic part of the error, and estimates for various time discretization methods.</p><p>In this paper we address some of these issues in the context of fully discrete linear parabolic problems where mesh modification in time might occur-as it is natural to expect in adaptive schemes for time-dependent problems. Our main tool in deriving the estimates is an appropriate adaptation to the fully discrete case of the elliptic reconstruction technique introduced by Makridakis and Nochetto for the model problem of semidiscrete finite element approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. A main characteristic of this approach, which contrasts with other direct techniques found in the literature, is that we can virtually use any available a posteriori estimates for elliptic equations to control the main part of the spatial error. Thus one can take full advantage of a well-established theory, instead of trying to adapt the estimates case by case. This follows from the fact that, in deriving the estimates, instead of comparing directly the exact solution with the numerical one, we construct an appropriate auxiliary function that fulfills two fundamental properties: (i) we know how to estimate its difference to the numerical solution via known a posteriori results, and (ii) it satisfies a variant of the original PDE with a right-hand side that can be controlled a posteriori in an optimal way.</p><p>In this paper, we combine the elliptic reconstruction technique with a posteriori energy estimates for the parabolic equation. Although residual-based a posteriori estimates using energy methods have been established <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, it is not immediately known how to use elliptic estimates other than the residual-based ones in them. For comparison's sake, in this paper we will derive residual based energy estimates; but we emphasize the fact that the techniques presented in this paper can be relatively easily used to derive estimators for parabolic problems where the "elliptic part" of the error is controlled by nonresidual type estimators, such as estimators based on the solution of local subproblems, for instance.</p><p>The main new results in this paper are optimal order a posteriori estimates, via energy techniques, in the following spaces (anticipating the notation that we will introduce in §1.1):</p><p>(a) L ∞ (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)), (b) L ∞ (0, T ; H 1 0 (Ω)) and H 1 (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)). In particular, we successfully address the open problem of obtaining optimal a posteriori error bounds via energy methods in L ∞ (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)) for fully discrete schemes. As a by-product we also recover known results, such as optimal order estimates for the L 2 (0, T ; H 1 0 (Ω)) norm. Energy methods have been used by other authors for Backward Euler fully discrete approximations to parabolic problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. While these results are of optimal order in L 2 (0, T ; H 1 (Ω)), they are not so in L ∞ (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)). Picasso <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and Zhiming Chen and Feng Jia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> manage to bound, at each time step, the spatial indicators by the error (lower bound); their technique is based on the "bubble functions" technique introduced by Verfürth for elliptic problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Also Bergam, Bernardi and Mghazli <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have established lower bounds, and their estimators have the additional feature of decoupling the space and the time discretization errors.</p><p>We stress that for our analysis we do not require any extraneous conditions on the variation of the meshes and the corresponding finite element spaces, between successive time-steps, that may be hard or impossible to enforce in practical computations. In fact, our analysis allows us to even obtain estimates in the higher order energy norms (as mentioned in (1) above). The direct approach, which works well in deriving the lower order energy estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, will not work here, unless one imposes severe mesh conditions or makes quite strong a priori assumptions. Our approach permits to override this difficulty; see §4.10 for a technical discussion about this point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Problem setting and notation.</head><p>Let us now focus our discourse by introducing the fully discrete scheme which will be the object of our analysis.</p><p>We start with the exact problem. Let Ω be a bounded domain of the Euclidean space R d , d ∈ Z + and T ∈ R + . We assume throughout the paper that Ω is a convex polygonal domain, noting that our results could be extended to cover certain nonconvex domains, such as domains with reentrant corners in d = 2, by using weighted a posteriori estimates for elliptic problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Since the difficulties in the analysis below in the case of other boundaries are mainly coming from the elliptic part of the error, the reader interested in a posteriori error estimates for curved boundaries is referred to Dörfler and Rumpf <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. We will consider the problem of finding a finite element approximation of the solution u ∈ L ∞ (0, T ; H 1 0 (Ω)), with ∂ t u ∈ L 2 (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)), to the linear parabolic problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂ t u, φ + a (u, φ) = f, φ , ∀φ ∈ H 1 0 (Ω), and u(0) = g, (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where f ∈ L 2 (Ω × (0, T )) and g ∈ H 1 0 (Ω), and a is a bilinear form on H 1 0 (Ω) defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> a (v, ψ) := A∇v, ∇ψ , ∀v, ψ ∈ H 1 0 (Ω), where "∇" denotes the spatial gradient and the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A ∈ L ∞ (Ω) d×d is such that a (ψ, φ) ≤ β |ψ| 1 |φ| 1 , ∀φ, ψ ∈ H 1 0 (Ω), (3) a (φ, φ) ≥ α |φ| 2 1 , ∀φ ∈ H 1 0 (Ω),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with α, β ∈ R + .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1630">OMAR LAKKIS AND CHARALAMBOS MAKRIDAKIS</head><p>Here and subsequently, for a given Lebesgue measurable set D ⊂ R d , we use the common notation</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ, ψ D := D φ(x)ψ(x) dµ(x), (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">φ D := φ L 2 (D) := φ, φ 1/2 D , (6) |φ| k,D := D k φ D , for k ∈ Z + (with D 1 φ := ∇φ, etc.), (7) φ k,D := φ 2 D + k j=1 |φ| 2 j,D 1/2 , for k ∈ Z + , (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where dµ(x) is either the Lebesgue measure element dx, if D is has positive such measure, or the (d -1)-dimensional (Hausdorff) measure ds(x), if D has zero Lebesgue measure. In many instances, in order to compress notation and when there is no danger of engendering confusion, we drop altogether the "differential" symbol from integrals; this applies also to integrals in time. We use the standard function spaces L 2 (D), H k (D), H k 0 (D) and denote by H -1 (D) the dual space of H 1 0 (D). We omit the subscript D whenever D = Ω. We denote the Poincaré constant relative to Ω by C 2,1 and, in view of the Poincaré inequality, we consider</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">|•| 1 to be the norm on H 1 0 (Ω). The energy norm |•| a is defined through (9) |φ| a := a (φ, φ) 1/2 , ∀φ ∈ H 1 0 (Ω). It is equivalent to the norm |•| 1 on the space H 1 0 (Ω)</formula><p>, in view of ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">4</ref>). In particular, we will often use the following inequality: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> |φ| 1 ≤ α -1/2 |φ| a , ∀φ ∈ H 1 0 (Ω). In order to discretize the time variable in (1), we introduce the partition 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">= t 0 &lt; t 1 &lt; • • • &lt; t N = T of [0, T ]. Let I n := (t n-1 , t n ],</formula><p>and we denote by τ n := t nt n-1 the time steps. We will consistently use the following "superscript convention": whenever a function depends on time, e.g., f (x, t), and the time is fixed to be t = t n , n ∈ [0 : N ], we denote it by f n (x). Moreover, we often drop the space dependence explicitly, e.g., we write f (t) and f n with reference to the functions in the previous sentence.</p><p>We use a standard FEM to discretize the space variable. Let (T n ) n∈[0:N ] be a family of conforming triangulations of the domain Ω <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. These triangulations are allowed to change arbitrarily from a timestep to the next, as long as they maintain some very mild compatibility requirements. Our use of the term "compatibility" is precisely defined in Appendix A; it is an extremely mild requirement which is easily implemented in practice.</p><p>For each given triangulation T n , we denote by h n its meshsize function defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> h n (x) = diam(K), where K ∈ T n and x ∈ K, for all x ∈ Ω. We also denote by S n the set of internal sides of T n . These are edges in d = 2 or faces in d = 3 that are contained in the interior of Ω. The interior mesh of edges, Σ n , is then defined as the union of all internal sides E∈S n E. We associate with these triangulations the finite element spaces:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Ṽn := {φ ∈ H 1 (Ω) : ∀K ∈ T n : φ| K ∈ P } and V n := Ṽn ∩ H 1 0 (Ω), (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where P is the space of polynomials in d variables of degree at most ∈ Z + . Given two successive compatible triangulations T n-1 and T n , we define ĥn := max (h n , h n-1 ) (see Appendix A and B). We will also use the sets Σn := Σ n ∩ Σ n-1 and Σn := Σ n ∪ Σ n-1 . Similarly, in §4, we will use Σn :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">= Σ n ∩ Σ n-1 ∩ Σ n+1 , Σn := Σ n ∪ Σ n-1 ∪ Σ n+1 , ĥn := max i∈[-1:1] h n+i .</formula><p>1.2. Definition (fully discrete scheme). The standard backward Euler-Galerkin method for the discretization of problem (1) associated with the finite element spaces V n , leads to the following recursive fully discrete scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">let U 0 := I 0 u(0), for each n ∈ [1 : N ] find U n ∈ V n such that τ -1 n U n -U n-1 , φ n + a (U n , φ n ) = f n , φ n , ∀φ n ∈ V n . (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>Here the operator I 0 is some suitable interpolation or projection operator from H 1 0 (Ω), or L 2 (Ω), into V 0 .</p><p>In the sequel we shall use the continuous piecewise linear interpolant in time of the sequence (t n , U n ) which we denote by U (t) for t ∈ [0, T ] (see §2.4 for the precise definition).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1.3.</head><p>A posteriori estimates and reconstruction operators. Our method consists in associating with U an auxiliary function ω : [0, T ] → H 1 0 (Ω), in such a way that the total error <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> e := Uu can be split as e = ρ -, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where := ω -U, ρ := ωu <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> satisfy the following two properties:</p><p>1. The error is easily controlled by a posteriori quantities of optimal order. 2. The error ρ satisfies a modification of the original PDE whose right-hand side depends on and U . This right-hand side can be bounded a posteriori in an optimal way.</p><p>In order to successfully apply this idea we shall choose the function ω to be a suitable reconstruction of U . The choice of this reconstruction is dictated by the elliptic operator at hand, and the precise definition of this elliptic reconstruction process is given in §2.2. We reap the benefits of our choice of ω by deriving optimal order estimators for the error measured not only in L 2 (0, T ; H 1 (Ω)), but also in L ∞ (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)), as well as in L ∞ (0, T ; H 1 0 (Ω)) and H 1 (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)). All the effects of mesh modification will be reflected in the right-hand side of the equation for ρ. In addition, our choosing ω as the elliptic reconstruction will have the effect of separating the spatial approximation error from the time approximation as much as possible. We show that the spatial approximation is embodied in which will be referred to as the elliptic reconstruction error, whereas the time approximation error information is conveyed by ρ, a fact that motivates the name main parabolic error for this term. The splitting (15)-( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) of the error is already apparent in the spatially discrete case <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The PDE satisfied by ρ can be written in the following variational form.</p><p>1.4. Lemma (Main parabolic error equation). For each n ∈ [1 : N ], and for each</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">φ ∈ H 1 0 (Ω), ∂ t ρ, φ + a (ρ, φ) = ∂ t , φ + a (ω -ω n , φ) + P n 0 f n -f, φ + τ -1 n P n 0 U n-1 -U n-1 , φ on I n . (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>Here P n 0 denotes the L 2 -projection into Ṽn . A proof of this result is given in §2.6.</p><p>1.5. Deriving the estimates: A general overview. Identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> along with the properties of the elliptic reconstruction will allow us to obtain a posteriori error estimates in different norms. We start from the aforementioned splitting of the error <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> e(t) X ≤ (t</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">) X + ρ(t) X ,</formula><p>where X is any suitable space of functions on Ω. The choice of X depends on the applications that are in mind, and on the ability to bound the terms on the right-hand side. In this respect, the following two observations are fundamental.</p><p>1. The first term, (t) X = ω(t) -U (t) X , can be bounded by appropriate a posteriori error estimates for elliptic problems. To see why this is possible we first observe that, at a fixed time t n , the elliptic reconstruction, ω n = ω(t n ), is defined so that it is the exact solution of the elliptic problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> find v ∈ H 1 0 (Ω) s.t.div (A∇v) = A n U n , where A n U n is the result of the discrete elliptic operator A n on U n with respect to the subspace V n (see §2.1 for the detailed definitions).</p><p>Second, we observe that U n is the finite element solution in V n of the same elliptic problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Note that, while A n v is not straightforward to compute for a general v ∈ V n , it becomes so when v = U n . In fact, the "right-hand side" A n U n of the elliptic problem can be expressed via known terms, by using the discrete parabolic equation (see (41) further), as follows (20)</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">A n U n = P n 0 f n -U n -P n 0 U n-1 τ -1 n .</formula><p>Therefore, to obtain an a posteriori estimate for this term, it is enough to assume that a posteriori error estimates for problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> are provided for the X-norm, through estimator functions that depend on U n , A n U n , the triangulation parameters and the polynomial degree-many such estimator functions are available from standard a posteriori error analysis for elliptic problems <ref type="bibr">[2, 7, 8, 30, e.g.]</ref>. Note that (t) X exclusively contains spatial error effects which motivates our choice of the name "elliptic reconstruction error" for .</p><p>2. The second term, ρ(t) X = ω(t)u(t) X , is estimated by an appropriate use of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and techniques inspired from the analysis of parabolic PDE's. In this paper we will illustrate the use of energy methods, leaving the study of duality methods to a subsequent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The right-hand side suggests that the resulting estimators will include quantities measuring the space error, the time error, the variation of f , and the effect of mesh changes with respect to n. Since all the time effects are included in this term, we refer to ρ as the "main parabolic error". 1.6. Comparison with the direct approach. Identity (17) can be appreciated if we compare it with the error equation that one obtains from a direct comparison of u and U . In the direct approach the error relation is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> ∂ t e, φ + a (e, φ)</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">= ∂ t U, φ + a (U n , φ) -f, φ + a (U -U n , φ) .</formula><p>Using the fact that U is the solution of the fully discrete scheme, one sees that</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">∂ t e, φ + a (e, φ) = ∂ t U, φ -φ n + a (U n , φ -φ n ) -f n , φ -φ n -f -f n , φ + a (U -U n , φ) , for φ n ∈ V n . (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>A comparison between ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">17</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">22</ref>) demonstrates the two main differences in the corresponding approaches. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">22</ref>) has all the information from the numerical scheme "built-in", in particular it satisfies the Galerkin orthogonality property; therefore the error (and stability) analysis is dictated by the choices of both φ and φ n . In the case of elliptic reconstruction, the Galerkin orthogonality property is not used explicitly in the analysis. The fact that U is a solution of the discrete scheme is used only implicitly through the reconstruction ω: it is used first to estimate and ∂ t (this estimate comes "for free" from the elliptic a posteriori theory precisely because of the definition of ω); second, it is used to derive <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, which then allows us to estimate ρ X and ∂ t ρ X , in terms of time and data approximation estimators, and spatial estimators dictated only by .</p><p>A second important difference between these two approaches is the presence of the term a (U n , φφ n ), which is suboptimal in L 2 (Ω), in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Because of this term, the direct approach fails to provide optimal order a posteriori estimators in L ∞ (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)), <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>; the same problem can appear also in a different context <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. On another hand, it is interesting to note that, the presence of this term is also the reason why the direct approach fails to lead satisfactory a posteriori results in the higher order energy norms; see §4.10 for the details.</p><p>Concerning the time discretization error, note that the term a (U -U n , φ) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">22</ref>) is very similar to the term a (ωω n , φ) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. 1.7. Outline. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the necessary discrete and continuous operators in order to define the reconstruction ω in §2 and state some of its basic properties needed in the sequel.</p><p>In §3 we provide the a posteriori analysis in L ∞ (0, T ; L 2 ). The estimators in Theorem 3.2 are of optimal order and residual type. We carry out the analysis with a particular class of "elliptic" estimators in mind. As mentioned earlier, other choices are possible, but in order to use them, the arguments related to the terms involving mesh-change effects must be appropriately adapted.</p><p>Next, in §4, we show a posteriori estimates of optimal order in the higher order energy norms L ∞ (0, T ; H 1 0 (Ω)) and H 1 (0, T ; L 2 (Ω)). This case is of particular interest as a simplified situation for a class of nonlinear degenerate parabolic problems where lower order energy estimates are not available <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In this section, we also discuss briefly why the direct approach cannot be applied successfully in this case ( §4.10).</p><p>Finally, in §5 we complement the theory with some numerical experimentation. In particular, we show that the estimators derived in §3 have the expected, optimal, experimental order of convergence in the numerical test.</p><p>In the Appendix we collect some useful facts about the concept of compatible triangulations in §A, elliptic regularity inequalities in §B.1, interpolation operators and inequalities in § §B.2-B.3, and our convention on the constants labeling in §B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>.</p><p>We refer the reader interested in the practical aspects of our estimators to a forthcoming paper in which detailed numerical experiments, including comparisons with estimators derived by duality methods, as well as numerical investigation of the effect of mesh modification via a posteriori estimators, are included <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Numerical results</head><p>We present the results of a series of numerical experiments to exemplify some of the practical aspects of the a posteriori estimates of Theorem 3.2. The main goal here is to approximate the asymptotic behavior of the various estimators and compare this behavior with that of the norms. 5.1. Benchmark solutions. We perform the numerical experiment by approximating in each case either one of the following two exact solutions: These solutions are used as benchmarks for the problem with A = [ 1 0 0 1 ]. The right-hand side f of the problem is thus easily calculated by applying the parabolic operator to each u. Therefore the exact errors are computable, and we can compare them with the error estimators. The domain on which we compute this solution is the square [-1, 1] 2 , and the time interval is [0, 1]. Note that the boundary conditions are not exactly zero but of the order of 10 -6 so that special care has to be taken with very small numbers. The initial conditions are exactly zero in both cases, and there is no initial error to be computed. </p><formula xml:id="formula_141">m 1 ε 2 2,n ) 1/2 ,</formula><p>• the space estimator</p><formula xml:id="formula_142">τ (i) m 1 η 1,n ,</formula><p>• and the time estimator</p><formula xml:id="formula_143">τ (i) m 1 θ 1,n , for each time t m ∈ [0 = t 0 : τ (i) : t N = 1].</formula><p>Of course, all the errors and estimators depend on the run i, but for the sake of conciseness we do not add this index. We deliberately ignore the estimators for data approximation (and mesh change), β 1,n and γ 2,n , as our examples are designed so as to make these estimators either negligible or comparable with respect to one of those calculated. Indeed, we take the mesh and stepsizes small enough as to resolve the data, and we keep the mesh unchanged across timesteps. Therefore, γ 2,n can be shown to be of order h 2 , and β 1,n to be of order τ since the function f is smooth enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>For each computed norm or estimator we look at its experimental order of convergence (EOC). The EOC is defined as follows: for a given finite sequence of uniform triangulations {T h(i) } i=1,...,I of meshsize h(i), the EOC of a corresponding sequence of some triangulation-dependent quantity E(i) (like an error or an estimator) is itself a sequence defined by ( <ref type="formula">121</ref>) EOC E(i) = log(E(i + 1)/E(i)) log(h(i + 1)/h(i)) .</p><p>Since the timesteps τ (i) are coupled to h(i), this is well defined.</p><p>Finally we look at the inverse effectivity index for each error-estimator pair, defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_144">max n∈[0:m] e(t m ) max n∈[0:m] ε ∞,n + τ (i) m n=1 (η 1,n + θ 1,n ) , (122) τ |e(t m )| 2 1 1/2 τ m n=0 ε 2 2,n 1/2 + τ (i) m n=1 (η 1,n + θ 1,n ) . (<label>123</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_145">)</formula><p>The initial estimator is zero in this case, and the data approximation and the mesh change estimators are dropped from this study. 5.4. Remark (Effectivity index). Note that we prefer using the inverse rather than the straight effectivity index; the reason for this choice is twofold. First, from a practical aspect, since the effectivity index tends to be quite high in an initial transient time, its inverse is nicer to visualize. Second, and more importantly, since we are interested in obtaining a numerical realization for the constant C appearing in the estimates of the type e ≤ CE , where e is the error and E the estimator, e /E is a more straightforward indicator for C than E / e , which is the (straight) effectivity index.</p><p>We also observe that we take all the constants involved in the estimators, including the interpolation constants, to be equal to 1. This, of course, is not true, and a fine tuning of constants should be performed, but since our purpose here is mainly to check that the asymptotic behavior of the error and the estimator is the optimal one, the (inverse) effectivity index is to be understood only qualitatively in this paper. Note also that the time estimator, involving θ 1,n , is in the denominator of (122) and (123).</p><p>Finally, we point out that from the theory, the inverse effectivity index must have an upper bound that is independent of the problem at hand (i.e., of the solution). In each numerical simulation, though, this upper bound is not necessarily reached (in fact this happens only in the worst-case scenario), so different problems (i.e., different solutions of u) can lead to different inverse effectivity indexes in practice. 5.5. Conclusions. The main conclusion of our numerical tests is that the estimators have the optimal rate of convergence which matches that of the error's norm. It is important to note that, in order to exhibit the optimality of the estimators for different norms, a different coupling of the meshsize h and the stepsize τ must be chosen: for P 1 elements, it is necessary to take τ ≈ h 2 to see that the L ∞ (L 2 ) error norm has EOC 2 while the L 2 (H 1 ) norm has EOC 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). If the coupling τ ≈ h is taken, for a problem where the time discretization error dominates, such as (120 fast), then both errors have EOC 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>).</p><p>The same observations are valid for tests with P 2 elements, albeit the couplings are τ ≈ h 3 and τ ≈ h 2 , respectively, in this case (see Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>).</p><p>In a different article <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> we conduct a more thorough numerical experimentation, where mesh changes and data approximation effects are included. 1/2 has EOC 1. These are the leading terms in the total estimators (the 3 and 4 plots in the 3rd row) and match in EOC, respectively, the L ∞ (L 2 ) error and the L 2 (H 1 ) error, as shown in the first 2 plots of the 3rd and 4th rows. Thus (54) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">55</ref>) are seen to be sharp and optimal. The last two plots in the 4th row are the inverse effectivity indexes for each norm. In the topmost row we plot the various estimators, and in the second row we show the corresponding EOC's. Note that τ θ ∞,n has EOC 1-reflecting the fact that the error due to time discretization is of order 1-as opposed to 2 in the previous example. This is now a leading term in both total estimators (plots 3 and 4 in the 3rd row) which both have EOC 1. This EOC matches that of the L ∞ (L 2 ) error and of the L 2 (H 1 ) error, as shown in plots 1 and 2 of the 3rd and 4th rows. Thus (54) and (55) are both sharp. The last two plots in the 4th row are the inverse effectivity indexes for each norm. 1/2 has EOC 2.

Compatible triangulations Each triangulation T n , for n ∈ [1 : N ], is a refinement of a macro-triangulation M which is a triangulation of the domain Ω that satisfies the same conformity and shape-regularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> assumptions made on its refinements in §1. A refinement procedure is admissible if it satisfies the following criteria:</p><p>1. the refined triangulation is conforming; 2. the shape-regularity of an arbitrarily deep refinement depends only on the shape-regularity of the macro-triangulation M ;</p><p>3. if T and T are both refinements, then for any two elements K ∈ T and</p><p>Refinement procedures that satisfy these criteria exist. For example, the refinement by bisection described in the ALBERT manual <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which is known to work for the space dimensions d = 1, 2, 3, 4, is admissible for simplex triangulations. All the refinements by bisection of the macro-triangulation M can be stored in a single binary tree whose nodes represent a simplex. We say that two triangulations are compatible if they are refinements of the same macro-triangulation. A set of compatible triangulations can be endowed with a partial order relation: namely, given two compatible triangulations T and T we write T ≤ T if T is a refinement of T . This partial ordering permits us to define in the natural way the coarsest common refinement of T and T , which we denote by T ∨ T , and the finest common coarsening, which we denote by T ∧ T . An immediate property of these definitions is (125) ĥ = max (h, h ) and ȟ = min (h, h ) , where h, h , ĥ, ȟ denote the meshsize of T , T , T ∨ T , T ∧ T , respectively. We therefore assume the coefficient matrix A defining the bilinear form a to be regular enough and Ω to be a convex polygonal as to ensure that there exists a constant C 2,2 such that if φ ∈ L 2 (Ω) and ψ ∈ H </p></div>			</div>
