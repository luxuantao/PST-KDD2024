<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper investigates the issues of day-ahead and real-time cooperative energy management for multi-energy systems formed by many energy bodies. To address these issues, we propose an event-triggered based distributed algorithm with some desirable features, namely, distributed execution, asynchronous communication and independent calculation, etc. Firstly, the energy body, seen as both energy supplier and customer, is introduced for system model development. On this basis, energy bodies cooperate with each other to achieve the objective of maximizing the day-ahead social welfare and smoothing out the real-time loads variations as well as renewable resource fluctuations with the consideration of different timescale characteristics between electricity and heat power. To this end, the day-ahead and real-time energy management models are established and formulated as a class of distributed coupled optimization problem by felicitously converting some system coordinates. Such problem can be effectively solved by implementing the proposed algorithm. With the effort, each energy body can determine its owing optimal operations through only local communication and computation, resulting in enhanced system reliability, scalability and privacy, etc. Meanwhile, the designed communication strategy is event triggered, which can dramatically reduce the communication among energy bodies. Simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>significant attention on both theoretical and practical research projects in recent years.</p><p>The optimal energy management problem is one of fundamental and key issue for energy hub, whose major purpose is to maximize the resource allocation profits or minimize the energy costs while meeting the coupled matrix constraint and a set of system operation constraints. A amount of researches have been conducted on this topic. For instance, a robust optimization approach was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which can effectively find the optimal operation point at the presence of bounded uncertainties. Based on portfolio theory, an integrated planning approach was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to compute the optimal portfolio and relative shares. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, a stochastic mixed-integer programming approach was employed to model the wind integrated energy hub; meanwhile, the reliability indices were regarded as constraints to limit system operations. It should be noted that these references mainly focus on the internal energy management of individual energy hub.</p><p>Recently, there is an increasing interest in investigating the cooperative energy management problem for interconnected multiple energy hubs to further enhance system reliability, improve energy efficiency and decrease energy cost, etc. For example, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> presented a multiagent genetic algorithm to solve economic dispatch problem among multiple energy hubs. For renewable-based residential energy hubs, a probabilistic optimization approach was developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, with the consideration of the interactions between the electricity and natural gas. To handle the multi-objective optimization problem, a self-adoptive learning with time varying acceleration coefficient-gravitational search algorithm was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In addition, there are some models, technologies and approaches presented for the problems of energy flow optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, the reliability of energy demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, etc. The above researches have obtained many significant results on the day-ahead, medium-term or other single timescale energy management problems. However, the dynamic variations and fluctuations of different energy loads as well as renewable energy generations are not well considered in real-time operation, which is a significant issue to be done in this paper from the view of multiple timescale features of different energy resources.</p><p>More importantly, the previous work are implemented centrally, which may face several challenges. To be specific, the centralized approaches rely on a powerful central controller and require two-way and high-bandwidth communication to work on gathered information of the whole system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. Thus, the solutions are costly to implement and prone to single-point failures and modeling errors. Furthermore, the real-time variability and fluctuation may undermine the efficacy of the centralized approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Lastly but not least, in the view of system privacy, the energy hubs are unwilling to exchange their detailed to the central controller.</p><p>As an alternative, the distributed approaches with some advantages, e.g., better robustness and privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, faster computation and less communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, are promising options. Up to now, few noticeable works have been documented within the context of energy hub based multi-energy systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, the concept of smart energy hubs was first presented; meanwhile, a distributed algorithm was introduced to find the Nash equilibrium. Nevertheless, the implementation of all the computation process is in a cloud computing center, which also requires a central controller and a two-way communication structure to calculate optimal solutions. Later, a synchronously distributed algorithm was developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> to determine the equilibrium. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, each energy hub is endowed with part of computation functionality resulting in reduced calculation pressure. However, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, it also depends on a central price coordinator and a two-way communication structure, which is not seen as a fully distributed approach. Note that the distributed algorithms for solving the energy management problem in multi-energy systems have just been founded. Although they have made some outstanding contributions on achieving the part paradigm shift from centralized fashion to distributed fashion, there are numberous significant issues such as more common communication structure, fully distributed implementation and asynchronous communication strategy that need to be further studied.</p><p>With mainly the aforementioned inspirations, this paper focuses on the cooperative energy management problems for multi-energy systems in both day-ahead and real-time scenarios, where an event-triggered based distributed algorithm is proposed to address these issues. To avoid ambiguity, the integrated energy unit, composed of an energy hub and local energy loads, is referred as the energy body which is employed for the system model development. The main contributions and salient features are summarized as follows:</p><p>1) Multiple timescale energy management models are introduced, which are formulated as a kind of distributed coupled optimization problem by making use of some change of variables. Under the collaboration of energy bodies, not only can the day-ahead maximal social welfare be fulfilled but also the real-time variations and fluctuations of different energy loads and renewable energy resources can be accommodated by reasonably adjusting local components of each energy body step by step at different time periods.</p><p>2) The proposed algorithm, aiming at making all computation process be divided into the local energy bodies, can solve the day-ahead and real-time energy management problems in a fully distributed fashion. By this means, each energy bodies can only utilize local information shareing about some auxiliary variables to find its optimal operation under a more common peer-to-peer communication network. Consequently, it possesses better flexibility, reliability and scalability, etc., and is beneficial for privacy protection.</p><p>3) An event-triggered communication strategy is presented and embedded into the execution of our distributed algorithm, such that each energy body can asynchronously exchange information at discrete instants driven by the designed trigger condition to remove unnecessary communication. As a result, the communication burden and expenditure can be dramatically reduced, which is more suitable for distributed microprocessors. Moreover, by theoretical analysis, it is proved that the proposed algorithm can convergence to the global optimal solution and be free of Zeno behavior.</p><p>The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. In Section II, the system structure and models are introduced. Section III firstly introduces some basic knowledge. Then, the proposed event-triggered based distributed algorithm along with the corresponding triggered condition are presented. In Section IV, several case studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Section V concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>An anticipated structure of single energy body, employed to link multiple energy carries together, is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. As an integrated energy unit of the energy hub and energy loads, the energy body can play the roles of both energy supplier and customer by locally managing its own distributed energy generators, distributed energy conversion devices, distributed energy storage devices, and schedulable energy loads. For example, each energy body can sell the part of excess electricity power to other energy bodies to make additional profit. In this case, it is seen as an electricity power supplier. At the same time, the energy body shall buy deficit heat power from other energy bodies if it can not meet its selfheat-demand, thus being regarded as a heat power customer. More importantly, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b), the cooperation among energy bodies can be implemented under a sparse and distributed communication network which is promising topology in the future multi-energy systems. In this mode, each energy body only needs to exchange information with its neighbors to achieve their co-management in both dayahead and real-time scenarios; whilst, the corresponding optimal operations can be obtained through location calculation completely. In addition, the interconnected physical structure is different from the previous energy hub models, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. To be specific, the interconnected energy hubs model is mainly reflected in the energy input side, in which each energy hub can only be employed to meet its self-energy demands. However, the energy body is seen as an integrated energy unit composed of the energy hub and local energy loads and their co-management can achieve deeper interconnection on both energy input and energy output sides. As a result, the system reliability, flexibility and scalability can be further improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Energy Body Model</head><p>As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a), at the input port, the received electricity power (E in ) flows to the hub via the transformer; meanwhile, the received nature gas power (G in ) is splited into two paths, i.e., the one to the CHP unit and the other one to the boiler. Therein, the dispatch factor denoted by ρ is employed to specify the share of natural gas by the CHP unit and boiler. Inside the energy body, the generated electricity power comes from the renewable generator (p r ) and electricity output of CHP unit. The generated heat power comes from the solar water heater system (h r ), heat output of CHP unit and the boiler. The energy (i.e., electricity and heat) storage devices can conduce to energy supply or demand of the hub, which are determined by the discharge/charge states. We denote p s and h s as the exchanged power of electricity and heat storage devices, respectively. It is defined that p s or h s is positive for discharging and negative for charging. With regard to the energy loads, both the electricity and heat loads contain an equivalent must-run load and an equivalent schedulable load, where l p,m (or l p,s ) and l h,m (or l h,s ) are used to denote the must-run (or schedulable) electricity and must-run (or schedulable) heat loads, respectively. At the output port, we let E out and H out represent the part of electricity and heat powers buying from or selling to the other energy bodies. Accordingly, the state is positive for selling and negative for buying. The balance of the inputs and outputs should satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E out i,T H out i,T = η tr i η chp,e i ρ i,T 0 η chp,h i ρ i,T + η boil i (1 -ρ i,T ) E in i,T G in i,T + p r i,T + p s i,T h r i,T + h s i,T - l p,m i,T + l p,s i,T l h,m i,T + l h,s i,T ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where η tr and η chp,e are the electric conversion efficiencies of the transformer and CHP unit, respectively; η chp,h and η boil are the heat conversion efficiencies of the CHP unit and boiler, respectively; the subscript " i " and " T " denote the index of energy bodies and time steps, respectively.</p><p>Aside from the above balance constraint, each energy body makes decisions on itself subject to a set of local operation constraints including the limits on the input capabilities (2)-(3), feasible dispatch factor (4), gas conversion rates ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, charge/discharge rates and stored energy of energy storage devices ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), and schedulable powers of energy loads <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, which are mathematically expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E in,min i ≤ E in i,T ≤ E in,max i<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">G in,min i ≤ G in i,T ≤ G in,max i (3) 0 ≤ ρ i,T ≤ 1<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">ρ i,T G in i,T ≤ G chp,max i<label>(5)</label></formula><p>(1 </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">-ρ i,T )G in i,T ≤ G boil,max i<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">-ϕ ch,max i ≤ ϕ s i,T ≤ ϕ ds,max i , ϕ ∈ p, h<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">SOC ϕ,min i ≤ SOC ϕ i,T ≤ SOC ϕ,max i , ϕ ∈ p, h<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">SOC ϕ i,T = SOC ϕ i,t-1 -ϕ s i,T ∆T, ϕ ∈ p, h (9) 0 ≤ l ϕ,s i,T ≤ l ϕ,s,max i -l ϕ,m i,T , ϕ ∈ p, h<label>(10)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Day-Ahead Energy Management among Energy Bodies</head><p>In day-ahead, the interconnected energy bodies shall cooperate with each other to maximize their social welfare over a period of one day while meeting the global supplydemand balance constraints and a set of operation constraints. The overall mathematical representation of the co-management problem is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">max J day = 24 T =1 n i=1 W i,T<label>(11)</label></formula><p>subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">n i=1 E out i,T = 0, n i=1 H out i,T = 0, ∀ T ∈ {1, • • • , 24}<label>(12)</label></formula><p>and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The outputs of renewable energy devices are seen as the corresponding forecasting values obtained from dayahead forecast curve. In addition, to ensure sustainable storage utilization, the energy stored in each energy storage device at the end of study period should be imposed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23</ref>]</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">SOC ϕ i,1 ≥ SOC ϕ i,24 , ϕ ∈ p, h.<label>(13)</label></formula><p>In the above problem, W i,T , denoting as the benefit function of individual energy body, here is composed of two parts, i.e., the profit part and cost part. The former arises from the selling energy to other energy bodies and utility incomes of the local energy loads. The latter includes buying energy costs from energy companies (including individual natural gas company and electricity company) and other energy bodies, operation cost of energy storage devices and the penalty on carbon emission. The mathematical representation is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">W i,T =U i,T + P pri T E out i,T + H pri T H out i,T -C E,G i,T -C ρ,G i,T -C s i,T<label>(14)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">U i,T = ϕ∈p,h -α ϕ i,T (l ϕ,s i,T + l ϕ,m i,T ) 2 + β ϕ i,T (l ϕ,s i,T + l ϕ,m i,T ) C E,G i,T =a E i,T (E in i,T ) 2 + b E i,T E in i,T + a G i,T (G in i,T ) 2 + b G i,T G in i,T C ρ,G i,T =̟ p i,T (η chp,e i ρ i,T G in i,T ) 2 + ̟ h i,T η chp,h i ρ i,T G in i,T + η boil i (1 -ρ i,T )G in i,T 2 C s i,T = ϕ∈p,h a ϕ,s i,T (ϕ r i,T ) 2 ,</formula><p>where P pri T and H pri T represent the market electricity and heat powers clearing prices among energy bodies at hour T ; U i,T is the utility function of energy loads; C E,G i,T and C s i,T are the cost functions of received energy from the main networks and the energy storage devices, respectively; C ρ,G i,T is penalty function; α ϕ i,T and β ϕ i,T are positive utility coefficients;</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">a E i,T , b E i,T , a G i,T , b G i,T</formula><p>, and a ϕs i,T are positive cost coefficients; ̟ p i,T and ̟ h i,T are penalty coefficients. Noticing that the set of global equality constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref> are non-affine constraints. It is caused by the coupled product of variables ρ i,T and G in i,T as seen in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). This case will lead to increased complexity for the design of distributed optimization algorithm. To address this issue, we employ the following change of variables,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">G g,ρ i,T = ρ i,T G in i,T , G g,1-ρ i,T = (1 -ρ i,T )G in i,T ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>while the other variables remain unchanged.</p><p>In this novel coordinates system, the co-management problem mentioned above can be re-written as the following form by some operations </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">min J day = 24 t=1 n i=1 -U i,T + C s i,T + a E i,T (E in i,T ) 2 + b E i,T E in i,T + δ i,T (G g,ρ i,T ) 2 + ϑ i,T (G g,1-ρ i,T ) 2 + γ i,T G g,ρ i,T G g,1-ρ i,T + b G i,T (G g,ρ i,T + G g,1-ρ i,T )<label>(16)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">(η tr i E in i,T + η chp,e i G g,ρ i,T + p r i,T + p s i,T ) - n i=1 (l p,m i,T + l p,s i,T ) = 0, ∀ t ∈ {1, • • • , 24} (17a) n i=1 (η chp,h i G g,ρ i,T + η boil i G g,1-ρ i,T + h r i,T + h s i,T ) - n i=1 (l h,m i,T + l h,s i,T ) = 0, ∀ t ∈ {1, • • • , 24}<label>(17b)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">G min i,T ≤ G g,ρ i,T + G g,1-ρ i,T ≤ G max i,T<label>(18a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">0 ≤ G g,ρ i,T ≤ G chp,max i (18b) 0 ≤ G g,1-ρ i,T ≤ G boil,max i ,<label>(18c)</label></formula><p>(2), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">13</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>, the coupled product form between variables, i.e., ρ i,T G in i,in and (1ρ i,T )G in i,in in the global equality constraints, can be transformed to the one, i.e., γ i,T G g,ρ i,T G g,1-ρ i,T in local objective function. As a result, the non-affine constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref> are converged to the affine ones, i.e., (17a) and (17b). In addition, ρ i,T and G in i,in can be uniquely determined by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>, as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">, ∀ t ∈ {1, • • • , 24}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Real-Time Energy Management among Energy Bodies</head><p>In practice, the real-time dynamic variations of heat and electricity power reflect different timescale features. To be specific, the variations of heat loads are regard as hourly timescale, while the variations of power loads and fluctuations of renewable generators are always seen as minute timescale <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. To address this issue, a two-timescale energy management approach is further investigated to gradually smooth out the variations and fluctuations by locally adjusting internal components of each energy body. The real-time dispatching process and concept among energy bodies in different timescale are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>In hourly timescale scheduling (i.e., 1-hour considered in this paper), the major purpose is to accommodate the variations of heat loads along with the fluctuations of solar water heater, and make use of hour-ahead prediction values of electricity loads and renewable generators instead of day-ahead ones to significantly amend day-ahead prediction errors. To guarantee the global effectiveness of the maximum social welfare in dayahead scheduling, the objective is set to make the actual hourly timescale scheduling results track the day-ahead scheduling results as close as possible.

Preliminaries 1) Graph theory: The information sharing among energy bodies is described by graph G = (K, E, A), where K = {i = 1, . . . , n} is a set of nodes representing energy bodies, E ⊂ K × K is a set of edges responding information interactions, and A = {a ij } ∈ R n×n is the associated adjacency matrix. An edge from j to i, denoted by (j, i) ∈ E implies that energy body i can obtain information from energy body j, then energy body j belongs to energy body i's neighbor set N i = {j|(j, i) ∈ E}.

To reduce the clutter in the notation, we let x i ∈ R m represent the local decision variables, in which all elements are stacked in a column.

Here, the so-called "distributed fashion" implies that each energy body can only utilize local communication and calculation among neighbors to find its optimal operations. Moreover, the execution of a continuoustime algorithm requires the continuous communication among energy bodies to achieve state updating. Such operation can result in excessive consumption of energy resources. This is also infeasible and impractical for a large network of energy bodies, each of which is normally embedded with a microprocessor holing limited communication capacity. Motivated by this observation, an asynchronous event-triggered broadcasting strategy is introduced for each energy body, such that the continuous communication operations can be replaced by discrete ones when necessary only. The following Lemma 2 demonstrates the strong convex feature of the studied problems aforementioned above which will be used in the convergence analysis of subsequent parts of this work.</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">B i ∈ R ℓ×m and τ i ∈ R ℓ ; F i (x i ) : R m → R</formula><p>Lemma 2: For the objection functions in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">16</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">20</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">22</ref>), there exist a set of constants u i &gt; 0 for all i ∈ V, such that,</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">∀x i , x ′ i ∈ Ω i , (x i -x i ′ ) T (∇F i (x i ) -∇F i (x i ′ )) ≥ u i x i -x i ′ 2 .

Thus, problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref> and problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref> are essentially equivalent. Next, the augmented Lagrangian function of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">28</ref>) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">min W max V L (W, V ) = n i=1 q i (v i ) -W T (L ⊗ I ℓ ) V - 1 2 V T (L ⊗ I ℓ ) V,<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">W = col (w 1 , • • • w n ) ∈ R ℓn</formula><p>is the corresponding Lagrange multiplier and w i ∈ R ℓ . By applying the gradient flow to ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">27</ref>) and (30) together with differentiated projection, the proposed event-triggered based distributed algorithm is described as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">ẋi =Π Ωi (x i , -∇F i (x i ) + B T i vi ) (31a) vi = - j∈Ni a ij vi -vj - j∈Ni a ij ŵi -ŵj + τ i -B i x i (31b) ẇi = j∈Ni a ij vi -vj ,<label>(31c)</label></formula><p>where v i , w i ∈ R ℓ are two auxiliary variables whose physical meanings are the locally estimated multipliers of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">27</ref>) and (30) mentioned above, respectively; vi = v i (t i k ) and ŵi = w i (t i k ) for t ∈ [t i k ≤ t &lt; t i k+1 ), represent the last updated states of energy body i; {t i k |k = 1, 2, • • • } indicates the event time at which agent i broadcasts its state information to its neighbors. The event time instants should be properly chosen to ensure the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, it is very important to design the event-triggered condition to determine these proper event time instants. To address this issue, the event-triggered function is proposed for algorithm (31) as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">F (v, ŵ) =ǫ 1,i ||(v i -v i )|| 2 + ǫ 2,i ||( ŵi -w i )|| 2 -ǫ 3,i j∈Ni a ij ||v i -vj || 2 , (<label>32</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">ǫ 1,i = h 1 ||B i || 2 /2u i + (5h 1 + 4h 2 )d i , ǫ 2,i = (5h 2 + 4h 1 )d i and ǫ 3,i = h 1 /4. Therein, positive coefficients h 1 , h 2 satisfy 3h 1 -h 2 &gt; 4ℑ/λ 2 , 3h 2 -h 1 &gt; 4ℑ/λ 2 and h 1 u i -h 2 2 &gt; 0 with ℑ = ||(R ⊗ I ℓ )B(R ⊗ I m )|| 2 .</formula><p>For each energy body, an event is triggered once F (v, ŵ) &gt; 0 which is also the event-triggered condition for (31).

Remark 2: In algorithm (31), each energy body only needs to share the information of auxiliary variables vi and ŵi with its neighbors to facilitate the cooperation, while the updating of variable x i are implemented through local computation completely. Thus, the proposed algorithm is fully distributed and provides well privacy protection for individual energy body. Moreover, through independent data adjustment accomplished in each energy body, e.g., the adjustment of τ i and F i (x i ), algorithm (31) can make automatically response to the changes of local production and consumption, which doesn't rely on specific initialization procedure during each scheduling period.</p><p>Remark 3: The algorithm (31) is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, but here we take the event-trigged communication strategy into consideration, reflecting in the updating of j∈Ni a ij vivj and j∈Ni a ij ŵiŵj , where vi and ŵj are discrete information. As a result, the requirement of continuous information exchange in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> can be avoid. Meanwhile, our algorithm can be implemented in an asynchronous communication fashion. In addition, compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, our algorithm is expended to solve more general distributed optimization problem. To be specific, we have no special limit for matrix B i in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>. However, B i should be degenerated to scalar 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> which is not suitable for our studied problems since B i is not a constant in both day-ahead and real-time models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 4:</head><p>The major differences and correlations between our algorithm and literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> are as follows: On the one hand, literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> mainly focuses on the energy management of various kinds of energy resources from the view of energy outputs. However, in this paper, we investigate the cooperative energy management problem of different energy resources within the context of energy hub based multi-energy systems, in which multiple energy inputs and outputs as well as their coupled relationship are taken into consideration. On the other hand, the proposed distributed-consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> is based on Lagrangian formalism, which suffers from the requirements of synchronous communication protocols and periodical communication. However, the implementation of our algorithm is event-triggered with the functionality of asynchronous communication, which is more suitable and feasible for practical applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this section, several simulations under a text system with five energy bodies are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The detailed test system structure and parameters are listed in Appendix D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Case 1: Day-Ahead Energy Management</head><p>This case study focuses on analyzing the day-ahead energy management results and demonstrating the performance of the proposed algorithm. By implementing the proposed algorithm, the day-ahead scheduling results are depicted in Fig, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>, where the line charts represent the averaged renewable electricity generation(AREG), averaged renewable heat generation (ARHG), averaged must-run electricity load (AMEL) and averaged must-run heat load (AMHL), while the stacked bar charts represents the scheduling results of the other components including the transformer (TF), CHP, boiler (BL), electricity storage (ES), heat storage (HS), schedulable electricity load (SEL) and schedulable heat load (SHL). It is obvious that such scheduling results, with the features of reducing peak and filling valley, could achieve lower costs and better profits during a period of one day. For instance, during the periods 1:00-4:00 and 22:00-24:00, the schedulable electricity loads maintain higher values and the electricity storages are in charging state to fill up the lower consumptions of must-run electricity loads. On the contrary, there are few schedulable heat loads and the heat storages maintain discharging state since the higher demands of must-run heat loads should be satisfied. At the electricity peak periods 10:00-13:00 and 17:00-20:00, the must-run electricity loads obviously increase, which leads to the increased inputs of CHP units and decreased schedulable electricity demands along with the electricity storages to be scheduled in discharging state. Moreover, the heat storages are scheduled to be charged and the schedulable heat loads are visibly increased during heat valley periods 10:00-16:00 to absorb the increased heat power generated by renewable energy resources with lower costs.  In order to clearly show the performance of the proposed algorithm, the trajectory of ||x ix * i || is shown in Fig, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(b). It can be observed that the value of ||x ix * i || gradually converges to zero, which means each energy body can find its optimal operations by only using local communication and calculation, then to illustrate the behavior ensured by Theorem 1. Furthermore, to demonstrate benefit of the proposed event-triggered broadcasting strategy, the corresponding eventtriggered instants of the five energy bodies are presented in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>). It can be seen that the proposed continuous-time algorithm can be executed with asynchronously discrete-time communication to significantly remove unnecessary communication when compared with the ones requiring continuoustime communication to achieve the state updating. As a result, the communication amount and expenditure can be greatly reduced, which is in favor of practical implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Case 2: Real-Time Energy Adjustment</head><p>In this case study, we focus on analyzing the real-time energy adjustment for each energy body to accommodate the variations of energy loads and the fluctuations of renewable energy generations. Without loss of generality, we let the dayahead prediction values of the must-run electricity loads and renewable generation are the same to the hour-ahead ones. The real-time renewable heat fluctuations and heat loads variations are shown in Figs. 4(a)-4(b), while the adjustment results of the other components during each hour are given in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(c</ref>)-4(f). The corresponding differences between day-ahead schedule and real-time heat operation results for all energy bodies are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>(a)-5(f). It can be seen that, by the cooperation among energy bodies, each of them can locally adjust its own heat power generation, conversion, storage devices and schedulable loads to smooth out the real-time fluctuations and variations of heat power. In addition, it is worth noting that, for all energy bodies, the hourly timescale adjustment results can maintain the similar dynamics to the day-ahead ones. It can achieve the designed goal of the hourly timescale, i.e., tracking the day-ahead scheduling results as far as possible; meanwhile, the effectiveness of maximum social welfare could also be ensured.</p><p>Next, the real-time (15-min timescale) fluctuations of renewable generators and variations of must-run electricity loads are shown in Figs. 6(a)-6(b). On the basis of the results in hourly timescale, the minute timescale electricity adjustment results are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">6(c)-(e</ref>). The corresponding differences between hour-ahead schedule and real-time electricity operation results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(a)-7(e). It indicates that we can not only adjust the electricity supplies form transformer and electricity storages, but also adjust schedulable electricity loads to smooth out the real-time electricity fluctuations and variations. Moreover, for each transformer, electricity storage and schedulable electricity load, the minute timescale dispatching result can track its hourly one in a better way, achieving the desired effect of the real-time electricity adjustment.</p></div>
