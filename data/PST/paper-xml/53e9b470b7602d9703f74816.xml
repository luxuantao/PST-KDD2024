<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Genome median and genome halving are combinatorial optimization problems that aim at reconstructing ancestral genomes as well as the evolutionary events leading from the ancestor to extant species. Exploring complexity issues is a first step towards devising efficient algorithms. The complexity of the median problem for unichromosomal genomes (permutations) has been settled for both the breakpoint distance and the reversal distance. Although the multichromosomal case has often been assumed to be a simple generalization of the unichromosomal case, it is also a relaxation so that complexity in this context does not follow from existing results, and is open for all distances.</p><p>Results: We settle here the complexity of several genome median and halving problems, including a surprising polynomial result for the breakpoint median and guided halving problems in genomes with circular and linear chromosomes, showing that the multichromosomal problem is actually easier than the unichromosomal problem. Still other variants of these problems are NP-complete, including the DCJ double distance problem, previously mentioned as an open question. We list the remaining open problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The gene order or syntenic arrangement of ancestral genomes may be reconstructed based on comparative evidence from present-day genomesthe phylogenetic approachor on internal evidence in the case of genomes descended from an ancestral polyploidisation event, or from a combination of the two. The computational problem at the heart of phylogenetic analysis is the median problem, while internal reconstruction inspires the halving problem, and the combined approach gives rise to guided halving. How these problems are formulated depends <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> on the karyotypic framework: the number of chromosomes in a genome and whether they are constrained to be linear, or if circular chromosomes are also permitted, and (2) on the objective function used to evaluate possible solutions. This function is based on some notion of genomic distance, either the number of adjacent elements on a chromosome in one genome that are disrupted in anotherthe breakpoint distanceor the number of evolutionary operations necessary to transform one genome to another.</p><p>While the karyotypes allowed in an ancestor vary only according to the dimensions of single versus multiple chromosome, and linear versus circular versus mixed, the genomic distances of interest have proliferated according to the kinds of evolutionary operations considered, from the classic, relatively constrained, reversals/translocations distance to the more inclusive Double Cut-and-Join (DCJ) measure, and many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The computational complexity of some of these problems has been settled for some specific distances and karyotypic contexts, and it is sometimes taken for granted that these results carry over to other combinations of context and distance. This is not necessarily the case. In this paper, we survey the known results and unsolved cases for three distance measures in three kinds of karyotype. We include several results presented here for the first time, as well as discussions on the definitions of the distances. The results contain both new polynomialtime algorithms and NP-hardness proofs. This paper is the full version of an extended abstract that has appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which announced the results without giving all the proofs. In particular, a full discussion on the breakpoint distance definition, as well as the proofs of Theorem 2, Theorem 4, and Theorem 6 are added here, which makes this version a complete and definitive one.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multichromosomal genomes</head><p>We follow the general formulation of a genome in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A gene A is an oriented sequence of DNA, identified by its tail A t and its head A h . Tails and heads are the extremities of the genes. An adjacency is an unordered pair of gene extremities. A genome Π is a set of adjacencies on a set of genes. Each adjacency in a genome means that two gene extremities are consecutive on the DNA molecule. In a genome, each gene extremity is adjacent to zero or one other extremity. An extremity x that is not adjacent to any other extremity is called a telomere, and can be written as an adjacency x∘ with a null symbol ∘. The adjacency x∘ is called a telomeric adjacency. For a genome Π on a set of genes G , consider the graph G Π whose vertices are all the extremities of the genes, and the edges include all the non telomeric adjacencies in Π as well as an edge joining the head and the tail of each gene. This graph is a set of disjoint paths and cycles. Every connected component is called a chromosome of Π. A chromosome is linear if it is a path, and circular if it is a cycle. A genome with only linear, or only circular, chromosomes is called a linear or circular genome, respectively. An example of a graph G Π is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>A Genome can also be represented as a set of strings, by writing the genes for each chromosome in the order in which they appear in the paths and cycles of the graph G Π , with a bar over the gene if the head of the gene appears before the tail (we say it has negative sign), and none if the tail appears before the head (it has positive sign). For each linear chromosome, there are two possible equivalent strings, according to the arbitrary chosen starting point. One is obtained from the other by reversing the order and switching the signs of all the genes. For circular chromosomes, there are also two possible circular string representations, according to the direction in which the cycle is traversed. For example, chromosome C 1 of the genome Π of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> may be written (12 4 14 1 7 8) or ( 8 7 1 14 4 12 ).</p><p>A genome with only one chromosome is called unichromosomal. These correspond to signed permutations: the two string representations are (linear or circular) signed permutations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genomes with duplicates</head><p>A duplicated gene A is a couple of homologous oriented sequences of DNA, identified by two tails A1 t and A2 t , and two heads A1 h and A2 h . An all-duplicates genome Δ is a set of adjacencies on a set of duplicated genes.</p><p>For a genome Π on a gene set G , a doubled genome Π ⊕ Π is an all-duplicates genome on the set of duplicated genes from G such that if A x B y (x, y {t, h}) is an (possibly telomeric) adjacency of Π (A x or B y may be ∘), either A1 x B1 y and A2 x B2 y , or A2 x B1 y and A1 x B2 y , are adjacencies of Π ⊕ Π.</p><p>Note the difference between a general all-duplicates genome and the special case of a doubled genome: the former has two copies of each gene, while in the latter these copies are organised in such a way that there are two identical copies of each chromosome when we ignore the 1's and 2's in the A1 x 's and A2 x 's: it has two linear copies of each linear chromosome, and for each circular chromosome, either two circular copies or one circular chromosome containing the two successive copiesNote also that for a genome Π, there is an exponential number of possible doubled genomes Π ⊕ Π (exactly two to the power of the number of nontelomeric adjacencies in Π). These definitions correspond to duplicated and perfectly duplicated genomes found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and slightly differs from the perfectly duplicated genome definition found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. An example of an all-duplicates genome and a doubled genome is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Doubled genomes are the immediate result of an evolutionary event called Whole Genome Duplication (WGD), which is known to have occurred in many evolutionary lineages, from protists <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to yeasts, to plants, to fish, to amphibians and even to mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. All-duplicates BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:120 genomes derive from doubled genomes through a series of rearrangement events. Typically, all-duplicates genomes pertain to extant species, while doubled genomes are ancestral configurations inferred to exist immediately after the WGD, and that are to be reconstructed.</p><p>In discussing all-duplicates genomes, we will sometimes contrast them with ordinary genomes which have a single copy of each gene.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The breakpoint distance</head><p>The breakpoint distance has been well-studied for permutations, i.e., unichromosomal genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, but only a few published discussions have focused on how it should be defined for multichromosomal genomes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for one suggestion). The distance should depend not only on common adjacencies, or rather their absence, but also on common telomeres (or lack thereof) in two genomes. Here we propose a definition that we wish valid for all types of karyotypes, based on a most general approach integrating all possible informations from the two genomes. For two genomes Π and Γ on a set G of n genes, suppose Π has N Π chromosomes, and Γ has N Γ chromosomes. Let a(Π, Γ) be the number of common adjacencies, e(Π, Γ) be the number of common telomeres of Π and Γ. Then insofar as it should depend additively on these components, we may suppose the breakpoint distance has form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d n a e N N N N BP ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) ( ) (| |) , Π Γ Π Γ Π Γ Π Γ Π Γ = - - + + + - b q g y</formula><p>where b, θ and g are positive parameters, while ψ may have either sign. Taking Π = Γ and imposing d BP (Π, Π) = 0 yields the relations b = 1 and 1 -2θ + 2g = 0, so θ = g + 1/2, and the distance formula reduces to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d n a e N N N N BP ( , ) ( , ) ( / ) ( , ) ( ) (| |) . Π Γ Π Γ Π Γ Π Γ Π Γ = - -+ + + + - g g y 1 2</formula><p>It is most plausible to count a total of 1 breakpoint for a fusion or fussion of linear chromosomes, which implies g = ψ = 0, so the most natural choice of breakpoint distance between Π and Γ is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d n a e BP ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) . Π Γ Π Γ Π Γ = - -<label>2</label></formula><p>It might be argued that a fussion or fusion should count for as many as 2 breakpoints, or anything between 1 and 2, so that alternate values of g and ψ might be entertained, provided g [0, 1  2 ], and ψ [0,1 -g]. This may have an influence on how to calculate the number of breakages within a scenario, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For example, the parameters chosen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  , giving rise to the disadvantage of there possibly being more breakpoints between two genomes than adjacencies in either one. For example, in comparing Π = (1 2 3 4 5) and Γ in which five linear chromosomes each contain one gene i {1,...,5}, the definition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> would count 9 breakpoints, which seems counterintuitive, while our definition counts 4, which seems more reasonable. Whether all the results presented in this paper also hold for the definition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is open.</p><p>The definition of the breakpoint distance is easily transposable to the comparison of two all-duplicates genomes. For one all-duplicates genome Δ and one ordinary genome Π, the breakpoint distance between Π and Δ is the minimum breakpoint distance between Δ and a doubled genome Π ⊕ Π, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d d BP BP ( , ) min ( , ).

Π is a genome on the set of genes {1,...,14}, containing three chromosomes, two of them being linear and one circular. Its adjacencies are the union of C 1 = {12 h 4 h , 4 t 14 t , 14 h 1 t , 1 h 7 h , 7 t 8 t }, C2 = {3 t 11 t , 11 h 10 t , 10 h 6 t , 6 h 13 h , 13 t 3 h } and C 3 = {9 h 2 t , 2 h 5 h }. It has four telomeres.</p></div>

(a) Δ has three chromosomes, while (b) Π ⊕ Π has four, and consist of two copies of two chromosomes, that have the same set of duplicated genes {1,...,7}. some of p, q, r, s are ∘ symbols, so that telomeric adjacencies are considered; one adjacency can even be ∘∘). The DCJ operation replaces pq and rs either by pr and qs, or ps and qr. An example of DCJ operation on the genome Π of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is drawn in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>A DCJ can reverse an interval of a genome, may cause the fussion of one chromosome into two, or the fusion of two chromosomes into a one, or a reciprocal translocation: the exchange of two telomere-containing segments between two chromosomes. Two consecutive DCJ operations, excising and circularising a chromosomal segment followed by a re-linearisation of the circular intermediate and reintegration on the same chromosome, using two new cut-points, results in a block interchange: two segments of the genome appear to simply exchange their positions. In the case these two segments are consecutive, the two DCJs result in a transposition, the apparent movement of a segment from one place on a chromosome to another. The DCJ operation is thus a very general framework, introduced by Yancopoulos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, as well as by Lin et al. in a special case <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and since been adopted by Bergeron et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and many others, sometimes under other names such as spring <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or "2-break rearrangement" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>If Π and Γ are two genomes on a set G of n genes, the minimum number of DCJ operations needed to transform Π into Γ is called the DCJ distance and noted d DCJ (Π, Γ).</p><p>This DCJ distance is easily defined also for two allduplicates genomes.

Double distance. Given an all-duplicates genome Δ and an ordinary genome Π, compute d(Δ, Π). This computation evaluates the evolutionary distance posterior to a WGD of the given genome Π, leading to an all-duplicates genome Δ, and locates the genes of the all-duplicates genome on chromosomes in one of the two ancestral copies of the ordinary genome. Because the assignment of labels "1" or "2" to the two identical (for our purposes) copies of a duplicated gene in Δ is arbitrary, the double distance problem is equivalent to finding such an assignment that minimises the distance between Δ and a genome Π ⊕ Π considered as ordinary genomes, where all the genes on any one chromosome in Π ⊕ Π are uniformly labeled "1" or "2" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The double distance function is not symmetric because Δ is an all-duplicates genome and Π is an ordinary one, thus capturing the presumed asymmetric temporal and evolutionary relationship between the ancestor Π and the present-day genome Δ.</p></div>

Given an all-duplicates genome Δ and an ordinary genome Π, find an ordinary genome M which minimises d(Δ, M) + d(M, Π). The guided halving problem is similar to the genome halving problem for Δ, but it takes into account the ordinary genome Π of an organism presumed to share a common ancestor with M, the reconstructed undoubled ancestor of Δ. A variant of the guided halving problem introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is to find an ordinary genome M that is a solution to genome halving, that is, minimises d(Δ, M), and which in addition minimises d(M, Π). This helps choosing, among the numerous solutions to the genome halving problem, the one that is closest to the outgroup. We do not study this variant here, and it is open for all genomic distances.</p><p>We will survey these five computational problems for the three distances that we have introduced, in the cases of multichromosomal genomes containing all linear chromosomes, all circular chromosomes, or permitting both. The latter are refered as mixed genomes.</p><p>While many problems are open for multichromosomal genomes, there is a huge amount of research on these problems for unichromosomal genomes, whether circular or linear (the two cases are often equivalent up to some transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). They are not systematically particular cases of the multichromosomal problems, as the constraint of keeping only one chromosome along a rearrangement scenario can result in more difficult problems. More precisely, unichromosomal DCJ problems reduce to RT multichromosomal ones. Indeed, the RT operations always transform a unichromosomal genome into a unichromosomal one. As this paper contains very few results on the RT distance, practically the unichromosomal cases are often independent and not generalized here. Results on unichromosomal genomes are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>, together with the results for the multichromosomal case we review or present here. A complete survey on these problems can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Breakpoint distance, circular and mixed genomes</head><p>In this section, d = d BP , and genomes are considered in their most general definition, that is, multichromosomal with both circular and linear chromosomes allowed. All the results also stand for circular genomes, but not always for linear genomes, which will be considered in a following section. As the nuclear genome of a eukaryotic species, a mixed karyotype is rarely observed, so probably unstable. Nevertheless this case is of great theoretical interest, as it is the only combination of distance and karyotype where all five problems mentioned in the previous section prove to be polynomially solvable, including the median problem which is hard for almost every other variant. Furthermore, the solutions in this context may suggest approaches for other variants of the problems, as well as providing a rapid bound for other distances, through the Watterson et al. bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distance and double distance</head><p>The distance computation follows directly from the definition, and is easily achievable in linear time. The double distance computation is also easy: let Π be a genome and Δ be an all-duplicates genome. Let a(Π, Δ) be the sum, for every adjacency xy in Π, of the number of adjacencies among x1y1, x1y2, x2y1, x2y2 in Δ. Let e(Π, Δ) be the sum, for every telomere x in Π, of the number of telomeres among x 1 and x 2 in Δ.</p><p>Then we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d n a e ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) . Π Δ Π Δ Π Δ = - - 2<label>2</label></formula><p>Indeed, it is a lower bound on the distance, because a(Π, Δ) and e(Π, Δ) are upper bounds on the number of common adjacencies and common telomeres, respectively, between Δ and any Π ⊕ Π. For all adjacencies that have not been assigned, assign them arbitrarily.</p></div>

Then there is an edge between each pair of gene extremities, weighted by 0, 1, 2, or 3. Now for any vertex x, draw an edge xt x weighted by half the number of genomes, among Π 1 , Π 2 , Π 3 , having x as a telomere. Each edge xt x is then weighted by 0, 1 2 , 1, or 3 2 . Finally, put an edge of weight 0 between t x and t y for all pairs of gene extremities x, y. Let M be a perfect matching in G. Clearly, the edges joining gene extremities in M define the adjacencies of a genome, which we also call M. The relation between the weight of the perfect matching M and the median score of the genome M is easy to state:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Claim 1.

The phylogeny problems, both "big" and "small" versions, which also generalise the median problem for three genomes, remain open. The big problem is the search for a Steiner tree in the space of genomes, minimising the sum of the distances on its branches, while in the small problem, presumably easier, the graph-theoretical structure of the tree, namely its vertex set and edge or branch set, are given, and only the genomes corresponding to the extra vertices (not corresponding to the given genomes) need to be reconstructed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Halving</head><p>To our knowledge, the genome halving with breakpoint distance has not yet been studied. In this framework, it has an easy solution, using a combination of elements from the maximum weight perfect matching technique in the solution of the median problem presented above, and the double distance computation. Let Δ be an all-duplicates genome on a gene set G , and G be the graph on the vertex set containing (1) all the extremities of the genes in G , and (2) one supplementary vertex t x for every gene extremity x. For any pair of gene extremities x, y, draw an edge in G weighted by zero, one or two according to the number of adjacencies in Δ among x1y1, x1y2, x2y1, and x2y2. Now for any vertex x, draw an edge xt x weighted by half the number of telomeres among x1 and x2 in Δ. Finally, put an edge of weight 0 between t x t y for all pairs of gene extremities x, y.</p><p>For a genome M on G , define a perfect matching, also called M, by including edges xy and t x t y for each adjacency xy, and an edge xt x for each telomere x. Let w(M) be the weight of the matching M. , that is, 2n -d(Δ,M), according to the double distance formula (see above in this section).</p><p>Conversely, it is easy to see that any perfect matching on G defines a genome M such that w(M) = 2n -d(Δ, M). This implies that the maximum weight perfect matching solves the genome halving problem in the breakpoint distance context. Again, it is possible to solve the problem on only circular genomes by restricting the graph G to the gene extremities, dropping the t x supplementary vertices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guided Halving</head><p>As is the case for the median problem, this context provides the only polynomial result for the guided genome halving problem up to our knowledge. The solution combines elements of the three previous results, on the double distance, median and halving problems.</p><p>Let Δ be an all-duplicates genome on a gene set G , and Π be an ordinary genome on G . Let G be the graph on the vertex set containing (1) all the extremities of the genes in G , and (2) one supplementary vertex t x for every gene extremity x.</p><p>For any pair of gene extremities x, y, there is an edge in G weighted by the number of adjacencies among x1y1, x1y2, x2y1, x2y2 in Δ, and xy in Π. Now there is an edge xt x for any gene extremity x weighted by half the number of telomeres among x1, x2 in Δ and x in Π. So each edge between gene extremities has an integer weight in {0, 1, 2, 3}, and xt x edges may have weight 0, 1  2 , 1, or 3 2 . Add 0-weight edges t x t y for all pairs x, y of gene extremities.</p><p>For any genome M, let s(M) = d(Δ, M) + d(M, Π). It is possible to construct a perfect matching M in G from genome M by choosing edges xy and t x t y for every adjacency xy in M. Its weight is denoted w(M).</p><p>Claim 3. For a genome M, the perfect matching thus constructed satisfies w(M) = 3n -s(M).</p><p>Indeed, the weight of the perfect matching M is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">w M a M a M e M e M ( ) ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) = + + + Π Δ Π Δ 2</formula><p>.

This implies that the maximum weight perfect matching solves the guided genome halving problem in the breakpoint distance context.</p><p>As is the case for the median problem, it is possible to generalise this statement for an arbitrary number of ordinary outgroup genomes. The phylogenetic problems are open.</p><p>Again, we can solve the problem on circular genomes by dropping the t x supplementary vertices in the graph G.</p></div>

We will prove that M' has at most two chromosomes. Suppose M' has at least three chromosomes. Then it has at least six telomeres v 1 ,...,v 6 . Among them, it is possible to identify two telomeres (say without loss of generality v 1 and v 2 ), that belong to different chromosomes and are not telomeres in Π 1 , Π 2 , or Π 3 , because by hypothesis, they all have the same two telomeres. Then the genome constructed from M' by adding the adjacency v 1 v 2 has at most the same median score as M' and fewer chromosomes, contradicting the hypothesis on M'. So choosing M = M' gives a genome with at most two chromosomes such that s(M) ≤ k. □</p><p>We now need to prove the NP-hardness of the 2-chromosome breakpoint median problem. We use a reduction from the hamiltonian cycle problem for directed graphs with vertex degree at most three, similar to the proof of Bryant <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for the breakpoint median problem for unichromosomal circular genomes.</p><p>Lemma 2. The 2-chromosome breakpoint median problem is NP-hard.</p><p>Proof. Given a directed graph with maximum degree 3, deciding if it has a hamiltonian directed cycle is an NPcomplete problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Let thus G 0 be such a digraph. We will construct an instance of the 2-chromosome breakpoint median problem from G 0 .</p><p>First, let G be the directed graph with vertex set V (G) = V (G 0 ) ∪ {xe : e E(G 0 )} ∪ {p, q}, and arc set</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">E G ux x v uv E G pq uv uv ( ) { , : ( )} { }. = ∈ ∪ 0</formula><p>Note that G 0 has a hamiltonian cycle if and only if there is a cycle in G covering all vertices but p and q. Given a subset X ⊆ E(G) of the arcs of a graph G, let G X denote the graph with vertex set V(G) and arc set X.</p><p>Construct three subsets A, B, C of arcs of G such that every arc of G belongs to exactly one of A, B, C, and A, B, C are either hamiltonian cycles of G or sets of vertex disjoint paths in G. The procedure is straightforward: for all vertex v of G which is a vertex of G 0 , put all incoming arcs in different subsets, and all outgoing arcs in different subsets. It can be done independently for every vertex because from the construction of G, no two vertices of G 0 are neighbors. Eventually put arc pq in any subset. Now perform a series of modifications of G to obtain a graph with three hamiltonian cycles A, B, and C. Along these modifications, we maintain a subset of arcs called supplementary arcs, noted S. Before any transformation, S is empty. The goal is to maintain the property that there exists a cycle covering all vertices of G except p and q and not using supplementary arcs if and only if there is a hamiltonian cycle in G 0 . As already remarked, the property is true at the beginning. Choose X {A, B, C} such that X is not a hamiltonian cycle in G (it is a set of disjoint paths). Choose two vertices a and b such that adding the arc ab to G and X would either give a graph in which X is a hamiltonian cycle, or a set of disjoint paths with fewer components. Then choose any vertex x of G different from a and b. Perform the following transformation illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>: add two new vertices y and z. For each arc xw of G, replace it by the arc zw, and add zw to Y {A, B, C} whenever xw Y. Add arcs xy, yz, xz, ay, yb to G. Add xz, ay, yb to X. Also add xz, ay, yb to S, and add xy, yz to all {A, B, C}\X. Clearly, the property that there exists a cycle covering all vertices of G except p and q and not using supplementary arcs if and only if there is a hamiltonian cycle in G 0 is still true after this transformation.</p><p>Repeat this process until A, B and C are all hamiltonian cycles in the resulting graph, which we call G'. The weight of an arc of G' is the number of hamiltonian cycles among A, B and C which contain this arc. Note that G' has only weight 1 and 2 arcs.</p><p>Let v be an arbitrary vertex of G, different from p and q. Let G = V(G')\{v} ∪ {v 1 , v 2 } be a set of genes (v 1 and v 2 are two new genes). For every X {A, B, C}, construct a genome Π X on G such that x h y t is an adjacency in genome X if xy is an arc of X in G' and x, y are different from v; If xv and vy are the arcs of X covering v, add the adjacencies x v h t 1 and y v t h 2 . This gives three linear unichromosomal genomes on G with the same pair of telomeres ( v h 1 and v t 2 ), thus an instance of the 2chromosome breakpoint median problem. For any genome M on G , the weight of an adjacency xy is the number of genomes, among Π A , Π B and Π C , which contain this adjacency. Adjacencies u h w t in M such that uw is an arc in S are called supplementary adjacencies.</p><p>Let l i be the number of arcs of weight i in the graph G', for each 0 ≤ i ≤ 3. For any genome M on G , note s(M) = d(Π A , M) + d(Π B , M) + d(Π C , M).

This implies by Claim 4 that M contains all adjacencies of weight 2, no adjacency of weight 0, and that v h 1 and v t 2 are telomeres of M. From the construction of G', M cannot contain any supplementary adjacency, since the extremities of supplementary adjacencies all are also extremities of weight two adjacencies, which are all contained in M. Note that in G', paths between vertices p and q to other vertices of the graph necessarily contain supplementary arcs. This yields that M has two chromosomes, one containing gene extremities from p and q, and the other containing the gene extremities from the other vertices, with telomeres v h 1 and v t 2 . Let H ⊆ E(G') contain the arcs xy such that x h y t is an adjacency in M, plus the arcs xv and vy for adjacencies of type v h 1 and v t 2 in M.</p><p>H ∩ E(G 0 ) yields a hamiltonian cycle in G 0 .</p><p>(⇐) Suppose there is a hamiltonian cycle in G 0 . Then there is a cycle H covering all vertices of G' except p and q.</p><p>Construct genome M on G by adding ( whenever xv or vy are arcs of H, (3) all weight two adjacencies, and (4) the adjacency p t q h . It is easy to check that M is a genome on G , and by construction it contains all weight 2 adjacencies and no weight 0 adjacencies. This proves that it is NP-complete to decide if a median genome reaches the lower bound of Claim 4 for its score, thus computing the minimum score median genome is NP-hard. □ A byproduct of this proof is the NP-hardness of the 2-chromosome breakpoint median problem. The result implies NP-completeness of the general case, where the genomes in the instance do not necessarily have the same pairs of telomeres. A consequence is that for any fixed k, it is also NP-hard to compute a best linear median genome with at most k chromosomes.</p></div>

The DCJ double distance problem is NP-hard for multichromosomal mixed or circular genomes.</p><p>Proof. The reduction is from the breakpoint graph decomposition (BGD) problem (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). A graph G is bicoloured if all its edges are coloured either red or blue; it is balanced if it has only degree 2 or degree 4 vertices, every vertex is incident to the same number of red and blue edges, and there is no cycle formed by only red or only blue edges. Given a balanced bicoloured graph G, the breakpoint graph decomposition problem is to find a partition of the edges of G into a maximum number of edge-disjoint cycles, each alternating between red and blue edges. Caprara <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> first proved the NP-hardness of this problem, and Berman and Karpinski <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> extended this by proving APX-hardness.</p><p>Let G be a balanced bicoloured graph on n vertices, defining an instance of the BGD problem.

Let Π ⊕ Π be the doubled genome such that d(Δ, Π ⊕ Π) = d(Δ, Π). As no genome has a telomere, by Theorem 3,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">d(Δ, Π ⊕ Π) = 2n -c(Δ, Π ⊕ Π).

Among them, w2 cycles are containing only two edges: if a vertex X of G has degree 2, then Π ⊕ Π has the adjacency X1 t X2 h and X2 t X1 h because the other possibility systematically has one cycle less in BG(Δ, Π ⊕ Π). The Δ edges of all the other cycles are the edges of an alternating blue-red cycle in G. Indeed, every blue edge defines an adjacency in Δ containing two gene heads, and every red edge defines an adjacency containing two gene tails. The Π ⊕ Π-edges all join one tail and one head, so two consecutive Δ-edges in a cycle of BG(Δ, Π ⊕ Π) have different colours. This means there are at least 2n -d(Δ, Π) -w2 alternating cycles in G.</p><p>Conversely, if there are k edge-disjoint alternating cycles in G, then d(Δ, Π) ≤ 2n -k -w2. Indeed, let C be any cycle of this partition. For every covered vertex X of degree 4 in G, let e and f be two consecutive edges of C (say e is blue and f is red) which are both incident to X. If e defines an adjacency in Δ which contains X2 h and f defines an adjacency which contains X2 t , choose X1 h X1 t and X2 h X2 t as adjacencies for Π ⊕ Π. If e defines an adjacency which contains X2 h (or X1 h ) and f defines an adjacency which contains X1 t (or X2 t ), choose X1 h X2 t and X2 h X1 t as adjacencies for Π ⊕ Π. For vertices of degree 2, always choose X1 h X2 t and X2 h X1 t as adjacencies for Π ⊕ Π. In this construction, each red-blue alternating cycle in G is a Π ⊕ Π-Δ alternating cycle in BP(Π ⊕ Π, Δ) that has at least k cycles. And there are w2 additional length 2 cycles at each degree 2 vertex. So d(Δ, Π) ≤ 2n -k -w2. □</p></div>

First, for each degree 2 vertex v of G, let X t X h be in M. Then, let v be a degree 4 vertex in G, and vw be a blue edge incident to v.

Define the gene set G as a set containing one gene X for every degree 2 vertex of G, and two genes X and Y for every degree 4 vertex of G.

For every degree 4 vertex v of G, let X and Y be the two genes in G , and X t and X h , Y t and Y h their extremities. For every blue edge uv in G, construct an adjacency in Π between the heads of the genes constructed from u and v, choosing arbitrarily between the heads of vertices X and Y if u or v have degree 4, in such a way that no two adjacencies share an extremity (choose a different head for the two blue edges incident to a degree 4 vertex). For every red edge tv in G, construct an adjacency in Π between the tails of the genes constructed from t and v, again choosing arbitrarily between the tails of vertices X and Y if t or v have degree 4. This defines a genome Π on G that has no telomere. Now, define the genome Δ in the following way. For each degree 2 vertex of G, Δ contains the adjacencies X1 h X1 t and X2 h X2 t defined by the extremities of the two copies of gene X. For each degree 4 vertex in G, Δ contains the adjacencies X1 h X1 t , Y2 h Y2 t , X2 h Y1 t , and X2 t Y1 h defined by the extremities of the two copies of the two genes X and Y.</p><p>This defines an all-duplicates genome Δ on G that has no telomere.

There exists a genome M such that d(M, Π) + d(M, Δ) ≤ w2 + 3w4 -k if and only if there exists at least k edge-disjoint alternating cycles in G. (This claim implies the theorem.) (⇐): Suppose there are k edge-disjoint alternating cycles in G. We will construct a genome M and a doubled genome M ⊕ M such that d(M, Π) + d(M, Δ) ≤ w2 + 3w4k. First, for each degree 2 vertex v of G, let X t X h be in M, and M ⊕ M be constructed so that X1 t X1 h and X2 t X2 h are in M ⊕ M. Then, for every vertex v of degree 4 of G, either the blue edge incident to X h is followed by the red edge incident to X t in one alternating cycle, or it is followed by the red edge incident to Y t . In the first case, let X h X t and Y h Y t be in M, and X1 h X1 t , X2 h X2 t , Y1 h Y1 t , Y2 h Y2 t be in M ⊕M. In the second case, let X h Y t and X t Y h be in M, and X2 h Y1 t , X1 h Y2 t , X1 t Y2 h , X2 t Y1 h be in M ⊕ M.</p><p>The matching M defines a genome without telomeres, and M ⊕ M is one of its doubled genomes. There are w2 + 2w4 genes, so by Theorem 3,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">d(Π, M) = w2 + 2w4 -c(Π, M) = w2 + 2w4 -k; and d(Δ, M ⊕ M) = 2(w2 + 2w4) -(2 × w2 + 3 × w4). So d(Π, M) + d(Δ, M) = w2 + 3w4 -k. (⇒): Suppose M is a genome such that d(Π, M) + d(Δ, M) ≤ w2 + 3w4 -k.

A genome is said to be canonical if it has no telomeres and has only edges of type X t X h for a degree 2 vertex in G, or X h X t , Y h Y t , X h Y t and X t Y h for degree 4 vertices of G. We will prove that M is canonical.</p><p>Subclaim. M is canonical.</p><p>Suppose M is not canonical. Suppose first that there is a degree 2 vertex v in G, such that M does not contain the BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:120 edge X t X h . Suppose M contains edges X t u and X h v, where u and v are gene extremities or ∘ symbols if X t or X h is a telomere in M. Then replace X t u and X h v by X h X t and uv (simply X h X t is both X t and X h are telomeres in M). By this operation, c(M, Π) decreases by at most one, while defining M ⊕ M as containing X1 h X1 t and X2 h X2 t makes c(M ⊕ M, Δ) increase by at least 2. This contradicts the hypothesis.</p><p>Now suppose that there is a degree 4 vertex in G, such that M does not contain any of the edges X h X t , Y h Y t , X h Y t , Y h X t . Say it contains edges X h t, X t u, Y h v, Y t w, where t, u, v, w may be null symbols if any of X h , X t , Y h , Y t is a telomere in M.</p><p>Then replace X h t, X t u, Y h v, Y t w by X h , X t , Y h Y t , tu, vw or X h Y t , tw, X t Y h , uv, depending on the cycles in c(M ⊕ M, Δ).</p><p>Suppose now that M contains only one among the edges X h X t , Y h Y t , X h Y t , Y h X t say X h X t , and M has edges Y t u and Y h v.

All these operations decrease d(Π, M) + d(Δ, M) or maintain it constant, while increasing the number of edges of type X t X h for a degree 2 vertex in G, or X h X t , Y h Y t , X h Y t and X t Y h for degree 4 vertices of G, contradicting the hypothesis. At the end of this process, M is canonical, so the subclaim is proved. </p></div>
