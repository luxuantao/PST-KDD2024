<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a detailed semantics for linguistic spatial expressions supportive of computational processing that draws substantially on the principles and tools of ontological engineering and formal ontology. We cover language concerned with space, actions in space and spatial relationships and develop an ontological organization that relates such expressions to general classes of fixed semantic import. The result is given as an extension of a linguistic ontology, the Generalized Upper Model, an organization which has been used for over a decade in natural language processing applications. We describe the general nature and features of this ontology and show how we have extended it for working particularly with space. Treaitng the semantics of natural language expressions concerning space in this way offers a substantial simplification of the general problem of relating natural spatial language to its contextualized interpretation. Example specifications based on natural language examples are presented, as well as an evaluation of the ontology's coverage, consistency, predictive power, and applicability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The relation between language and space has long been an area of active research (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">154,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">111]</ref>). Human languages impose particular linguistic constructions of space, of spatially-anchored events, and of spatial configurations that relate in complex ways to the spatial situations in which they are used. Establishing tighter formal specifications of this relationship has proved a considerable challenge and has so far eluded general solutions. One reason for this is that the precise nature of the contribution made by spatial language has been conceived too simply. In much earlier and ongoing work, language is assumed to offer a relatively simple inventory of terms for which spatial interpretations can be directly stated. Examples of this can be found not only in accounts that focus on formalizations of particular tasks, such as path descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, scene descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, navigation and way-finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">140]</ref>, but also in foundational work on the formal ontology of space <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, on qualitative spatial calculi <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>, and on cognitive approaches involving, for example, image schemas <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>. In all of these approaches the principal burden of explanation is located within the non-linguistic formalizations pursued. This produces characterizations of spatial semantics that mirror the tasks and formal criteria addressed rather than the properties required for treating spatial language. As we shall argue below, such characterizations turn out to be ill-suited for dealing with the extreme flexibility of spatial language use observable in real contexts.</p><p>To bring the flexibility of spatial language use under control, we pursue a detailed formalization of what language itself brings to the interpretation of space. In particular, we consider language as contributing a structure of the spatial world that can be formulated as an ontology. This organization provides an additional layer of ontological information that formalizes the 'semantic commitments' entered into by any linguistic spatial construction. Such semantic commitments are intended to capture precisely the degree of formalization required to explain the linguistic options taken up while at the same time avoiding over-commitment with respect to the physical or conceptual spatial situations in which those linguistic options may be exercised. This then serves as an intermediate 'interface ontology' supporting mediation between linguistic forms on the one hand and contextualized interpretations on the other. We organize this intermediate layer around the central notion of 'spatial modalities', abstract categories that group collections of similarly functioning linguistic spatial constructions together without committing to particular contextual interpretations. For example, linguistic constructions involving the prepositions 'at', 'near' and so on are related to the spatial modality Proximal, which stands in contrast to Distal and is a superconcept of spatial modalities involved with lateral (left-right) and frontal (front-back) 'projection'. The characterization of the linguistic expression "Bill is waiting at the post office" as expressing the spatial modality Proximal then makes commitments to a functional connection between the person waiting and the post office without (wrongly) committing to a spatial contextualization involving containment; both inside and outside the post office are still compatible with descriptions with 'at'. An expression 'near the post office' brings in addition a contribution from the spatial modality Disjointness and so overlaps with, but is distinct from, 'at'. The interface ontology as a whole provides a rich web of semantic inter-relationships; each of the spatial modalities we define brings with it semantic commitments that help constrain appropriate contextualizations. This paper motivates the design of the ontology in depth and provides extensive details of its use.</p><p>Constructing a view of spatial semantics as an additional layer of ontology in this way brings several advantages crucial for adequately capturing the relationship between language use and spatial interpretation. First, it supports the application of the full range of methods developed within ontological engineering and applied ontology in order to organize the information necessary in ways that conform to a strict and formally specified modeling style <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">148]</ref>. Second, it provides a suitable level of abstraction for dealing effectively with spatial language and for describing what linguistic expressions themselves bring to the interpretation process-something that has not been found possible when focusing on linguistic elements as isolated terms. And third, it allows the relationship between linguistic expressions and spatial interpretation to be recast as a particular case of ontological alignment, or mediation, whereby two or more distinct ontologies are brought into a formal relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98]</ref>. Combining these considerations establishes a formally robust and well grounded framework from which to consider the full flexibility required for dealing with the mapping between language and space.</p><p>A distinct, well-defined and empirically-motivated layer of semantics for spatial language of this kind has direct applications for many currently relevant tasks involving spatial language. These include attempts to support communication via natural language with the human users of Geographic Information Systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, of context-based services <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and of devices operating in space, such as situated robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96]</ref>. In addition, the growing demand for automatic enrichment of textual data with spatial annotations in the context of the semantic web raises precisely analogous issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. In all of these areas, solutions to the language-space mapping problem are urgently required. We also suggest that the organization we propose is equally relevant as a contribution to the linguistic discussion of space, particularly concerning how the interpretation of spatial language can be managed.</p><p>We organize our discussion as follows. In Section 2 we establish precisely why we consider spatial language to demand its own layer of ontological description. We then present in Section 3 two examples of linguistic spatial descriptions illustrating the general spatial categories of our linguistic ontology and their connection both to natural language constructions and to formal contextualized interpretations. In Section 4 we turn to the detailed structure and definitions of our linguistic ontology, including illustrative examples. Section 5 discusses issues concerning applicability and use of the ontology, and in Section 6 we address evaluation-itself now an area of increasing importance for ontological engineering in general. In Section 7, we conclude with a summary of what has been achieved and consider future research tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The case for a linguistic ontology for space</head><p>Our claim is that the processing of authentic spatial language requires a particular kind of knowledge to be capturedknowledge concerning the range of spatially-related meanings that language itself, or languages themselves, construct. This knowledge and its organization have been dealt with inadequately hitherto despite the fact that much is now known concerning the linguistic construction of space. Linguistic investigations of spatial semantics, particularly approaches from Talmy, Langacker, Vandeloise, Bierwisch, Lang, Levinson and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">161,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110]</ref>, have revealed broadly similar mechanisms at work across cultures and types of language use and a considerable body of work has emerged building on these foundations. Detailed studies of spatial language use can be found in contexts ranging over formal semantic interpretations, psychological studies, dialogue analysis, computational modeling and many more <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">159,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">160,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">157,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. The insights gained in this tradition provide the starting point for the formalization we propose. It is of particular importance to be clear about just how substantial this previous work is and, for this reason, our bibliographical references are extensivealthough still by no means exhaustive. So far, few attempts have been made to bring this substantial body of information together within a unified account supportive of automatic processing. We propose here for the first time a comprehensive approach to combining the various contributions that also relates them to non-linguistic spatial interpretations. The fundamental question at issue has been framed succinctly by Bierwisch: 'How much space gets into language' <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>? We propose for this a linguistically-motivated ontology, or 'linguistic ontology' for short, that provides a specification of an encapsulated layer of ontological information motivated solely by the requirements of linguistically-expressed spatial meanings. This provides a new layer of organization for capturing the contribution of language to spatial interpretation that is free of non-linguistic, contextually-dependent additions. We thereby decompose and modularize the problem of interpreting and producing spatial language by 'stratifying' three ways: (i) lexicogrammatically, (ii) according to a shallow semantics, and (iii) by contextualized specifications-all three of which are formally distinct. The application of ontological engineering methods then offers considerable benefits for teasing apart the respective contributions made by these essentially distinct knowledge sources.</p><p>We motivate the use of a linguistic ontology intermediate between linguistic expressions and their contextualized interpretation by briefly considering three perspectives relevant to the modeling of spatial language: we need to address (a) the linguistic phenomena of spatial language use, (b) the formalization of spatial language interpretations, and (c) the computational instantiation of processing schemes for natural language involving space. In all three domains there is striking converging evidence in favor of characterizing the relative contributions of spatial language, particularly spatial semantics, and domain or task descriptions of space in the manner we suggest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Evidence from linguistic usage</head><p>Early work in the semantics of spatial language began with a predominantly geometric perspective that still exerts considerable influence today. Under this view, the semantics of a spatial expression is related quite directly to a spatially-specified situation. For example, the semantics of a prepositional phrase involving the English preposition in might be given using a two-place predicate of the form:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>in(x, y)</head><p>interpreted to mean that some spatially-locatable entity x in the world is contained geometrically within the boundaries of some spatially-identifiable region y. Problematic with this account, and all modifications of it, are the basic facts of linguistic usage. Extensive illustrations of this have been given by Herskovits <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>-one of which concerned with the preposition 'in' is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In the situations depicted we cannot say, on the right-hand side, that the potato is 'in' the bowl even though it is, in some sense, completely contained geometrically, although, on the left-hand side, we can say that the bulb is in the socket even though it is patently not contained.</p><p>The kind of spatial meaning involved with 'in' is termed a topological spatial relation. Such relations generally locate an entity with respect to some specified region but do so in a way that makes it difficult to identify the regions that are applicable in any particular case. Although a 'naive', or pre-theoretical, consideration might suggest relations based on geometry (e.g., containment for 'in'), this leaves many common instances of use to be considered as exceptions. Commonly proposed meanings for 'in' include at least <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• geometrical containment,</formula><p>• containment within a concavity ('in a cup'),</p><p>• containment within a containing surface ('a crack in the glass'),</p><p>• interposition among elements ('in a forest'),</p><p>• location within/among elements of an aggregate ('in a town', 'within/among buildings'). These all involve some notion of 'containment' but precisely what is contained where is quite varied. Considerable effort has been expended in trying to bridge the gap evident between geometric descriptions of spatial situations and the kinds of meanings listed but, in general, the problem remains unsolved.</p><p>Bennett and Agarwal term these kinds of alternatives modes of locating and hosting and simply accept them as alternative meanings requiring alternative formalizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. This 'gets the job done' as far as moving forward on spatial formalization is concerned but does not go far towards explaining linguistic usage. Indeed, the situation is even worse in that each of these modes of locating and hosting can be driven further in ways that are then rendered more or less 'metaphorical'. In a sentence such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, for example, (1) I am in the tree.</p><p>Herskovits suggests that we can build on geometrical containment by adopting the three-dimensional convex hull of the tree rather than the tree itself. Whereas in a sentence such as (2),</p><p>(2) I am in Bruxelles.</p><p>Bennett and Agarwal propose that in this case the region for a containment relation is 'footprint' containment, whereby the two-dimensional 'footprint' of the spatial extent of the speaker ('I') is taken to be a spatial part of the two-dimensional 'footprint' of the spatial extent of Bruxelles. This is clearly an adequate analysis neither of example <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, nor of the examples depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In short, we arrive at a proliferation of formalizations for which it may be possible to force an interpretation in terms of some topological inclusion relationship but the main problem is actually deciding on which regions may be playing a role or not. If this is left sufficiently free, the geometric account is essentially empty-some region will always be constructible post hoc. The source of explanations is therefore located within contextualized interpretations without telling us precisely how such contextualization might be reached.</p><p>Another class of spatial meanings is described in terms of projective relations, such as 'in front of', 'left of', etc. These are more complex than topological relations in several ways. Their interpretation relies on the additional step of fixing an underlying reference system <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>, defined relative to the speaker or hearer, or with respect to some object's intrinsic or imposed orientation properties ('my left' vs. 'your left', 'the front of the church', or 'in front of the rolling ball', etc.). Unless the reference system is known, projective spatial expressions cannot be related unambiguously to spatial context. Nevertheless, it is precisely this crucial information that our English and German data show to be most commonly left implicit in natural dialogue, requiring resolution during interaction or from context <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Providing maximal support and constraint for this resolution is then extremely important for effective spatial language processing.</p><p>The problems that arise when attempting to fix the spatial import of projective relations are very similar to those of topological relations. We can show this drawing on the most commonly used formalizations proposed for projective relations, those of spatial templates <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113]</ref>, or field potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">129]</ref>. These formalizations build on the observation that projective terms appear to identify general directions rather than precise orientations. For example, 'to the left of X' picks out a general direction towards the left but is not restricted to a 90 • angle. Use of projective terms therefore suggests a graded applicability structure, whereby one direction may be a 'best' exemplar (a 'focal axis') but other directions are also acceptable to the extent that they approximate this best case. This can be captured by defining for each projective relation a probability field that reflects the likelihood of application of a term given a particular spatial position. This approach is applied in computational approaches to robotics and perception where a robot may need to interpret linguistic descriptions (particularly expressions containing spatial prepositions) to follow particular paths or locate objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">150,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref>. More complex expressions (e.g., 'in front and to the left of X') are generally interpreted by defining compositions of the individual fields involved.</p><p>The graded probability of location obtained within such accounts often matches applicability judgements made by speakers with respect to spatial situations relatively well. But there remain problems, most significant of which is the basic issue of just how the potential field relevant for a particular communicative situation is to be determined. Potential fields need to be parameterized in various ways (e.g., by being stretched or relaxed according to relative size and orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>, with respect to potential distractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>, and according to the selected reference frame), but the precise motivations for that parameterization are often context specific or ad hoc. This is exactly analogous to the problem with topological spatial terms: just as it was unclear what regions are called for, here it is equally unclear just what kind of field is appropriate.</p><p>Natural language usage is, moreover, substantially more varied than a straightforward parameterized selection of applicability fields would suggest. Consider, for example, the interpretation of even seemingly simple linguistic expressions involving left. A common interpretation compatible with potential fields would be in terms of an area of high probability along an axis situated 90 • counter-clockwise with respect to some reference object plus an orientation. However, in different contexts 'left' can equally well denote the entire 'left-hand' half-plane, a reorientation by an angle of contextually determined size or a redirection of movement, i.e., the expression turn left may denote a change of orientation (on the spot), a change of movement direction without a reorientation (as, for example, in a sideways motion or with non-oriented entities such as balls), or both (intuitively the normal case in route instructions). Worse, in the case of a street network, 'turn left at the next junction' has little to do with a focal axis: in fact, the field collapses according to the actual possibilities provided by the road network. If there are several roads on the 'left-hand side' it is not enough to pick the one that is closest to a 90 • angle and to call that the 'left turn', since all the turns on the left are 'left turns' in some sense; a more discriminating description is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>.</p><p>Field potentials are also used for other spatial relations with similar accompanying problems. For example, one model of the spatial expression 'at X' might be as a circular field centered (i.e., with highest probability) on the element X. Or, a model of the expression 'along X' might be a field that follows the shape of the spatial element X <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref>. But in each case, just what shape of field is to be picked as well as how it is to be positioned with respect to the current spatial situation represents a difficult interpretative decision in its own right. One last illustration of this is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; this shows a repositioning of a potential field that is extreme, while still remaining a straightforwardly everyday example of spatial language that is unlikely to strike any but the most literal of interpreters (e.g., us and the computational systems we construct) as strange. The example concerns the spatial relationship 'between'; if asked without any context what the appropriate potential field for describing the spatial situation corresponding to the spatial expression 'between X and Y' might be, it would be reasonable to expect that points nearer to a line connecting X and Y would receive a higher probability than points lying further away. The figure shows, however, that the information given in the explanatory sign ('swim only between the red and yellow flags') intends to pick out a completely different spatial situation and, what is more, 'effortlessly' succeeds in doing soviolating on the way a 'universal' hypothesized by Zwarts that the spatial interpretations of simple prepositional phrases necessarily contain their reference objects <ref type="bibr">[168, p. 80]</ref>.</p><p>Such examples show that relating a linguistic term to a probability field conflates at least two steps: the selection of a contextual interpretation and the generation of a field appropriate to that contextual interpretation. But, as with topological regions, it is precisely this first stage that is the main problem facing spatial language interpretation and production. Discussions of spatial terms often fail to separate these two stages and so already incorporate particular contextualized interpretations in their consideration of the linguistic semantics involved. With respect to projective terms, such discussion leads to the misconception that graded applicability structure is an integral part of some spatial term's semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, whereas it is actually a property of the contextualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>. It is only when we have the contextualization that we can go on to identify which kind and shape of probability field may be required and it is only there that we can observe graded applicability. But to reach this stage, we must first unravel the linguistic contribution to the contextualization process.</p><p>A third area of difficulty with natural language usage is the considerable 'ontological flexibility' that spatial terms exhibit. Depending on their context of use, particular spatial terms take on quite different properties. One classic statement of this was given by Hobbs over a decade ago. Consider the ontological status of a spatial entity such as a 'road': "When we are planning a trip, we view it as a line. When we are driving on it, we have to worry about our placement to the right or left, so we think of it as a surface. When we hit a pothole, it becomes a volume for us" <ref type="bibr">[78, p. 820</ref>].</p><p>These quite different 'conceptualizations' give rise to correspondingly different linguistic descriptions, or grammatical syndromes as we will characterize them below-such as 'along the road', 'on the road', 'in the road', and so on. Each of these possibilities commits to a certain range of properties for the object described, but those properties are only indirectly related to ontological properties of the entity in the world. Indeed, even the selection of a lexical item, such as 'road', cannot be taken as a neutral labelling of reality. There may be considerable uncertainty as to where the limits of applicability of a term might lie and to what follows from such an application once made; this problem has received considerable study in the area of geographic entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">147]</ref>. In general, the diverging identity criteria necessary for the entities picked out by linguistic classifications and by entities 'in the world' demand an ontological separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>Language usage itself requires us, moreover, to distinguish between at least 'objects' and the 'places' where such objects may be located <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>. Several grammatical tests support this distinction. Asher, for example, suggests use of a grammatical alternation involving (in English) in or at versus inside <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This test relies on the fact that it is quite dispreferred to say that one is 'inside' a region; this motivates the contrasting acceptability judgements observable in examples (3)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>):</p><p>(3) The tractor is in the field. (4) ??? The tractor is inside the field.</p><p>A 'place' may be brought into discussion by referencing an object but it remains a question of interpretation to determine just what that place is.</p><p>It is also clear that language usage demands an account in which geometric modeling is often not the primary consideration. One extension beyond geometric information now finding wide acceptance is the inclusion of functional notions <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>. Functional relationships obtain whenever the use or behavior of one entity depends in some way on another. There is now strong evidence that a broad range of spatial terms are crucially sensitive to functional features <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. For example, acceptability judgements for the use of 'above' when referring to a tube of toothpaste geometrically 'above' a toothbrush vary systematically according to whether the precise placement is supportive of putting the toothpaste on the brush or not; moreover, for some particular linguistic terms, it is the functional information that appears to be a stronger conditioning factor of use whereas, for others, it is the geometric contribution that appears stronger <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>Common functional notions include 'control' and 'support'. These deal succinctly with the problematic uses of 'in' shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> above: the bulb is 'in' the socket because it is 'functionally controlled' by this placement-if we move the socket the bulb moves, if we remove the socket, the bulb falls, etc.; similarly, the potato is not 'in' the bowl because it is not controlled by the bowl-if we lift the bowl the potato stays where it is. It does not appear plausible at this time to reduce the functional to the geometric, or vice versa. Indeed, language usage in general is most responsive to perceived (interpretation) or claimed (production) functional relationships-regardless of their geometric support.</p><p>In all three of the areas of linguistic usage discussed-topological terms, projective terms, and the ontological flexibility of spatial categorization-we find considerable subtlety being introduced by the need to consider language. There are distinct kinds of information, or entities, being drawn upon which may not be evident when considering a treatment of space independently of language. The complex and situation-dependent relationship of these entities to spatial interpretation calls for their own layer of ontological modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Formalization evidence</head><p>In the previous subsection we have seen that language use is very flexible. In this subsection, we focus on some of the problems that this flexibility brings for formalization-at this stage still independently of whether a computational instantiation is being targeted. Formalizing the meanings entailed by this flexibility clarifies further the difficulties involved. Particularly problematic is the fact that specific linguistic terms have been taken to require very different logical formalizations in different circumstances. This follows directly from the sheer diversity of Bennett and Agarwal's 'modes of locating and hosting' mentioned above. As they write: "Because of the ambiguity of natural language, there will not be a definite mapping between natural language terms and elements of this semantic theory. Rather, we shall find that each natural language term has a number of distinct senses, corresponding to different ways in which the interpreted entity can be interpreted within our semantic framework" <ref type="bibr">[24, p. 80]</ref>.</p><p>But from a linguistic perspective, allowing unrelated meanings within a lexical item is less than satisfactory. It is often a sign of missed generalizations and complicates processing. Here we wish to ensure that we do not lose the strong sense in which shared grammatical constructions share important aspects of their meaning.</p><p>The interposition of a knowledge organization mediating between linguistic form and contextualized interpretation, i.e., our linguistic ontology, attempts to capture these shared aspects directly so as to provide a more parsimonious framework for integrating the 'distinct senses' of spatial expressions proposed in the literature. These distinct senses are often only required because they are already attempting to model contextualized interpretations. In effect, each formalization has already committed to a particular usage in context without telling us how that might have been reached. Accounts are then forced to simply include further alternate logical forms within the lexicon entries involved. Building a more abstract, linguisticallysensitive layer of formalization into the account allows us to move beyond this in order to be more supportive of flexible spatial language usage that is nevertheless constrained to lie within the range of variation that naturally occurs.</p><p>In many respects, our formalization approach is analogous to the direction started by Bierwisch. Bierwisch <ref type="bibr">[26, p. 36]</ref>, for example, presents the following two examples illustrating considerable diversity in meaning for very similar constructions:</p><p>(5) He left the institute an hour ago. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> He left the institute a year ago.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> we appear to be dealing with a change of location; in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, however, the meaning appears to be a change of social affiliation. Bierwisch's method of dealing with this diversity is to interpose a semantic representation that is neutral between the distinct contextualized readings. In this case, a single semantic representation is postulated, centered around a generative semantics-style predicate-argument expression such as:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[x DO [BECOME [NEG [x AT y]]]]</head><p>The central 'spatial' component involving the semantic prime 'AT' is then kept neutral between x being spatially located proper within the physical space of the institute and x changing their social affiliation with the abstract entity constituting the institute. This offers a straightforward example of factoring out a context-independent semantic representation in order to provide a suitable starting point for contextualization.</p><p>In several more recent approaches to the formalization of linguistic spatial expressions, we find this separation of concerns not being followed. It is therefore interesting and relevant to consider briefly whether the problems of usage of linguistic spatial terms introduced above are appropriately included in these approaches. Kracht <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, for example, presents an extensive, typologically-motivated proposal for the semantics of many spatial expressions in terms of a presumed universal semantically transparent phrase structure of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[ MP M [ LP L [ DP Landmark ]]]</formula><p>This represents structurally an assumption that locative expressions consist of two 'layers', one of which Kracht terms the configuration, the other the mode. Configurations capture mutual static spatial relations between objects and are expressed as 'location phrases' (LP); modes capture movements with respect to those configurations via 'mode phrases' (MP). An important benefit of Kracht's approach is that the semantics of such phrases, combinations of such phrases, and their embedding within larger syntactic contexts are all constructed in a strictly compositional and well-specified fashion. This is a desirable property for any account and is certainly one which we attempt to maintain in our own approach. Particularly telling, however, are the consequences for compositionality that Kracht's basic assumptions give rise to.</p><p>Kracht takes the semantics of spatial expressions to be temporally parameterized spatial neighborhoods in threedimensional space. In particular, the lexical semantic content of spatial terms, such as prepositions, is provided by a collection of specially defined localization functions whose task is to map given spatial neighborhoods to other geometrically related spatial neighborhoods. For example, the semantics of the preposition 'in' under this account is a function that requires an object x and a time t and which produces the set of regions that are contained in the inside of x at that time t. Now, while this is without doubt a possible and appropriate contextualized interpretation of some uses of spatial expressions, it is by no means clear that this is an appropriate semantics for the linguistic expressions themselves-for all of the reasons of flexibility sketched in the previous subsection. The consequences of this for compositionality are, however, substantial and Kracht himself notes that he explicitly wishes to exclude examples of the kind Herskovits discusses; in fact: ". . . there are many instances where [the semantics of localizers we have given] fail to do justice to our intuitions. Moreover, there invariably are borderline cases. For example, when is some object x at an object y, and when is it on y? . . . It is difficult to imagine how a strictly compositional account would handle this problem, and we shall have to leave it aside" <ref type="bibr">[94, p. 191</ref>]. Thus, compositionality is only maintained in this account by relying on the natural compositionality of geometric operations on regions: linguistic compositionality has been made dependent on a particular (contextualized) spatial interpretation, one which, as we have seen, is itself problematic.</p><p>A similar difficulty arises in the combinatory categorial grammar approach to spatial expressions proposed by Francez and Steedman <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. This account, although couched within a very different formal and linguistic framework, makes the same assumption that an appropriate semantics for spatial expressions is a specification of the regions of three-dimensional space that those expressions pick out. Here, as is usual within combinatory categorial grammar accounts, the semantics of larger expressions is constructed via function application over the semantics of component expressions as determined by the internal structure of complex syntactic categories. Francez and Steedman add to this semantics explicit spatial and temporal 'contextual variables' which, during function application, collect additional constraints via so-called 'shift-functions' <ref type="bibr">[58, p. 394</ref>]. In the case of spatial expressions, the role of these functions is to take some spatial region and to modify, or 'shift', this to produce another region related in some particular specified way to the originating one.</p><p>The precise semantics of these shift-functions is not Francez and Steedman's main focus-they are primarily concerned with achieving an appropriately compositional account that adequately reflects the role of context. In this respect, there is much to be taken from the mechanisms they propose. However, it is clear that these shift-functions are, again, being seen primarily as involving geometric operations. This can perhaps be explained in relation to the origins of their approach in Pratt and Francez's treatment of temporal semantics in terms of contextual variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>. In that account, the semantics of temporal expressions is related directly to temporal interval logics, enabling the interpretation of linguistic temporal expressions to proceed in step with the operations these logics support. Whereas this treatment is very appealing for treatments of temporal language, the use of spatial language shows considerably more flexibility and it is by no means clear which 'logics' (and there are many (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>)) may appropriately play the role that is played by temporal interval logics in the case of time. It is clear, however, that Euclidean three-dimensional geometry does not provide a sufficient basis; this situation therefore needs to find appropriate consideration within any account that seeks to cover a broader range of natural spatial language usage. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>The direction we follow in our development of a linguistic ontology for spatial language accordingly draws on a further class of recent approaches to the semantics of spatial language. These are approaches which use linguistic evidence in order to motivate abstract specifications of spatial semantics that cover just those distinctions that language appears to require, rather than relating this immediately to contextualized interpretations in a three-dimensional space. This follows further the 'two-level' approach of Bierwisch introduced above, but begins spelling out in considerably more detail the linguistic side of the spatial equation.</p><p>An early detailed account of this kind was Eschenbach's <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> formalization of spatial expressions such as 'left'/'right', 'in front of'/'behind', etc. In this framework, an abstract geometric structure covering the semantic commitments of language is imposed on the concrete spatial situation, depending on the binding of some specific, well-defined contextual anchors. The linguistic semantics is then couched in terms of abstract algebraic structures, with their own entities and properties-for example, that required for 'left'/'right' involves half-planes, that for 'in front of'/'behind' involves oriented half-lines-which may then be 'anchored' into particular contexts in a flexible but well-defined fashion; we have discussed this approach and its relation to linguistic ontology elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Another well developed account in this spirit is the work by Zwarts on the semantics of location and path expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">169]</ref>. Employing several distinct kinds of linguistic evidence (most interestingly, aspect), Zwarts <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref> develops in a style analogous to that of Eschenbach an algebraic theory that yields appropriate properties for path descriptions constructed compositionally during the interpretation of prepositional phrases, combinations of prepositional phrases, and prepositional phrases combined with other spatially-relevant material in their respective verb phrases. Again, these constructions must be seen first and foremost as abstract spatial interpretations of linguistic spatial descriptions which may stand in more or less complex relationships with actual spatial situations.</p><p>We consider the moves being made in this direction as offering strong evidence in favor of the kind of modularity that we pursue here. Distinguishing a linguistic spatial semantics from contextualized spatial interpretations appears to be a beneficial, and perhaps even necessary, step towards getting the full flexibility of spatial language usage under theoretical and formal control. The main task facing the development of such a semantics further is then to characterize in detail what kinds of abstract spatial configurations can be motivated linguistically, what their interrelationships and properties are, and how they interact with other aspects of semantics and context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Natural language processing concerns</head><p>The interpretation of spatial language raises similar general issues to those involved when trying to relate generic natural language processing components to the requirements of any specific domain. The basic premise we motivate here is that it is useful from several perspectives to specify a level of representation that is intermediate between natural language expressions on the one hand and formally specified characterizations of spatial situations on the other. A separation of information into distinct modules of this kind is reminiscent both of earlier 'two-level semantics' accounts that have been adopted in several natural language processing contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref> and of notions of 'quasi-logical form', originally advocated in systems such as the Core Language Engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Our own use of a two-level architecture goes back to the Penman Upper Model, originally developed within the Penman text generation system in the mid-1980s <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. This was, to our knowledge, the first approach to two-level semantics explicitly formulated as an ontology. Particularly within natural language generation, it was recognized relatively early that organizing 'domain knowledge' in a way that reflected its expression in natural language would more readily support generic natural language generation applications. The Penman Upper Model was accordingly defined as an interface between application knowledge and linguistic knowledge, expressed as what we would nowadays term a 'lightweight ontology' using the knowledge representation system LOOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>.</p><p>The introduction of a further layer of domain-independent semantics between syntactic analysis/generation and domain knowledge is a move now being suggested, apparently independently, as a component of several distinct approaches. Within a parsing and interpretation context, it has been argued that such a semantic layer improves portability and re-use of components within dialogue systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>; within a generation context, it has been argued similarly that compositional semantics needs characterizations that capture how language decomposes entities and that this is, again, independent of domain-specific organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>. Within the spatial domain, we also see language-motivated characterizations proposed by Mavridis and Roy as a kind of 'parsing' of "situations into ontological types and relations that reflect human language semantics" <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>. Here, just as in our case, the relationship to language is intended to support automatic natural language processing, while the relationship to situations and ontological types is intended to ease their formal interpretation and contextualization.</p><p>A further motivation for imposing this additional layering, or stratification, of 'ontological' representations when considering language processing is that it provides a more appropriate modularization of concerns. Without stratification there is a tendency to equate existing foundational ontologies, such as DOLCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>, SUMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> and so on, with natural language semantics directly. Such treatments can be sophisticated <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, or more straightforward as in the direct linking of SUMO categories with WordNet synsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref> or in the inclusion of semantically-motivated categories as a proper part of the ontology as a whole, as in the Sensus ontology of the DARPA knowledge-sharing initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> and the more recent Omega effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">130]</ref>, both of which build on developments of the Penman Upper Model mentioned above. Problematic in all these cases is that they do not address the ontological flexibility of natural language terms that we discussed above with respect to the quote from Hobbs and, as a consequence, mix components of very different ontological statuses. A representation of natural language semantics within a foundational ontology, for example as proposed for DOLCE by Cimiano and Reyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> or for SWINTO (a combination of DOLCE and SUMO) by Oberle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>, then commits to an inappropriate rigidity of interpretation. Similar criticisms hold for links between lexical organizations, such as FrameNet, VerbNet, WordNet, etc. and foundational ontologies of any kind. The flexibility of 'ontological' classification requires that entities in the world receive diverse classifications according to the requirements of the discourse context. When bringing foundational ontologies and linguistic information together, therefore, it is necessary to pay particular attention to the ontologically non-rigid nature of linguistic classification.</p><p>It is equally necessary to avoid importing into computational system design over-restrictive assumptions from theoretical accounts. For example, Jørgensen and Lønning develop a Minimal Recursion Semantic analysis component for computational use that is embedded within Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar and which implements fairly directly the account of Kracht summarized above <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. Based on Kracht's assumptions, they assume that it should be reasonably straightforward to move from their underspecified semantics to contextualized interpretation-however, as argued above, this will only hold for geometrically transparent usages. It would be highly desirable to maintain the overall framework for interpretation that they develop, while at the same time weakening the implicit reliance on geometry.</p><p>Our approach to meeting these requirements draws, as mentioned, on the course of development begun with the Penman Upper Model. Here, the basic idea was to provide an ontology of categories and relations sufficient for driving all of the decisions required by the linguistic components present in the system. Knowledge from particular domains was then made accessible to the linguistic components by formally relating (at first in terms of subsumption or inheritance) the concepts from any specific domain to the concepts provided by the Upper Model ontology. Any domain-specific concept then inherited appropriate 'methods' for linguistic expression <ref type="bibr">[12, p. 57]</ref> and semantic specifications could employ domain knowledge concepts freely, safe in the assumption that the linguistic components would know how to express those concepts via the methods associated with the linked Upper Model concepts. Crucial to the design of the Upper Model was a commitment to including distinctions only when they are motivated by specifiable contrasts in grammatical form. For this reason, we consider an Upper Model to be a linguistically-motivated ontology representing that portion of the semantics of a natural language that finds expression in that language's grammar; similarities can usefully be drawn here with Jackendoff's criterion of grammatical effect <ref type="bibr">[87, p. 13]</ref>. This guarantees that the relation to linguistic form is known-thereby supporting its use in generation and analysis-while also moving the description towards semantics.</p><p>Basing design on grammatical evidence rather than lexical organization differentiates the Upper Model from other, superficially similar systems that have been developed on lexical grounds, such as FrameNet, VerbNet, WordNet and systems descended from these <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. We consider the distinction between lexical semantics and grammatical semantics central because lexical items tend to be too idiosyncratic in their bundling of semantic properties to reveal generic semantic configurations. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> The Upper Model is therefore more closely related to approaches that adopt an explicit orientation to grammar and grammatical distinctions for linking with semantics as now suggested across a very broad range of frameworks, from generative grammar <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>, through cognitive approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, to social-functional accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. The degree to which it is possible or desirable to bring the lexically and grammatically motivated organizations together remains an open issue at this time.</p><p>Our main motivation for calling an organization of this kind an ontology then lies in the role we attribute to language of structuring, or schematizing, experience. In many respects, just as any 'reality' is necessarily filtered through our perceptual systems, it is also filtered through the language system-at the latest whenever we wish to communicate ('thinking for speaking' <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>). We can therefore characterize this linguistically constructed reality in much the same way, and applying similar principles, as adopted when characterizing other constructions of reality.</p><p>The concrete starting point for the work described in this paper is a particular extension to the original Upper Model design made in the mid-1990s in order to meet new application demands. This involved both broadening the range of languages addressed and incorporating some generic semantic principles developed for 'linguistically motivated' ontologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. The result was the Generalized Upper Model, referred to hereafter as GUM <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The GUM linguistic ontology provided a broad basis for driving natural language generation, but did not treat spatial language with any degree of sophistication. Therefore, in order to meet the requirements of a linguistically-motivated spatial organization as set out in this section, we have developed GUM further in three main respects:</p><p>-First, we now work with an explicit orientation to the state of the art in formal ontological engineering, observing modeling strategies from formal ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">146]</ref> and enforcing criteria for ontological correctness from the OntoClean methodology for ontology evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. -Second, we specify the ontology so that it is usable for both generation and analysis, thereby providing a common source and target semantic representation suitable for dialogue systems; this also provides a formal and logical representation which can be used together with automatic consistency checking and reasoning. -And third, drawing strictly on linguistic evidence, we have combined both the results of the existing literature of empirical analyses of spatial language and conclusions from our own empirical studies of situated spatial discourse in order to produce a highly detailed extension of GUM for the spatial domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Conclusion</head><p>We have argued that folding together contextualization and linguistic semantics in the area of spatial semantics leaves an over-complex impression of the mechanisms involved. We need instead to isolate those linguistically-motivated semantic distinctions that provide a basis for contextualization and which themselves generalize across contexts of use. In particular, we need to provide an as exhaustive as possible characterization of the distinct kinds of spatial configurations and modes constructed by a language and to formalize how these are deployed in the construction of the shallow semantics of sentences as a whole. In Section 4 below we set out the categories of the linguistic ontology in detail; but first, in the following section, we prepare the ground for this by illustrating our methodology for designing a linguistically-motivated ontology such as the Upper Model. This will also let us introduce some of the top-level concepts of the ontology that we require below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The development of a linguistic ontology of space</head><p>We emphasized in the previous section the importance we attribute to grammatical evidence. Focusing on the closedclass, or grammatical, end of the spectrum of linguistic phenomena allows stronger claims to be made concerning the coverage of the resulting semantic framework and its adequacy for explaining linguistic flexibility. Attempting a grammatical characterization for the spatial area is also of considerable interest for general linguistic reasons; Talmy claims, for example, that the grammatical category of closed-class forms in its entirety is actually limited to a small range of concepts coming from the spatial domain <ref type="bibr">[154, p. 177</ref>]. In contrast, accounts starting from open-class items exhibit a tendency to slip over from accounts of language to accounts more appropriately considered as domain-specific extensions of non-linguistic ontologies. This is precisely the function of open-class items: to provide structure for all the various individual domains of experience at issue for a culture. Grammatical semantics, on the other hand, is there to provide a generalized foundation re-usable across domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</p><p>Approaches that are not anchored in linguistics are naturally drawn to the lexical approach because it is the open-class items that are easiest to find without linguistic analysis. This also characterizes many computational and formal approaches to spatial language, together with a restriction of attention to a rather small subset of the linguistic phenomena that actually contribute to the linguistic construction of space. This is not adequate for building a linguistic semantics because its methodology is limited with respect both to the range of semantic distinctions that can be made visible and to the range of linguistic data that can be drawn upon as evidence. As pointed out with particular force by Levinson, spatial information is in fact distributed across at least determiners, adjectives, adpositions, relational nominals, adverbial nominals, grammatical case, locative verbs, verbal affixes, clitics and combinations of all of these <ref type="bibr">[110, p. 99]</ref>; drawing on this range of evidence provides a much broader foundation for identifying what language itself is doing with space. It also, although we will not be able to address this here, prepares the ground effectively for accounts that apply across languages: as we shall see below, most of the distinctions drawn in our spatial extension to GUM can be found across languages, although their particular grammatical realizations may differ substantially. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref>Our task here is to provide a level of semantic description that will support the process of contextualization. Such descriptions must distinguish the spatial situation picked out by an utterance from all other grammatically distinguishable situations without overcommitment: that is, the description captures formally just the degrees of flexibility, or underspecification, that the linguistic utterance itself leaves open. As mentioned above, we draw on several approaches that have been taken in the literature for developing a level of description for spatial language of this kind. In particular, we proceed in the directions proposed by Talmy <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>, Bierwisch <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Levinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> Halliday and Matthiessen <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, Eschenbach <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, Zwarts <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref> and others, combining these within an overarching ontological framework anchored in formal ontology. This is organized in terms of appropriately motivated semantic types within the Generalized Upper Model linguistic ontology.</p><p>The move from grammatical evidence to a linguistic ontology can be complex and it is not feasible in this paper to show for each category just which range of linguistic phenomena is drawn upon; Tenbrink <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>, for example, provides considerably more detail. It is, as a consequence, easy to lose sight of our fundamental commitment that no semantic distinctions be introduced unless we can specify their linguistic consequences. To show this process at work, however, we present two examples of linguistic analysis of this kind, starting from the grammatical constructions involved and relating these to the semantic configurations entailed. These configurations also provide our first views of the ontological organization of the Generalized Upper Model spatial extension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Example 1: Basic configurations and the place of spatial relationships within these</head><p>The following is adapted from an original German example of a location description found in our own experimental studies on spatial language use (cf. Section 6): <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> To the left of the computer is a USB drive.</p><p>All the usual potential ambiguities mentioned in Section 2 above apply to this utterance, although in this case we know precisely the spatial context and the dialogue development that led up to the utterance and so can reliably disambiguate. Without this context, however, left of the computer could mean "to the left from your point of view" just as well as "to the left from my point of view", which can make a decisive difference if speaker and hearer do not share their view on the scene, or the speaker may ascribe an intrinsic left side to the computer-typically, the side that is on the left when interacting with it <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>-which is then independent of the current position of both speaker and hearer. As is overwhelmingly the case in natural interactions, the linguistic structure of the example chooses not to reflect these conceptual options, leaving it to the interaction and the hearer to resolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>.</p><p>The utterance itself is an existential statement that 'locates' a figure with respect to a ground. The figure/ground distinction is widely accepted in spatial processing and perceptual psychology and is also regularly reflected grammatically in language. Talmy, for example, proposes that the figure is conceived of as a moving or movable entity which is more relevant in the present context, while the ground serves as a reference entity conceived of as more stationary <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>. This conceptual asymmetry is reflected as grammatical syndromes within linguistic structure-for example, by the grammatical distinctions of subject and (indirect) object, by syntactic distinctions between main and subordinate clauses, and by presenting some entities as presupposed and others as new. All languages have a range of ways of performing this particular placing of entities of different kinds in relation to one another, both semantically and syntactically, and we draw on this as evidence for distinguishing the particular 'semantic configuration' involved here from others. Grammatical evidence supporting this in the present case can be found in the kinds of alternations <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref> possible (e.g., insertion of 'there' as grammatical subject), nonpossibility for progressive present tenses, of passive and many more that together make up distinctive syndromes of grammatical consequences (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>). It is these grammatical consequences that we use as signposts pointing to the semantic distinctions required of the Generalized Upper Model.</p><p>The syndrome of grammatical evidence clustered around the present example motivates the definition of a semantic entity called a Configuration. Configurations generally correlate with grammatical clauses or other grammatical units expressing events or relationships (e.g., nominalizations). Moreover, we can be more specific in that the particular type of clause in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> corresponds to a particular subtype of Configuration, one that we call a SpatialLocating; we will see other subtypes of Configurations below. This type of semantic configuration has the function of relating some entity (the figure) to some specification of a place (the ground). The figure-ground asymmetry also motivates the assignment of distinct roles to the entities within the configuration: in the present example, the USB drive fills a locatum relation (the movable object to be located, or 'referent' <ref type="bibr">[110, p. 39]</ref>), whereas the place (the ground) fills a placement relation.</p><p>The entity being placed and the place itself can also be distinguished from one another by virtue of distinct syndromes of grammatical behavior (e.g., most obviously, the former is a simple nominal phrase and the latter is a prepositional phrase). They are, accordingly, assigned to distinct linguistic-ontological categories within the Generalized Upper Model by drawing a corresponding high-level distinction between the concepts SimpleThing and Circumstance. This reflects the fundamental distinction between the identity of entities and the location of entities mentioned above (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>). In the example, the USB drive is a SimpleThing, and to the left of the computer is a further grammatically motivated subconcept of Circumstance, called a GeneralizedLocation. It is also worth noting here that, similarly to Zwarts <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref>, we adopt the position that individual spatial expressions (such as the prepositional phrase at issue here) receive their own individual spatial semantics independently of subsequent composition with events or objects-this is important for maintaining compositionality, to which we return below in Section 5.2.1.</p><p>The concept GeneralizedLocation provides a common semantics for any linguistic expression of a 'place'-including prepositional phrases, adverbials, nominals and other spatially-relevant constituents when used in appropriate grammatical contexts. Place is therefore understood as a category constructed by the grammar of a language, in our case particularly English and German (but for other languages too: cf. the references to Talmy, Levinson and others above). In addition, although GeneralizedLocation constructs a place on the basis of some specified entity, or reference object, it does not do so directly but rather in terms of the distinct kinds of 'modes of anchoring and locating' that language(s) make available; these we group together under the single concept SpatialModality. Our linguistic ontology provides, again exclusively on the basis of grammatical evidence, a detailed characterization of the range of subtypes of SpatialModality and their interrelationships and constraints. We show this at length in the next section.</p><p>Formally, we may consider a GeneralizedLocation as a one-place predicate that 'locates' its argument. The precise placement of that argument is then constrained by the specification of a particular subclass of SpatialModality. This is captured in an expression of the form: λx.Loc(x, P spatial-modality (R)) where R is the reference object (e.g., the 'desk' in 'in front of the desk', the 'tree' in 'in the tree', etc.) and Loc a predicate of co-location. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> The expression says that some entity x co-locates with some 'location' that must be derived from the reference object R in the manner identified by the given spatial modality P spatial-modality . This formalization is then similar to those proposed by Creary et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and Bierwisch and Wunderlich <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">164]</ref>, both of whom argue for a complex compositional structure rather than superficially more straightforward two-place predicates. In our case, however, there will be no restriction to geometric interpretations of the reference objects for the reasons set out above.</p><p>This layer of interpretative indirection is the essential key to achieving an account adequate for the observed flexibility of linguistic spatial expression usage. Consider, for example, the kind of semantics that must be given for a prepositional phrase such as 'at the town hall' when used in the sentence: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> I am waiting at the town hall.</p><p>If we proceed directly to a contextualized interpretation of the spatial situation involved, we have a problem. Such a statement includes both waiting inside the town hall and outside it in the immediate vicinity as possibilities. No single 'applicability field' or selection of spatial region can be sensibly specified without considering the context of interpretation of the utterance. Moreover, as we saw in the examples of the previous section, this has nothing to do with a possible 'relaxation' or 'stretching' of the relevant applicability field: the range of application may turn out to be, as in the 'between' case illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, totally disjoint. Employing our generic scheme for generalized locations, however, we can give the semantics of the prepositional phrase of (8) straightforwardly as:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>λx.Loc(x, P proximal (R))</head><p>The concept proximal is one of the spatial modalities that we introduce in detail below. The expression as a whole means that a place is to be derived from the reference object, or relatum as we will now call it in line with general linguistic practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, subject to a constraint of Proximity. That is, the relatum, i.e., the town hall, is used to locate some entity via the mode of locating/anchoring of 'being in a proximal relationship to'. Crucially, we take this already to be a functional characterization, since we cannot express metrically just what is proximal or not-this depends on the purpose of the interactants-nor over what duration the relation holds, whether the objects involved in a description are moving, and so on. All that the linguistic statement commits to is that the location is stably proximal 'for current purposes', whatever they might be. We do not at this stage, i.e., within the linguistic semantics, need to talk further of any kind of spatial region representing this proximity: linguistically, no further commitment is made beyond the claim of functional proximity and it is this that provides fixed semantic import for all constructions grouped under this particular linguistic-ontological category. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref>Within our current example <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the semantics is constructed similarly. The computer fills the relatum relation of its GeneralizedLocation (the more stationary object used for reference), while to the left is the spatial modality that is applied to the relatum in order to 'create' a place; we show the particular position of the spatial modality employed here, to the left, within the hierarchy of spatial modalities as a whole in Section 4 below. This abstract specification of a 'place' then fills the placement role of the SpatialLocating configuration and we arrive at the complete spatial semantics for the example utterance shown graphically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. In our discussions below, we will use standard Description Logic notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for definitions rather than diagrammatic representations because, as set out in detail in Section 4, our linguistic ontology is in fact expressed within a description logic. This notation then provides a particularly succinct representation of the class-subclass relations and the availability of roles and possible constraints on those roles' fillers just as we require. The definition of SpatialLocating given so far (this will be refined further below) is then as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) SpatialLocating ≡ Configuration ∃locatum.SimpleThing ∃placement.GeneralizedLocation Similarly, the concept GeneralizedLocation receives a definition of the form: (10) GeneralizedLocation ≡ Circumstance ∃hasSpatialModality.SpatialModality ∃relatum.SimpleThing</p><p>These definitions form part of the linguistic ontology's terminological component (TBox), whereas the particular semantic representations constructed (indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) are part of the assertional component (ABox) or instantial information. The non-diagrammatic notation we use for the instantial information will be introduced in Section 4.</p><p>Instantial representations, which can be derived automatically from the corresponding linguistic utterances (cf. Section 5.1), then need to be subjected to contextualization in order to reach a description of possible spatial situations. The semantic representation itself, however, only serves to constrain that interpretation by capturing the linguistic commitments entered into by the expression at hand. The area of spatial modalities in which to the left is located (LateralProjections: cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>), for example, only commits to a decomposition such as that involved in breaking some abstract space into half-planes formed with respect to a reference entity together with an imposed orientation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>). LeftProjection and RightProjection are then distinguished as two disjoint extensions of the theory of LateralProjections, anchoring further which of the halfplanes is picked out and the relationships holding between the two. In each case we have a statement of fixed semantic import, expressed as a minimal abstract spatial 'theory'. The determination of the abstract spaces involved, the necessary reference entities, and their orientation then defines the range of possible interpretative uncertainty to be resolved during contextualization. The semantic representation makes the claim that all utterances sharing such a representation will face the same kinds of uncertainty regardless of how contextualization plays itself out in each particular case. We present examples of this in Section 5.2 below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Example 2: Linguistically distinguished spatial situations</head><p>For our second example, we show in more detail how differences can be established between spatial modalities on the basis of the distinctive patterns revealed by grammatical syndromes. As a starting point, we take Talmy's suggestion that we can: ". . . start with any closed-class spatial morpheme in any language, considering the full schema that it expresses and a spatial scene that it can apply to" <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>.</p><p>Talmy illustrates this approach by drawing out the spatial schemas involved in the example: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> The board lay across the road. This is another example of a relation between a figure and a ground. As before, we can consider this as correlating semantically with a Configuration involving a located entity (the board) and a generalized location constrained by a spatial modality. Talmy suggests that the greater part of the schematic structure in this case is conveyed by the closed-class term 'across' and, like other spatial closed-class terms, this expression represents a particular schematic spatial relationship between a (particular kind of) figure and a (particular kind of) ground. The question for us, and for the definition of the spatial modality component of the linguistic ontology, is just what the nature of that particular relationship is.</p><p>Talmy's method consists of setting out 'distinguishing scenarios' that differ minimally from the scenario associated with usage of the closed-class item across in English but which nevertheless call for the use of a different closed-class item or grammatical construction. This functions as an investigative probe for revealing those features deemed essential to the meaning of 'across'. If any of the features do not hold, or hold differently, then a different linguistic expression is required. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows Talmy's results. Features (a) and (b) are taken as a starting point while features (c)-(i) are motivated by what happens linguistically when the corresponding features are violated in the distinguishing scenarios shown on the right. A similar kind of approach underlies many attempts to provide formal characterizations corresponding more closely to linguistic usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, including the development of specially tailored spatial calculi (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>).</p><p>Talmy's methodology has been employed for a range of languages, revealing both similarities and differences across the semantic features those languages construct. But the tests are not exhaustive and can result in over-commitments: that is, the particular situations described in test sentences can lead to spatial distinctions being imported that are not linguistically motivated for the terms being investigated. A consideration of grammaticized distinctions is present in Talmy's account, but only implicitly. Talmy's description for 'across' is not, for example, an account just of the term 'across'-what is actually analyzed is the entire linguistic construction where 'across' appears, involving a spatial modality ('across'), a spatially-relevant activity ('lay') and the particular entities concerned (since both 'board' and 'road' bring with them spatial</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>Features derived from appropriate or inappropriate spatial descriptions for 'across' according to Talmy <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref> G is ribbonal c.</p><p>F is linear (and generally bounded at both ends) vs.</p><p>The wall siding lay over the road. d.</p><p>The axes of F and G are roughly perpendicular vs.</p><p>The board lay along the road. e.</p><p>F is parallel to the plane of G vs.</p><p>The board is sticking out of/into the road. f.</p><p>F is adjacent to the plane of G vs.</p><p>The board lay (buried) in the road/ The board was suspended above the road. g.</p><p>F's length is at least as great as G's width vs.</p><p>The baguette lay on the road. h.</p><p>F touches both of G's edges vs.</p><p>The board lay over one edge of the road. i.</p><p>The axis of F is horizontal (the plane of G is typically, but not necessarily, horizontal)/The spear hung across the wall.</p><p>vs.</p><p>The spear hung up and down on the wall.</p><p>commitments). The description and motivation that Talmy offers of this method is then still, from our perspective, centred too narrowly on individual items rather than on what the grammatical organization and corresponding constructions as a whole commit to.</p><p>To show this more clearly we begin by noting that the semantics of 'across' as characterized by Talmy presupposes several features that are only partially due to the contribution of 'across'. As a case in point, Talmy proposes that 'across' is only appropriate due to the 'ribbonal' nature of the entity playing the role of ground: here, the road. But Talmy himself provides a further example in which the ground is not 'ribbonal' in the described sense (case (i)): <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> The spear hung across the wall. and, in fact, it is easy to find further counterexamples, such as "the bridge across the lake" which does not presuppose the form of the lake to be ribbonal. It seems more likely that the association of being 'ribbonal' is due to our world knowledge of those entities with which 'across' co-occurs, and so conceptualized information is again confused with the linguistic semantic contribution.</p><p>Within the Generalized Upper Model, we characterize the spatial semantics that appears to be involved in usages of 'across' in the intended sense by defining a particular spatial modality, that of PathRepresentingInternal. This modality constructs a 'place' by construing some path that is internal to another entity, given as the spatial modality's relatum, in the sense of 'lying within its borders'. Moreover, it is sufficient here to lie within the borders when the path is projected into the plane of the relatum rather than being strictly inside in terms of three-dimensional containment. The relatum then needs to be seen as (at least) 2-dimensional since 1-dimensional entities do not give rise to insides.</p><p>For this and similar reasons, GUM is also forced to draw a high level distinction between points (0 D) vs. lines and planes (1 to 2 D). This plays a role for the categorization of several spatial modalities, including both the present example and spatial modalities such as Distribution, which implies a complex (at least 1-dimensional) relatum. This latter modality is used in some configurations involving 'across' explicitly excluded from consideration in Talmy's example, as in the distributed meaning of 'across' in expressions such as "all across the country". In the present case, the entailed 2-dimensionality is consistent with a linguistic construal of the road as 2-dimensional. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> Putting this together, Talmy's finding that the figure needs to be one-dimensional is captured by the notion of 'path', while the ground needing to be planar is captured by the spatial modality being internal.</p><p>This contrasts with what happens when we take other spatial modalities: for example that corresponding with 'around' in phrases such as "the road around the lake". 'Around' is similar to 'across' in that some relatum is used to construct a 'path-like' place that locates the figure; however, it is also different in that the relationship is not necessarily internal to the relatum, although it might be, as seen in "He swam around the lake". As a consequence, we can only state that 'around' is PathRepresenting but the precise subcategory of PathRepresenting relevant for a particular usage is a pragmatic discourse inference made in connection with the relatum and the activity. Many prepositions (at least in English) under-commit in this way. These phenomena are captured by defining a more general category of PathRepresenting that is divided into two more specific categories, PathRepresentingInternal and PathRepresentingExternal; i.e.:</p><p>PathRepresenting ≡ PathRepresentingInternal PathRepresentingExternal Returning to our example, Talmy also suggests that some notion of adjacency must be involved since the board can be neither within the road nor somewhere above it. But this again involves several over-commitments. The observation is more appropriately accounted for by representing 'across' as committing only to the two-dimensional (topological) relationship (i.e., projecting the path into the plane of the relatum). It is then simply not possible to infer any internal relationship in the third dimension. As seen by "the bridge across the lake", the term 'across' as such can easily be used while violating adjacency and so adjacency cannot be assumed to hold. This is also brought out clearly by the many examples in which 'across' and 'over', where adjacency is clearly not entailed, are interchangeable in context:</p><p>(13) a. The shop is over/across the street.</p><p>b. The bridge goes over/across the street. c. The man walks over/across the street.</p><p>In the present example, the adjacency component is actually contributed by the meaning of 'lay' rather than 'across', again showing that it is necessary to be sensitive to the entire grammatical construction when considering interpretations. Talmy's characterization of 'across' in terms of boundaries is also problematic: it is claimed that the figure needs to touch both edges of the ground. However, unlike formal geometric or topological considerations of space and regions, language does not rely on boundaries in this strict way. Instead, what is linguistically relevant here is the notion of covering the extension of the ground functionally: the board covers the full width of the road for some purpose. This generally remains the case even if it is somewhat shorter or considerably longer than the road's extension. As soon as this sentence is set into a functional context, the exact topological relationship becomes irrelevant: a person could use the board (lying across the road) as a bridge over the muddy road even if a considerable piece was missing; this would not necessitate an expression like "the board lay over one edge of the road" (suggested by Talmy under case (h)) unless it became functionally relevant in the given context. Similarly, bridges are regularly built across rivers without touching edges or boundaries. Thus, touching the edges as such cannot be crucial to the linguistic semantics. Instead, the notion of functionally covering the full extent is the linguistically relevant characterization that needs to be captured as part of the shallow semantics of space. The concept PathRepresentingInternal represents this since it construes its path as being limited (functionally) by some entity's boundaries. In contrast, realizations of PathRepresentingExternal do not necessarily involve full coverage, since paths may follow the outward shape of an entity for a limited extent.</p><p>'Across' also appears, as Talmy points out, to convey a particular relationship between the shape of the ground and the trajectory of the figure that Talmy characterizes as perpendicularity concerning the axes (case (d)). This must also be seen functionally since it is largely inferable from what it means to get 'across' an entity at all: i.e., a connection is made between one side of the relatum and another. The notion of perpendicularity at issue here is again therefore based on functional concerns rather than geometry. Some items, for example 'through', which can also serve as a realization of PathRepresentingInternal (since some 'path-like' place is created within the specified relatum), do not relate to perpendicularity (as in 'he walked through the crowd'); other items, for example 'over', may be used in both perpendicular and non-perpendicular contexts. For example: in "the bridge leads over the street", the bridge (as figure) is functionally perpendicular to the street (as ground), whereas in "walking over the bridge", the trajectory of the path (as figure) is topologically parallel to the bridge's linear extension (as ground). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref>Many of the spatial notions that we can identify here are also related to construals of specifically constrained topological shapes for the ground. In the case of 'across', this concerns functional perpendicularity (as a notion specific to 'crossing') and coverage of the full extent (as a notion associated with the concept PathRepresentingInternal, encompassing several lexical realizations); Talmy's parallelness in the plane is also captured in this way, since adhering to the ground's topological contour is conceptualized as taking place in the plane. These properties provide further evidence for class-subclass relationships among the spatial modalities. In particular, the Generalized Upper Model makes the concept PathRepresenting a subconcept of the modality ShapeCommitting, indicating that the referent object (i.e., relatum or ground) has a determining effect for the shape of the 'place' that is constructed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PathRepresenting ShapeCommitting</head><p>This dependence can vary from a quite specific determination (as in 'following a path' where the shape of the path is entirely responsible for the shape of the place constructed) to more generic determinations, such as that involved in getting from one side of the relatum to another side (as in 'across the lake'). In the latter case, the shape is only constrained to be topologically bounded by 'opposed' sides that can be crossed between.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Conclusion</head><p>In this section, we have set out how we employ grammatical evidence in order both to motivate particular categories within our linguistic ontology and to articulate further the relationships and dependencies between these categories. We believe that the kind of approach proposed by Talmy brings out a rich collection of semantic features for consideration within an adequate semantics, but it is nevertheless striking that the restricted range of grammatical evidence that he draws upon reduces the accuracy and generality of the claims that can be made. The more semantic constraints we can motivate directly from patterns of linguistic usage, the more accurate our semantic formulation can become and the better we will be able to constrain interpretations of spatial terms according to the discourse purpose and the spatial situation.</p><p>We have argued that this requires placing spatial terms in grammatically fleshed out contexts in order to have fullest access to the grammatical evidence available. A prepositional phrase such as 'across the road' cannot be considered in isolation because alone it represents an overly impoverished source of evidence. Such abbreviated starting points invite interpreters to 'guess' intended interpretations, which is a process subject to such broad variation as to be inherently problematic; this becomes even worse if we consider, for example, individual prepositions. Bringing in grammatical sources of evidence as we propose so as to consider entire constructional contexts (e.g., the clauses through which particular usages are expressed) allows us to go further than looking at particular lexicalizations while still constraining the range of interpretations that are considered eligible. This is seen as an essential pre-condition for bringing out the similarities and differences necessary for an accurate semantics.</p><p>Although space precludes giving the same level of detail for each category we discuss in this paper, in the development of the Generalized Upper Model linguistic ontology to which we now turn, we always base distinctions on as broad a range of grammatically complete examples as possible. Moreover, since we consider it unlikely that arbitrarily constructed examples provide sufficient variation to build upon, this also moves our method further towards empirical, corpus-based studies. This is brought out subsequently as one of the main criteria for evaluation we employ in Section 6 below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The linguistically-motivated ontological structure of spatial categories and relations</head><p>We have now motivated a linguistic ontology for mediating between linguistic form and contextualized interpretation (Section 2) and sketched in what way grammatical evidence is taken as the principal guide to that linguistic ontology's content and organization (Section 3). In this section we turn to the main results, the linguistic ontology itself. In particular, we set out in detail the spatial extension we have developed for the Generalized Upper Model linguistic ontology, showing how all of the categories discussed so far fit together within a comprehensive account of the linguistic semantics of space.</p><p>The spatial extension of GUM is a formal theory axiomatized in description logic (DL <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>), a decidable fragment of first-order logic (FOL). Using DL provides a structural backbone based on the class-subclass relationship (the 'signature' of the theory) and the usual description logic possibilities for defining roles between classes and constraints on those roles' fillers. GUM's signature therefore contains categories (unary predicates), also called classes or concepts, and relations (binary predicates); specific kinds of relationships are defined as relations between classes, which are themselves organized within a relation hierarchy. 9 The GUM ontology itself is formulated in the Web Ontology Language OWL 2.0 10 and is freely available (licensed under creative commons). 11 We employ both DL and OWL primarily because this guarantees the broad technical applicability of the ontology in diverse contexts of use, including natural language processing tools and dialogue systems, where DL, and now increasingly OWL, are established standards. We do not claim that the semantics of spatial language makes particular demands on expressivity that allow that semantics to be situated within one particular class of description logic rather than another, although this would be an interesting path to explore. Moreover, as the spatial extension of GUM is intended for use within running dialogue systems, our aim has been to keep the ontology within a decidable logic as far as possible. The classes making up the class-subclass backbone and the roles defined over these classes are motivated throughout by distinguishable grammatical syndromes of the kind suggested in the previous sections. Standing 'behind' the concepts of the spatial extension backbone, we envisage modular 'spatial theories', represented as formal specifications, that capture the minimal semantic commitments entered into by each class (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref> and Section 5.2); in this section, however, we focus on the backbone.</p><p>The most general distinctions within the GUM concept hierarchy partition the top node, GUMThing, into three basic subcategories: Configuration, Element and MultiConfiguration. These categories represent three distinct scales of semantic complexity for entities, related in various ways to one another as we shall see below. A Configuration in GUM is, as described informally above, the semantic correlate of some activity or state of affairs, i.e., some representation of experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The semantics of simple clauses therefore corresponds, in general, to Configurations and the description offered by GUM is most closely related to event-based representations in linguistics drawing on a Neo-Davidsonian linguistic semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Combinations of clauses correspond to MultiConfigurations-these are specified as semantic dependency structures holding over configurations.</p><p>Subtypes of Configurations define distinctive sets of relations which typically take Elements as their fillers. These relations then capture the different ways in which Elements can participate in events, activities, or states. Exactly one of those elements has to stand in the relation processInConfiguration and is restricted to be a particular subtype of Element called a Process. Processes are most commonly expressed linguistically by verbal groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Further participants in the state of affairs are related in configuration-specific ways to the Configuration as a whole and define those semantic elements which are necessarily entailed by the kind of configuration occurring: e.g., a 'running' state of affairs can only exist together with something that 'runs', etc. Additional information concerning when, where, how, or under which conditions some state of affairs occurs is provided by a further subtype of Element called Circumstance, related to the configuration by a small 9 Throughout this paper we use 'category', 'concept', 'class', 'type', etc. as synonyms, reflecting the fact that several different traditions are being combined in the discussion and DLs do not distinguish these formally in any case; similarly for 'relation', 'role', 'feature', 'property', 'attribute', etc. 10 http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax. 11 http://www.ontospace.uni-bremen.de/ontology/stable/GUM-3-space.owl.

Dotted lines indicate further subconcepts, the namespace "g" indicates that the concept is defined in the core GUM ontology, while terms without a namespace are defined in the spatial extension. number of configuration-independent relations. The basic definition of a Configuration, given again in standard Description Logic notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, is then: (14) Configuration ≡ GUMThing ∃processInConfiguration.Process i.e., any configuration is a subclass of GUMThing and necessarily has a role processInConfiguration filled by a Process. In addition, subclasses of configurations define further participantInConfiguration and circumstanceInConfiguration relations, filled by SimpleThings and Circumstances respectively; we omit a formal specification here. These distinctions are, as always, demanded by distinctions made linguistically: semantic participants often correlate with obligatory grammatical elements, and circumstances with optional ones (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>). Both of them, however, can be expressed by nominal groups, adverbial groups and prepositional phrases.</p><p>Within English, German, and many other languages there is strong evidence for several immediate subcategories of Configuration (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>). Within GUM we adopt the following three disjoint Configuration subconcepts: BeingAndHaving, DoingAndHappening, and SayingAndSensing. BeingAndHaving configurations describe statements of existence and static relations between participants, DoingAndHappening configurations describe intentional actions and non-intentional happenings, and SayingAndSensing configurations represent cognitive and verbal acts. As we are addressing the linguistic-ontological structure of spatial language here, we will focus on those configurations, elements, and relations involved in the representation of spatial semantics. The first few steps in the configuration sub-hierarchy leading down to spatially-relevant categories are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Again, these broad configuration classes are all distinguished by differing grammatical behavior. As noted above, we will not always have the space to present this grammatical evidence explicitly and so it is important to recall that no distinctions are introduced into GUM without linguistic grounding regardless of whether we explicitly show that grounding here. Moreover, although we sometimes employ simplified constructed examples to illustrate concepts, our main evidence is naturally occurring corpus or experimental data. All of the distinctions are therefore motivated from linguistic phenomena as set out in the discussion of the previous sections.</p><p>We have already seen one particular case of a Configuration that involved spatial semantics: both the main examples of Section 3, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, were assigned to the semantic class SpatialLocating. The position of this class in relation to other GUM configurations can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, where we see several further subconcepts lying between SpatialLocating and Configuration; we describe those that are spatially relevant below. Several other branches in the Configuration hierarchy also contain spatially-relevant configurations; alongside SpatialLocating two other configurations are particularly relevant:</p><p>(i) NonAffectingSpatialDoing: dynamic spatial configurations, in which an entity is changing its relative position (such as motion or orientation); (ii) AffectingSpatialDoing: dynamic spatial configurations, in which an entity affects the relative position of another entity (such as motion or orientation).</p><p>These are both subconcepts of the main configuration type DoingAndHappening and so correlate with very different grammatical phenomena to those of the concept SpatialLocating, a subconcept of the main class BeingAndHaving.</p><p>The inter-connections between these distinct types of configurations and the many subclasses of spatial modalities will become quite detailed as we proceed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> therefore gives a graphic representation of the general structure of types of classes and relations in GUM relevant for specifying the semantics of spatial language as a road map of what is to come. In this style of representation, adopted from the documentation of the DOLCE foundational ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>, classes are represented as boxes and class-subclass relationships are shown by spatial inclusion (i.e., boxes within boxes). The relations between classes are indicated by directed gray arrows. Taking the lowest two relations in the center of the figure, for example, we can read off the diagram that the relation actor is a relation between a SimpleThing (which is a subclass of Element) and DoingAndHappening (which is a subclass of Configuration), while actee is a relation between SimpleThing and AffectingAction (which is one of the two main subclasses of DoingAndHappening). We refer back to this diagram at many points in the discussion below.</p><p>Our overview of the GUM linguistic ontology is structured as follows. First we provide a more complete description of the SpatialLocating configurations that we have seen and used in our examples above (Section 4.1). Then we look at non- affecting and affecting dynamic configurations (Sections 4.2 and 4.3 respectively). Following this, we set out the distinct kinds of spatial elements used in these configurations, namely: GeneralizedLocation and an extended kind of 'place', called a GeneralizedRoute (Section 4.4), then the SpatialModalities themselves (Section 4.5), and finally those SimpleThings that exhibit particularly spatial aspects (Section 4.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Static spatial configurations and their elements</head><p>In English, German, and many other languages, there is a broad class of clausal constructions distinguished by distinctive syndromes of grammatical properties that may be termed 'relational' (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>). These bring together entities and attributes of those entities. In regular, non-spatial relational expressions, such as "The book is old", attributes (e.g., "old") are assigned to entities (e.g., "book") by the GUM configuration of Relating, a subconcept of BeingAndHaving. Within the Relating configuration and all its subtypes, the entity and the attributes are distinguished by differing relations: the GUM relation hierarchy specifies the relation domain for the entity and the relation attribute for the attribute.</p><p>Proceeding downward in the configuration hierarchy below Relating (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) is the concept Circumstantial; configurations of this type relate an entity to some attribute of cause, reason, purpose, or other circumstance-like attribute, including those involving space and time. For these latter circumstances, we have a further particular subtype of Circumstantial, a GeneralizedLocating. For configurations of this type, the required relation domain is further specified in the relation hierarchy to be the subrelation locatum, corresponding as we have seen above to the 'located entity'.</p><p>GeneralizedLocatings cover both spatial and temporal locatings. A configuration defining only a spatial relation is then a SpatialLocating, while a configuration defining only a temporal relation is a TemporalLocating. Focusing on the SpatialLocating case, the inherited attribute relation is further specified to be a placement relation; this allows the configuration to specify the place where the entity is being positioned; we showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> above how this configuration is structured internally. The filler of the placement is in fact restricted to be one of two subtypes of Element, however: either it is a GeneralizedLocation, as seen in our first examples, or it is a GeneralizedRoute. We describe GeneralizedRoutes in more detail below; for the present we note that it is equally possible to specify a place in terms of a single location ("the dog is in the park") and as an 'extended' place ("the road runs from Bremen to Hamburg"). The grammatical behavior of the clause construction in this latter case is far closer to the first example than it is to a motion event and so we capture this within GUM by allocating them to the same configuration, i.e., a SpatialLocating; the internal behavior of places and routes is, however, different and so they are distinguished within GUM. GeneralizedRoutes may specify start, intermediate, and end points of the 'route' <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and that route may then be specified by both actions and attributions of spatial extent. Jackendoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> and others propose that humans distinguish conceptually as well as linguistically between places and paths and the GeneralizedLocation vs. GeneralizedRoute distinction reflects this. We gave a preliminary definition of SpatialLocating in (9) in Section 3 above; now we refine the definition to fit with the GUM hierarchy in full: <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> SpatialLocating ≡ Circumstantial ∃locatum.SimpleThing ∃placement.(GeneralizedLocation GeneralizedRoute)</p><p>The definition we gave for GeneralizedLocation (10) is unchanged; we repeat it here for ease of reference:</p><p>GeneralizedLocation ≡ Circumstance ∃hasSpatialModality.SpatialModality ∃relatum.SimpleThing</p><p>As observed above, although the relatum relation is necessarily present, it is often left unspecified in natural discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref> and so must be filled in during contextualization.</p><p>The GeneralizedLocation binds together a relatum and a spatial relationship within a single structured entity that may stand in a placement relation within a spatial configuration. An encapsulation of this kind has been argued better to support compositionality (cf., e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">168]</ref>) and also allows various combinations of multiple locations to be expressed within single configurations, as in the example "The plant is in the corner, by the window, next to the chair", in which one SpatialLocating defines three placements. This becomes even more important when, as described below, placements are modified by expressing spatial perspectives, spatial accessibility, as well as extensions or enhancements of the spatial relation. For example, the utterance "The plant is to the front left of the chair, right here in the corner" combines two relations (front and left) with respect to one relatum (the chair), while "in the corner" is enhanced with possible access information "right here". Modifications contained within single encapsulated 'places' are easier to track when they are re-used across spatial placements in a dialogue <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. This is a further motivation for defining GeneralizedLocations so that they retain their structure independently of the configurations in which they are used. Thus we find the 'same' GeneralizedLocation at work in the configurations corresponding to "he goes to the right of the chair" (dynamic spatial configuration) and "he is standing to the right of the chair" (static spatial configuration)-the difference being captured, as we will see below, in terms of two distinct modes of participation in their configurations: i.e., direction (cf. ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>)) and placement (cf. ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)) respectively. We can also now combine these definitions and show how particular spatial statements are represented. For this we adopt a further standard notation used for description logic assertional, or instance information, that of the Manchester syntax for OWL 2.0.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">12</ref> Using the classes and relations defined within GUM, the clause "The USB drive is on the table" receives the semantics shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, consisting of two related instances, or 'individuals'. All instance names (shown in slanted font) appearing here and in similar expressions used in this paper are to be read strictly as placeholders or semantic variables-that is, they do not indicate any hidden lexical or syntactic information; we will also regularly omit non-spatial information. Although we will return to this point again in Section 5.1 below, it is nevertheless worth emphasizing here that this kind of assertional specification is generally to be derived automatically using computational analysis grammars, drawing on the close connection between linguistic forms and semantic specification guaranteed by our reliance on grammatical syndromes when constructing the ontology in the first place. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">13</ref>Finally, spatial location descriptions can also occur together with temporal specifications. This may happen in two ways: either both pieces of information are linguistically presented as equal, or the temporal information is added to the spatial location information. As an example of the former case, the sentence "The meeting is in the city center at eight o'clock" can be split linguistically into spatial and temporal components, as in "The meeting is in the city center and the meeting is at eight o'clock". Therefore, the spatial and the temporal entities are of equal status and the sentence is a realization of the configuration SpatialTemporalLocating (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). An example of the latter case is: "He was in the city center at eight o'clock"; this sentence cannot be split into "*He was in the city center and he was at eight o'clock", showing grammatically that the temporal component depends on, or further modifies, the attribution of spatial information. This sentence is then a straightforward realization of SpatialLocating with additional circumstantial temporal information.</p><p>The two sentences also differ with respect to the kind of entity being talked about, i.e., that which fills the locatum relation inherited from GeneralizedLocating. In a SpatialTemporalLocating, the locatum must be an event; whereas a SpatialLocating does not require any specific kind of locatum, i.e., it may be a person, an object, an event, etc. This distinction reflects the syndrome that events are linguistically construed as spatiotemporal entities; they can be referred to either in terms of their spatial or in terms of their temporal attributes. Persons and objects also exist in time and space, but English and German do not construe them temporally: "*He was on Monday."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Non-affecting dynamic spatial configurations and their elements</head><p>With actions or events such as "I ran" or "the ball rolled" either the state of affairs is construed linguistically as an actor intentionally performing an action or as an unintentional event occurring. Such configurations are often expressed by intransitive verbs or, if transitive, the object is not affected or created by the action or event but serves instead to restrict or further define the type of action in question-as in "I play tennis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. Within GUM, such configurations are specified as NonAffectingActions, a subconcept of DoingAndHappening (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). These require one additional obligatory participant, the actor, for the entity who performs the action or who initiates the event; the respective dependencies can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. NonAffectingActions are themselves subdivided into configurations that represent either actions or events. Configurations representing actions have one spatially relevant subconcept, NonAffectingSpatialDoing, in which an actor performs a spatial action. Such actions may be associated with spatial direction terms that express a particular orientation or movement in a specific direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. Accordingly, there are two subclasses of this concept: (i) NonAffectingOrienting, which defines a spatially oriented relation of the actor, for instance "We are facing the table". Here we have a GeneralizedLocation as usual, but in this case it fills the configuration-specific relation orientationDirection. (ii) NonAffectingMotion, which defines a spatial movement of the actor, for instance "He is walking towards the table".</p><p>Movements are the more complex of the two and can be expressed by directed motions, re-orientations, or under-specified movements of the actor. The category NonAffectingMotion is accordingly divided into three subclasses: (17) NonAffectingMotion ≡ NonAffectingDirectedMotion NonAffectingOrientationChange</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NonAffectingSimpleMotion</head><p>In NonAffectingDirectedMotions, the direction of motion can be expressed in different ways. For example, if a direction is specified without a specific goal, the direction depends only on the actor, as in "He walks forward" or "He goes upward". The GeneralizedLocations here fill a configuration-specific relation motionDirection and cannot freely define an additional relatum; it is the position of the actor which determines the interpretations possible for 'forward', 'upward', etc. Alternatively, if the direction is expressed with specific entities, as in 'along the road', the configuration defines the relation route. The definition of NonAffectingDirectedMotion is then as follows: (18) NonAffectingDirectedMotion ≡ NonAffectingMotion (∃direction.GeneralizedLocation ∃route.GeneralizedRoute)</p><p>GeneralizedRoutes can define the relations source, pathPlacement, pathIndication, and destination for their route components, and these in turn are filled by GeneralizedLocations; we will see the definition in detail below. The instantial semantics shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> gives an example of a specification that defines the start and end point of a route in a NonAffectingDirectedMotion. This is the GUM specification corresponding to the expression "The deer ran from the hill to the stream." Motions that do not involve a change of location but only a change of orientation are specified by the configuration NonAffectingOrientationChange. The direction of the orientation is defined by the relation orientationDirection, which can be expressed by a directional term, such as "The wheel rotates to the right", or by a reference object together with a spatial relation, such as "He curves toward the jars". NonAffectingOrientationChanges can also define sources and destinations, given by a route, in which case the direction can be expressed with several segments, such as "turn from the kitchen (90 • to the left) to the office". Here both the GeneralizedLocations "from the kitchen" and "to the office" are defined as the source and destination in a GeneralizedRoute since they can also indicate start and end points of a directed motion; intermediate places within a turn, however, appear to be rare. The resulting definition is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. The third category, NonAffectingMotion, does not express an orientation or direction but a particular kind of spatial motion. Examples for this category are "He is wiggling up and down" or "He is dancing around". The relation placement is then specified for the places expressing where the action takes place; e.g. "He is dancing around in the street".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Affecting dynamic spatial configurations</head><p>In expressions of actions or events such as "They are assembling the engine" or "The drink was placed on the table before him", an actor either creates or affects an entity. In GUM, such expressions are represented by the configuration AffectingAction, a further subconcept of DoingAndHappening. It inherits the relation actor for the actor and defines the additional relation actee for the affected entity (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>); i.e.: <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> AffectingAction ≡ DoingAndHappening ∃actee.SimpleThing AffectingActions either create an entity that did not exist before the action, represented by the subconcept CreativeMaterial-Action, or they affect (for instance change, manipulate, or destroy) an entity that is construed as existing, represented by the subconcept DispositiveMaterialAction (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>).</p><p>For the GUM spatial extension, a necessary subconcept of DispositiveMaterialAction is AffectingSpatialAction, a configuration that defines an action in which an entity is spatially affected by an actor. In general, the actor changes the location or orientation of the actee. Similarly to NonAffectingSpatialDoing, AffectingSpatialAction has two subconcepts, i.e., AffectingOrienting and AffectingMotion (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Apart from defining the relation actee, their definitions correspond to those of non-affecting orienting and motion configurations respectively. This correspondence also holds for the subconcepts of AffectingMotion, yielding the corresponding subconcepts: AffectingDirectedMotion, AffectingOrientationChange and AffectingSimpleMotion. An example of an AffectingDirectedMotion, "He puts the USB drive on the table", is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>; here, the "USB drive" is the actee spatially manipulated by the actor. The actor in AffectingSpatialActions may also remain unspecified in the linguistic form. This often occurs in passive constructions, such as "The cupboard was moved to the wall", or in 'middle' constructions, such as "The cupboard goes over there".</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Spatial elements I: GeneralizedLocation and GeneralizedRoute</head><p>Although static and dynamic descriptions clearly exhibit some fundamental conceptual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>, the way in which language construes static and dynamic situations shows many points of overlap. In English for example, it is not possible without further grammatical context to state whether 'across the street' is static or dynamic. Static contexts involve a figure and a ground construed linguistically as two currently immobile entities that are spatially related to one another in a particular way defined by the spatial modality. Dynamic contexts may involve the same spatial schema but in these cases the figure is not an immobile entity but rather the trajectory covered by some entity. There are also intermediate forms in which the entities involved are static, yet there is an entailed trajectory that licenses the spatial term, as in "The shop across the road", which is motivated by the necessity of crossing the road in order to reach the shop.</p><p>In all these cases, it is the grammatical syndromes of the clauses as a whole that provide distinguishing information. GUM therefore represents, as mentioned above, elements that can occur in both static and dynamic configurations in the same way. Dynamic descriptions can, however, give more spatial information than static descriptions: for example, they can specify a path, a starting point or an end point of an action. Our formalization reflects this, first, by distinguishing GeneralizedLocations from GeneralizedRoutes as indicated above and, second, by providing more attributes for dynamic configurations than for static configurations.</p><p>As already shown, GeneralizedLocations describe relative positions of entities and fill a variety of relations, such as a placement of a static location, a direction of a directed movement, an orientationDirection of an orientation change motion, or a motionDirection in a directed motion. They are also used to specify parts of a route, resulting in the following definition for the category GeneralizedRoute:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(23) GeneralizedRoute ≡ Circumstance (=1 source.GeneralizedLocation =1 destination.GeneralizedLocation 1 pathPlacement.GeneralizedPathLocation 1 pathIndication.GeneralizedPathLocation)</formula><p>source and destination specify the start or end point of the movement, while the relations pathPlacement and pathIndication specify intermediate points. These relations are each filled by a GeneralizedPathLocation, a further subconcept of GeneralizedLocation that adds in the possibility of building up chains of connected locations serving as route segments.</p><p>Placements and indications of paths are distinguished according to the way the path is described. A pathPlacement is defined when the relatum is linguistically construed in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions and locates the path itself; examples of path placements are "along the river", "down the corridor" or "through the tunnel". A pathIndication is defined when the relatum is linguistically construed in zero dimensions and gives a single point constraining where the path may lie; examples of path indications are "by the tree", "past the fence", etc. When a GeneralizedRoute is related to an orientation change configuration, however, neither pathIndication nor pathPlacement can be defined; this reflects the effects of the distinctions in the dimensionality of entities discussed in previous sections.</p><p>The instantial semantics shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> gives an example of a more complex specification combining locations and generalized routes. This extends the example given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> above, showing the GUM specification corresponding to the expression "The deer ran from the hill down the road by the old tree to the stream."<ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">14</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>  Whereas the route parts in this example co-describe the route given, it is also possible to construct a route out of a sequence of route segments so that one segment is understood to follow another. The grammatical evidence for these distinctions is complex and builds on the differing ordering possibilities and preposition choices available for the distinct types. An example of such an expression is "along the river, over the bridge, past the fence and down the road". Here, the whole path is represented by a GeneralizedRoute, specifying the first placement "along the river" by a pathPlacement filled by a GeneralizedPathLocation. This element then defines not only the spatial modality ("along") and the relatum ("the river") but also a further relation nextPathPlacement, which is itself filled by another GeneralizedPathLocation representing "over the bridge". GeneralizedPathLocations not only inherit the relations hasSpatialModality and relatum from GeneralizedLocation, but also specify a successor relationship for positioning route segments within an ordered list of pathPlacements or pathIndications. Two successor relations are distinguished for this: nextPathPlacement and nextPathIndication, according to the type of route segment following. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">15</ref>One last subconcept of GeneralizedLocation is GeneralizedComplexLocation. This element represents a location requiring a particular kind of 'complex' relatum for constructing a place. Such complex entities either consist of more than one element, i.e., they are linguistically expressed as plurals, for instance "He went between the objects", or are themselves subconcepts of the GUM category DecomposableObject, for instance "He stood among the crowd". GeneralizedComplexLocations can, as with all GeneralizedLocations, be used in both static or dynamic spatial configurations but select particular spatial modalities: in particular, subclasses of the spatial modality Distribution (see Section 4.5).</p><p>Finally, all GeneralizedLocations may additionally specify the following relations:</p><p>accessibility, when some kind of specific access between the locatum or actor/actee and the GeneralizedLocation is expressed; this accessibility might be high or low, as in "I am here" vs. "I am there". reciprocality, when a spatial reciprocal relationship between the locatum or actor/actee and the relatum holds; an example of such a relationship is "The cups are beside each other". -spatialPerspective, when a spatial perspective is expressed for a spatial configuration, e.g., "The desk is to the right from my point of view" or "Seen from above the helicopters move to the left".</p><p>The distinct kinds of locations and routes defined in GUM are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Spatial elements II: SpatialModality</head><p>As we have motivated and illustrated in previous sections, the core of the GUM treatment of spatial relations is provided by the internal organization and subconcepts of the concept SpatialModality. This is the part of the linguistic ontology that corresponds to the type of relationship being described in any linguistic spatial description, typically expressed grammatically by a spatial preposition, an adverb, an adjective, a part of the verb, or as entailed by the lexical semantics of the verb. SpatialModality fills the hasSpatialModality relation in GeneralizedLocations and specifies the type of spatial relationship to be construed between a locatum and a relatum in a static configuration, or between an actor/actee and a relatum in a dynamic configuration. An overview of the subconcepts of SpatialModality is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>.</p><p>The most general distinction is whether the modality constructs distance between entities (SpatialDistanceModality), functional dependencies between entities (FunctionalSpatialModality), or positions between entities relative to each other (RelativeSpatialModality): (25) SpatialModality ≡ SpatialDistanceModality FunctionalSpatialModality RelativeSpatialModality This disjunction is not exclusive; spatial modalities may fall under several of the main categories, as described below. Different spatial modalities can also be combined by extension (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>)-for instance "left" extends "front" in the expression "it is to the front left of him".</p><p>Spatial modalities can also be modified in order to give a more explicit description of the relationship between entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref>. Such modifications are often used in order to describe the placement or the motion more precisely. The following modifications are specified in GUM:</p><p>-Qualitative or quantitative spatial information enhances spatial modalities, for instance "diagonally" enhances "left" in the expression "The TV is diagonally to the left"; in this case the SpatialModality defines the relation hasEnhancement, filled by QualitativeSpatialTemporal or QuantitativeSpatialTemporal entities. -Spatial modalities can also be modified by extreme positions, which can be expressed with respect to a specific distance or axis. They are usually expressed by superlatives, such as "the leftmost" or "the furthest left" for extreme axis and "the closest" or "the farthest" for extreme distance information. For these, SpatialModality defines the relations extremePositionOnAxis or extremeDistancePosition. -Angles and distances can be combined with spatial modalities, specified by the relations qualitativeAngleExtent, quantitativeAngleExtent for angle information and qualitativeDistanceExtent or quantitativeDistanceExtent for distance information. Angles and distances can either be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively and the respective relations are subsumed under qualitativeSpatialExtent and quantitativeSpatialExtent. Examples are "They turn around 180 • " (quantitativeAngleExtent), "Turn a bit further to your right" (qualitativeAngleExtent), "He moves a bit further forward" (qualitativeDistanceExtent) and "They go three steps left" (quantitativeDistanceExtent). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">16</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1.">Spatial relationships about distance</head><p>A SpatialDistanceModality subsumes expressions about spatial distances between entities. Examples of this concept are "The plant is 10 meters away from the robot", "The plant is far away from the robot" or "The plant is by the window". Such expressions either embody the distance relation between entities by specifying a quantitative measure ("10 meters") or a qualitative measure that either suggests a long distance ("far away from") or a short distance ("by"). The corresponding subconcepts of SpatialDistanceModality are therefore QuantitativeDistance and QualitativeDistance; the latter concept then has the two further subcategories Distal and Proximal.</p><p>Other, not directly distance-related expressions can imply a certain amount of space between entities too: NonProjection- Axial, also a subclass of Disjointness, captures this distance information. This category specifies expressions that indicate a (relative or absolute) direction according to a specific axis without presupposing a viewpoint-based projective relationship. NonProjectionAxial subsumes the concepts HeightNonProjectionAxial, which refers to expressions construing perpendicular positions, such as "It is deep down", and RelativeNonProjectionAxial, which refers to relative directions such as "They're beyond the dining room table". Moreover, all relationships referring to external projections and external representation of pathways (see below) necessarily imply distance between the locatum/actor and relatum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2.">Spatial relationships about functional aspects</head><p>A FunctionalSpatialModality subsumes expressions about spatial-functional relations between entities. The functions concern accessibility, motion control, support and containment or their opposites, as described by Coventry, Carlson, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Expressions of this kind of spatial-functional relation mostly go together with distance or relative information between entities. In GUM, FunctionalSpatialModality has the subconcepts Access, Control and DenialOfFunctionalControl.</p><p>Access represents relations implying that an entity is physically accessible from another entity, possibly for some 'purpose' as intended by this entity (cf. Pustejovsky's 'telicity' field in lexical qualia structure: <ref type="bibr">[133, p. 331]</ref>). One of its subclasses is Sequential, which reflects spatial relationships that rely on countable or temporal aspects, as in the example "The library is after the shops" where the relationship between locatum and relatum is reflected by a sequential dependency, i.e., it takes a certain amount of time to move to the placement ("library"). Control represents relations holding between two spatial entities such that one entity controls the position of another entity in space: i.e., if the first entity moves, then the second moves as well. However, the entities do not necessarily have physical contact with each other. Subconcepts of Control are Support and Containment. Support indicates that the control of one entity is caused by an external (though not necessarily physical) contact between the entities, for instance by the presence of gravity (e.g. "The USB drive is on the table"). Containment indicates that the control is caused by (functional) containment (e.g. "The USB drive is in the bag"). DenialOfFunctionalControl represents relations implying that no spatial-functional relation or contact exists between the entities (e.g. "The USB drive is outside the room", "The lion is out of the cage").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.3.">Spatial relationships about relative aspects of entities</head><p>RelativeSpatialModality subsumes expressions about relative spatial relationships between entities. Such expressions imply the involvement of spatial axes (ProjectionRelation), the topological layout between entities (such as Parthood, Connection and Disjointness), restrictions to complex relata (Distribution), or specific kinds of shapes of entities (ShapeCommitting).</p><p>ProjectionRelations are divided along the natural three-dimensional spatial axes, i.e., language constructs horizontal (namely lateral and frontal) and vertical directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">162]</ref>. Projective spatial modalities in GUM are accordingly HorizontalProjection, with subconcepts FrontalProjection and LateralProjection, and VerticalProjection. FrontalProjection is further subdivided into BackProjection and FrontProjection, corresponding to expressions such as "The board is behind/in front of the sofa", LateralProjection is subdivided into LeftProjection and RightProjection, corresponding to expressions such as "The board is to the left/right of the sofa". The modality VerticalProjection distinguishes between AboveProjection and BelowProjection, such as "Birds are flying above/below the clouds", and UnderProjectionExternal and OverProjectionExternal, such as "Birds are flying over/under the clouds"; these concepts are then further differentiated according to their functional commitments <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>The most specific projective concepts LeftProjection, RightProjection, FrontProjection, BackProjection, AboveProjection, and BelowProjection are also cross-classified according to whether they indicate external or internal relationships between entities with respect to topological positions. For example, FrontProjection can cover both 'in front of the car' (external) and 'in the front of the car' (internal). External projective modalities are additionally subsumed under Disjointness and Proximal, while internal projective modalities are additionally subsumed under spatial Parthood.</p><p>The spatial modality DirectionalRelation covers expressions concerning spatial directions; in many cases these fill source and destination relations. The concept subsumes the two subconcepts GeneralDirectional, subdivided into GeneralDirectional-Distancing and GeneralDirectionalNearing, and SpecificDirectional, representing spatial relations that define directions between entities independently of additional references (e.g. "out of the house") or depending on additional references, respectively. Such additional references are, for instance, geographic information, as specified by the CardinalDirectional categories and the TopographicDirectional category <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. Arbitrary directions (e.g., "to and fro") are specified by MultipleDirectional, while clock directionals (e.g., "The fridge is at three o'clock") are specified by ArcDirectional. Different languages tend to construct this semantic area rather differently, most traditionally using conventionalized topographical landmarks, such as 'uphill'/'downhill', 'towards the sea'/'away from the sea', etc. <ref type="bibr">[110, p. 148]</ref>.</p><p>As remarked above, some spatial relations require their relata to consist of either a complex object or multiple objects. Linguistically, the relatum then appears either expressed in the plural or as a collective term. These kinds of spatial relations are covered by the modality Distribution. Examples are "It is in the middle of the boxes" (plural) and "He stood among the crowd" (collective). Collective terms are often associated with the GUM element DecomposableObject, i.e., a concept made up of different identifiable parts.</p><p>Spatial locations that construe specific parts of their relata are defined by the concepts Peripheral and Central, both subconcepts of spatial Parthood. They construct positions in the middle or at the edge of places, such as "The deer is in the middle of the field" (Central); this example is again an illustration that the distinctions made in GUM are not based on lexical entries but rest instead on grammatical distinctions. The phrase "in the middle of" can be an instantiation of Central as well as Distribution.</p><p>Finally, ShapeCommitting refers to expressions in which the relatum is restricted to a specific shape as discussed in Section 3. There are two subconcepts: PathRepresenting and Surrounding. PathRepresenting defines spatial relations that depend on the shape or the surface of a relatum that expands in at least one dimension; the locatum's position is then described with respect to this shape, or the actor moves along this shape. The concept Surrounding defines spatial relations between entities in which the relata are located somewhere around the locatum or actor. An example of such an expression is "Hedges enclosed the flower beds". Surrounding is also a subconcept of Access.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Spatial elements III: SimpleThings</head><p>The entities that may fill relations referring to participants in a spatial relationship, such as locatum, actor, actee, and relatum, are generally instances of the element SimpleThing. This element represents entities constructed by language as things, and so are generally expressed linguistically by nominal phrases. They can be abstract or concrete, mental or physical, decomposable or non-decomposable, conscious or non-conscious, all of which are subconcepts of SimpleThing. SimpleThings also subsume those elements occurring in spatial modifications, such as QualitativeSpatialTemporal and QuantitativeSpatialTemporal (cf. Section 4.5). These represent qualitative or quantitative spatial (or temporal) information for a spatial modality, such as the qualitative modification "slightly" in "turn slightly to the right", or the quantitative information "45 • " in "turn 45 • to the right". They are connected with the spatial modality by filling the relation spatialExtent. Moreover, as seen in Section 3, the particular combination of spatial modalities and types of entities can itself bring further constraints on those entities' spatial construal (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>).</p><p>Certain other thing-like entities also make specifically spatial commitments that require modeling in a way that appropriately captures their interaction with the spatial modalities they are used with. These are often carried by groups of individual lexical items and so lie at the very edge of what we include within GUM-although there is also usually grammatical evidence to be found from the particular constructions within which they appear. We illustrate three distinct kinds of such classes here.</p><p>First, most lexical items for physical objects bring with them commitments concerning the relative extent of their dimensionalities, as described in considerable detail by Lang (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>): this is used to motivate distinctive usage patterns such as 'the height of the man' vs. 'the length of the shadow'.</p><p>Although not yet present in GUM, an account such as Lang's would clearly be a useful and appropriate extension. Second, there is a further set of lexical items that may be beneficially described as nominalizations of spatial modalities, quite analogously to nominalizations of other categories, typically configurations, which are already covered in our generation grammars (cf. Section 5.1). Examples of these kinds of entities include spatial 'parts', such as interior, top, bottom, edge, center, border and so on. Considering these as nominalizations allows them to share the semantic accounts given for their respective spatial modalities and to avoid additional separate treatments within GUM itself. Third, there are also kinds of spatial 'features', such as bump, hole, corner and so on. These are strongly shape committing, although the particular shapes committed to are quite varied as is usual when we move towards the open-class, lexical end of linguistic information.</p><p>Both these latter types of spatial terms can be refined further for particular domains of application: for example, coast is a specifically geographic kind of edge, and mountain might be seen as a specifically geographic kind of 'bump'. Finer classifications of these kinds of entities remain for the future: it will be particularly interesting to compare existing proposals for classificatory features with those predicted from the spatial modalities hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Conclusion</head><p>In this section we have presented the organization and main concepts and roles of our spatial extension for the Generalized Upper Model. As we shall see in the evaluation in Section 6, these possibilities cover a substantial proportion of the spatial expressions found in our test corpora, although there is still need for extension and comparison with the situation for other languages (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">153,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">155]</ref>). At the present time the GUM ontology as a whole consists of 270 concepts and 110 relations. Of this total, the spatial fragment as described here contributes 98 concepts (36%) and 28 relations (25%), thus forming a significant extension in scope and detail over the original GUM.</p><p>The spatial extension has had little effect on the DL expressivity of GUM. The core ontology of GUM is formalized in ALCHN , i.e., its logic allows role hierarchy (H), cardinality restrictions (N ), and ALC-related operators (namely atomic negation, universal restrictions, concept intersection, limited existential quantification, and class complements). The spatial fragment is slightly more expressive than this core part by virtue of introducing data valued roles (also called datatype properties in OWL) and qualified cardinality restrictions: for instance, the spatial extension defines a relation reciprocalRelation with a boolean data range, which specifies whether a spatial relation is reciprocal; furthermore, the ranges of some of GUM's spatial roles are not defined by subclasses of Thing, such as the role orientationRoute, which is filled with an instance of GeneralizedRoute that cannot define a pathPlacement or a pathIndication. As a consequence, the spatial extension of GUM is expressed in the logic ALCHQ(D) and remains, as we shall see in the next section, a broad practical linguistic ontology appropriate for a range of natural language processing tasks. The ontology as a whole has been validated as a formally consistent specification; this follows relatively straightforwardly from the fact that GUM contains virtually no cases of negation and so the resulting description is more or less guaranteed to be formally consistent. This has been verified for the current version using Protégé <ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">17</ref> with the Pellet DL reasoner. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_14">18</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Application and use of the GUM spatial extension</head><p>We have now set out in some detail the categories we propose for a linguistic ontology of space and their interrelationships. The question now arises as to how we can assess and evaluate this proposal's applicability and adequacy. In this section, we address this issue from the perspective of use of the ontology. We will consider how the ontology can be beneficial for applications and how it contributes to the construction of semantic interpretations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Context of use</head><p>In our own work on spatial language, we employ GUM and its spatial extension as the semantic layer in a complete natural language dialogue system enabling interaction both with autonomous robots and with spatial assistance systems providing way-finding or navigation services (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">139,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138]</ref>). For the purposes of the present paper, we can regard the architecture of the system as fairly traditional: speech or written input is passed on to an analysis component that produces semantic representations, these semantic representations are related both to contextual information and to the current state of the dialogue, certain problem-solving tasks are triggered (e.g., finding routes, locating services, etc.), and the results are converted back into a semantic representation, which is then passed back through a generation component to produce either spoken or written output. The problem-solving components of our system represent domain knowledge using ontologies expressed in description logic and perform their tasks using the well-known description logic reasoners Pellet <ref type="foot" target="#foot_15">19</ref> and Racer,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_16">20</ref> some application-specific implementations of navigation and route-finding algorithms, as well as further dedicated spatial reasoners.</p><p>The role of GUM in this environment is to support natural language interaction by defining the semantic types and constraints that hold at the semantic level of analysis: instantial information of the type used for illustration in the previous section is produced by the analysis component and triggers contextualization. However, in contrast to many systems where contextualization is seen as a process of further specification filling in the underspecified semantics derived from the input <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88]</ref>, with GUM we allow for a much broader range of 'inter-ontology' alignments between the linguistic ontology (and instantial information with respect to that ontology) and the ontologies of the application (and instantial data with respect to these). It is in this latter approach to contextualization that much of the flexibility of natural spatial language usage is achieved.</p><p>Our automatic generation component, taking semantic specifications formulated in terms of GUM to surface strings, follows the long established techniques for using the Penman Upper Model in natural language generation (cf. Section 2.3 above), relying on broad coverage systemic-functional generation grammars for English and German <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. More interesting for the current paper, however, is the approach we take to analysis, since (a) an Upper Model-based semantics has not previously been coupled with an analysis component and (b) the requirements of analysis demand a more careful consideration of semantic compositionality during interpretation. The basis of our analysis component also turns out, nevertheless, to be relatively straightforward. We have adopted the framework of combinatory categorial grammar, and more specifically the version producing Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS) developed by Kruijff and Baldridge <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. HLDS specifications are sorted hybrid modal logic representations, in which the sorts are provided by semantic type hierarchies defined along with the grammar. The grammars themselves are highly lexicalized and the semantics of lexical items use the same defined semantic types. Semantic interpretations of utterances are built up by functional composition in the usual way. For performing the analysis itself we employ the OpenCCG toolset. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_17">21</ref>Our initial analysis grammars were constructed exactly parallel to the spatial language analysis grammars developed by Kruijff and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> with the single exception that the semantic types employed in lexical entries are, in our case, drawn from the GUM ontology. The HLDS analysis results of Kruijff et al., in contrast, employ semantic types adopted from a combined linguistic-domain commonsense ontology. This is a practical solution in their case because the domain of application is relatively fixed and the spatial language that occurs accordingly limited in scope. It would, however, be interesting to consider a GUM-based semantic layer in the context of their system also.</p><p>The final connection to our discussion here lies in bridging between HLDS specifications and ABox assertions within description logic. Due to the close formal relationship existing between modal logic and description logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, it is in fact straightforward to consider the output of our grammars produced using OpenCCG as ABox assertions of exactly the kind we have given in our examples above. We show this very briefly here as follows. Our grammars contain lexical items of the form depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> for spatial prepositions such as in, on, etc. On the left-hand side of the figure we find a complex syntactic category and on the right-hand side its corresponding semantics. This particular lexical item then states that one syntactic reading of 'in' is as a category that is 'looking' for an NP on its right-hand side (indicated by the forward slash) in order to construct the complex category NP\NP-i.e., a category that is itself looking for an NP on its left (indicated by the backslash) to yield an NP: in other words, an NP post-modifier such as a PP. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_18">22</ref> The semantics for this category includes the two semantic types necessary for this reading: first, a GeneralizedLocation corresponding to the NP\NP (or PP), providing a semantic 'place'; and second, a SpatialLocating that has the place as its placement and an empty slot, x5, for the object to be located. This is then directly comparable with the single-place predicate interpretation given in Section 3.1 above. The GeneralizedLocation contains a spatial modality appropriate for 'in', i.e., Containment, which is classified within GUM as one of two kinds of functional control (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>). The full form of the entry also links the semantics of the middle NP with the variable x5 (the locatum), since this is the NP being sought on the left, and the semantics of the rightmost NP with the variable x4 (the relatum); in short, the semantics corresponds to that of a phrase [x5 in x4] NP just as described in Section 3 above.</p><p>The work of constructing complete semantic specifications is then carried out by functional application, modelled in OpenCCG by unification. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows the semantics that result when the phrases in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> are parsed with our current grammars.</p><p>(26) a. the box on the shelf in the kitchen b. the box in the kitchen on the shelf Naturally, many more parses are produced but those shown are the first two returned for each phrase; we also delete here all attribute values that are not concerned with spatial information. The most significant difference between the two is that quite different spatial relationships have been constructed. In the first specification, it is the shelf that is in the kitchen (SpatialLocating x3), whereas in the second it is the box that is in the kitchen (SpatialLocating x1). We have tuned the grammars so that more likely interpretations are produced first: in the present case, it is less likely that one finds the kitchen on the shelf-although, of course, this is still semantically possible (the kitchen may be a doll's house kitchen for example) and so is still present as a less favored parse. The correspondences with the Manchester syntax specifications used elsewhere in this paper should be self evident. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_19">23</ref> There is still substantial work to be done in selecting the most contextually appropriate parses from the solution set returned; however, our concern at present is simply to restrict that set to spatially possible parses. For more straightforward utterances our grammars are already showing useful results. Although these grammars remain experimental, we have benchmarked them against two testbeds of spatial language constructions. The first testbed was built directly from the set of spatial language constructions selected to illustrate each concept within the complete GUM spatial extension documentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, while the second testbed is derived from the spatial language corpora used in the evaluation of linguistic coverage that we describe in Section 6.1. At the time of submission the English grammar provides parses for 98% of the first testbed, and just over 50% for the larger corpus-derived testbed. As with all our resources, the analysis grammars are freely available for use and extension. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_20">24</ref>Although hand-crafted grammars of this kind have substantially smaller coverage than wide-coverage statistical parsers, we believe that their accuracy and quality is significantly higher with respect to spatial language than existing statistical parsers. Statistical approaches neither provide a detailed account of spatial meaning, nor take spatial semantic constraints into account in the parsing process. That notwithstanding, the application of the GUM ontology to existing wide coverage linguistic resources also poses a challenging and useful direction for future research. Moreover, while the manual annotation of spatial data with respect to proposed ontological categories described in Section 6.1 is a useful measure of overall model coverage, it is evident that a far better indication of coverage could be obtained if analysis were automated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Representational and semantic levels: Adequate inferences</head><p>The provision of a linguistic ontology makes possible the performance of a particular range of inferences, both internally to the ontology and with respect to the modules and other layers of information with which it is intended to interact. Another argument for our decomposition of the spatial semantics problem is that different kinds of inferential work can be distributed more appropriately. In this subsection, we set out this role of our linguistic ontology in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Compositionality and interpretation</head><p>We have seen in this section how instantial semantic representations of utterances (represented as ABox assertions within description logic or, equivalently, as HLDS specifications) can be constructed employing an appropriate computational analysis grammar. We consider in this subsection where this stands in the entire chain of interpretation that we require for a situated spatial dialogue system and spatial contextualization. We can consider the ability to construct appropriately structured semantic specifications anchored against the semantic terms of the linguistic ontology as a rather weak kind of compositionality. The semantic specifications of complete phrases are composed from the semantic specifications of their components, respecting the constraints on concept construction specified in the ontology. But for further contextualization, it is necessary to consider what these semantic specifications mean in their own right.</p><p>We stressed in the opening sections of the paper how we were committed to an 'indirect' approach to spatial semantics, one which resists immediate interpretations of linguistic spatial expressions in terms of, for example, regions of threedimensional space, in order to avoid over-commitment and inflexibility in interpretation. We therefore see GUM semantic specifications as performing the following central task in building interpretations. Information derived from utterances is organized according to GUM into specific relationships and categories. The function of this organization is to provide anchor points to which constraints on appropriate kinds of (non-linguistic) spatial semantics can be attached. These constraints are seen as 'minimal' properties to be met by (non-linguistic) spatial formalizations of particular linguistic semantic categories rather than specific accounts of space 'as a whole'. Flexibility in interpretation then results from the fact that a variety of different spatial theories might be adopted, as long as the minimal conditions on what is to be expressed for a particular category are met.</p><p>We will illustrate this approach by example, showing how it opens up several important directions for future research. In particular, we can usefully relate the framework to earlier discussions of the so-called 'two-level approach' to linguistic semantics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">165,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref>), in which a compositional semantic level is separated from a non-compositional 'conceptual' level. We also seek to maintain a compositional semantic level but go further by applying newly emerging results in ontology structuring and inter-ontology alignment to explore the relationships between levels within a more formal setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99]</ref>. Detailed discussion of this component of our work goes beyond the scope of the present paper (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>), but our examples will suggest the line of development we are following. It should, however, be noted here that it is only with an ontology-like specification of the linguistic semantics, such as that offered by GUM for example, that the tools of inter-ontology alignment become applicable to this problem at all. We also see this as an important contribution of our approach.</p><p>Most of the more formal approaches to spatial language introduced in Section 2 above have also aimed for compositionality. We saw there that some choices of spatial formalization are less suitable than others. The geometric (time-dependent) three-dimensional space interpretations of Kracht and of Francez and Steedman <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>, for example, restricted the scope of their accounts to what we have termed 'geometrically transparent' usages. Extending beyond this, the treatment of modification in spatial prepositional phrases proposed by Zwarts <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref>-such as "one meter behind the desk", "right under the lamp", "far outside the village"-provides further convincing evidence that a compositional approach based on three-dimensional regions cannot be sufficient since information necessary for the construction of interpretations of these modified phrases is then simply not available. In particular, to support a composition in which the semantics of one meter and the semantics of behind the desk, or the semantics of right and under the lamp, can be combined, it is necessary for the denotations of the second members of each pair to include distance and direction information. This is not immediately available from a set of points making up a region. Zwarts argues that the appropriate denotation for spatial expressions is therefore to be found in sets of vectors pre-anchored in the specified reference objects. Distance modification then constrains the length of the vectors considered, and direction modification constrains which out of a broader range of vectors at issue is relevant according to angle.</p><p>This perspective is useful because it emphasizes an important precondition for compositionality as such: if the information necessary for a composition is not available in the entities being composed, then it will not be possible to construct a compositional account: whatever information is placed within the semantics of our linguistic spatial entities, we need to ensure that it is sufficient for the meanings that are to be constructed with it. We can expect, therefore, that further properties beyond the sets of vectors that Zwarts proposed will also be required: for example, functional notions may support modifications of the kind "properly on the table", "right over the brush" and so on: this suggests that telic notions will also belong in the semantic specification as proposed for lexical semantics in general by Pustejovsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>. Patterns of modification are then also shown to offer grammatical syndromes relevant in the construction of our semantics.</p><p>Different areas of the linguistic ontology appear to require support from different kinds of abstract spatial theories. In Section 2.2 above, we briefly mentioned Eschenbach's account of 'front'/'behind' and 'left'/'right' in terms of half-lines and half-planes respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. To the extent that this characterization is further supported by empirical studies, we associate such distinct abstract theories with GUM categories in order to provide a summary of the abstract spatial commitments of those categories: for example, the spatial modality LateralProjection would then be connected with a theory that at least defines half-planes. The subconcepts of this category within GUM, i.e., RightProjection and LeftProjection, are then associated with theories formally extending that of the superconcept. Precisely which kinds of extensions are called for in each case, for example whether they are conservative (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>) or not, itself defines several important further research questions. A similar situation holds for the spatial modality FrontalProjection and its subcategories BackProjection and FrontProjection-this area would, given appropriate support, be related to a theory of half-lines in the same way.</p><p>The entire area of routes, destinations, sources, etc. described in the previous section under the concept GeneralizedRoute requires a different treatment. The distinctions drawn here on grammatical evidence appear to be covered well by Zwarts' proposals for an algebra of paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref>, related to his notion of sets of vectors mentioned above. Zwarts' use of linguistic aspect in his argumentation also illustrates another powerful grammatical syndrome: the inter-relationship of notions of boundedness and temporality. In addition, certain properties of paths that he specifies algebraically provide important guidelines for interpreting the distinct combinations of routes and paths specified in GUM. For example, we distinguished in Section 4 above between location expressions consisting of components that co-describe a route-for example, by giving its source and destination-and expressions that describe a sequence of path segments. The GUM specification of these is quite distinct and allows us to associate their interpretations with path intersection or path concatenation respectively. Zwarts' results concerning constraints on aspect are then directly importable, as we will illustrate in the subsection following.</p><p>The bundling of source, destination and path information within the GUM concept GeneralizedRoute also makes contact with the body of work drawn on by Kracht <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. His formal distinction between modes (concerning movement) and localizers (static relationships) corresponds loosely with GUM's division between roles of the GeneralizedRoute (Kracht's modes) and the places filling those roles (Kracht's location phrases). Similar constructs are given by Asher and Sablayrolles in their account of French motion verbs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Moreover, we see here clearly the value of maintaining a looser coupling between GUM specifications and corresponding spatial theories since the approaches to semantic interpretation taken by Kracht and by Asher and Sablayrolles are significantly different. For Kracht, we have a normal case of compositionality by which the meaning of the mode (the directionality) is composed with that of the location phrase; for Asher and Sablayrolles, we have instead many cases of nonmonotonic discourse interpretation. Both approaches have beneficial properties and it is by no means clear at this time whether one account is always to be preferred to the other. However, regardless of the account we select, the same kinds of distinctions will need to be drawn on the basis of the linguistic utterances considered. These distinctions may then be interpreted further in various ways, but the grammatical syndromes drawn upon for their formulation will not change. Thus we can strongly presume that any account proposed will need the distinctions drawn by GUM; moreover, any account drawing on these distinctions receives as a by-product a well specified mapping down to surface form.</p><p>To show these various features of our account in slightly more detail, we turn from an abstract comparison to one concrete case of compositional semantic interpretation drawing on Kracht's description. This illustrates our suggested use of GUM as a collection point for semantic constraints. As already mentioned, within Kracht's account the semantics of modes combines with that of location phrases. The semantics of localizers, i.e., spatial prepositions, are taken to be functions that take a referent object (our relatum) and a time, and which produce the set of regions standing in some specified geometric relationship with the reference object at that time <ref type="bibr">[94, p. 188</ref>]. The semantics of modes is then constructed essentially by decomposing temporal intervals in order to characterize when propositions hold. For example, the notion of a 'coinitial' mode insists that some spatial configuration obtains at the 'beginning' of the period over which an event is described. Thus, in Kracht's sentence: <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> The cat came out from under the table.</p><p>we have a (static) location phrase "under the table" that Kracht takes as denoting the set of three-dimensional regions geometrically 'under' the table at any given time and the mode for 'from' picks out temporal intervals in which the location phrase is true of the mover. The result is then just those events where the selected intervals strictly begin the interval of the event as a whole: i.e., the cat started out under the table and ends up not under the table. The multiword lexeme 'came out' then provides a set of events with which this semantics must be combined. As with Francez and Steedman's account, the semantics of the spatial terms here incorporates many items that are not strictly to do with spatial language but which serve to bind together information during composition; these are also specific to the fine-grained detail of the account as a whole. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_21">25</ref>A description of the same sentence drawing on GUM's categories (and which would be produced by automatic analysis) can be seen by analogy to example <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> above; this description involves a NonAffectingDirectedMotion with an actor of a cat and a route. The filler of the route role is supplied as usual by the spatial prepositional phrase, in this case: "from under the table". The 'from' is picked up as a specification of the source of the route, also as usual. Now, when we turn to the embedded phrase "under the table", we have a difference to our earlier example. The spatial modality of a GeneralizedLocation filling the slot of a source depends on the syntactic category of the linguistic unit expressing that GeneralizedLocation. When this is a noun phrase (e.g., "from the hill"), the spatial modality is provided by the source as a GeneralDirectionalDistancing; this is analogous to a coercion or the interpretation of an empty place-indicating 'preposition' in those accounts that strongly bind syntactic structure to semantic structure (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>). When the embedded unit is a prepositional phrase, however, it contributes its own spatial modality directly. The GUM specification of the embedded PP here is also constructed as normal, yielding for "under the table" a GeneralizedLocation with relatum "table" and a hasSpatialModality of UnderProjectionExternal, a subcategory of VerticalProjection, Disjointness and functional Access (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>). Each of these superconcepts contributes spatial theories for further interpretation; the vertical projection may be appropriate for a half-plane description in the style proposed for 'left'/'right' by Eschenbach above (with the addition of gravity as a potential orientational anchor) or as a set of (downward pointing) vectors as proposed by Zwarts, disjointness may be covered by a spatial mereology or region calculus, and access by some notion of 'protection from' (as in "under the umbrella").</p><p>For the semantic interpretation of the combined phrase, we combine the contributing semantics of source and its GeneralizedLocation accordingly. Our general ontological approach is committed to high degrees of modularity, leading us to maintain domains as separate as far as possible. This is most compatible with the treatment of Zwarts, who also attempts to keep spatial semantics purely spatial. With an association of GeneralizedRoute with Zwarts' path algebra, we can take the denotation of the current route as the set of paths originating in the place given by the source. But, alternatively, with an association with Asher and Sablayrolles' spatial regions relevant for movement, we could similarly have a path from a specified starting area. The GUM backbone specification tells us which semantic contributions are to be combined, but does not demand conformance to one particular non-linguistic spatial construal rather than another.</p><p>The final part of the semantic interpretation is carried by the additional fact that the GeneralizedRoute fills the role of a route in the NonAffectingDirectedMotion spatial configuration as a whole. This calls for the information to be combined and, again, several options are available. Possibilities include taking the intersection of events from Kracht, the relation of two domains (the spatial 'trace' of the event and the path itself) from Zwarts, or the simpler logical conjunction of Asher and Sablayrolles axioms for verbs of movement.</p><p>In a sense, the specifications produced with respect to the linguistic ontology provide a skeleton for compositional semantic interpretation that generalizes both across differing syntactic treatments and across different theories of space. We do not believe that it is possible at this time (and perhaps it will never be possible) to decide once and for all on the spatial theory appropriate for all natural language spatial semantics in all contexts of use. As a consequence, we consider the provision of a linguistic ontology such as GUM as an essential mediator between approaches and between levels. Different contexts of use may well demand spatial theories with differing formal properties; with the associations to abstract spatial theories pursued with respect to GUM, we therefore seek to provide explicit specifications of the minimal requirements that need to be met by a spatial theory when particular kinds of spatial language are to be used. In subsequent phases of interpretation, we then relate statements made in these spatial theories to non-linguistic, domain-oriented descriptions of space, which may also be ontological in nature. This approach also avoids the danger of needing to bring ever more non-linguistically motivated information into the shallow semantics in order to provide for later compositionality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">Internal inferential relationships within GUM</head><p>In the previous subsection we saw the role of GUM as offering a guide for subsequent semantic interpretation. In this subsection we consider the inferential possibilities provided by GUM itself. Most obviously, the GUM ontology can be used to analyze whether a specification of a particular sentence satisfies certain conditions and requirements. For instance, a direction can only be defined by a NonAffectingSpatialDoing or AffectingSpatialAction, but not by a SpatialLocating. Such dependencies and constraints can be automatically verified in terms of ontological consistency of the sentence instantiation (ABox consistency) using standard description logic reasoners. They then also feed into syntactic analysis via semantic type checking during composition. This information is important for subsequent interpretation because it makes it possible to identify semantic gaps and constraints that raise explicit goals for pragmatic contextualization.</p><p>We exemplify four types of linguistic inference supported by GUM specifications: two for utterances taken from our corpus, an invented one inspired by arguments put forward by Kracht <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, and a final set of examples showing how the inherently limited semantics possible within GUM also has the positive effect of blocking inference chains that more powerful formalizations might wrongly suggest as plausible.</p><p>We start with example (28) in order to show both what information is entailed and where pragmatic inferences must take this further. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> neunzig Grad Rechtsdrehung ninety degrees rotation to the right</p><p>The corresponding GUM specification is as follows (the specification of angleDegrees, an instance of QualitativeSpatial- Temporal, is omitted for simplicity): Although semantically unambiguous, this phrase is underspecified with respect to its contextual interpretation. Nevertheless, the phrase succeeds in evoking a range of realistic expectations about what kind of spatial movement is being described. The GUM specification captures semantic entailments that drive these intuitions as follows.</p><p>First, the configuration as a whole is defined as NonAffectingOrientationChange. This implies (going down the hierarchy in GUM to the corresponding branch) that:</p><p>(i) DoingAndHappening: Somebody is doing something or something is happening. This event involves at least a processIn-Configuration, which is here defined as 'drehen' (rotate). (ii) NonAffectingAction: The event doesn't affect anybody or anything; there is no actee in this configuration, whose role would otherwise need to be filled. (iii) NonAffectingDoing: The event involves an actor who is doing something. This role is not given explicitly in the configuration and can be formally identified as missing. (iv) NonAffectingSpatialDoing: The event is a spatial action; therefore it may define a placement where the action takes place: this is not the case here and so we know that this information although potentially relevant is not being provided directly. (v) NonAffectingMotion: The actor performs a spatial movement, namely one of three possibilities: directed motion (route or direction), orientation change (orientationDirection or orientationRoute), or simple motion (placement). (vi) NonAffectingOrientationChange: The movement performed by the actor is a change in orientation, defined by the relation orientationDirection.</p><p>The relation orientationDirection is filled by a GeneralizedLocation, which requires at least a spatial modality and a relatum. While the relation hasSpatialModality is defined as RightProjection, the slot for the relation relatum remains unfilled ('turn to the right of what?'). By this point, therefore, we have identified where specific information needs to be added by pragmatic inference for full contextualization. For example, one default relatum for the right direction in such a situation would be the actor, i.e., the actor would turn to their own right. Further pragmatic information may be derived from the (linguistic or situational) discourse context; if the actor has been the addressee in previous utterances, it can be inferred pragmatically that this is also true for the current (semantically undefined) actor, who is then animate (derived from the fact of being an addressee), with a high likelihood of possessing intrinsic directions, thus instantiating a likely relatum. Thus, GUM identifies the expected roles and concepts for a particular configuration. At specific points in the hierarchy, the requirements of the GUM concept definitions highlight that both the actor and the relatum are missing. To fully understand the description, the information about who is doing the turning action, and what the direction 'right' relates to, need to be ascertained. The fact that the '90 degree' information is optional suggests that there is some redundancy involved here-a reorientation to the right, for example, can be interpreted even without the quantitative specification.</p><p>Our next example illustrates how semantic ambiguity leads to different kinds of possible inferences, again using an example from our corpus.</p><p>(30) Go down three inches.</p><p>Corresponding GUM specifications are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>; we omit the internal definition of the instance distExtent as this is not of central concern. We see here that there is already semantic ambiguity to be resolved. The spatial expression 'down' is lexically compatible with at least two distinct readings: one as involving a SpecificDirectional spatial modality, another as a Individual: NADM Individual: GenRoute Types: NonAffectingDirectedMotion Types: GeneralizedRoute Facts: actor Jack Facts: destination GenLoc2 processInConfiguration running Individual: GenLoc2 route GenRoute Types: GeneralizedLocation relatum Bus hasSpatialModality FrontProjectionExternal Following through the detailed interpretation in the manner shown in the previous example, this utterance can be interpreted in two basic ways. In the case of a NonAffectingMotion interpretation, a spatial action is specified without a direction or orientation; however, the location where the motion takes place is specified via a placement relation: the action of running takes place in front of the bus. In the case of a NonAffectingDirectedMotion interpretation, the destination of a route is specified as being in front of the bus. In both cases, this exhausts the possible specifications based on the given semantics of the utterance. A number of inferences can be drawn on this basis. If the utterance is interpreted as being part of a route, this entails that other route elements can be added, namely a source, pathIndications, and pathPlacements.</p><p>Consider the following example in which these optional slots are filled:</p><p>(34) Jack ran out of the house, through the gate, across the field, and in front of the bus.</p><p>Here the alternative reading of a motion event taking place in front of the bus is very much less likely, since the presence of a source ('out of the house') induces a GeneralizedRoute interpretation. Furthermore, the fact that a destination constitutes the end point of a motion configuration entails that the action is bounded, while no such inference holds for the placement interpretation. Boundedness is traditionally tested by considering the acceptability and logical consequences of adding various temporal adjuncts <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref>, as in:</p><p>(35) Jack ran in front of the bus for three hours.</p><p>Here, only the placement interpretation is available. Adding 'for three hours' to the modified example <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> renders the sentence semantically unacceptable in the intended sense:</p><p>(36) * Jack ran out of the house, through the gate, across the field, and in front of the bus for three hours.</p><p>In contrast, adding another punctual event is unproblematic for the destination version (example (37)) but unacceptable for the placement version (example <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>):</p><p>(37) Jack ran out of the house, through the gate, across the field, and in front of the bus. He was killed immediately. (38) * Jack ran in front of the bus for three hours. He was killed immediately.</p><p>In addition to these semantically based inferences, pragmatic considerations open up a further range of interpretations, all of which are nevertheless perfectly possible given the linguistic material considered. The spatial modality FrontProjectionExternal does not indicate, for example, just how the front relation is being projected. For instance, various different perspectives could be used in this situation. The front direction could be defined based on the intrinsic front side of the bus, or on the current direction of movement of the bus (which could be going backwards), or on an onlooker's perspective; each of these yield different regions for 'front' (at least potentially). Furthermore, the given semantics does not have anything to say about whether or not the bus is currently in motion. In the former interpretation, it is additionally unclear whether the process of running is directed or the actor is running in circles; therefore, the specification in GUM remains on the branch above the differentiation of NonAffectingSimpleMotion and NonAffectingDirectedMotion. All of these details would have to be derived from the discourse context, which is likely to either provide enough information to rule out some of the available alternatives or else render them irrelevant. In short, beyond the inferences described above that can actually be made based on the semantics of the two basic interpretations, there is neither a necessity nor a semantic basis for spelling out the broad range of possible geometric configurations potentially represented by this utterance.</p><p>In our last examples, we show how the definitions in GUM can also be used to block invalid reasoning chains that might otherwise be invoked. For example, GUM does not specify projective relations to be transitive. It might be thought that it is a matter of the lexical semantics that one can infer from 'A' being to the left of 'B' and 'B' being to the left of 'C', that 'A' is also to the left of 'C'. But this is misleading. It can readily turn out that, due to differences in granularity or objects arranged in circles, etc. (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>), that such relations do not hold. We need to be very cautious about specifying such information as additional axioms in the linguistic semantics therefore. A more appropriate place to state such regularities is in the abstract representations of space, since here it is possible, for example, to specify precisely transitive and inverse relations among projective relations and to determine when they hold-regardless of linguistic descriptions and their inferences. Many such specifications have been developed within the field of qualitative spatial representation and reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>-the double-cross calculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, for instance, precisely models orientation relations and their composition. Spatial inferences can then be performed on the basis of the calculus, i.e., it can be analyzed whether 'left' is the inverse of 'right' in a given situation. This has been illustrated with respect to several parts of GUM-for example, the horizontal projective relations are related to the double-cross calculus in Hois and Kutz <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_23">27</ref> Further informal examples of the link between linguistic semantics and formal spatial theories have been presented by Bateman, Tenbrink and Farrar <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, while examples of the modular formal spatial theories we employ independently of language can be seen in Bateman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>There are also interesting interactions with compositionality specifically concerned with what interpretative work is done where. For example, in the approach of Asher and Sablayrolles <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, certain information is pushed down into the lexical items of individual verb families that from our perspective may be better located at the configuration level. Asher and Sablayrolles note, for example, that for a verb such as 'run' (again their examples are actually in French but we will only use translations for current purposes) it is not yet possible to fully specify whether movement from a location to another location is taking place: <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> The man ran to the park. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> The man ran on the spot.</p><p>To cope with this, they suggest adding a defeasible inference to the lexical semantics of 'run' concerning whether or not the eventuality described involves change of location. The corresponding GUM specifications instead move this information up to the configuration: example (39) involves a NonAffectingMotion and a destination relation within a route, while ( <ref type="formula">40</ref>) is a NonAffectingDirectedMotion with an associated placement relation. All that 'run' as a kind of Process itself contributes is a manner of moving; the question of whether a location-change is involved is not linguistically constructed outside of the context of an entire clause. Again this means that we can avoid importing defeasible rules into our linguistic semantics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Conclusions and discussion</head><p>In this section, we have described the use of GUM as part of larger natural language processing systems and the kinds of contributions that it makes to compositional semantic interpretation and subsequent inference processes. We should also compare GUM with other ontologies that contain descriptions of space, particularly those that build on principles of ontological engineering. Ontology already plays an important role here and we find several areas where explicit ontological formalizations have been pursued (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>). Normative standards, such as OGC's GML <ref type="bibr">(ISO 19136)</ref> and OpenGIS, also relate well to ontological accounts but have not been shaped significantly by linguistic concerns. As a consequence they only address half of the language-space relationship, leading to the problems set out in detail in Section 2. Similarly, it is difficult to relate spatial ontologies that define categories of linguistic spatial relations according to 'conceptual' schemes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">121]</ref>) to GUM without compromising the flexibility of usage characteristic of natural spatial language. Some general purpose ontologies also contain significant information about space; for example both ResearchCyc <ref type="foot" target="#foot_24">28</ref> and the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO: <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>) formalize a variety of spatial theories; Bateman and Farrar offer an extensive overview of this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The base ontology of SUMO, for example, defines several general spatial concepts. One of them with a substantial number of subconcepts is the category SpatialRelation representing many spatial relations based on mereological and topological relations. Although this categorization of relationships appears to have much in common with the distinctions drawn in GUM, substantial differences arise due to their very different purposes: i.e., SUMO does not try to cover the meaning of spatial language while GUM's categorization is strictly based on the requirements of treating natural language semantics. Many cases motivated by linguistic examples are not then covered. Moreover, the term SpatialRelation does not seem to be used consistently in the SUMO categorization because it also reflects information about relations between size properties of entities, i.e., larger and smaller, which is covered by a ScaledComparison configuration in GUM and is independent of any specific spatial configuration. Most importantly, the central SUMO function WhereFn does not account at all for the complex construction of the relative position of an object and its relatum covered by GUM's GeneralizedLocation.</p><p>Another ontology-like organization that is much more closely linked with linguistic evidence and which also includes some spatially relevant characterizations is the FrameNet lexical database <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, part of the Berkeley FrameNet project. Information within FrameNet is primarily motivated by lexicographic concerns and provides a representation of lexical semantics in terms of the 'frames' that words may appear in and the distinctive sets of 'roles' that such frames provide. Frames concerning spatial aspects include Motion, Motion_scenario, Motion_directional, Moving_in_place, Cause_to_move_in_place and Quitting_a_place. Each of these defines roles that express information such as the mover, the direction, the place, the path and so on. Although a fine-grained articulation of the semantics of spatial modalities and other particularly spatial details has not been one of FrameNet's goals, it does exhibit several points of overlap with the distinctions drawn in GUM and a detailed investigation of alignment between the FrameNet examples and a GUM classification would be of considerable interest. Certain distinctions drawn in GUM-for example between placements and routes or between path placements and path indications-do not appear to be reliably indicated in FrameNet, despite their distinct linguistic realizations. In such cases the FrameNet analyses appear to be including contextualization decisions in their assignment of roles. This is partly due to the lexical orientation of FrameNet, which, as we argued in Section 3 above, systematically undervalues the contribution of grammatical evidence. We would predict that this should impact negatively on automatic classification based on the FrameNet scheme.</p><p>Several more lexically-oriented classifications are similar in this respect, although nevertheless offering well-motivated groupings of lexical items that could beneficially be linked with the GUM-based lexical semantics. VerbNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_25">29</ref> for example, organizes verb entries by the range of grammatical alternations and argument restrictions that clauses containing the verbs enter into. This extends the basic work on alternations of Levin <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref> and also exhibits similarities with our methodology of isolating grammatical syndromes. However, the approach is less inclusive in terms of the grammatical phenomena admitted as evidence and, perhaps as a result of this, the resulting organization is quite flat. Although a good source of information concerning the range of lexicalizations available, the distinction between different kinds of spatial relationships is not addressed in detail. Similar potentially useful but partial sources of linguistic information can be found in initiatives such as 'The Preposition Project' (TPP), <ref type="foot" target="#foot_26">30</ref> which contains senses of particular lexical prepositions, including those with spatial meaning.</p><p>In contrast to these directions, a non-lexically inspired ontology that specifically focuses on spatial aspects in natural language and which is intended to be used within a spatial application for human robot interaction is that mentioned above of Kruijff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. This is closer to the organization proposed by GUM, although the grammatical evidence appealed to is less broad and there has been less of an attempt to evaluate the semantic representations against naturalistic data. The ontology does not then make the fine-grained distinctions between spatial relations and spatial configurations that can be found in the spatial extension of GUM. Moreover, the basic two-level semantics division between semantics and conceptual/contextual information is not maintained, leading to over-committed interpretations.</p><p>Finally, it is interesting to note that several approaches to processing spatial language now rely on linguistically-motivated classifications of the linguistic utterances that occur. However, these all provide a limited range of relevant abstractions due, on the one hand, to their task and application-specific focus and, on the other, to their appeal to a narrower range of linguistic evidence. Denis and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, for example, provide a five-way classification of the components of spatial navigation, including actions, actions with landmarks, introduction of new landmarks, descriptions of landmarks and 'others'. Similarly, Levit and Roy <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> simulate the interpretation of path descriptions (also with respect to the Map Task corpus that we mention below) by means of a probability-based combination of what they term navigational information units (NIUs). NIUs form an "intermediate" form of representation based on a subset of the literature of spatial linguistic expressions, and invoke categories such as to ("in a straight line approach the closest point of a reference object"), away_from ("move in the direction opposite to centre mass of a reference object"), path and so on. These categories form a small subset of those available within the Generalized Upper Model. However, although Levit and Roy's system relied on handcoded manual construction of NIUs-the connections between actual linguistic expressions and NIUs specifications had not been implemented-they argued nevertheless that such an "intermediate" representation is a valuable step in grounding certain spatial communication tasks, regardless of how it is achieved. The semantic specifications provided by GUM can be seen in precisely this light, providing a representation intermediate between utterances and contextualization. And, what is more, in the case of GUM the connection between linguistic form and semantic specification has been implemented. It would be an interesting further step, therefore, to examine whether the probabilistic modeling provided for the NIUs could also be extended to cover GUM specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Ontology evaluation, coverage and agreement</head><p>While Section 5 discussed GUM's adequacy and applicability with respect to compositionality, inference, and application, this section evaluates GUM with respect to data coverage and inter-annotator agreements when the ontology is used for linguistic data annotation. In both areas we will see that GUM appears to provide a significant and measurable advance in the treatment of spatial language and its semantics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Broad corpus-driven evaluation of linguistic coverage</head><p>For the reasons explained above, we must consider the breadth of GUM's coverage of linguistic data and not only its detail. To support this we have analyzed how GUM specifications fare when classifying natural language utterances taken from a broader set of test corpora. In addition, we attempt here to provide a further important aspect of quality control by providing evaluation metrics to benchmark coverage and to record gaps as well as growth as we move to new application areas.</p><p>The broader set of test corpora considered were deliberately selected in order to exhibit a considerable quantity of spatial language. For this we used seven different spatial language corpora containing natural language collected in English and German. The use of spatial corpora rather than broader coverage resources such as the British National Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> was to ensure both that a breadth of spatial terminology was included and that complex constructions which involve a number of related spatial constructions were available in the data set. For English analysis, three spatial language corpora were selected: the Trains 93 Dialogues <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, the HCRC Map Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and the IBL (Instruction Based Learning) Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>.</p><p>For German, four spatial corpora were selected for analysis: the Bielefeld SFB 360 Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>, and three corpora gathered in recent years within our own group: Aibo2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, Rolland <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142]</ref>, and Stuga (unpublished route description corpus). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_27">31</ref> As all of these corpora are collections of task-oriented dialogues in the spatial domain, they contain a wide variety of spatial terms including localizing expressions, spatial action descriptions, and route descriptions-although the proportion of these features is by no means evenly distributed as will be discussed below. Source data selection proceeded by collecting a sample set of "spatial language utterances" from each of the considered corpora. These utterances were selected on the basis of their containing either one or more clauses judged to convey spatial action, motion, or localization information directly, or a clause constituent which conveyed placement or direction information within another clause type. Clauses with idiomatic or metaphorical uses of spatial terms were not considered. For the TRAINS 93 corpus, four dialogues, i.e., D93-11.3, D93-15.5, D93-19.1, and D93-26.3, were selected at random, from which the first 100 utterances with spatial contributions were extracted. Similarly, the first 100 spatial utterances were extracted from three randomly selected IBL dialogues: u4, u15, and u17. For the Map Task dialogues, which are considerably longer and more complex than Trains or IBL dialogues, one dialogue was selected at random, q1nc4, from which the first 100 spatial utterances were similarly extracted. For the Bielefeld SFB 360 Corpus, 100 examples were taken from dialogues about assembling a propeller aircraft. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_28">32</ref> Five examples each were selected from Dialog01 to Dialog19 together with five examples from Dialog20 to Dialog22 according to their variety of different spatial expressions. Similarly, 100 utterances were extracted from ID A001 to A051 of the Aibo2 Corpus, which mostly includes route instructions from human-robot interaction in a naive user exploration scenario. For the Rolland Corpus, 100 utterances from R001 to R034 were selected randomly, comprising utterances expressed in a further scene exploration task. For the Stuga Corpus, 30 utterances were extracted at random from D001 to D020, including expressions about route descriptions within a human-human-interaction scenario. The total test corpus consisted of 630 spatial utterances. Analysis then proceeded by 'cleaning' the surface language in each utterance to isolate the core surface spatial information conveyed. Specifically, non-spatial content such as conflated confirmation speech acts, conflated stalls or other communication management content, plus non-spatial modifications of nouns or verbs were removed so as to focus on spatial content. The resulting utterances do not constitute canonical forms, however, since they remain close to the original surface language with lexical choice and other structural information preserved for spatial content.</p><p>A GUM specification was then assigned for each pre-processed utterance, providing a 'semantic annotation' for each unit. This assignment was performed manually by native speakers of the analyzed language against the category descriptions provided by GUM and involved the bottom-up assignment of semantic categories to constituents of each utterance. The result was a complete GUM semantic description of the kind illustrated in previous sections. The corpus of 630 analyzed utterances gave 712 instances of spatially-relevant Configurations and 918 instances of SpatialModality. The utterances, their pre-processed forms, and the specifications of the surface spatial semantics are available online as part of the GUM documentation. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_29">33</ref> Of the total included in the target test corpus collection, a spatial semantics was successfully allocated to 592 of the utterances, leaving just over 6% of the corpus for which the spatial import of these utterances was not judged to be adequately covered. Segments for which no spatial semantics were judged adequate included a number of manner expressions and reciprocal spatial constructions; the coverage of these remains for future work.</p><p>This high degree of coverage is already a positive result for GUM. However, we can also use the statistics gathered both to isolate areas where further development should be undertaken and to pinpoint design requirements for further corpus collection activities. The GUM categories of Configuration and SpatialModality and their subconcepts provide a precise specification of a diverse range of linguistically construed spatial situations. When considering a corpus of spatial expressions, therefore, we can consider to what extent the diversity of the utterances occurring in the corpus overlap with the diversity of situations covered by the ontology. Our present results show that the spatial language corpora considered offer only a limited range of situations. If our randomly selected subset is in any way representative of their respective corpora (and we have no reason to presume it is not), then this lack of diversity limits our ability to effectively benchmark existing coverage. We see this concretely in the overviews of our results given in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, which show the distribution of spatial configuration types and spatial modality types against the corpora analyzed. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> it can be seen that the corpora contain a large number of spatial locating and directed motion configurations with a very much smaller number of orientation changes and orienting. In order to probe the accuracy and coverage of these other areas of GUM, it will be necessary to find many more naturally occurring examples-either in other corpora or by means of focused experiments which require expressions in the desired semantic areas.</p><p>Similarly, with the spatial modalities presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, we see large proportions of uses for modalities such as GeneralDirectionalNearing, FrontProjection, LeftProjection, and Support, about ten further modalities having relatively frequent use, and several that are seen only occasionally in the data. Spatial modalities not seen at all in the data include abstract modalities which would be accounted for by sub-categories, e.g., Connection, and one terminal GUM spatial modality, MultipleDirectional, which is used to capture the non-directed motion in a use such as "they walked around town". Again it would be desirable to find more examples of the infrequently occurring spatial modalities, as it is certain that there is much more detail to bring out here. The distribution that we observe also provides a semantic characterization of the particular text types that made up the originating corpora; the large proportion of route descriptions, for example, contribute significantly to the preponderance of general directionals, etc.</p><p>As the coverage of both the GUM linguistic ontology and the number of annotated corpora linked to the linguistic ontology grow, statistics of this kind will provide useful metadata concerning the material covered. This can then be used for guiding further development, exploring corpora containing lesser used spatial information or pulling apart already covered areas of spatial information in finer detail. We can also draw in other areas of spatial work and treat these as corpora for benchmarking GUM coverage: for example, several of the lexicographically-oriented lexicon projects mentioned above also include spatial examples relevant for benchmarking; similarly, considering linguistic annotations such as those investigated to date by the SpatialML spatial markup language initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> would also usefully complement the range of linguistic phenomena considered to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Inter-annotator agreement</head><p>The GUM ontology can also be interpreted as an annotation schema for natural language sentences in its own right. This offers a further method for its evaluation, i.e., by carrying out annotation tasks and measuring the degree of agreement that different annotators achieve. We can then apply existing methods for evaluating the reliability and usability of the ontology considered as an annotation scheme. Such measurements can be used to show the reliability and comprehensibility of GUM's specification: if different annotators annotate similar sentences in a similar way, this supports the claim that GUM provides regularly recognizable distinctions between categories. Inter-annotator agreement measures of this kind are not intended to prove that GUM represents actual human conceptual structures of space or the language of space; rather what can be shown is that GUM's categories can be learned by non-experts, that the categories (after a training phase) can be distinguished correctly, and that they are not randomly chosen for some linguistic terms.</p><p>Here we present results from an exploratory study of inter-annotator agreement that we have conducted with four annotators, two native German annotators (G1 and G2) and two native English annotators (E1 and E2), who were not previously familiar with GUM and its organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Based on the guidelines for organizing inter-annotator agreement studies set out by Lombard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>, all annotators were provided with a manual on how to annotate sentences with GUM together with a spreadsheet document reflecting the structure of the GUM categories. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_30">34</ref> The annotation task was split into a training phase with 10 sentences, a supervised annotation phase with 2 × 50 sentences, and an unsupervised annotation sample with 100 German and 90 English sentences. Inter-annotator agreement was calculated for the unsupervised annotation samples. All of these sentences were taken from the data set used to measure GUM's coverage (cf. Section 6.1). The GUM specifications from this data set were used as a "gold standard" <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, counting them as a 'third annotator' (GS) per language. Annotators were instructed (i) to clean up the sentences, i.e., to remove non-spatial information from the sentences and grammatically correct them if necessary, and (ii) to annotate the sentences according to the GUM specification as given by the spreadsheet document.</p><p>We compare the annotation results based on the different parts of the GUM specification, namely the particular subtypes of Configuration (such as SpatialLocating, NonAffectingDirectedMotion, etc.), attribute (such as placement, direction, etc.), SpatialModality (such as LeftProjectionExternal, Proximal, etc.) and modification (such as extension, accessibility, etc.) that the annotators selected. Hence, the major decision points within the annotation or specification for a sentence were investigated. The results of agreements between the annotators E1, E2, and GS for the English data sample are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>; results for G1, G2, and GS for the German data sample are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>.</p><p>The English sample with 90 sentences, which were taken from Trains and IBL (see Section 6.1), contains 115 configurations, 193 spatial roles, 143 modalities, and 15 modifications that were used for comparing agreement. Due to the clean-up task, we had to remove 15 additional configurations as the annotations did not refer to the same sentences. The calculation of agreement was performed in a 'strict' fashion, i.e., even similar categories (e.g., LeftProjection and LeftProjectionInternal, or direction and motionDirection) were regarded here as different annotations and marked as disagreements. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> show agreement on all categories to be above 70%, except for the agreement on modifications between annotator E1 and E2. Modifications, however, only occurred in 15 cases. Particularly promising are the results for spatial modalities: a wide range of 24 different categories were used by the annotators and their agreement is still higher than 70%. Also Cohen's Kappa, a standard measure of agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, is on average slightly above 0.7 over all comparisons, which is also a good positive indication of the reliability of the annotation decisions made.</p><p>The German sample with 100 sentences was taken from Rolland and Aibo (see Section 6.1) and contains 136 configurations, 178 spatial roles, 164 modalities, and 86 modifications. Agreements between annotators were compared as for the English annotations. Due to the clean-up task, 16 additional configurations were removed, and as with the English sample, the calculation of agreement was performed 'strictly'. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> show agreement on all categories above 70%, except for the agreement on modalities and modifications between annotator G1 and G2. The number of modalities that were used, however, is 36 and this therefore shows a broad variety of different types. If we would factor out over-or underspecifications (for instance, combining FrontProjectionExternal with FrontProjection, etc.), the agreement is above 80%; we omit such calculation here, however. Also Cohen's Kappa is in most cases above 0.7 for all comparisons, which again indicates reliability similar to the English corpus samples.</p><p>An interesting finding from the annotation evaluation is that some annotations illustrate dependencies from the modality hierarchy (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>)-even without explicit knowledge of the annotators since they were not informed about the modalities' hierarchical structure. In sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> taken from the German sample, for instance, the annotation of the 'gold standard' for gegenüber (opposite side) is the modality Proximal. Both German annotators, however, annotated this modality as a FrontProjectionExternal. Although this category is too specific for the relationship of being on the opposite side, it is a subcategory of Proximal. Hence, both categories shows a strong connection-formalized by the hierarchical relationship in GUM and implicitly indicated by the annotations. On average the results show a high agreement between the different annotators. This also proves that with the use of a manual, uninformed annotators can be taught to apply the decision options in GUM and to decide on a specific configuration with its spatial roles filled with a high variety of different modality types and modifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Discussion</head><p>The empirical, corpus-driven approach to ontology evaluation presented in this section has been useful for several reasons. First, we have seen both that the GUM spatial extension covers existing spatial language corpora well and that those corpora need to be extended in breadth to provide more data for further linguistic ontology development. And second, we have demonstrated both that it is possible to use a linguistic ontology to inform the semantic annotation of linguistic data and that, when this is done, the results show a promising degree of reliability. All of these directions need to be taken further in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and outlook</head><p>Our starting point in this paper was the extremely flexible relationship observed between spatial language and contextualized interpretations of that language. There is an urgent need for versatile and comprehensive accounts that support the contextualization process by pinpointing the information that needs to be anchored by context without prematurely overcommitting to particular spatial interpretations. We have addressed this by considering the linguistic construction of space far more closely than has hitherto been the case. This has led to a 'linguistically responsible' characterization of the semantic distinctions that are carried by grammar (at least in English and German), couched as an extension of the Generalized Upper Model linguistic ontology and employing current ontological engineering principles.</p><p>We have shown that this treatment covers a large proportion of naturally occurring linguistic expressions involving space. Simple inventories of linguistic terms (and their direct semantic interpretation in terms of physical spatial models) have been replaced by a richly structured characterization of linguistically-motivated spatial semantics that provides strong support for active mediation between linguistic form and detailed spatial models. This characterization generalizes across contexts of use and applications, just as the corresponding linguistic expressions do. The Generalized Upper Model spatial extension is now accordingly employed as a level of linguistic semantics for both automatic generation and analysis within spatially-aware computational systems. We have seen that GUM lies within the description logic ALCHQ(D) and, as a consequence, any appropriate DL reasoner can be applied to provide reasoning support. Moreover, to support usability further, GUM is accessible online as an OWL DL specification including detailed comments about its categories and relations as documentation. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_31">35</ref> At a design level, the OntoClean methodology has been applied throughout GUM's development, strictly enforcing ontological requirements of consistency and respect for identity criteria.</p><p>We claim that an adequate account of linguistic spatial expressions will require at least the kinds of distinctions that our characterization has set out, independently of how these distinctions are then anchored in axiomatizations of space of particular kinds, in action routines for embodied behavior, or in perceptual models. The linguistic variability deployed in spatial expressions exhibits the distinctions drawn and so brings constraints to bear on the properties that any such models need to provide. The categories of the formalization we develop thereby support mediation, by virtue of the constraints they bring, but without imposing commitment to particular underlying formal systems. This allows us to remain relatively agnostic about the spatial models employed in any particular application system or theoretical account, thereby further supporting re-use.</p><p>We are now extending the coverage of GUM, benchmarking progress against a broadening range of corpora of naturally occurring spatial language. Particular areas being added include that required for describing geographic information, as explored for the spatial language annotation task within SpatialML <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, and the consequences of pursuing similar descriptions in other natural languages. Setting out explicit connections between the categories of GUM and the semantic requirements of languages other than English and German will be crucial for determining the extent to which the spatial extension of GUM needs to vary across languages. In this area also, there is a substantial body of previous work to draw on <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">153]</ref>; at present we assume both that further spatial modalities will be discovered and that there will be variations in the spatial modalities required by specific languages. Moreover, in all cases of extension, we will continue to develop the formalization of the spatial interpretation, using GUM as the linguistic component of a formally specified heterogeneous account mediating between language use and contextualized interpretation.</p><p>Finally, the account is now sufficiently detailed and concrete, that we can consider how to extend the range of evidence that can be drawn upon for investigating its adequacy and appropriateness. We have described our use and evaluation of the GUM organization as an annotation scheme above, and this needs to be taken further. We can also investigate in greater depth the formal relationships between the spatial theories that are taken as appropriate interpretations of distinct portions of the GUM concept hierarchy-here it will be interesting to appeal to current research exploring characterizations of spatial calculi in general in order to see if parallels between the GUM organization and the formal 'meta'-structure of this domain can be isolated. There is also the possibility of psychological investigation: now that a firm relationship has been posited between distinct areas of spatial linguistic semantics and linguistic forms, we can explore to what extent this is supported empirically. Carlson and colleagues (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>), for example, have performed experiments which show challenging and 'non-standard' connections between the spatial information activated by particular linguistic terms, such as 'distance' information being activated by projective terms such as 'left'/'right', etc. Investigations of whether such activations follow the connections suggested within GUM may throw new light on its organization as a whole. Moreover, as Carlson and van Deman conclude: "The premise in the literature has been that different terms are associated with different information. . . . However, the current results indicate that a distinction must be made between the semantics conveyed by the term itself, and the information deemed relevant during the processing of the spatial term" <ref type="bibr">[35, p. 434</ref>].</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Even traditional differences discussed in the literature, such as the contrast between English in/on and German and Dutch in/an/auf, in/aan/op, etc. or the well-known typological distinction between 'satellite-framed' and 'verb-framed' languages<ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">145,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">154]</ref> reveal themselves to be less than clear-cut when naturally occurring usage data are considered.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5" xml:id="foot_4"><p>We assume a standard compositional semantics, so for a preposition in a prepositional phrase, for example, the semantics of the phrase would in fact be the two-place predicate λRλx.Loc(x, P spatial-modality (R)). The variable for the reference object is bound when the preposition and the prepositional object are combined within the prepositional phrase (cf.<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>). We omit this phrase-internal detail for the purposes of the current discussion.</p></note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7" xml:id="foot_6"><p>More precisely, this means that the sentence introduces a discourse reference object into the unfolding semantics of the text/dialogue that is construed semantically as 2-dimensional and which is used to refer to and classify some entity as a 'road'.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8" xml:id="foot_7"><p>Note, that there are topologically parallel relations that, when put into a real context, will not comply with a "walking over the bridge" scenario.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We see this as offering potential support for precisely the kind of two-level architecture that we have proposed: the linguistic ontology provides the semantics of the 'terms themselves', but when this is anchored to contextualized spatial interpretations further kinds of information may naturally be entailed. There is then considerable opportunity for targeted investigation using both the general architecture we propose and the particular distinctions we have developed within this.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>PathRepresentingInternal. The entailments following from these readings within GUM also differ in ways significant for the interpretation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>  Construction of the semantics proceeds as follows. Spatial modalities contribute to GeneralizedLocations (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> or Definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>). In the first reading, the SpecificDirectional modality suggested lexically allows a GeneralizedLocation to be built directly; the spatial extent of "three inches" is combined as a quantitativeDistantExtent (cf. Section 4.5). In the second reading, the alternative PathRepresentingInternal modality supports a finer classification as part of a GeneralizedPathLocation, i.e., as a segment of a path; the spatial extent information is treated as in the first reading. In both cases no relatum is explicitly supplied by the linguistic form, although semantically required (and hence entailed).</p><p>Developing the first alternative further, a GeneralizedLocation may fill a variety of roles, including a placement role in SpatialLocating configurations (cf. ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)), a source or destination in generalized routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, a direction role in a NonAffectingDirectedMotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, an orientationDirection in a NonAffectingOrientationChange <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, and so on. 26 The verb contributes particular lexical information that supports a NonAffectingDirectedMotion analysis and this binds the GeneralizedLocation into the spatial configuration as a direction. Here, although the actor is not specified in the linguistic form, the imperative allows this to be filled with the addressee. Moreover, the relatum of directions is always the actor/mover and therefore is also identifiable by co-reference (indicated in the specification by the extension .1) without further pragmatic interpretation.</p><p>The second alternative is more constrained from the outset; a GeneralizedPathLocation can only form the pathPlacement or the pathIndication in a GeneralizedRoute <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Here, the internal path is not construed as a point and so pathPlacement is the appropriate choice. The lexical semantics of the verb as a NonAffectingDirectedMotion also makes available the possibility of binding a GeneralizedRoute into the configuration with the route role <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and so this is a further possible semantic analysis for the example sentence as a whole. In this case, the fact that a relatum is left unspecified in the surface form for the spatial modality has consequences differing to those for the first interpretation. Since the required modality is not a direction but a PathRepresentingInternal, this means that the action takes place in relation to an entity that is capable of representing the path; such entities could be hallways, streets, roads, rivers, borders, etc. This information does then need to be filled in pragmatically. The explicit mention of a relatum can disambiguate the two possible interpretations of 'down'.</p><p>In our third example, we illustrate how GUM leads to limited inferences with respect to the ambiguous and pragmatically highly underspecified (though semantically complete) example shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. </p></div>			</div>
