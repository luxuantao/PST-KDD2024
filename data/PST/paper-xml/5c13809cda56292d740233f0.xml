<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N the past two decades, multi-agent systems (MASs) have been extensively investigated due to their potential applications in a wide range of areas, such as rendezvous, formation, flocking, and sensor networks, to name just a few <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A large volume of works focus on the consensus problem of MASs, that is, to design a control strategy such that a group of agents agree on a certain quantity of interest (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the references therein). In practical MASs, external disturbances widely exist and affect the system performance. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the consensus problem for MASs in the presence of external disturbances. Due to various physical constraints such as wide spatial distribution of agents and constrained communication ranges, it is desirable to design fully distributed control strategies for MASs. In other words, each agent can only use the information of itself and its neighbors in the design and implementation of its controller.</p><p>Various distributed control strategies have been developed for consensus of MASs with general linear dynamics, which are referred to as linear MASs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). It is observed that the control strategies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> were designed by utilizing some information on eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix corresponding to the communication graph. However, these eigenvalues are actually global information, in the sense that all agents must know the entire network topology. To avoid using the global information, fully distributed adaptive control strategies were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for linear MASs. The basic idea is to find an adaptive law such that the coupling gain corresponding to each edge or node in the communication graph is dynamically updated. It is noted that the aforementioned distributed control strategies are often implemented by conventional periodic sampling control, which is also referred to as time-triggered control. However, in many practical cases, individual agents may be equipped with simple embedded microprocessors, which typically have limited on-board energy resources. By using a time-triggered control strategy, unnecessary fast sampling has to be taken in order to ensure the satisfactory performance of the concerned system, which often leads to excessive energy consumption and thus shortens the system's operational lifespan. To deal with this issue, as an attractive alternative, event-triggered control can be taken into consideration. Using this control approach, the control task is executed only when a prescribed triggering condition is violated. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, event-triggered control has more advantages than periodic sampling control when handling energy resource constraints. This is because the efficiency of resource utilization can be improved under event-triggered control strategies, while still guaranteeing a satisfactory control performance.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, an event-triggered control strategy was developed to stabilize a single system. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, a distributed eventtriggered control strategy was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> such that a group of single-integrators can achieve average consensus, and the result was further extended to a self-triggered setup. From then on, consensus of MASs has been widely investigated via distributed event-triggered control. At the beginning, many relevant works focused on MASs with simple dynamics, for instance, single or double integrator dynamics (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). It is noted that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a combined measurement approach was presented for event design and a novel distributed eventtriggered control strategy was developed. Under this control strategy, the communication load among neighboring agents 2168-2267 c 2018 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.</p><p>See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.</p><p>can be significantly reduced. Recently, a number of eventtriggered control strategies have been developed for consensus of linear MASs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>). In particular, by using the combined measurement approach as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the consensus problem was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for linear MASs with and without a leader, respectively. It should be pointed out that among those control strategies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, some eigenvalue information of the Laplacian matrix is required to be known for each agent. To be specific, for the cases with undirected communication graphs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the second smallest eigenvalue or the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix is required to be known; for the cases with directed communication graphs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the smallest positive real part of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix is required to be known. All this eigenvalue information is global information. Therefore, the event-triggered control strategies in the aforementioned works are not fully distributed. Most recently, two fully distributed event-triggered control strategies have been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> to address the consensus problem for homogeneous linear MASs and heterogeneous linear MASs, respectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, fully distributed event-triggered control strategies are yet to be developed for linear MASs in the presence of external disturbances. Motivated by the above observations, we will design fully distributed event-triggered and self-triggered control strategies for consensus of linear MASs subject to external disturbances. In practice, agents' states are not always available. Instead, agents' outputs are often available. By utilizing the so-called σ -modification technique, a distributed eventtriggered adaptive output feedback control strategy is first designed. Furthermore, to avoid continuously monitoring the measurement error, a distributed self-triggered adaptive output feedback control strategy is developed. It is shown that by the proposed two control strategies, no agent will exhibit Zeno behavior. Compared with the previous works, the main contributions of this paper are at least threefold. First, compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the consensus problem can be solved for linear MASs with intermittent communication. Consequently, the communication load among neighboring agents is significantly reduced. Second, compared with most existing strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the proposed event-triggered control strategy is fully distributed, without requiring any global information. Last but not least, the proposed event-triggered control strategy can deal with linear MASs with bounded external disturbances, unlike those existing works, except for <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> where external disturbances are required to satisfy the restrictive matching condition.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces some preliminaries and formulates the consensus problem. The main results are provided in Sections III and IV. Section III presents a distributed event-triggered adaptive control strategy and discusses the feasibility of the proposed event-triggering mechanism by excluding Zeno behavior. Subsequently, the event-triggered result is extended to the self-triggered setup in Section IV. In Section V, numerical simulations of a practical example illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed two control strategies. Finally, some conclusions are given in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>Notation: For a vector x ∈ R n , x denotes its Euclidean norm. For a square matrix A ∈ R n×n , A T , A , λ min (A), and λ max (A) represent its transpose, induced 2-norm, minimal eigenvalue, and maximal eigenvalue, respectively. If A is positive definite (or semidefinite), denote A &gt; 0 (or A ≥ 0). The Kronecker product of two matrices is represented by A ⊗ B. Let I n be the n × n identity matrix and N be the set of all non-negative integers. 1 N is an N-dimensional column vector with all elements being 1. For vectors x i ∈ R n , i = 1, . . . , N, col(x 1 , . . . , x N ) stands for a column vector which stacks all x i together. Given some scalar a i , i = 1, . . . , N, a diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements being a i , i = 1, . . . , N, is denoted as diag{a 1 , . . . , a N }. For a function f : [0, ∞) → R, its upper right-hand derivative is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D + f (t) = lim sup s→0 + ((f (t + s) -f (t))/s). If f (t)</formula><p>is not differentiable at point t 0 , then ḟ (t 0 ) stands for D + f (t 0 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Algebraic Graph Theory</head><p>Let G = (N , E) be a graph, where N = {1, . . . , N} is a finite nonempty set of nodes and E ⊆ N × N is a set of edges. If there exist two nodes i and j such that (j, i) ∈ E, then they are said to be adjacent, and node j is called as a neighbor of node i. The neighbor set of node i is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N i = {j ∈ N | (j, i) ∈ E}.</formula><p>The graph G is said to be undirected, if and only if (i, j) ∈ E implies that (j, i) ∈ E, for any i, j ∈ N . Let the adjacency matrix associated with G be denoted as A = [a ij ] ∈ R N×N , where a ii = 0, a ij = 1, if (j, i) ∈ E, and a ij = 0, otherwise. A path of G is defined as an ordered sequence of distinct nodes {i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i m } such that (i k , i k+1 ) ∈ E, for k = 1, 2, . . . , m -1. If there is a path between any two nodes of G, then G is said to be connected. Let d i be the degree of node i, which represents the number of its neighboring nodes. For the graph G, define the degree matrix as D = diag{d 1 , . . . , d N }, and the Laplacian matrix as L = D -A. If the graph G is undirected, then the corresponding Laplacian matrix L is symmetric and positive semidefinite, i.e., L = L T ≥ 0. Furthermore, if the graph G is connected, then its Laplacian matrix L has a simple zero eigenvalue with other eigenvalues being strictly positive, that is, 0 = λ 1 &lt; λ 2 ≤ • • • ≤ λ N . Note that the eigenvalue λ 2 &gt; 0 is the well-known algebraic connectivity of G.</p></div>

The dynamics of the ith agent are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ẋi (t) = Ax i (t) + Bu i (t) + Ew i (t) y i (t) = Cx i (t) (1)</formula><p>where  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> as its special case, when the external disturbances are matched, i.e., B = E. It is assumed that the agents' states cannot be measured, and each agent can make use of its own output information.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DISTRIBUTED EVENT-TRIGGERED ADAPTIVE CONTROL STRATEGY</head><p>In this section, to address the consensus problem of linear MASs, we will propose a distributed event-triggered adaptive output feedback control strategy, which is robust to external disturbances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Adaptive Control Law Design</head><p>For each agent, the following distributed event-triggered adaptive output feedback control law is proposed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">υi (t) = Aυ i (t) + Bu i (t) + F(Cυ i (t) -y i (t)) (3a) ξi (t) = Aξ i (t) + c i (t)BK N j=1 a ij ξ i t i k -ξ j t i k (3b) ċi (t) = -ϕ i c i (t) + ⎡ ⎣ N j=1 a ij ξ i t i k -ξ j t i k ⎤ ⎦ T × ⎡ ⎣ N j=1 a ij ξ i t i k -ξ j t i k ⎤ ⎦ (3c) u i (t) = K(υ i (t) -ξ i (t)) (3d) for t ∈ [t i k , t i k+1 )</formula><p>, where υ i (t) ∈ R n is the state of the observer, ξ i (t) ∈ R n is the state of the compensator, F, K, and are the feedback gain matrices to be determined, c i (t) is the adaptive coupling gain corresponding to agent i with c i (0) &gt; 0, ϕ i is some small positive constant, and t i k is the kth triggering time instant of agent i, for k ∈ N. The design of the adaptive law (3c) is partly motivated by the so-called σ -modification technique in robust adaptive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. With this adaptive law, the parameter drift phenomenon of the coupling gain can be avoided.</p><p>To introduce the event-triggering mechanism, define the combined measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">z i (t) = N j=1 a ij ξ i (t) -ξ j (t)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and the measurement error as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">e i (t) = z i t i k -z i (t), t ∈ t i k , t i k+1 (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>for agent i, i ∈ N . Let the sequence of event-triggering time instants of agent i be denoted by {t i k : k ∈ N}. Then, the proposed event-triggering mechanism is given as follows. The next triggering time instant t i k+1 is determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">t i k+1 = inf t &gt; t i k | e i (t) = γ i Kz i t i k + β i e -α i t (6)</formula><p>where γ i , β i , and α i are the parameters to be designed later. Under this triggering mechanism, an event is triggered for agent i, whenever the term e i (t) crosses the threshold</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">γ i Kz i (t i k ) + β i e -α i t .</formula><p>Note that e i (t) is reset to zero once an event occurs for agent i. This can be easily seen from its definition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. It should be pointed out that under the adaptive control law (3a)-(3d) and the event-triggering mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, agent i only needs to transmit the compensator state ξ i (t) to all its neighbors via inter-agent communication.</p><p>For agent i, define the observer error as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">xi (t) = υ i (t) -x i (t). Let zi (t) be the latest sampling value of z i (t) at time t, that is, zi (t) = z i (t i k ), for t ∈ [t i k , t i k+1 ). Then, it follows from (1) and (3a)-(3d) that for t ∈ [t i k , t i k+1 ) ẋi (t) = (A + FC)x i (t) -Ew i (t) ξi (t) = Aξ i (t) + c i (t)BKz i (t) ċi (t) = -ϕ i c i (t) + zT i (t) zi (t) υi (t) = (A + BK)υ i (t) -BKξ i (t) + FCx i (t).

Let x(t) = col(x 1 (t), . . ., x N (t)), υ(t) = col(υ 1 (t), . . ., υ N (t)), x(t) = col(x 1 (t), . . ., xN (t)), ξ(t) = col(ξ 1 (t), . . ., ξ N (t)), q(t) = col(q 1 (t), . . ., q N (t)), η(t) = col(η 1 (t), . . ., η N (t)), ε(t) = col(ε 1 (t), . . ., ε N (t)), z(t) = col(z 1 (t), . . ., z N (t)), z(t) = col(z 1 (t), . . ., zN (t)), e(t) = col(e 1 (t), . . ., e N (t)), w(t) = col(w 1 (t), . . ., w N (t)), and c(t) = diag{c 1 (t), . . ., c N (t)}. Then, one has q(t) = (L⊗I n )x(t), η(t) = (L⊗I n )υ(t), ε(t) = (L⊗I n )x(t), and z(t) = (L⊗I n )ξ(t).</formula><p>Obviously, q(t) = η(t) -ε(t) and z(t) = z(t) + e(t). According to Definition 1, it is seen that the consensus problem can be solved if and only if q(t) is uniformly ultimately bounded. Hereafter, q(t) will be referred to as the consensus error. By <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the closed-loop system can be written in the following compact form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ε(t) = [I N ⊗ (A + FC)]ε(t) -(L ⊗ E)w(t) (8a) ξ(t) = (I N ⊗ A)ξ(t) + (c(t) ⊗ BK)z(t) (8b) ċi (t) = -ϕ i c i (t) + zT i (t) zi (t) (8c) η(t) = [I N ⊗ (A + BK)]η(t) -(L ⊗ BK)ξ(t) + (I N ⊗ FC)ε(t).

Therefore, the ultimate bound of q(t) can be adjusted by choosing suitable parameters ϕ i , i = 1, . . . , N.

This is because the term -ϕ i c i (t) is added into (3c) to avoid the parameter drift phenomenon by the so-called σ -modification technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In real implementations, by choosing sufficiently small ϕ i , i = 1, . . . , N, the consensus error q(t) can converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero.

Feasibility Analysis</head><p>In this section, we aim to analyze the feasibility of the proposed event-triggering mechanism by excluding Zeno behavior, that is, a phenomenon of an infinite number of events in a finite time interval.

Suppose that there is at least one agent which exhibits Zeno behavior. Without loss of generality, assume that agent i exhibits Zeno behavior, for i ∈ N . Then, by the definition of Zeno execution for hybrid systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, there exists a finite time T i such that t i k ≤ T i for all k ∈ N and lim k→∞ t i k = T i . According to the definition of limits, for any i &gt; 0, there exists a positive integer M i such that T ii &lt; t i m ≤ T i , for any m ≥ M i . Consider the time evolution of e i (t) on each interval [t i k , t i k+1 ), k ∈ N. By <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, ėi (t) = -ż i (t). Thus, the upper right-hand derivative of e i (t) over [t i k , t i k+1 ) is obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">D + e i (t) = e T i (t)ė i (t) e i (t) ≤ ėi (t) = żi (t) = Az i (t) + N j=1 a ij BK c i (t)z i t i k -c j (t)z j t j k</formula><p>≤ A e i (t) + αi (t) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> where k arg max l∈N {t j l |t j l ≤ t}, and αi (t)</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">Az i (t i k ) + N j=1 a ij BK(c i (t)z i (t i k ) -c j (t)z j (t j k ))</formula><p>. From the proof of Theorem 1, it can be seen that c i (t) and z i (t), i ∈ N , are bounded. Thus, there exists a positive constant i such that αi (t) ≤ i , for all t ∈ [0, ∞).

This design idea is similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which deals with the leader-follower consensus problem. However, different from that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the decay rate α i in this paper does not need to satisfy the constraint α i &lt; ᾱ, where ᾱ &gt; 0 depends on the communication graph.</p><p>Remark 4: It is worth mentioning that the event-triggering mechanism proposed in this paper has three distinctive features. First, by virtue of the combined measurement approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, each agent is triggered only at its own triggering time. In other words, the triggering of an agent is independent of that of other agents. Consequently, the number of information transmission among neighboring agents can be significantly reduced, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Second, the proposed event-triggering mechanism is fully distributed. More specifically, the parameters in the triggering condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> are independent of any global information such as the eigenvalue information of the Laplacian matrix. Finally, all agents can be triggered in an asynchronous fashion.</p><p>Remark 5: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, a distributed event-triggered control strategy was developed for linear MASs with external disturbances. The differences between the control strategy proposed in this paper and that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> are stated as follows. First, compared with the state feedback control strategy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the proposed control strategy is based on output information of each agent. Second, the proposed control strategy is designed and implemented in a fully distributed manner, while that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> needs some global information, for instance, the information on eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix and the total number of agents. Third, the proposed control strategy can deal with the cases with bounded external disturbances, while that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> requires the external disturbances to satisfy the restrictive matching condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISTRIBUTED SELF-TRIGGERED ADAPTIVE CONTROL STRATEGY</head><p>The event-triggered control strategy proposed in the previous section suffers a drawback that during its implementation, each agent has to continuously monitor the measurement error. That is, agent i still needs to continuously measure the compensator state ξ j , for all j ∈ N i . Therefore, the communication load among agents may not be reduced as desired. To overcome this drawback, a self-triggering algorithm, in which the next triggering time can be precomputed based on the information available at the current time for each agent, is proposed in this section.</p><p>The idea is to calculate the next triggering time t i k+1 using the information available for agent i in [t i k , t i k+1 ).

Finally, the next triggering time t i k+1 can be calculated as ti l+1 . Let T * be the lifespan of the MAS (1) and T i be the sequence of triggering time instants over the time interval [0, T * ) for agent i, i.e., T i = {t i k i : k i ∈ N}. Then, the proposed self-triggering algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. In this algorithm, when an event is triggered for agent i, it needs to send the request to its neighbors for their compensator states ξ j (t), j ∈ N i , to receive the state information, and to send the combined measurement z i (t) and the coupling gain c i (t) to all its neighbors. Thus, each agent needs to execute information transmission at the triggering time instants of itself and its neighbors. It has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that compared with the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the self-triggering algorithms established by the combined measurement approach can actually reduce the number of information transmission for consensus of single-integrator MASs. It is also expected that the number of information transmission can be reduced under the proposed self-triggering algorithm based on the combined measurement approach.</p><p>The following theorem states the result on consensus by the preceding self-triggering algorithm.</p><p>Theorem 3: Consider the linear MAS (1) with the adaptive control law (3a)-(3d) under Assumptions 1-4.

The other is that for agent i, its next triggering time t i k+1 can be calculated based on its own information at the current triggering time t i k , i.e., z i (t i k ) and c i (t i k ), and the latest received neighboring information, i.e., z j (t j k ) and c j (t j k ), j ∈ N i . It must be pointed out that with the self-triggering algorithm no continuous monitoring is required between any two consecutive triggering time instants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION EXAMPLE</head><p>In this section, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies will be demonstrated on a group of two-mass-spring systems. For such an MAS with external disturbances, a synchronization problem has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Consider the two-mass-spring system as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, which consists of two masses that are free to slide on a frictionless surface. This system is controlled via a force u(t) ∈ R acting on mass m 1 and disturbed by an external force w(t) ∈ R acting on mass m 2 . The displacements of these two masses can be measured and used as the output information. The spring stiffness of two springs are k 1 and k 2 , respectively. Define the system state as</p><formula xml:id="formula_99">x = [x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ] T = [y 1 , ẏ1 , y 2 , ẏ2 ] T ,</formula><p>where y 1 and ẏ1 denote the displacement and velocity of mass m 1 , respectively; y 2 and ẏ2 denote the displacement and velocity of mass m 2 , respectively. Then, the dynamics of the two-mass-spring system can be described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">ẋ = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0 1 0 0 -k 1 +k 2 m 1 0 k 2 m 1 0 0 0 0 1 k 2 m 2 0 -k 2 m 2 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ x + ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0 1 m 1 0 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ u + ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0 0 0 1 m 2 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ w y = 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 x. (<label>49</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_101">)</formula><p>It is observed that the dynamics (49) are in the form of (1). Consider the scenario that the MAS consists of five identical two-mass-spring systems in the form of (49), acting as agent i, i = 1, . . . , 5. The communication graph among these five agents is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Let u i , w i , y 1i , and y 2i be the control input, external disturbance, displacement of mass m 1 , and displacement of mass m 2 , for agent i, respectively. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the system parameters are set as follows: m 1 = m 2 = 0.75 kg, and k 1 = k 2 = 2 N/m. The external disturbances are assumed to be some sinusoidal signals, i.e., w i (t) = 0.02 sin(0.5t), i = 1, . . . , 5. It can be checked that Assumptions 1-4 are satisfied. Consequently, the proposed two control strategies can be employed to solve the consensus problem for the concerned MAS.</p><p>The simulation is carried out with the MATLAB software. Let Q 1 = Q 2 = I 4 . By solving the AREs ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> with the "care" command, the feedback gain matrices F, K, and are obtained as The initial coupling gains and the parameters in the adaptive law and the event-triggering mechanism are chosen as follows: c i (0) = 1, ϕ i = 0.1, σ i = 0.99, κ i = 5, and α i = 0.1, for i = 1, . . . , 5. The initial states for the agents, observers, and compensators can be randomly selected. For convenience, these initial values are randomly chosen over the interval (0, 1) as follows:      velocity for two masses m 1 and m 2 are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>, respectively, where x i = [x i1 , x i2 , x i3 , x i4 ] T denotes the state of agent i, for i = 1, . . . , 5. The corresponding adaptive coupling gains are depicted in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, respectively, which can be observed to be bounded. From the simulation results, it can be seen that the consensus problem is solved under the proposed two control strategies. Moreover, the event-triggering time instants of each agent are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_102">F = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ -0.8034 -0.0773 -0.1514 -0.1302 -0.0773 -0.8807 -0.1302 -0.2816 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ , K = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ -0.9857 -1.5743 0.5362 -0.6803 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ T = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0.</formula><p>To study the effect of the parameters ϕ i , i = 1, . . . , 5 on the consensus performance, consider the event-triggered and selftriggered cases with different ϕ i . The norm of the consensus error q(t) in the event-triggered case is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref>. For the self-triggered case, the result is similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref> and hence is omitted here. Note that the smaller the ultimate bound of q(t), the better the consensus performance. It is thus verified that the consensus performance can be improved by decreasing the values of ϕ i , i = 1, . . . , 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have investigated the consensus problem for linear MASs with external disturbances under fixed undirected graphs. First, for each agent, a distributed eventtriggered adaptive output feedback control strategy has been proposed. It has been shown that the consensus problem can be solved and the consensus error converges to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin. Then, to relax the requirement of continuous monitoring, a distributed self-triggered adaptive output feedback control strategy has been further proposed. It has also been shown that the occurrence of Zeno behavior can be prevented for each agent for the proposed two control strategies. A key feature of the proposed two control strategies in comparison with existing event-based strategies is that they are fully distributed, without requiring any global information. Future work can be directed to more general agent dynamics such as heterogeneous linear MASs or more general communication topologies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .Fig. 3 .</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
