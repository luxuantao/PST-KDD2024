<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Biological vesicle membranes are fascinating subjects widely studied in biology, biophysics and bioengineering. Being ubiquitous in biological systems, they not only are essential to the function of cells but also exhibit rich physical properties and complex behavior. Vesicle membranes are formed by certain amphiphilic molecules assembled in water to build bilayers. The molecules in the fluid-like membrane are free to wander and are allowed to shear at no cost. The bilayer structure makes vesicle membranes simple models for studying the physico-chemical properties of cell as well as of their shape deformations.</p><p>As shear stresses lead to no energetic cost, the equilibrium shape of such a membrane may be determined by the resulting elastic bending energy, which was first studied by Canham, Evans and Helfrich. The elastic bending energy is formulated in the form of a surface integral of different curvature terms on the membrane in the isotropic case <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. The general elastic bending energy is obtained from the HookeÕs Law <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E ¼ Z C fa 1 þ a 2 ðH À c 0 Þ 2 þ a 3 Gg ds; ð1:1Þ</formula><p>where a 1 represents the surface tension, which demonstrate the interaction effects between the vesicle material and the ambient fluid material. H = (k 1 + k 2 )/2 is the mean curvature of the membrane surface, with k 1 and k 2 as the principle curvatures, and G = k 1 k 2 is the Gaussian curvature. a 2 is the bending rigidity and a 3 the stretching rigidity. They are determined by the interaction and properties of the materials that form the membrane. c 0 is the spontaneous curvature that describes the asymmetry effect of the membrane or its environment. We note that for the asymmetry effect of the lipid bilayer, one may attribute to the intrinsic spontaneous curvature effect of a monolayer the area difference of a bilayer or even the presence of the protein molecules within the lipid bilayer (when c 0 is a function on the membrane surface) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. This paper constitutes one step in our attempt to systematically study the shape deformation of vesicle membranes and its relation to the external fields and internal bulk and surface properties of the vesicle. In earlier works, we have laid ground work for the study of membrane deformations using a unified energetic variational approach via the diffusive interface approximation (EVADIA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Our approach was further analytically justified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> with rigorous consistency checks and convergence proofs, and computationally substantiated through numerical experiments with or without the spontaneous curvature effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Most of the computational experiments, however, were limited to the three-dimensional axis-symmetric cases. In this paper, we present full three-dimensional simulations that reveal both the effectiveness of the energetic variational formulation and also interesting membrane shapes and deformations previously not explored in the literature.</p><p>For a closed surface, the last term in (1.1), which is equal to the Euler-Poincare ´index, represents the topological structure of the membrane which has also been formulated and studied in the context of the energetic variational formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. With a constant a 1 , the first term can be neglected as it remains constant for vesicles with a given surface area. By taking the bending rigidity k as a constant, we consider in this paper the simplified form of the bending energy given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E ¼ Z C ðH À c 0 Þ</formula><p>2 ds: ð1:2Þ</p><p>The effect of the spontaneous curvature is retained in the above energy. Thus, the central theme of this paper is to study the equilibrium configurations and the dynamic deformations of vesicle shapes under the bending energy (1.2), with fixed cell volume and surface area in the full three-dimensional cases.</p><p>Comparing with the numerical studies given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the removal of the axis-symmetry constraint allows us to systematically analyze the shape transformations of the vesicles in the real physical three-dimensional cases. We can re-evaluate the presence and the stability results that was previously established for the axial symmetric situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We can also explore the non-axis-symmetrical shapes and discover new configurations. Furthermore, this added numerical capability sets us up in a position to simulate and study some more complex shape transformations, including intricate merging and splitting of the vesicle membranes.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the energetic variational formulation, and address the approach of Lagrange multipliers. This is different from the penalty constraint method used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and the difference and connection of these two methods are examined. In Section 3, we discuss the discretization schemes and some detailed implementation issues. Spectral methods are used due to their high resolution feature. In Section 4, we first present some convergence tests for our method, then we assemble a number of interesting experiments together to explore the true world of three-dimensional vesicle membrane deformations and to illustrate the application potential of our approach. Both three-dimensional axis-symmetrical and non-axis-symmetrical vesicles are observed. We also present some experiments showing the merging and splitting of the vesicle membranes. We then make some conclusion remarks and present the direction of our future work in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">An energetic variational formulation</head><p>As in our previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, we introduce a phase function / = /(x), defined on the physical (computational) domain X, which is used to label the inside and the outside of the vesicle C. We visualize that the level set {x : /(x) = 0} gives the membrane, while {x : /(x) &gt; 0} represents the inside of the membrane and {x : /(x) 6 0} the outside. Since this function is defined on the Eulerian reference coordinates, we do not need to follow the motion of the specific level set. While we derive the corresponding interface motion through the dynamics of this phase function /. This is reminiscent to other Eulerian methods, such as the level set methods and volume of fluids (VOF) methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. The difference is that we employ the energetic variational approach with the help of the phase field method.</p><p>Define the following modified elastic energy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W ð/Þ ¼ Z X k 2 D/ À 1 2 ð/ 2 À 1Þð/ þ CÞ 2 dx; ð2:3Þ</formula><p>where is a transition parameter that is taken to be very small and C is ffiffi ffi 2 p times of the spontaneous curvature. For simplicity, we take k = 1 in the remaining discussion. Note that the more general case of k not being a constant may be used to study the effect of different molecule compositions in the bilayer.</p><p>In addition, for the volume constraint, we define the functional</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Að/Þ ¼ Z X /<label>ðxÞ</label></formula><p>dx; ð2:4Þ and for the surface area constraint, we define the functional</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Bð/Þ ¼ Z X 2 jr/j 2 þ 1 4 ð/ 2 À 1Þ 2 ! dx: ð2:5Þ</formula><p>The functionals W, A and B are defined as the bulk integrals on the whole domain, rather than the surface integrals as those in (1.1) and (1.2). Such energetic formulations may be viewed as diffusive relaxations or approximations of the sharp interface models as they induce a thin transitional region near the interface and the parameter represents the thickness of this region. To briefly recall the key ideas, we tend to a formal argument that explains why the relaxed formulations should work in principle. Suppose the membrane C, which is a surface in X, is regular enough. For small , due to the uniform boundedness of the functional B, the region away from the level set / = 0 are all close to / = +1 or À1.</p><p>In such cases, one can always define the following transformation near the interface: /ðxÞ ¼ q dðxÞ ; ð2:6Þ</p><p>where d(x) is the distance of the point x 2 X to the surface C. Substituting this into (2.3), we have that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W ð/Þ ¼ Z X k 2 q 0 dðxÞ DdðxÞ þ 1 ðq 00 À ðq 2 À 1Þq Þ À Cðq 2 À 1Þ 2 dx: ð2:7Þ</formula><p>As ! 0, to minimize the energy, the leading term has to vanish, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">q 00 À ðq 2 À 1Þq j j 2 ! 0 ð2:8Þ</formula><p>which means that the transition region profile q (AE) is approaching to the function tanhðÁ= ffiffi ffi 2 p Þ. In the meantime, we see that / is approaching to the Heaviside function with 1 inside of the interface and À1 outside. C still coincides with the zero level set of /. Moreover (2.6) indicates that the parameter is effectively the thickness of the transition region between {/ = 1} and {/ = À1} <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Substituting the limiting profile of / in the modified elastic energy, we see that the energy W(/) approaches to the same energy as in (1.2) (up to a constant multiple) if approaches zero. Moreover, the constraint functional:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Að/Þ ¼ Z X /ðxÞ dx ð2:9Þ</formula><p>goes to the difference of inside volume and outside volume and the functional</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Bð/Þ ¼ Z X 2 jr/j 2 þ 1 4 ð/ 2 À 1Þ 2 ! dx ð2:10Þ</formula><p>is approaching to 2 ffiffi ffi 2 p areaðCÞ=3, or about 0.94 times the area of C. In short, the original problem of minimizing the bending surface energy with the prescribed surface area and bulk volume constraints is now effectively transformed into the problem of finding, for small , the function / = /(x) on the whole domain that minimizes the energy W = W(/) with prescribed values for the constrain functionals A and B.</p><p>The dynamic behavior of the vesicle deformation often depend on many factors such as the external environment. Here, we examine the simplest setting governed by the following gradient flow (steepest decent) equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">/ t ¼ Àc dW d/ þ k 1 dA d/ À k 2 dB d/ :</formula><p>The right-hand side is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the modified problem and the two scalar parameters k 1 and k 2 are the Lagrangian multiplier for the two constraints. The constant c is the elastic relaxation time, controlling the speed for reaching the equilibrium. Denote</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f ¼ D/ À 1 ð/ 2 À 1Þ/; f c ¼ D/ À 1 ð/ 2 À 1Þð/ þ CÞ; g ¼ Df c À 1 2 ð3/ 2 þ 2C/ À 1Þf c : 8 &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; : ð2:11Þ</formula><p>We arrive at the following equation for the gradient flow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">/ t ¼ Àcg þ k 1 þ k 2 f : ð2:12Þ</formula><p>To derive the explicit expression of the Lagrangian multipliers k 1 and k 2 , we start by taking the integration of Eq. (2.12).

(2.12) into Eq. (2.14), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">k 1 Z X f dx þ k 2 Z X f 2 dx ¼ c Z X fg dx: ð2:<label>15Þ</label></formula><p>Collecting (2.12), (2.13) and (2.15) we arrive at the following closed system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">o/ ot þ cg À k 1 À k 2 f ¼ 0; k 1 j X j þk 2 R X f dx À c R X g dx ¼ 0; k 1 R X f dx þ k 2 R X f 2 dx À c R X fg dx ¼ 0 8 &gt; &lt;</formula><p>&gt; : ð2:16Þ</p><p>The above system, equipped with the initial values /(x, 0) = / 0 (x) and periodic boundary condition is to be used to simulate the full three-dimensional deformation of the vesicle membranes. Note that, f and g are defined as those in <ref type="bibr">(2.11)</ref>. We note also that, although a Dirichlet boundary condition /j oX = À1 is a more natural and physical condition, the periodic boundary condition can be reasonably justified physically when the interface is sufficient small compared with the overall physical domain X. Computationally, the periodic boundary condition makes it easier to apply the Fourier transform in our numerical schemes. Furthermore, since</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">d dt W ð/Þ ¼ Z X dW d/ / t dx ¼ Z X gðÀcg þ k 1 þ k 2 f Þ dx:</formula><p>Substituting the system (2.16) into the above, we immediately obtain the following energy dissipation law for the system (2.16):</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">W t ¼ À 1 c Z X ðcg À k 1 À k 2 f Þ 2 dx: ð2:17Þ</formula><p>Let us note that in problems where only the volume is conserved and the area is allowed to change, we can modify the original system (2.16) by setting k 2 = 0 and ignoring the third equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Numerical schemes</head><p>The solution of the energy minimization can be obtained from the solution of the gradient flow equation, which, is of interests by itself in the study of the dynamic transformations. Thus, we focus on the numerical solution of (2.16).</p><p>For the spatial discretization, we use the Fourier spectral methods. Due to the regularization effect of the finite transition layer, for fixed , the solutions exhibit high order regularities and thus making spectral methods very efficient with the help of FFT routines.</p><p>There are a number of options for the time discretization. A fully implicit scheme of the type</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">/ nþ1 À / n Dt ¼ Àcg nþ1=2 þ k 1 þ k 2 f nþ1=2</formula><p>can be implemented to preserve a discrete analog of the energy law (2.17). The terms g n+1/2 , f n+1/2 , k 1 and k 2 have to be properly constructed based on certain averages of the solutions at the two consecutive steps. Such a scheme is unconditionally stable but it comes with the expense of solving nonlinear systems at each time step. For a simpler implementation, one can use the forward Euler method:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">/ nþ1 À / n Dt ¼ Àcg n þ k 1 ð/ n Þ þ k 2 ð/ n Þf n ;</formula><p>where k 1 and k 2 are functions of / n and they are decided by the second and the third equations of (2.16).</p><p>The energy decay properties can still be assured, but only with a sufficient small time step Dt. To improve the stability and accuracy of the approximations in time while maintaining comparable efficiency, we may also apply a semi-implicit in time discretizations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">/ nþ1 À / n Dt ¼ ÀrD 2 / nþ1 þ rD 2 / n À cg n þ k 1 ð/ n Þ þ k 2 ð/ n Þf n</formula><p>with r being a nonnegative constant. If r = c, then it implies the highest order derivatives terms on the right-hand side is fully implicitly treated, and in general, its value can be tuned so that both accuracy and stability may be maintained. Note that, with FFT, the solution of the above system is as efficient as in the explicit forward Euler case. In addition, with r ¼ rDt, one may also interpret this discretization as an approximation to the gradient flow defined in a modified Hilbert space:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">/ t þ rD 2 / t ¼ Àc dW d/ þ k 1 dA d/ À k 2 dB d/ :</formula><p>To obtain high order in time discretizations, we may also employ classical Runge-Kutta type methods as well as high order exponential time differencing schemes that can be efficiently coupled with the spectral approximations, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> for more discussions.</p><p>We next make some special comments on the discrete energy laws for implicit schemes, the treatment of the Lagrange coefficients k 1 , k 2 in the explicit scheme, and the step-size control, as they are the new features not employed in our previous works. We also briefly discuss the strategies for parallel implementations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Implicit scheme and discrete energy law</head><p>Theoretically, we can take a fully implicit scheme and ensure the monotone decreasing of the energy while preserving the constraints. First, without any confusion, we redefine function f and g as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ ¼ 2 Dð/ nþ1 þ / n Þ þ 1 4 ½ð/ nþ1 Þ 2 þ ð/ n Þ 2 À 2ð/ nþ1 þ / n Þ; gð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ ¼ 1 2 D½f c ð/ nþ1 Þ þ f c ð/ n Þ À 1 2 2 ð/ nþ1 Þ 2 þ / nþ1 / n þ ð/ n Þ 2 À 1 þ Cð/ nþ1 þ / n Þ h i Â ðf c ð/ nþ1 Þ þ f c ð/ n ÞÞ</formula><p>where f c is still defined in Eq. <ref type="bibr">(2.11)</ref>. Note that the two redefined functions are symmetric with respect to the two arguments and we have the consistency with the original functions f and g when the two arguments coincide. Such generalized definitions of nonlinear terms have been used in, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, to derive discrete energy laws. They are convenient to use in our discussion here as well. An implicit numerical system is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">/ nþ1 À/ n Dt þ cgð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ À k 1 À k 2 f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ ¼ 0; k 1 j X j þk 2 R X f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ dx À c R X gð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ dx ¼ 0; k 1 R X f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ dx þ k 2 R X f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ 2 dx À c R X f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þgð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ dx ¼ 0: 8 &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; : ð3:18Þ</formula><p>Based on the first two equations of the above system, we can easily show</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Að/ nþ1 Þ À Að/ n Þ ¼ Z X / nþ1 dx À Z X / n dx ¼ ÀDt Z X ½cgð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ À k 1 À k 2 f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ dx ¼ 0:</formula><p>By the first and the third equations of this system, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Bð/ nþ1 Þ À Bð/ n Þ ¼ Z X ð/ nþ1 À / n Þf ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ dx ¼ ÀDt Z X cgð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ À k 1 À k 2 f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ Â Ã f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ dx ¼ 0:</formula><p>Furthermore, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">W ð/ nþ1 Þ À W ð/ n Þ ¼ Z X ð/ nþ1 À / n Þgð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ dx ¼ ÀDt Z X gð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ cgð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ À k 1 À k 2 f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ Â Ã dx ¼ À Dt c Z X cgð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ À k 1 À k 2 f ð/ nþ1 ; / n Þ Â Ã 2 dx</formula><p>which is the discrete analog of the energy law. At each time step, predictor-corrector type ideas can be used to iteratively solve the system (3.18) for / n+1 , k 1 and k 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Lagrange multipliers and time step adjustment</head><p>For the explicit scheme, the two Lagrange multipliers can be adjusted to preserve the volume and surface area constraints. Such adjustments are needed due to several reasons. First, we may preset the their values but the initial shape of the vesicle may not totally satisfy the prescribed volume and surface area constraints for such given values. Second, there are some experiments designed specifically to study the shape transformation of the vesicles by changing their volume or surface area. Third, although in theory the Lagrange multipliers k 1 and k 2 keep the A(/) and B(/) constants, the truncation and round errors in numerical experiments often lead to the violation of the constraints on A(/) and B(/) so that their values may experience slight shifts from the originally assigned values as time goes on. Thus, one technique to be discussed here is on how to adjust k 1 and k 2 for A(/) and B(/). Now, suppose A f and B f are our desired volumes and surface areas, respectively. Let the current values of the volume be A n = A f + DA n , and that of the surface area be B n = B f + DB n . We consider a relaxation of the constraints (d/dt)A(/) = (d/dt)B(/) = 0, by taking two positive constants c 1 , c 2 as relaxation rates and deriving the equations for the Lagrange multipliers from the following ODEs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">d dt Að/Þ ¼ Àc 1 DA n Dt ; d dt Bð/Þ ¼ Àc 2 DB n Dt :</formula><p>These can also be interpreted as gradient flows of a penalty formulation for the constraints:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">c 1 ðA n À A f Þ 2 Dt þ c 2 ðB n À B f Þ 2 Dt ;</formula><p>with c 1 /Dt and c 2 /Dt being penalty coefficients. Naturally, if the constraints were strictly satisfied, this penalty term would be a null Lagrangian term due to the introduction of the Lagrange multipliers. However, when the numerical solutions are slightly drifting away from the constrained set, the relaxation process or the penalty term serves as a mechanism to pull the solutions back. We thus derive from (2.12) some modified formulae of (2.13) and (2.15):</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">k 1 jXj þ k 2 Z X f dx ¼ c Z X g dx À c 1 DA n Dt ; ð3:19Þ k 1 Z X f dx þ k 2 Z X f 2 dx ¼ c Z X fg dx þ c 2 DB n Dt : ð3:20Þ</formula><p>The adjusted values of k 1 and k 2 obtained from Eqs. (2.13) and (2.15) assure the variations in volume and surface area being kept small. Furthermore, the constraints are ultimately satisfied in the steady state. Based on our computational experience, we have found that it serves our objective well with c 1 and c 2 being taken as 0.5 in the computation. For some experiments, the initial volume A 0 and surface area B 0 may be very different from the preset values A f and B f . In such cases, we use a continuation approach to divide the experiment into several steps so that a smooth transition takes place from A 0 and B 0 gradually to A f and B f . We note that this hybrid approach of using a forward Euler in time discretization coupled with the Lagrange multiplier adjustment can be understood in the general framework of time-splitting methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> for constrained time-dependent PDEs: the forward Euler step is viewed as a step along the tangential direction of the solution manifold, while the adjustment is made to project the solution back to or at least closer to the constrained space.</p><p>Next, let us discuss the choice of step sizes in the time discretization. In general, variable time steps can be employed. A few issues to be addressed include the one on the accuracy of the transient solution and the other on the stability and the efficiency in reaching the steady state. To make the discretization robust, our time step adjustment is geared towards preserving the energy decay property. That is, the time step is adjusted so that the energy preserves the monotone decreasing property in the discrete approximations.</p><p>For example, initially, we take a small step to ensure the decrease of the energy, and when the solution is close to a steady state, larger time step may be allowed by. If a particular time step size violates the energy decreasing principle, we just simply half the time step in this case to recompute the discrete solution. It is assured that sufficiently small steps would decrease the energy if the solution is not at a local minimum of the energy.</p><p>In our numerical simulations, as a stopping criterion, the solution is taking to be in a steady state when either kcg À k 1 À k 2 f k L 2 &lt; tol with the tolerance tol being chosen based on the required accuracy, or the time step Dt is becoming exceedingly large or sufficiently small, indications that the solutions are at rest. We like to point out that for the most part of in our numerical experiments, although fully adjustable, the step size Dt is kept to be in the interval from 10 À6 to 10 À7 for most part of the simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Parallel implementations</head><p>To make our three-dimensional simulations efficient on todayÕs high performance computing platform, parallel implementation is a useful approach that can be realized on both distributed memory systems via MPI and shared memory systems via OPENMP. For both types of implementation, we choose to divide the unknowns into several groups according to their locations along the z-axis. These different groups of variables are intended to be processed mostly on different processors. Because the two-dimensional discrete FFTs in the x-y planes are performed independently, it is very easy to parallel them. The difficulties arise in the parallel implementation for the FFTs along the z-axis. For the MPI-based implementation, we need to exchange data between processors to reconstruct the data array formatted in the x-y planes from and to that formatted along the z-axis. This is relatively easier to accomplish with the OPENMP programming as it uses implicit communications between processors. The three-dimensional array data of the phase-field function are shared in the memory. Some extra working space may help avoiding the false sharing of data and enhance the performance OPENMP dramatically.</p><p>Another alternative implementation is to use FFTW freeware package which provides necessary interfaces for the parallel implementation of FFT via MPI and OPENMP. In our numerical experiments, we have mostly utilized the OPENMP platform on a shared memory system with 16 CPUs. Using the method mentioned in the prior paragraph, our parallel code is only implemented using the serial interface of FFTW for one-dimensional and two-dimensional discrete FFTs. Scalable performance of our numerical implementation is clearly observed. This provides efficient means for us to conduct extensive three-dimensional simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Numerical simulation</head><p>The EVADIA technique has been previously implemented in the three-dimensional axis-symmetric cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The focus now is on the full three-dimensional simulation without the axis-symmetry assumption. Throughout this section, we take c = 3.0 and the domain as the box [Àp, p] 3 except otherwise indicated. Most of the parameter values used in the experiments are described. Additional simulations and more detailed descriptions can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Initial data preparation</head><p>For our numerical simulations, the volume and surface area are not set a priori. Instead, a simulated vesicle starts from a given initial shape and we set the corresponding A f and B f computed from the integrals to be A 0 and B 0 . However, if the initial phase-field function / 0 (x) is dramatically different from an ideal profile of the form tanhðdðxÞ= ffiffi ffi 2 p Þ, the initial volume and initial surface area calculated from formula (2.4) and (2.5) are not necessarily accurate. Thus, starting from this kinds of initial / 0 , the simulation process may preserve the values of the volume and surface area that are far from the ones desired for.</p><p>To resolve this issue, we can easily get a better phase-field function if the numerical simulation is performed from the initial data for a short initial period of time without preserving the volume and surface area. During this initial transient layer, the energy decreases quickly and soon the phase-field function start to behave more like the profile tanhðdðxÞ= ffiffi ffi 2 p Þ. At such a state, we take it as / 0 and continue our simulation using the previously described procedures while preserving the constraints corresponding to values of A 0 and B 0 computed from / 0 via (2.4) and (2.5).</p><p>Figs. 1 and 2 present an example of how an initial phase-field function is prepared. The domain is the box [Àp,p] 3 with grid size 64 • 64 • 64 and = 0.1736. We start from a vesicle in the shape of ellipsoid that is axis-symmetric with the x, y, z axes. The graphs of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> show the sharp drop in the energy curve along with the significant drop in the estimate of the surface area functional B. Although the actual surface area of the ellipsoid almost does not change much, its value calculated by the surface formula (2.5) changes dramatically from 66.38 to 45.61 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. And it is already good enough to use 45.61 as the vesicleÕs fixed surface area. At the beginning, a cross-section density plot of the phase-field function is shown in the left graph of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Once the energy decreases to a level that is no more than one fifth of its starting in a time period on the order of 10 À4 , we get a good initial phase field prepared, as shown in the second graph of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The other graphs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> provide both the three-dimensional view and a cutting view of the prepared initial phase field. The 45°cut is made to allow a look into the interior of the vesicle membrane surface. Similar cutting views are provided in other examples given below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Convergence verification</head><p>For a particular numerical simulation, the quality of the numerical result is affected by the choice of computational domain, the transition thickness parameter (or the effective width of the diffusive interface) , the number of grid points, and the choices of other parameters used in the simulation. The computational domain is set to be the box [Àp,p] 3 and the membranes are assumed to be enclosed in the box unless otherwise noted. The parameter is generally taken to be a couple of percentage points of the domain size to ensure a relatively sharp interfacial region. The mesh size is normally taken to be several times smaller than to ensure adequate spatial resolution. To ascertain the accuracy and robustness of our numerical algorithms and the parameter selections, we here present results of some numerical tests on the convergence and performance of our method.</p><p>The first example is for the same set of parameters ( = 0.2454, same initial / 0 in the same domain) but solved on two different grid sizes 40 • 40 • 40 and 64 • 64 • 64. The initial data depict a shape of a irregular cylinder in the z-direction, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. In this case, the constraints only capture the surface area and the enclosed volume within the box.</p><p>To compare in detail, the second row of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> gives the density plots of the cross-sections. With the same initial / 0 , the computed shapes corresponding to the two different mesh sizes maintain almost the same volume (À120.12 and À120.03) and surface area (90.61 and 90.57). Moreover, the energy values decreases to almost the same level, namely, the final energy values are 45.23 (t = 0.1864) and 45.17 (t = 0.1634), respectively. The energy plots are also given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. After a number of steps of no appreciable drop in the energy, the calculation is stopped.</p><p>The second experiment given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> is designed to test the dependence of the parameter , which measures the thickness of the transition layer. In this experiment, the shape is the same as the above experiment, and a 64 • 64 • 64 grid is used but the value of is changed from 0.2464 to 0.1736. The two equilibrium shapes are almost the same except the transition layer width. The corresponding final energy values 43.26 (t = 0.2050) and 45.17 (t = 0.1634) are again very closed to each other.</p><p>The convergence can also be verified with the two Lagrange multipliers k 1 and k 2 .  The next experiment is designed to test the convergence due to different time step sizes. In this experiment, the forward Euler scheme is applied to three vesicles starting from the same initial shape of a non-axis symmetric torus with different time step sizes (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> for an illustration of the vesicle config-  uration). The different runs are all terminated at t = 0.215 and data on the step sizes used, number of steps taken, the initial and final values of energy, volume and surface area are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4</ref>.1. There is no parameter adjustment in the simulation process. Due to the time discretization and machine errors, the final volume and surface area may slightly change from the initial values, however, the data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4</ref>.1 show that they are preserved remarkably well. As the errors are so small, we can say that the final results are independent with the time step sizes, while preserving the values of volume and surface area.</p><p>To summarize, the above numerical tests indicate that effective and reliable simulations can be carried out based on the energetic variational approach with diffusive interface approximation (EVADIA). Moreover, as the experimental results indicate, the choices of various parameter values used in the simulations are capable of ensuring the convergence of the numerical scheme and ensuring the validity of the simulation results when we predict the vesicle shapes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Three-dimensional numerical experiments</head><p>In this section, we first compare some results with those previously obtained with the axis-symmetry assumption in order to numerically verify the consistency of the different numerical schemes. Then we present some interesting true three-dimensional simulations of vesicle shapes that are not necessarily axis-symmetric. In particular, we present a set of experiments intended to simulate the phase transition of solutions resembling worm like micellar particles. To graphically represent the three-dimensional membrane shapes, the cross-sectional views, full three-dimensional views as well as three-dimensional cutting views are used in the figures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Axis-symmetric cases</head><p>We now compare some results in axis-symmetric cases to confirm that all the shapes we have obtained in the three-dimensional axis-symmetric cases indeed reappear in the full three dimension simulations. We set the spontaneous curvature C = 0 in all the simulations here.  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows a discocyte (pancake) shaped and a gourd-shaped vesicles computed without the axis-symmetry assumption. In this experiment, the discocyte is transformed from an ellipsoid revolving around the z-axis. The flatter the ellipsoid is, the more the final pancake pinches at the center. And for a flat enough initial ellipsoid, the final pancake pinches off to a torus. This transformation is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>.</p><p>Another experiment is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>. It begins with a pot-like shape, with initial volume À207.48 and surface area 52.04 shown in the top-left picture. By preserving the initial volume and surface area, it finally transforms to be a shell shape, shown in the top-right picture; with smaller preset surface area valued at 45.06 and 48.30, it transforms to stomatocyte shapes, shown in bottom pictures. The stomatocyte shaped cells are abundant in nature, see the discussions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Symmetric torus and non-symmetric torus</head><p>To look for non-symmetric three-dimensional equilibrium shapes, a non-symmetric torus is used as an initial shape in our simulations. In several experiments, they gradually turn to a symmetric shape in the equilibrium state as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> which corresponds to the case with the volume (difference) at À211.43, and the surface area at 41.59. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> shows, on the other hand, an example that non-symmetric torus does exist in the equilibrium state, as illustrated in earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. The bottom cross-sectional view shows that the radii of the two circular sections are quite different, and the radius of the hole at the center of the torus is very small. For the same area and volume, a solution can also be found for a symmetric torus with a smaller hole in the center than that of the non-symmetric torus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Non-zero spontaneous curvature cases</head><p>In this section, we give some examples to show how the spontaneous curvature affects the vesicle shapes. More studies on this issue can be found <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The gourd-shaped vesicle in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> is computed without the spontaneous curvature. If such a shape is taken as the initial condition, with a constant spontaneous curvature C = 3.0 defined in the energy functional, the gourd shape eventually splits into 3 smaller sphere-like vesicles whose curvature matches with the constant value of spontaneous curvature. The transformation is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>.    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> shows how an inhomogeneous spontaneous curvature would affect the membrane surface. The inhomogeneities are introduced in a manner that the spontaneous curvature is zero except in some small neighborhood of selected points. The top row shows the case where a non-zero spontaneous curvature is given on the top and bottom of an ellipsoidal disk, causing the budding formation at these two points on the surface. The bottom row shows the results of the transformation of an ellipsoid with a non-zero spontaneous curvature in eight symmetrically located points.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Constrained self-assembly</head><p>As another interesting application, we now present numerical simulations of constrained self-assembly process in the mixture of different species. Such self-assembly is often determined by the competition of the phobic and philic interaction which, on one hand, can be reflected from the presence of the corresponding terms (sometimes implicitly) in the energetic variational formulation. On the other hand, the final assembled configuration can also be affected by the geometric or chemical configuration of the real molecules. Worm-like micellar fluids (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> and their references) can be a good example. A micelle is formed when a variety of molecules such as soaps, shampoos and detergents are added to water. The molecule may be a fatty acid, phospholipids, or other similar molecules. The molecule has a strongly polar end and a nonpolar hydrocarbon chain end. When this type of molecule is added to water, the non-polar hydrophobic tails of the molecules clump into the center of the concentration. The polar, hydrophilic head of the molecule will be associated with the water molecules on the outside of the micelle. The geometric shape and the size of the micelle are determined by the combination of the philic/phobic competition and the size of the molecule.</p><p>There are many such examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In the diblock polymers, the overall molecule sizes (length) are fixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This is also true in the case of the lipid membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and the surfactant monolayers. The lipid size (hence the membrane thickness) is fixed. The extra constraint will dramatically change the phase separation process and overall properties of the mixtures.</p><p>In view of these considerations, we want to present the prototype example that will show the transition from the presence of small drops to the presence of filaments and then to the membrane sheet, all with the fixed (constraint) length (the radius in the sphere and the filament, the thickness of the membrane). In practice, we impose such a constraint by properly balancing the constraints between the different quantities, such as volume and area.</p><p>The numerical examples to be presented are based on the energetic variational formulation. Small specimen are assumed in the initial state, and they evolve into larger coherent structures via the gradient flow so as to minimize the energy. In different simulation runs, periodic boundary condition in certain directions are specified to allow the assembly into larger structures and avoid the boundary curvature effect. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref> provides the graphical display of two different simulations. On the left, the cutting and full threedimensional views of the merging of three small spheres into a larger torus are presented. Although a sphere can be a local equilibrium state for a standing alone vesicle, the merger of like ones can result a smaller elastic bending energy with the given total volume (the volume different is kept at value À222.51) and surface area (being kept at value 31.94). The parameter and the spatial mesh size are given by = 2h = 0.1964. On the right side of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>, the pictures show how six small spheres merge into a cylinder. In fact, as period boundary condition in the z-direction is applied. Notice that in the beginning those spheres are not aligned to be on a straight line. The final result shows the formation of a straight cylinder. Here, the volume difference is kept at value À232.18, while the surface area is kept at 22.34, and = 2h = 0.1964.</p><p>Not only the volume and surface area and the number of specimen taken initially affect the final equilibrium state, the change in the proximity and the positions of the initial individual spheres also lead to different final states. For example, when the initial data is given by eight spheres aligned close to, but not on, a plane, the solution turns to discocyte shape through the merger of the small vesicles, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">14</ref>. In this experiment, the volume difference is always kept at value À235.82, the surface area at 26.90, and = 1.25h = 0.1227.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15</ref>, we start from nine small spheres aligned to the x-y plane. Period boundary conditions are imposed in the x-y directions, so that one may view this as a periodic array of small spheres all centered on the x-y plane. To minimize the total energy with fixed volume and area (per unit period in the x-y-direction), they begin to get merge together while preserving the total volume (À185.70) and surface area (83.68). Since the prescribed surface area is larger than the area of two flat surfaces (2(2p) 2 % 78.96), the surface can not be flat. Thus, bumps and holes are formed. To get a better view, in the bottom row of the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15</ref>, the solution is shifted by a half period in both the x and y directions, so that the bump and the hole appear in the center of the domain. The three dimension and cutting views reveal a very special topological structure. In this experiment, we take = 1.768h = 0.1736. To re-confirm the validity of the numerical solution, another experiment is conducted with = 1.5h and the surface area be changed from 83.68 to 87.00, a similar solution is obtained. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Euler number</head><p>The energetic variational formulation offers distinct advantages in simulating complex topological deformation of vesicle membranes as one does not need to physically track the interfaces.

It shows that the Euler number decreases from 5 in an almost stepwise fashion, and eventually, the Euler number arrives 0. The stepwise behavior of the estimates follows from the quantization effect of the Euler number and the sharp drops in the dynamic evolution predicts the topological transformation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, the static and dynamic deformations of full three-dimensional vesicle membranes under the elastic bending energy, with prescribed bulk volume and surface area, are considered. Full three-dimensional numerical simulations based on the energetic variational approach with diffusive interface approximation are carried out. This constitutes another step in our systematic development for an energetic variational approach in the modeling of vesicle membranes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> for a detailed documentation of our recent progress). With the use of Lagrange multipliers, our model can effectively incorporate constraints for preserving the volume and surface area, as well as the geometric constraints for the molecule sizes. Several possible schemes for the numerical implementation are discussed. Some interesting experiments are given to illustrate the transformation of the vesicle shapes. The results not only verified our earlier attempts for the axial-symmetric configurations, they also covered new cases including non axial-symmetric cases and with the presence of the spontaneous curvatures. Applications to the study of geometrically constrained self-assembly phenomena and effective ways to identify the topological events are also provided. Extensions to include the effects of external fields such as fluid flows and electro-magnetic fields are currently under investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we would like to stress that the current work constitutes only one step in our attempt to establish a unified energetic variational phase field method for the systematic study of the deformation and configuration of vesicle membranes. The framework consists of the derivation of different dynamic and static equations and the development of the corresponding numerical algorithms and codes. There are many issues that remain open and will be pursued in our future work. In order to understand the interaction between the vesicles in our system, we will examine more closely the relation between the final and the initial membrane configurations. We will try to compare with the interface morphology and evolution in experimental observations. Moreover, since the information from the experimental works often are the reflection of combined effects, more careful study on the relation between the parameters in our system and the physical properties of the specific vesicle membrane materials will be needed in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

The top row shows the case where a non-zero spontaneous curvature is given on the top and bottom of an ellipsoidal disk, causing the budding formation at these two points on the surface. The bottom row shows the results of the transformation of an ellipsoid with a non-zero spontaneous curvature in eight symmetrically located points.</figDesc><graphic coords="15,56.69,357.49,425.52,188.64" type="bitmap" /></figure>
