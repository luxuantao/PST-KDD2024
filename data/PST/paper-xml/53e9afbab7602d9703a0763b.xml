<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> are revolutionizing distributed sensing in a wide range of application domains, ranging from home automation to process monitoring, healthcare analysis, weather forecasting, military situation awareness, and traffic control. Sensor nodes in a WSN can generate a large amount of real-time, in-situ contextual data about a specific monitored space, e.g. agricultural field, city quarter, building, room, human body. The capabilities of a WSN do not only involve collection and forwarding of raw sensor readings, but also include in-node/in-network data processing (e.g. aggregation and merging) and, sometimes, innetwork complex elaboration, such as event detection, object tracking and classification based on even sophisticated distributed classification algorithms.</p><p>A specific class of WSN is Body Sensor Networks (BSN) that represents an emerging platform for many human-centered applications, spanning from medical to sports performance monitoring, gaming, and social networking. As a result of the advancements of ubiquitous and increasingly powerful wearable devices, to support the wide variety of application contexts, there exists a growing number of health monitoring systems with sophisticated capabilities. Moreover, there is enormous public interest in products that allow individuals, ranging from children to elders, to monitor and improve their own health and lifestyle.</p><p>In a common healthcare scenario, assisted livings monitored by BSN are able to gather data streams to not only process in real-time but also store them into remote medical data repositories. This implies a huge amount of data to be transmitted, stored and analyzed. In the coming years, BSN are likely to be exploited to allow for implicit social interaction among people, who can exchange private/public information through their worn BSN nodes when they come into contact. BSN of co-located people can be also exploited as a mobile sensor infrastructure to support other context-aware applications such as disaster, medical emergency and mass event management. In such context, management of a large number of disparate BSN as well as cooperative BSN to support various applications is a crucial issue to deal with. Moreover, the huge amount of data, that a BSN is able to deliver, demands a powerful, scalable storage and processing infrastructure to perform both online and offline analysis of BSN data streams.</p><p>BSN, with their huge amount of gathered sensor data and their limited processing power, can be empowered by exploiting a Cloud computing infrastructure to realize an integrated platform that provides: (a) the ability to utilize heterogeneous sensors; (b) scalability of data storage; (c) scalability of processing power for different kinds of data analysis; (d) global access to the processing and storage infrastructure; (e) easy sharing of results; and (f) payas-you-go pricing for using BSN services.</p><p>In the last few years, there have been an increasing number of initiatives to develop distributed platforms based on BSN for e-Health applications. Many national and international research projects in academia, industry and government focus on the development and deployment of Health Care platforms in which wearable wireless sensors are attached to patients for enabling 24/7 monitoring of vital parameters, such as CodeBlue, DexterNet, and SPINE (Signal Processing In-Node Environment). Apart from companies working in the e-Health domain, there are also initial important investments in this field from Telecommunications operators that foresee e-Health at home as a strategic business. There are already several international forums (workshops and conferences) focusing on Health-Care and BSN: BSN, Bodynets, Pervasive Health, PETRA, and so on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Motivations and challenges</head><p>The need of integrating BSN with Cloud computing can be motivated by discussing the following issues related to BSN: Data management. BSN data management deals with how data is produced (also known as processed or raw sensor data streams), continuously and in real-time efficiently collected, stored and eventually transferred for processing. Such management may be distributed in time and/or space <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Time distribution refers to activities taking place at different times, while being coordinated to have a common goal. Space distribution means that activities may take place at different locations, while they are networked. A Cloud computing infrastructure can facilitate such data management through the provision of large-scale storage platform.</p><p>Data processing. The collected data from single BSN is usually processed to obtain higher level information and/or data cumulative charts related to a single monitored assisted living. In the presence of a large number of incoming sensor streams from multiple BSN, processing of data to produce critical information/decisions in realtime requires fast processing that is usually computation intensive. The exploitation of the computational resources of a Cloud infrastructure can fully support such demand of intensive computation power.</p><p>Data analysis. Annotated BSN datasets can be imported into analysis tools and data modeling is performed for further use in various applications and decision making systems. The analysis operations depend on suitable storage and middleware technologies to perform highly swift data processing. It can be availed by exploiting the processing power of Cloud to provide faster response. Moreover, workflow-oriented methods can be exploited to define effective automatic processes to extract knowledge from the annotated BSN datasets.</p><p>Application development. The development of large-scale BSN applications is a complex task, involving not only the programming in-the-small of the BSN worn by single assisted livings but particularly the programming in-the-large of applications able to coordinate distributed collection, processing and storing of body sensor streams produced by BSN in an application-specific context. To this purpose, Software as a Service (SaaS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> approach based on Cloud infrastructure, coupled with an efficient BSN framework, can be exploited. It is also important to define the paradigm that the SaaS approach could be centered on.</p><p>In this special issue, we are specifically interested in the integration of BSN with a Cloud infrastructure that poses challenges related to data management, developing and computing. In the following we first briefly enumerate the main BSN-related issues, followed by a more in-depth discussion of specific challenges regarding the integration of BSN with Cloud computing to perform effective distributed body sensor stream management and largescale BSN application development.</p><p>Specific BSN issues to deal with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> include:</p><p>Wireless communications. BSN mostly use wireless connectivity for data exchange. The wireless communications should be able to reduce interference and increase the co-existence of sensor nodes with other networked devices. This is to ensure that the functionalities of BSN nodes are not degraded due to the presence of other devices capable of possible interruption in seamless data transmission.</p><p>System interoperability. A BSN system requires ensuring seamless data transfer across different standards to promote information exchange, plug-and-play device interaction and uninterrupted connectivity.</p><p>Sensor heterogeneity. A BSN system should be capable of integrating various different sensors in terms of complexity, power efficiency, storage, and ease-of-use. Moreover, it should provide a common interface between the sensors and a storage service to facilitate remote storage and viewing of sensed data as well as access to external processing and networked analysis tools.</p><p>Security. Transmission of BSN data streams should be secured to prevent potential intruders.</p><p>Privacy. One key concern of BSN users is to protect the privacy of personal data. A BSN system should ensure that assisted living's privacy is maintained even when data is being analyzed using an external tool. In addition, social awareness and acceptance is required for wider applications of BSN.</p><p>Data validation and consistency. Data collected from multiple sensor nodes need to be collected and analyzed in a seamless fashion. BSN sensors are subject to inherent communications, hardware and network failures that may result in erroneous datasets. It is crucial that the sensed data is validated and data quality is maintained to reduce any noise in the data and identify possible weakness in the infrastructure.</p><p>System programming. Developing applications on BSN requires many efforts due to the lack of proper software abstractions and the difficulties in managing resource-constrained embedded environments. For these reasons, in the last years several frameworks and middlewares have been conceived and made available to support high-level programming of BSN applications. However, there is still the need of defining new paradigms and tools for a more effective programming of efficient BSN systems.</p><p>Development methodologies and tools. Apart from programming frameworks, the development of BSN applications needs to be tackled by exploiting specific software engineering methodologies able to support the development lifecycle of such systems: from analysis to implementation and deployment. On the other hand, integration of BSN with a Cloud computing infrastructure poses the following major research challenges:</p><p>Interfacing the Cloud with BSN. There should be an interface between BSN resources and the Cloud fabric. Communication interfaces are to be built to manage network connectivity between BSN and the Cloud. BSN nodes may be exposed as Cloud services and indexed via indexing services. Provision should be offered to manage sensing processes and data. Sensor virtualization will therefore be a key approach. Moreover various services for the underlying sensor resources, such as power management, security, availability, and QoS, need to be specifically provided.</p><p>Sensor stream management. Data management will include data format conversion into standard formats, data cleaning and aggregation to improve data quality, and data transfer to storage Clouds.</p><p>Massive scale and real time processing. Integration of heterogeneous BSN generating big data is a challenge due to the amount of information that is required to be processed in real-time. If BSN is used to generate real-time multimedia content such as streaming video, audio and images, it poses additional challenges to efficiently and accurately process and store the data in a Cloud environment.</p><p>Complex event processing. Real-time data streams from BSN may trigger certain events and services in the Cloud. This data streams are analyzed and results are used in applications for decision making by identifying contextual and situational information/knowledge. Advanced off-line data analysis and analytics. While heterogeneous and real-time BSN data feeds allow improving decision making by using data and decision-level fusion techniques, the definition of business intelligence tools to maximize knowledge extraction from massively collocated information (big data) in the Cloud is a challenge.</p><p>Large-scale computing frameworks. The allocation of computational and storage resources as well as data migration in the Cloud is critical when multiple BSN data sources are highly decentralized. This is particularly challenging when the data sets and their corresponding access/search services are geographically distributed within the Cloud.</p><p>Development methodologies and tools. The development of largescale BSN systems is a complex task that needs suitable and effective software engineering methodologies/approaches. Specifically, an application needs to be designed at a higher level of modeling abstraction, implemented according to a given approach and then seamlessly deployed onto the distributed BSN/Cloud platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Related work</head><p>In the recent years, there have been an increasing number of initiatives to develop distributed platforms based on BSN mainly for e-Health applications. Many national and international research projects in academia, industry and government focus on the development and deployment of health care platforms in which wearable sensors are attached to patients for enabling round-the-clock monitoring of vital parameters. Examples of such projects include CodeBlue <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, DexterNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, SPINE <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and Titan <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. These systems provide programming abstractions based both on low-level TinyOS system programming for sensors, and on J2ME and Android API for mobile devices; however, they do not address the issues of integrating a Cloud infrastructure to provide extended scalability, seamless data streaming and data analysis.</p><p>Recently researchers have investigated the integration of WSNs/BSN with large-scale distributed computing infrastructures. Examples include an integration architecture of Cloud computing and WSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Open Sensor Web Architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the Sensor-Cloud infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and so forth. These works describe architectural models, case study and identify some related development issues. However, there is still a gap to develop a Cloud-based infrastructure that is targeted to BSN applications, such as those listed in Section 2. The following research works aim at tackling the fulfillment of such a gap.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> authors propose the development of an autonomic Cloud environment for hosting an ECG data analysis service. In particular, they propose an autonomic Cloud environment that collects people's health data and stores them to a Cloud-based information repository and facilitates analysis on the data using software services hosted in the Cloud. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a secure and scalable Cloud-based architecture for e-Health WSNs is proposed. The aim is to support (i) body sensor data collection from patients both hospitalized and at home, and (ii) medical data management for e-Health monitoring. A Cloud infrastructure is used for storing and retrieving the collected BSN data. Security protocols and mechanisms are defined to provide data security.</p><p>Although, sensor data collection is provided by all architecture and is based on a (static and/or mobile) gateway device that gathers data from the body worn sensors and transmits them to the Cloud through an Internet-based connection, the exploited technologies are different at application, protocol and system level. It is worth noting that SAaaS uses a complex software framework at the gateway side called Hypervisor, which is able to manage not only sensor reading collection but also to control actuator devices.</p><p>Sensor data management is based on different paradigms (datadriven pipes and filters, rule-based planning, virtual sensors, and workflow-oriented). However, not all specify the sensor data management paradigm. The processing framework is basically the execution engine of the sensor data management paradigm carried out at SaaS level or at PaaS level. While most architecture provide some sort of Cloud storage a few related work are based on stand-alone databases, and do not specify the use of a persistent storage. It is worth noting that a system integrating BSN and Cloud infrastructure should incorporate a end-to-end decision making process through a flexible and distributed workflow-oriented model, as well as offer a customizable visualization service for user-defined views on sensor data and analysis results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Overview and Scope of the Special Issue</head><p>The aim of this special issue is to provide a comprehensive guide on new ideas and results in the BSN-Cloud domain. In particular, it focuses on the state of the art, architecture, and associated techniques for BSN-Cloud integration, allowing collection and dissemination of health data from BSN to a storage Cloud repository, and processing and analysis of the stored data using software services hosted in the Cloud. It also identifies potential research directions and technologies that will drive innovations within this domain.</p><p>This special issue is a timely contribution to a field that is gaining considerable research interest, momentum, and is expected to be of increasing interest to commercial developers. In particular, this special issue makes a three-fold integrated contribution:</p><p>It presents the current research about BSN-Cloud integration, by communicating outstanding research papers.</p><p>It promotes the BSN and Cloud computing disciplines by integrating different perspectives, ranging from infrastructure, secure data sharing, to BSN-Cloud data routing.</p><p>Through the inclusion of high quality papers, it presents open research issues and attempts to address key problems that will enhance the evolution of next-generation BSN-based platforms.</p><p>We anticipate that this special issue will establish a pathway for the development of future generation large-scale wearable sensorbased systems. Thus, the papers of this special issue will not only serve as a snapshot of the state-of-the-art research in BSN and identify future developments, but also will be used as reference for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Organization</head><p>This special issue includes six high quality papers from experts in this BSN-Cloud domain. They have been selected from a large number of submissions, with acceptance rate of 31.58%. Each submitted papers have been reviewed by renowned scholars who provided excellent feedback to improve the quality, content and structure of the papers. The selected six papers are chosen in a way that they cover the top topics on integration of BSN and Cloud computing (see Section 2).</p><p>Fortino et al. in their paper, ''BodyCloud: A SaaS Approach for Community Body Sensor Networks'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> propose a SaaS approach for community BSN that supports the development and deployment of Cloud assisted BSN applications. BodyCloud is a multi-tier application-level architecture that integrates a Cloud computing platform and BSN data streams middleware. BodyCloud provides programming abstractions that allow the rapid development of community BSN applications. BodyCloud endeavors to support several cross-disciplinary applications and specialized processing tasks. It enables large-scale data sharing and collaborations among users and applications in the Cloud, and delivers Cloud services via sensor-rich mobile devices. BodyCloud also offers decision support services to take further actions based on the analyzed BSN data. This work describes the general architecture of the proposed approach and presents a case study for the real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG (electrocardiography) data streams of many individuals. The case study highlights the effectiveness of BodyCloud in supporting the development of Cloud-assisted BSN applications.</p><p>In ''Authentication of Lossy Data in Body-Sensor Networks for Cloud-based Healthcare Monitoring'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Ali et al. propose, analyse, and validate a practical, lightweight robust authentication scheme suitable for health-monitoring. In their model, the bodyworn device needs only to perform digital signatures infrequently (e.g. once an hour, over a large block of data), thereby reducing energy costs, and the receiver can verify most of the data even in the presence of losses. They developed an authentication scheme that is both low-cost and loss-resilient, and designed a framework for optimizing placement of network coding within the tree to maximize data variability for a given overhead and loss environment. Finally, they validated the scheme using experimental traces of typical operating conditions to show that it achieves high success at very low overhead and cost.</p><p>To minimize the traffic going to and coming from cloud ECG compression, Ibaida et al. in their paper ''Cloud Enabled Fractal Based ECG Compression in Wireless Body Sensor Networks'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, presented a new fractal based ECG lossy compression technique. The proposed technique is based on modifying the popular fractal model to be used in compression in conjunction with Iterated Function System. ECG signal is divided into equal blocks called range blocks. Subsequently, another down sampled copy of the ECG signal is created which is called domain. For each range block the most similar block in the domain is found. As a result, fractal coefficients (i.e. parameters defining fractal compression model) are calculated and stored inside the compressed file for each ECG signal range block. In order to make our technique cloud friendly, the decompression operation is designed in such a way that allows the user to retrieve part of the file (i.e ECG segment) without decompressing the whole file. Therefore, the clients do not need to download the full compressed file before they can view the result. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and compared with other existing lossy ECG compression techniques. It is found that the proposed technique can achieve higher compression ratio of 40 with lower Percentage Residual Difference Value less than 1%.</p><p>In the paper ''A Platform for Secure Monitoring and Sharing of Generic Health Data in the Cloud'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Thilakanathan et al. addressed the issues of privacy and security in the domain of mobile telecare and Cloud computing. They demonstrated a telecare application that will allow doctors to remotely monitor patients via the Cloud. They use this system as a basis to showcase a model that will allow patients to share their health information with other doctors, nurses or medical professionals in a secure and confidential manner. The key features of the model include the ability to handle large data sizes and efficient user revocation. The authors also addressed the problems of achieving efficient user revocation, especially when considering large data sizes. For this, they defined a secure data sharing model and protocol, and demonstrated the feasibility of the protocol through a prototype which combines smartphone, Bluetooth and Cloud computing technologies.</p><p>With the myriad of distributed Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems at play, each with unique requirements and eccentricities, the challenge lies in the need to service these disparate systems with a middleware layer that is both coherent and flexible. There is significant complexity in the management of sensor data and the derivation of contextual information, as well as in the monitoring of user activities and in locating appropriate situational services. Forkan et al. in the paper ''CoCaMAAL: A Cloudoriented Context-aware Middleware in Ambient Assisted Living'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, presented the CoCaMAAL model that seeks to address such issues and implement a service oriented architecture (SOA) for unified context generation. This is done by efficiently aggregating raw sensor data and timely selecting appropriate services using a context management system (CMS). The authors developed a prototype of the model and implemented some case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p><p>To provide reasonable energy consumption and to improve the network lifetime of BSN systems, Chang and Ju in their paper ''An Energy-saving Routing Architecture with a Uniform Clustering Algorithm for Wireless Body Sensor Networks'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, presented an energy-saving routing architecture with a uniform clustering algorithm. The authors adopted centralized and cluster-based techniques to create a cluster-tree routing structure for the sensor nodes. The main goal of this scheme is to reduce the data transmission distances of the sensor nodes by using the uniform cluster structure concepts. To make an ideal cluster distribution, the distances between the sensor nodes are calculated, and the residual energy of each sensor node is accounted for when selecting the appropriate cluster head nodes. On the basis of the uniform cluster location, the data transmission distances between the sensor nodes can be reduced by using an adaptive multi-hop approach. The energy consumption is reduced, and the lifetime is extended for the sensor nodes by balancing the network load among the clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the previously known schemes in terms of the energy consumption and the network lifetime of the BSN.</p></div>
