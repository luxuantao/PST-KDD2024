<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Supervisory control is usually considered as an external control mechanism to a system by controlling the occurrences of its controllable events.

Based on Petri nets, a deadlock prevention approach always aims to design a controller to ensure that deadlocks never occur. Behavioral permissiveness is an important criterion in evaluating the performance of a supervisor. A maximally permissive supervisor can generally lead to high utilization of resources and productivity of a system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>F LEXIBLE manufacturing systems (FMSs) are a typical automated production system where a number of shared resources are involved to finish various kinds of jobs. However, if the resources are improperly allocated, deadlocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> may occur. They must be avoided since their occurrences drastically decrease the productivity of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Petri nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> have been considered as a suitable tool to tackle deadlock problems in FMSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. Deadlock prevention always uses an offline mechanism to enforce constraints to a system. In the framework of Petri nets, a supervisor always consists of a set of control places and arcs connecting them to the transitions in the Petri net to be controlled. In this case, the supervisor provides a proper control mechanism to decide to enable or disable the transitions at different markings. The most advantage of a deadlock prevention approach is that once it is established, deadlocks never occur.</p><p>Many researchers focus on the design of deadlock prevention policies by using Petri nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. Generally, three criteria are considered in the designing and evaluating their performance, i.e., behavioral permissiveness, structural complexity, and computational complexity. Based on them, much work has been done, aiming to find a live Petri net supervisor with the maximally permissive behavior, a simple structure, and low computational overheads.</p><p>A maximally permissive, also called optimal, Petri net supervisor can make all legal markings of the original net reachable. Thus, it can likely lead to high utilization of the system resources. The theory of regions is an effective approach to find an optimal supervisor if it exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. It first generates the reachability graph of a Petri net model and then finds all marking/transition separation instances (MTSIs). An MTSI is a pair of a marking and a transition where is a legal marking and once fires at , the system reaches an illegal marking. An iterative approach to design optimal supervisors is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. At each iteration, a control place is computed to implement an MTSI by disabling at . Once all MTSIs are implemented, the controlled net is live with all legal markings. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>, Uzam and Zhou provide an iterative method to design liveness-enforcing supervisors for FMSs. They divide the reachability graph of a Petri net model into two parts: live-zone (LZ) and deadlock-zone (DZ), where the LZ contains all legal markings and the DZ includes all dead markings and bad markings from which no legal marking is reached. They first find the set of first-met bad markings (FBMs) of a net model. An FBM is an illegal marking that represents the very first entry from LZ to DZ. At each iteration, an FBM is singled out and a control place is designed to forbid it. The process cannot terminate until all FBMs are forbidden. The method is easy to use but cannot lead to an optimal supervisor in general.</p><p>Motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>, our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> also provides an iterative approach to design optimal Petri net supervisors for FMSs. A vector covering approach is developed to remarkably reduce the considered legal markings and FBMs. Then, an integer linear programming problem (ILPP) is designed to compute an optimal control place to forbid a selected FBM but no legal marking. Once all FBMs are forbidden, the controlled net is live with all legal markings. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we propose an ILPP to minimize the number of the obtained control places. Though it is both behaviorally and structurally optimal, it suffers from the computational complexity problem since the ILPP has too many constraints and variables.</p><p>All the above work is based on place invariants (PIs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref> to design control places, each of which is used to enforce a linear constraint. The supervisor consists of a set of control places, aiming to enforce the conjunctions of constraints to a system to be controlled. In this case, one cannot find an optimal supervisor if the legal state space of a Petri net model is nonconvex. For instance, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) shows a Petri net model that cannot be optimally controlled by a set of conjunctive constraints. This fact can be verified by the theory of regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> as follows. The net model has 15 reachable states, . None of them has an optimal monitor solution by the methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. Therefore, all the methods proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> cannot provide an optimal pure net supervisor for this example. Note that a pure Petri net means that it has no self-loops. That is to say, the Petri net model does not have an optimal pure Petri net supervisor expressed by a set of control places. The reason is that its legal state space is nonconvex, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>.</p><p>It can be seen that there are two legal markings and and an FBM . Since the legal space is nonconvex, we cannot make the two legal markings reachable and the FBM unreachable by linear constraints. However, the legal space can be classified into two subsets: and , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(b), which are associated with the linear constraints: and , respectively, where denotes the marking of . Since every legal marking satisfies or , and each constraint can forbid all FBMs. Thus, the optimal control purpose can be enforced by the disjunctions of the two constraints. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c</ref>) shows an optimal supervisor to implement the disjunctions of the constraints, which can make the net live with all legal markings.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Iordache and Antsaklis provide a structural solution for labeled Petri nets to enforce disjunctive constraints, where the supervisor includes not only the added control places but also some added transitions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, they extend the results by considering the firing vector. However, the supervisor proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> contains arcs connecting the added transitions to the places in the original net. In this case, the supervisor may change the states of the net model. A supervisor is always used to decide to disable or enable a transition at every marking. Thus, traditionally, the supervisor should control the transitions of a Petri net but not change its states.</p><p>According to the above remarks, this paper aims to optimally design a Petri net supervisor for an FMS. If the legal state space is nonconvex, we cannot restrict the model running in the legal space by the enforcement of conjunctive constraints. In this case, we classify the set of legal markings into several subsets. Each subset can be implemented by a linear constraint while all FBMs are forbidden by it. Then, the optimal control purposes can be implemented by the disjunctions of the constraints. An ILPP is also proposed to classify the set of legal markings into as few subsets as possible, aiming to obtain the minimal number of constraints. Hence, the supervisory structure can be kept simple. In summary, this work makes the following contributions.</p><p>1) For a Petri net model of an FMS, an optimal control mechanism is proposed by considering the classification of legal markings. We first divide the set of legal markings into multi-subsets. Then, a linear constraint is designed for each subset, where all markings in the subset satisfy the constraint but each FBM does not. Then, the system is optimally controlled by the disjunctions of the constraints for all subsets of legal markings. Experimental results show that it can optimally control the Petri net models whose legal spaces are nonconvex. 2) An ILPP is formulated to obtain a set of constraints, where each constraint can forbid all FBMs and every legal marking satisfies at least one constraint. That is to say, the disjunctions of all obtained constraints can make all the legal markings reachable and all FBMs unreachable. The objective function is to minimize the number of constraints. Meanwhile, a vector covering approach is applied to reduce the number of considered markings, aiming to lessen the computational overhead of the proposed method. 3) A Petri net supervisory structure is proposed for the disjunctions of linear constraints. Added transitions are included in the supervisor but there is no arc between the added transitions and the places in the original net. This means that the supervisor only controls the transitions in the original net but does not change its states. A modified ILPP is proposed to obtain a set of constraints whose disjunctions can be implemented by the proposed supervisory structure. 4) The proposed method is general since it is applicable to all FMS-oriented classes of Petri net models in the literature, which include PPN <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Basics of Petri nets used throughout this paper and a well-known based control place synthesis method <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref> are recalled in Section II. Section III proposes an optimal control mechanism by classifying legal markings. The application of a vector covering approach is provided in Section IV.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. OPTIMAL CONTROL BY CLASSIFYING LEGAL MARKINGS</head><p>This section proposes a technique to optimally control an FMS by classifying into a number of subsets where each subset is associated with a linear constraint. Then, the optimal control purpose can be achieved by the disjunctions of these constraints. Suppose that the control goal is to enforce the disjunctions of the linear constraints, as presented below <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where is the number of constraints and 's and 's are non-negative integers. Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> indicates that at least one of the constraints must be satisfied. Let denote the th constraint:</p><p>, where is a vector with , . Definition 1: Let be the set of reachable markings of a net and a linear constraint. The set of reachable markings under constraint is defined as . Theorem 1: All markings in are reachable if ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is enforced.</p><p>Proof: The proof is trivial. Definition 2: Let be the set of reachable markings of a net and a linear constraint. The set of forbidding markings under constraint is defined as . Theorem 2: All markings in are forbidden if (9) is enforced.</p><p>Proof: The proof is trivial. Take the net in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) as an example to demonstrate the above statements. Suppose that there are two constraints : and : . According to Definition 1, we have and . By Definition 2, we have and . Since and , by Theorems 1 and 2, the disjunctions of and can make all legal markings reachable and all FBMs unreachable. Hence, by combining the two theorems, we have the following result on the optimal control of a net.</p><p>Theorem 3: Let and be the sets of legal markings and FBMs of a net , respectively, and 's linear constraints. Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) can enforce optimal liveness-enforcing control if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p>1) ; 2)</p><p>. Proof: By Theorem 1 and Condition 1), <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> can ensure that all legal markings are reachable, i.e., it is maximally permissive. Similarly, according to Theorem 2, Condition 2) can ensure that all FBMs are forbidden by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, i.e., the controlled net is live. Hence, (9) can enforce an optimal liveness-enforcing control purpose if Conditions 1) and 2) are satisfied.</p><p>According to Condition 1) in Theorem 3, a marking is reachable if it satisfies at least one of the constraints. For the optimal control purposes, any legal marking must be reachable. Therefore, we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Equation ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) is called the optimal control condition.</p><p>By Condition 2) in Theorem 3, a marking is forbidden if it is forbidden by every constraint. For the liveness control purposes, all FBMs must be forbidden. Therefore, we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Equation ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) is called the liveness control condition.</p><p>According to Theorem 3, if a set of constraints 's satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, then (9) can achieve an optimal control purpose. However, (10) cannot be directly considered as a constraint for an ILPP. In this case, we introduce a set of binary variables 's to represent the relation between each legal marking and each constraint . Specially, indicates that satisfies and implies that does not satisfy . Then, ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) is rewritten as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where is a positive constant that must be big enough. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, if , it becomes . While, if , it is , implying that this constraint does not restrict 's and . Since must satisfy at least one constraint, we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> Combining ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), we can obtain an ILPP to determine 's and 's. Then, (9) can be used to achieve the optimal control purposes. However, there are too many constraints in the ILPP if all legal markings and all FBMs are considered. In the next section, a vector covering approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is applied to remarkably reduce the legal markings and FBMs that must be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. REDUCTION OF CONSIDERED MARKINGS</head><p>This paper considers the Petri net models of FMSs, where the places can be classified into three categories: idle, operation, and resource places whose sets are denoted as , , and , respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Tokens in an idle place represent the maximal number of concurrent operations that may happen in a production sequence. An operation place represents an operation to be processed for a part in a production sequence and initially has no token. Resource places represent the resources in an FMS and their initial tokens represent the number of available resource units.</p><p>In Uzam and Zhou's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>, only the tokens in operation places are considered to construct a . Accordingly, we develop a marking reduction technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to reduce the number of the markings in and , which must be considered. In the following, denotes for an expedient description and a multiset formalism is used to represent the marking for the sake of simplicity, i.e., . Since only the operation places are considered, the disjunctions of constraints, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, is rewritten as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) are modified, respectively, as follows:</p><p>(15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> Next, the vector covering approach originally from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>   <ref type="formula">16</ref>), all legal markings satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><p>Proof: It follows immediately from Theorem 4. Corollary 2 indicates that we need to consider markings in only, instead of , to guarantee the optimal control purposes. Therefore, ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) can be reduced as <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Accordingly, ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is reduced as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> By considering the example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>, there are only one and two markings in and , respectively. Specially, we have and . If satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, all FBMs satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Similarly, if and satisfy ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), all legal markings satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><p>Equations ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) can determine variables 's and 's . Then, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> can keep the maximally permissive behavior of the system to be controlled. However, there is still a problem that we do not know the number of constraints required for a net. That is to say, we cannot obtain the proper value of . In the next section, we propose an ILPP to find the minimal value of .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. OPTIMAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE SET OF LEGAL MARKINGS</head><p>As stated in the previous section, we do not know that how many constraints are needed. In the worst case, each legal marking in is associated with a constraint. That is to say, . In fact, the number of constraints to be computed is much less than the cardinality of . Suppose that there are constraints initially. Next, we select the minimal number of constraints in the constraints. A variable is introduced for each constraint and we have the following constraints: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where implies that is selected and indicates that is redundant and there is no need to add it as a constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> indicates that, if is not selected, no legal marking necessarily satisfies it.</p><p>Finally, we formulate the following ILPP to find the minimal number of constraints whose disjunctions can optimally control a Petri net model, which is denoted as the Minimal Number of Disjunctive Constraints (MNDC) problem. MNDC</p><p>The objective function is used to minimize the number of constraints that are selected. Denote its optimal value by . If MNDC has an optimal solution, then we can claim that the considered Petri net model can be optimally controlled by the disjunctions of constraints and the minimal number of constraints is , as stated next.</p><p>Theorem 5: Given a Petri net model, if MNDC has an optimal solution , then the net can be optimally controlled by the disjunctions of the minimal number of constraints. Proof: Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">21</ref>) ensures that every obtained constraint can forbid all FBMs in . By Corollary 1, every constraint can forbid all FBMs of the net. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, every legal marking in satisfies at least one obtained constraint. By Corollary 2, every legal marking of the net model satisfies at least one constraint. Hence, by Theorem 3, the disjunctions of all obtained constraints, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, can optimally control the net. In addition, the objective function ensures that the minimal number of constraints is selected, which equals the optimal solution . In summary, the conclusion holds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE I THE NUMBERS OF CONSTRAINTS AND VARIABLES IN MNDC</head><p>It is well-known that an ILPP is NP-hard. The computational time for finding an optimal solution of an ILPP greatly depends on the number of the constraints and variables in it. Therefore, we discuss MNDC in the sense of the number of its constraints and variables. The numbers of the constraints in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">21</ref>) -( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) are , , , and , respectively. Thus, the total number of the constraints in MNDC is</p><p>. Next, we consider the number of its variables. The number of variables 's is . The number of variables 's for each legal marking is . The number of both variables 's and 's is . Finally, MNDC has variables in total. The number of the two instances in MNDC is summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. Now, we discuss the initial value of . Suppose that there exist the minimal number of constraints whose disjunctions can optimally control a given Petri net model and denote the number as . If is too small, i.e., , MNDC has no solution and we cannot find the minimal number of disjunctive constraints. In this case, we can increase and solve it again. Therefore, the proper range for is from to . The closer the given is to , the more efficient the proposed method is. The best case is that initially happens to be . Then a minimal number of constraints can be obtained and MNDC has a small number of constraints and variables. However, given a net model, we do not know the exact value of before solving MNDC. That is to say, it is hard to set initially. One simple solution is varying from 1 to and the process terminates once MNDC has an optimal solution. The other solution is to set initially by experiences. Once MNDC has no solution, we can increase until it has one. In fact, it is possible that MNDC has no solution with . In this case, the given net cannot be optimally controlled by disjunctive constraints. The reason is that the state space of its FBMs is nonconvex. Each of the constraints must forbid all FBMs. That is to say, every FBM should satisfy the liveness control condition, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, which indicates that it can be considered as the conjunctions of linear constraints. Thus, one cannot forbid all FBMs without removing legal markings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> if the state space of FBMs is nonconvex. This situation is similar to the case that one cannot optimally control a net by the conjunctions of linear constraints if the state space of its legal markings is nonconvex.</p></div>

SUPERVISORY STRUCTURE FOR DISJUNCTIONS OF CONSTRAINTS</head><p>This section develops a supervisory structure for the disjunctions of linear constraints. Just as stated in Section II-C, each constraint in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) can be implemented by a control place , i.e.,</p><p>where denotes the marking of . In order to implement the disjunctions of constraints, we introduce an additional structure for , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Now, we analyze the additional structure in detail. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, is an integer constant that must be no less than the upper bound of . The upper bound can be easily computed from a Petri net model of an FMS since the tokens in each operation place is limited by the capacity of the resources required by the operation. In the additional structure of a control place, is called the release transition of . Once fires, it puts tokens in and one token in . Then it does not disable any transition of the net model to be controlled since it has enough tokens. In this case, cannot enforce the th constraint .</p><p>is called the restriction transition of . Once is enabled and fires, it removes tokens from and one token from . In this case, can enforce the th constraint again. is 1-bounded and called the flag place of . The fact that it has one token in means that the th constraint is not enforced and no token in indicates that the th constraint is enforced.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, at least one of the constraints must be satisfied. Thus, at least one flag place is empty, which can be represented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> where is the marking of place . The constraint can be easily transformed into a by introducing a control place <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> where denotes the marking of . By using the based method in Section II-C, we can obtain the control place , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. An algorithm to design the supervisory structure for the disjunctions of constraints is presented below. Algorithm 1: Design of a supervisory structure for the disjunctions of constraints.</p><p>Input: A set of constraints 's and their upper bounds 's, .</p><p>Output: A Petri net supervisory structure for the disjunctions of the set of constraints 's, . Take the net in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) as an example. The net can be optimally controlled by the disjunctions of two constraints: and . The supervisory structure can be obtained by Algorithm 1, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c</ref>). It can be verified that the controlled net is live with 17 markings that include all the 11 legal markings and six extra markings generated by the added supervisory structure. The results verify that the proposed method can optimally control the net that cannot be dealt with by the theory of regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> and our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>However, the proposed supervisory structure may have a problem that it cannot transform the feasibility of one constraint to the other immediately by the firing of a transition. It can be explained in detail as follows. Suppose that and are two disjunctive constraints and a legal marking satisfies but not . Let be a transition that is enabled at with . If satisfies but not , then is disabled by the proposed supervisory structure since it cannot transform the feasibility of to immediately by firing . A simple example is used to illustrate the problem as follows.</p><p>A Petri net is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(a)</ref>, where there are two constraints : and :</p><p>. The upper bounds of the two constraints are one since both and can have at most one token. The supervisory structure to enforce the disjunctions of the two constraints are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(b</ref>). There exists a reachable marking in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(a), at which is enabled. Once fires, it yields a new marking . It can be seen that satisfies but not , while satisfies but not . Thus, should be a legal marking reachable from by firing , i.e., . However, the proposed supervisor disables at , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(c</ref>). Note that the two disjunctive constraints in this example can be transformed into a linear constraint . In the light of the above remarks, we provide a sufficient condition to avoid this problem. Since the problem arises when the firing of a transition can transform the feasibility of a constraint to another constraint. Thus, a sufficient condition is that a transition that is an input transition of a control place is not an output transition of another control places. Let be the set of control places. A formal representation of the condition is presented below, where is the set of transitions of a net <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> Equation ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) also can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> Theorem 6: The proposed supervisory structure (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) can optimally control a given net model by enforcing a set of disjunctive constraints if , where denotes the set of control places.</p><p>Proof: First, we prove that the proposed supervisory structure can ensure that at least one of the constraints must be satisfied. From the supervisory structure, once fires, it puts tokens in and one token in . Then, does not disable any transition of the original net model since it has enough tokens. In this case, cannot enforce the th constraint . Once is enabled and fires, it removes tokens from and one token from . In this case, can enforce the th constraint again. Thus, if has one token, the th constraint is not enforced and no token in indicates that the th constraint is enforced. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, place can ensure that at least one constraint is satisfied. In summary, the proposed supervisory structure can enforce the disjunctions of constraints.</p><p>Next, we prove that any legal marking is reachable. It is obvious that the initial marking is reachable. Let and be two legal makings with ( ) in the original net. Suppose that is reachable. Now we prove that the presented supervisor does not disable at , i.e., is reachable. Since is a legal marking, it satisfies at least one constraint. Suppose that satisfies constraints whose according control place is . Since , there are two subcases: 1) and 2) and . For Case 1), since satisfies , we have . Therefore, we can let ( ). Then, no control places in can disable since each of them can have enough tokens. Considering , does not disable . Thus, can fire at . For Case 2), if does not disable , it is similar to Case 1), i.e., no control places can disable . We assume that disables at . This means that once fires at , the new marking, , does not satisfy . Since is also a legal marking, it must satisfy at least one constraint. Suppose that satisfies . Since , i.e., , the firing of does not add any token in . Thus, also satisfies . That is to say, can fire at , which leads to a marking with . In this case, can fire. Once it fires, we have a new marking with and there are enough tokens in . That is to say, can fire at , i.e., is reachable from . Thus, we can claim that the presented supervisory structure can make all legal markings reachable.</p><p>Finally, we show that all FBMs are forbidden by the supervisory structure. Since each FBM is forbidden by all constraints and the presented supervisory structure ensures that at least one constraint must be satisfied at any marking, all FBMs are forbidden by the presented supervisory structure. In summary, the conclusion holds. Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> [or <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>] indicates that for each transition , , it is in either or . Let be a constraint and the control place to implement it. According to (7), we have . Since implies and indicates , according to (29), we have</p><p>where <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> indicates that and (31) implies . Since either <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> or (31) is satisfied, which cannot be added directly into MNDC, a binary variable is introduced for to represent whether <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> or (31) is true. Hence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> and (31) are rewritten as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(33)</ref> where indicates that (30) is true and implies that (31) is true, i.e., and , respectively. For each transition , we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(33)</ref>. Thus, by considering all transitions, we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(35)</ref> By adding <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(35)</ref> to MNDC, we have the following ILPP that is denoted as the Compressed Number of Disjunctive Constraints (CNDC) problem. CNDC <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(36)</ref> (37)</p><p>The objective function is used to minimize the number of the constraints that are selected. Denote its optimal value by . If CNDC has an optimal solution, we can obtain constraints. Then, the proposed supervisory structure can optimally control the system by enforcing the disjunctions of the obtained constraints. The optimal value of CNDC is no less than that of MNDC due to the addition of ( <ref type="formula">36</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(37)</ref>. On the other hand, they can ensure that no transition is in both preset and postset of the obtained control places. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(36)</ref> and (37) have constraints. As a result, CNDC has constraints. The number of variables 's ( ) is . Thus, CNDC has variables. Corollary 3: The proposed supervisory structure can optimally control a given Petri net model by enforce a set of disjunctive constraints if CNDC has an optimal solution.</p><p>Proof: If CNDC has an optimal solution, then we can obtain a set of disjunctive constraints. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(36)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">37</ref>), we have</p><p>. By Theorem 6, the proposed supervisory structure can optimally control a given Petri net model. Now, we discuss the structural complexity of the proposed supervisor. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the proposed supervisor has places and transitions. Thus, the structural complexity greatly depends on . In this case, an ILPP, namely, CNDC, is proposed to minimize , which can greatly reduce the size of the supervisory structure. Note that, the supervisor in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> has places and the number of the added transitions is bounded by . Also, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> provides a supervisor in which the number of places is bounded by . However, as stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the number of the added transitions is of in the worst case. The advantage of the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is that it can be applied to any Petri nets but this work focuses on the Petri net models of FMSs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE</head><p>This section presents a simple example to illustrate the proposed method in detail. The Petri net model of an FMS is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Its places can be classified as: , , and</p><p>. The net has 39 reachable markings, 9 and 23 of which are FBMs and legal markings, respectively. By using a vector covering approach, the minimal covered set of FBMs and the minimal covering set of legal markings have three and two elements, i.  <ref type="formula">36</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">37</ref>)) to MNDC. Here, we do not provide CNDC for this example due to the limited space. For this net, we can easily obtain that the capacities of places , , , and are 2, 1, 2, and 1, respectively. Thus, we can compute the upper bounds and of the two constraints and , respectively, i.e., . Then, a Petri net supervisory structure is designed to implement the disjunctions of the two constraints by Algorithm 1. The controlled net is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, which can make the net model live with all 23 legal markings.

However, the proposed method can classify the legal markings into two subsets, each of which is associated with a linear constraint. Then, we provide an optimal supervisor that allows all legal behavior. Thus, it can be verified that the proposed method can provide an optimal Petri net supervisor for the net that cannot be optimally controlled by the conjunctions of constraints.</p></div>

After adding the supervisor to the original net model, the controlled net is live with 19 markings that include the 13 legal markings of the original net and six extra markings generated by the added places and transitions.

However, by using the proposed method, we find an optimal supervisor that can make the system live with all the legal markings. This shows that the proposed method can deal with the net model that cannot be dealt with by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Next, the Petri net model of an FMS shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> is considered, which is a weighted version of a net from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>This work aims to optimally control the Petri net models of FMSs by considering the disjunctions of constraints. Given a net model, it develops a method to compute a set of constraints, whose disjunctions can make all legal markings reachable while prohibit deadlock from occurring. An ILPP is proposed to minimize the number of disjunctive constraints and a vector covering approach is used to reduce the number of the markings that must be considered, which can greatly reduce the computational burden. Finally, a supervisory control structure is proposed to enforce the disjunctive constraints and a modified ILPP is provided to compute them. The proposed method is general since it is applicable to all FMS-oriented Petri net models. Experimental results show that the proposed method can find optimal supervisors for the Petri net models that cannot be dealt with by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some shortcomings in the proposed method. The first is its computational complexity. It is based on the reachability graph analysis of a Petri net model, which suffers from the state explosion problem. Also, we need to solve ILPPs, which are NP-hard. Though a marking reduction technique is used to reduce the number of the constraints in ILPPs, which can reduce the computational burden of the proposed method, its computational complexity is still NP-hard. Thus, the proposed method cannot be applied to large-scale Petri net models if there are too many constraints and variables in the proposed ILPPs. Second, the proposed supervisory control structure can introduce extra states. Deciding how to reduce them is an open topic. In the future, we will also study how to avoid the full enumeration of reachable markings to reduce the computational overheads.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Note that a pure Petri net means that it has no self-loops. That is to say, the Petri net model does not have an optimal pure Petri net supervisor expressed by a set of control places. The reason is that its legal state space is nonconvex, as shown in Fig.2(a).It can be seen that there are two legal markings and and an FBM . Since the legal space is nonconvex, we cannot make the two legal markings reachable and the FBM unreachable by linear constraints. However, the legal space can be classified into two subsets: and , as shown in Fig.2(b), which are associated with the linear constraints: and , respectively, where denotes the marking of . Since every legal marking satisfies or , and each constraint can forbid all FBMs. Thus, the optimal control purpose can be enforced by the disjunctions of the two constraints.
