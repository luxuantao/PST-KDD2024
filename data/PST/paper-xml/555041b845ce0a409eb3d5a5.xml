However, new challenges arise when selecting the most appropriate participants when considering their different incentive requirements, associated sensing capabilities, and uncontrollable mobility, to best satisfy the quality-of-information (QoI) requirements of multiple concurrent tasks with different budget constraints. This paper proposes a multitask-oriented participant selection strategy called "DPS," which is used to tackle the aforementioned challenges, where three key design elements are proposed. First is the QoI satisfaction metric, where the required QoI metrics of the collected data are quantified in terms of data granularity and quantity. Second is the multitask-orientated QoI optimization problem for participant selection, where task budgets are treated as the constraint, and the goal is to select a minimum subset of participants to best provide the QoI satisfaction metrics for all tasks. The optimization problem is then converted to a nonlinear knapsack problem and is solved by our proposed dynamic participant selection (DPS) strategy. Third is how to compute the expected amount of collected data by all (candidate) participants, where a probability-based movement model is proposed to facilitate such computation. Real and extensive trace-based simulations show that, given the same budget, the proposed participant selection strategy can achieve far better QoI satisfactions for all tasks than selecting participants randomly or through the reversed-auction-based approaches.</p><p>Index Terms-Data collection, incentive schemes, participant selection, participatory sensing, quality-of-information (QoI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>P ARTICIPATORY sensing was first proposed in [1], where the key idea was to have ordinary citizens collect and share sensory data from their surrounding environment by using their smartphones <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Early participatory sensing systems, such as PEIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and SoundSense <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, were prototyped for a single sensing task or, simply, tasks. They did not explicitly consider the coexistence of multiple concurrent tasks or how to best motivate more users to contribute. Recent approaches such as Campaignr <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and PRISM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> can provide multidimensional sensory data simultaneously for multiple concurrent tasks. Meanwhile, the latest research system MEDUSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> points out that participatory sensing systems must support ways in which participants can be motivated by incentives to contribute sensory data, since participating in crowd sensing may incur real monetary costs (e.g., bandwidth usage). Therefore, support for multiple sensing tasks with rewards is critical for future participatory sensing systems and is our research path in its own right.</p><p>Our research is motivated by the application scenario shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, which is also derived from the smartphone-based environmental monitoring system described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It shows a group of mobile users subscribing to a central server, which receives the sensing tasks from task publishers. Each task is associated with certain quality-of-information (QoI) requirements. Broadly speaking, QoI relates to the ability to judge whether information is fit for use for a particular purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For the purposes of this paper, we will assume that QoI is characterized by a number of attributes, including the sensing region, sensing time period, data granularity, and quantity requirements, and the incentive budget it is willing to afford. For simplicity, we only consider a sensing region as a 2-D (longitude and latitude) area in the same plane. It is worth noting that the proposed strategy is also suitable for 3-D sensing space with altitude dimension. On the server's side, the targeted sensing region is divided into virtual areas of the same size, according to the task publisher's data granularity requirement. Each task lasts for a certain period of time, which is also divided into several discrete time slots according to the associated data granularity requirement. In each time slot on each area, a number of measurements (sensory data samplings) are required. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, when there are adequate samples, the use of their average value per area, instead of the originals, does not affect the accuracy of the system. On the participant's side, they move around in the sensing region. When they receive the task requirements, they contact the central server to register their current location, required amount of incentive if participating in the data collection, and their sensing capabilities. In our considered scenario, the sensing capability of a participant is measured by how many data samples the user can collect in a time unit for all tasks, which is decided by both the sampling frequency and the type/amount of sensors equipped on his/her smartphone. For simplicity, we assume equal sampling frequency for all participants and, thus, use the number of sensors Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Considered participatory sensing scenario, where the task publisher request for different types of sensory data is in a targeted region. A subset of all candidate participants is selected from all users with different sensing capabilities, initial locations, and incentive requirements to carry on sensing tasks.</p><p>to uniquely represent the sensing capability of a participant's smart device. When a particular participant is selected by the central server as the collector, his/her smart device measures the required environmental parameters periodically and uploads the collected data to the server. As a result, a reward is finally paid as a return. The environmental data collection phase stops either when all QoI requirements are fully satisfied or when the given task budget runs out.</p><p>In urban environments, the density of the available participants can be remarkably high. Thus, it is possible and necessary to use only part of all available participants to achieve multiple concurrent tasks. Different participant selection strategies lead to different system performance in terms of the achieved level of QoI satisfactions.</p><p>A highly simplified participant selection scene with four sensing tasks is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. For each task, samplings are required in (4, 4, 3, 2) areas, respectively. Three users named {a, b, c} are walking in the region, where each carries two kinds of sensors. According to their future trajectory, selecting {a, b} as participants can collect sensory data in (4, 3, 3, 2) areas for each task, respectively, whereas selecting {b, c} can collect sensory data in (4, 4, 1, 0) areas for each task, respectively. Although {b, c} can collect data for one more area for the second task, they collect much less data for the third and fourth tasks, compared with {a, b}. Therefore, in this highly simplified example, selecting {a, b} as participants can obviously fit the tasks' requirements better than {b, c} and achieve more accurate sensing results. However, in practice, there are far more tasks and participants; to evaluate how a subset of participants can satisfy the requirements of multiple tasks can be quite complicated. Moreover, it is not possible to assume that the trajectories of participants are known a priori. Therefore, selecting the most efficient participants to achieve the tasks' QoI requirements by minimum incentives and a constrained budget is the challenge that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Participant selection has always been a major challenge in participatory sensing systems, due to the diversity of users' sensing capabilities and incentive requirements. It is even more so when considering their unpredictable mobility pattern and the associated QoI requirements by various tasks. Many researchers proposed different participant selection strategies from different aspects, which either considered only one sin-gle sensing task, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, or ignored the budget constraint, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The aim of this paper is to find a subset of participants whose sensory data collection can best satisfy QoI requirements of multiple concurrent tasks in both temporal and spatial dimensions, with a constrained task budget. The contribution of this paper is fourfold as follows.</p><p>• We introduce a QoI satisfaction metric in terms of data granularity and quantity, which is used to quantify the degree of how collected sensory data can satisfy multidimensional task QoI requirements. • We introduce a probability model to estimate the expected amount of data collected on a participant in the sensing region. From the historical trajectory information of a user, his/her probability of moving from one location to another can be calculated. Then, given the transition possibilities between quantized areas and their sensing capabilities, the expected amount of collected data by all participants can be predicted/computed. • We propose a dynamic participant selection strategy called "DPS." The participants are selected based on a greedy algorithm that explicitly considers their expected amount of data collected, required QoI of multiple tasks, and users' incentive requirements, under the constraint of an aggregated task budget. • The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed strategy are extensively evaluated by real-trace-driven simulations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the related research activities. Section III establishes a formal model of our system and Section IV describes the QoI satisfaction metric. Section V formulates the optimization problem of participant selection, describes our proposed DPS in detail, and gives the formal model to estimate the amount of data collected by mobile participants, as an input to DPS. Section VI extensively evaluates the performance of the proposed strategy by real-trace-driven simulations, and finally, Section VII concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>Since Burke et al. first proposed the concept of participatory sensing in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, most early systems have been designed to support some specific task and are not suitable for multiple tasks. For example, the Common Sense project <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> develops a participatory sensing system that allows individuals to measure their personal exposure to air pollution. Other applications of participatory sensing include the collection and sharing of information about noise pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Moreover, vehicle sensing is one important aspect of participatory sensing, for vehicles exhibit better mobility than pedestrians and have no strict limits on processing power and sensing capabilities. <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al. in [23]</ref> propose a probe-car-based traffic monitoring strategy, followed by an improvement in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> by recruiting 4000 probe cars (taxis) to cooperatively work. Lee et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> take a further step forward by providing ordinary drivers a framework with which mobile users can participate in traffic monitoring.</p><p>As most of these early works do not have a participant selection scheme (i.e., they select participants randomly or just use laboratory workers as testers), they are not suitable for large-scale real-world deployment. Some recent research activities have proposed system models for multitask-oriented participatory sensing systems with reward. PRISM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> first studies platforms for multiple sensing tasks and proposes a procedural programming language for collecting multiple kinds of sensor data from a large number of mobile phones. MEDUSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> synthesizes participatory sensing and crowdsourcing and puts forward a runtime system for multiple sensing tasks with the following stages: task submission, worker selection, and monetary incentives management.</p><p>The collaboration and scheduling of sensors is a problem similar to participant selection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Krause et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> consider the simultaneous placement and scheduling of sensors and propose an algorithm to decide where and when to place and activate the sensors using the submodularity of the utility function. He et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> consider the quality of sensing as the utility function and uses a greedy algorithm for sensor allocation. Joshi and Boyd in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> consider minimizing the estimation error as the objective, involving convex optimization in solving it. However, WSNs are quite different from participatory sensing, since participants have uncontrolled mobility patterns and unpredictable incentive requirements.</p><p>Some researchers have noticed the lack of participant selection methods. Two representative works, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, use the trajectories of participants in the participant selection phase. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Reddy et al. develop a selection framework to enable organizers to identify well-suited participants for data collection, based on geographic and temporal availability as well as participation habits. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Tuncay et al. exploit the stability of user behaviors and select participants based on the fitness of mobility history profiles. Similarly, Weinschrott et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and Zhong and Cassandras in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> discuss task assignment for opportunistic in situ sensing, and Lu et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> focus on initiating sampling around specific location "bubbles" (regions). Gaonkar et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> propose a coverage maximization algorithm that records participants' tracks and selects participants whose availability matches the campaign coverage constraints. Such methods rely heavily on the knowledge of participant trajectories and, thus, may lead to increased risk of mobile users' privacy leakage.</p><p>Participant selection in multitask systems is quite different from single-task systems. As far as we are concerned, the work of Duan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is the first to propose the participant selection method for multiple tasks. Assuming that incentive requests of participants and the utility of sensory data on all locations are known, the proposed method selects a subset of participants, who have the maximum sensory data utilitydeducting incentive requirements. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Riahi et al. further improve the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> by defining how to calculate sensory data utility on a certain location. Both works concentrate on selecting participants to maximize the difference between the value and the price of sensory data. Another approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is aimed at minimizing the overall sensing cost of mobile devices with heterogeneous sensing capabilities while achieving the sensing tasks' requirements. The authors did not consider the scenario that in suburb areas with few people, the incentive requirement of noncompeting participants could be too high for the task publishers to afford, nor the scenario that sensing resources should lean toward satisfying those tasks affording higher budgets. It is more practical in real-world participatory sensing applications that task publishers offer the maximum incentive budget they are willing to afford and expect the central server (sensing platform) to provide them as high QoI satisfaction as possible.</p><p>As an incentive mechanism that also includes participant selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, its aim is to obtain the maximum amount of sensory data by minimal payment. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, a reversed-auctionbased approach is proposed, which gathers the bid price of all participants and selects those with the lowest bid price.</p><p>In comparison, we aim to best satisfy QoI requirements of multiple tasks by selecting participants with a constrained task budget. Moreover, we also consider the protection of user privacy, and only assume knowing their historical and current location, but not future trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>This section presents a formal model for describing our participant selection system. We consider a scenario of multitaskoriented participatory sensing in a selected spatial region L during a particular time period T , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The system is composed of a central server, a set of task publishers, and a set of M smartphone users moving in region L during time period T as candidate participants. They are denoted as M Δ = {m = 1, 2, . . . , M}. Let q present, for example, an environmental monitoring task in the considered region within that time period and Q be the collection of all concurrent running tasks. The incentive budget of q is denoted as c q , and the entire budget of all tasks can be calculated by C total = c q , ∀ q ∈ Q. Moreover, according to the task's QoI requirement, or more precisely, the required data granularity of task q, the task publisher divides the entire region into a set of L areas, denoted as L q Δ = {l = 1, 2, . . . , L}, and also divides the entire sensing period into a set of time slots, denoted as T q Δ = {t = 1, 2, . . . , T }. On each virtual cube that is composed of a 2-D area and within a certain time slot, the required amount of data samples can be denoted as r q lt , ∀ l ∈ L q , ∀ t ∈ T q , which is also given by the task publisher as a requirement. Based on the given budget and QoI requirements of all tasks Q, the central server aims to select part of all candidate participants for data collection at the beginning of T , as the key algorithm we propose in this paper.</p><p>As for participants, each candidate demands some kind of monetary or virtual incentives, denoted as d m , ∀ m ∈ M, during T . When a particular participant is selected as the data contributor, his/her device samples the required environmental parameter periodically by the equipped sensor(s). To simplify the scenario and avoid loss of generality, we set an equal sampling frequency for all users, denoted as Δt. Thus, the number of data samples in T can be calculated by T /Δt . Finally, s q m , ∀ m ∈ M, ∀ q ∈ Q is used to denote the sensing ability of a participant m to task q, where s q m = 0, if m cannot collect data for q 1, otherwise.</p><p>(</p><p>As mentioned earlier, we use the number of equipped sensors of a participant's device m to represent his/her sensing capability as S m , as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S m = ∀ q∈Q s q m , ∀ m ∈ M.</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)<label>2</label></formula><p>It is worth noting that it is reasonably assumed that the initial locations of each participant m entering the sensory region is known and given, denoted as E m (0); the detailed definition in practice will be described in Section V-C. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> shows the list of notations used in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. QUALITY OF INFORMATION SATISFACTION METRIC</head><p>As its name implies, the QoI satisfaction metric is used to describe the level of QoI satisfaction to the extent that the collected sensory data can satisfy the requirement of a task (data collection). Suppose that a subset X (of size |X |) of all participants is selected for a task q and let o q lt (X ), ∀ l ∈ L q , ∀ t ∈ T q denote the amount of samplings collected by X for task q on a certain area l, within a certain time slot t. The initial value of each o q lt (X ) is zero. When a new data sample on area l at time slot t is collected, if the amount of collected data o q lt (X ) is less than the amount of required data r q lt , then o q lt (X ) is increased by 1; otherwise, if the amount of collected data o q lt (X ) has reached the amount of required data, then r q lt , o q lt (X ) does not change. Such rules can also be applied to the condition of adding data collection of two different participants m 1 and m 2 together, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">o q lt (m 1 + m 2 ) = o q lt (m 1 ) + o q lt (m 2 ), if o q lt (m 1 ) + o q lt (m 2 ) ≤ r q lt r q lt , if o q lt (m 1 ) + o q lt (m 2 ) ≥ r q lt .</formula><p>(3) Thus, two matrices, i.e., R q and O(X ) q , are used to denote the multidimensional QoI requirements of task q and the amount of sampling collected by X , respectively. Thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R q = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ r q 11 r q 12 . . . r q 1T r q 21 r q 22 . . . . . . r q L1 r q LT ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ (4) O q (X ) = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ o q 11 (X ) o q 12 (X ) . . . o q 1T (X ) o q 21 (X ) o q 22 (X ) . . . . . . o q L1 (X ) o q LT (X ) ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where ∀ l ∈ L, ∀ t ∈ T , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">o q lt (X ) = o q lt ∀ m∈X m . (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>Then, the following lemma immediately follows from the definition of O q (X ). Lemma 1: Given X 1 ⊂ X 2 , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">O q (X 1 ) ≤ O q (X 2 ), ∀ X 1 , X 2 ⊂ M, ∀ q ∈ Q. (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>Lemma 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">O q (X ) ≤ R q , ∀ q ∈ Q, ∀ X ⊂ M. (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>To best satisfy a sensing task's multidimensional QoI requirements, we aim to minimize the difference between the required and attained values (i.e., the defined two matrices R q and O(X ) q in our case) by the Frobenius norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Since the Frobenius norm is mathematically used to measure the spatial length of a matrix, R q -O q (X ) can denote the vector difference for a particular task q. By using ( R q -O q (X ) F / R q F ), the difference is normalized with the value ranging from 0 to 1. Therefore, for a task q, its achieved QoI satisfaction metric can be computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">u q (X ) = 1 - R q -O q (X ) F R q F , ∀ q ∈ Q, ∀ X ⊂ M. (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>In this way, the achieved QoI satisfaction metric of task q ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that no data is collected for task q, and 1 means that all considered QoI requirements at each area and within each time slot are fully satisfied. If the collected data O(X ) q do not meet the requirement matrix R q , the QoI satisfaction metric can have room for increase when more data are collected. Moreover, the Frobenius norm can also denote the distribution of samplings. When the data collection amount is fixed, the Frobenius-norm-based QoI satisfaction metric shows better results when samplings are uniformly distributed among subregions than when samplings are gathered in a few subregions.</p><p>Proposition 1 below states an interesting fact-that given a random set of selected participants, adding a participant into the selected set can never decrease the QoI satisfaction of all tasks.</p><p>Proposition 1: Given X 1 ⊂ X 2 , we have u q (X 1 ) ≤ u q (X 2 ).

PROBLEM FORMULATION AND SOLUTIONS</head><p>The goal of this paper is to find a set of participants whose collected amount of sensory data can best achieve the required QoI for all concurrent tasks being serviced. We denote the targeted set of selected participants as X * . Moreover, their total incentive requirement should be less than the total available budget C total from all tasks. Hence, the optimization problem is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Maximize : U (X ) = [u 1 (X ), u 2 (X ), . . . , u Q (X )] T subject to : X ⊆ M; m∈X d m ≤ C total (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula><p>where U (X ) is a vector of objective functions. Each element of U (X ) is the QoI satisfaction metric of the sensory data collected by X . Until now, the problem of participant selection remains an optimization problem. Different from the existing optimization problems formulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> that aim at fully satisfying the data collection requirement of tasks, the novel optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> treats the total budgets C total of all tasks as constraint for selecting participants and aims at maximizing all tasks' QoI satisfaction, which is of more practical significance, for some data requirements cannot be fully satisfied due to the uncontrollable trajectories of participants.</p></div>

Proposed DPS Strategy</head><p>The objective function of (20) fits the basic form of nonlinear knapsack problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimizations like the following: Given a set of items, each with mass and a value, determine the number of each item as to be included in a collection, so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit, and the total value is as large as possible.

Expected Amount of Collected Data by Participants</head><p>When a particular participant is selected as the data contributor, he/she measures the required environmental data periodically by the sensor(s) embedded on his/her smartphone.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Setup</head><p>We assess the proposed DPS scheme by using the (Microsoft Research Asia) GeoLife data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, where real movement traces of ordinary citizens are used to represent mobile users in the considered scenario. The GeoLife project has collected 182 volunteers' trajectories in Beijing for three consecutive years. Each trajectory is marked by a sequence of time-stamped GPS points that contain users' latitude, longitude, and altitude at a given time. We adopt the following procedures to set up our simulation platform.</p><p>• As all traces were spread in different parts of Beijing, a specific rectangular region where the traces mostly appear is needed. We store all trajectories in a geographical MySQL database and find a 200 × 500 m 2 region that is of high movement density, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a), that happens to be around the area of the Microsoft Research Asia site. We use this region as the simulation area for the considered data collection application. • If not specially mentioned in the following experiments, three tasks are simulated in the region, i.e., |Q| = 3.</p><p>For simplicity reasons, we consider the data granularity requirement of all tasks to be the same. Thus, for all tasks, the entire region is divided into 8 × 20 areas of 25 × 25 m 2 , i.e., |L q | = 160, ∀ q ∈ Q. Moreover, by setting |T q | = 10, the lifetime of all tasks is composed of ten time slots. For each area, the required amount of data in a time slot is set to be 5 (r q lt = 5, ∀ q ∈ Q, l ∈ L, t ∈ T ). Since a participant's incentive requirement could be realized in different formats in practice, such as real money or bonus points, we use dimensionless units to represent both the participants' incentive requests and the tasks' budget constraints. The default budget of each task is set to be 200 or c q = 200, ∀ q ∈ Q.</p><p>• All 618 trajectories in the considered region are taken as potential (candidate) participants, i.e., |M| = 618, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>). Since these traces are recorded at different times, in our simulation, we simply neglect their time index and overlay them into the same time period. For each mobile user, given that the best GPS accuracy is about 5 m, we divide the entire region into 40 × 100 subregions, where each subregion covers an area of 5 × 5 m 2 , and we identity them as the mobile users' locations instead of the original GPS coordinates. The first GPS record of each trajectory that falls into the aforementioned simulation region is used as the initial location of a mobile user. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(b) shows initial locations of all 618 users. The total number of samplings |H| of each participant is set to 100, and the next 100 GPS records of each trajectory are used to represent the actual locations of samplings. In addition, users' sensing capabilities are randomly generated as a uniformly distributed random variable with which each user has 50% likelihood of carrying the sensor for each task, as s q m = rand(0, 1), ∀ m ∈ M, q ∈ Q. If not specifically mentioned in the following experiments, their incentive requirements d m for participating in the entire sensing time period are also randomly generated from 1 to 20 units. • To construct the location transition matrix P (Δt), we analyze the adjacent movement of all 618 trajectories from one point to another. Each square in the figure represents an area l, ∀ l ∈ L, and its gray value denotes the summed possibility for a participant to appear in this area from any initial location. It can also be regarded as the average amount of time that a participant spends in a specific area during the duration of simulation.</p><p>Collectively, it is interesting to put Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a)-(d) together, and we obtain the following observations.</p><p>• The concentrated trajectories in "Region 1" [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref> and (c)] are exactly the main road to the Sigma Building, as the office building of Microsoft Research Asia, where employees spend most of their day. • The "yellow strip" in "Region 2" [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(c)</ref>] corresponds to the very busy Zhichun Road, where traffic is always high. • As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>, there is a shortcut from the west to the east, composed of three road sections between a couple of residential areas. Its west point connects another busy road, i.e., the 4th Road of South Zhongguancun. This observation is confirmed by trajectories in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>). • "Region 3" [squared by the blue dashed line to the northwest corner; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref>] has the highest population density if considering their initial locations. However, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(d) for the average sojourn time, most of them are just pass-by users and will leave the simulation region soon after. • Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>) also shows that the density of participants' initial locations are quite high in "Region 5," where users spend most of their time [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(d)</ref>]. Through a field trip, we find that "Region 5" is a newly built residential community with outdoor fitness facilities (where the elderly like to be), and it is farthest from the main roads.</p><p>• Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(c) shows that "Region 4" has a relatively lower density, but Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(d) shows that many participants enter into that area and spend quite some time here. From the map, we see that "Region 4" is the exact spot of the Sigma Building.</p><p>All these features observed from the real-world trajectories further confirm the necessity to consider users' mobility patterns for participant selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Implementation</head><p>We refer to the proposed scheme as "DPS," and to compare the system performance, two other participant selection schemes are simulated, namely: 1) the random selection method (referred to as "RS") is considered as the benchmark, and 2) a reversed-auction-based method (referred to as "RA"), which is slightly modified from the existing algorithm RADP <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. RS selects participants randomly until the total incentive budget runs out; RA is slightly modified from RADP <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> as to better fit our scenario. That is, the basic idea of RADP is to select participants who can provide higher sensing capabilities with a unit incentive request. According to our definition of participants' sensing capability in Section I, namely, the number of equipped sensors, RA used for comparison purposes select participants who have higher ratios between the number of equipped sensors and the incentive requirements, until the total incentive budget runs out. All three schemes and environmental settings are written by script files in the PHP programming language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Results</head><p>We first show the accuracy of our probability-based data collection method. Ten randomly selected participants are taken as a test set, and their real-trajectory-based data collection in the first time slot is calculated. Meanwhile, their data collection expectations in the first time slot are also calculated using the generated location transmission matrix and their initial locations. In each round of the experiment, a location transmission matrix is generated by randomly selected 10, 50, 100, 200, . . ., 600 participants. The accuracy of each round is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, and we can observe that the average accuracy of data collection estimation rapidly increases when few trajectories are taken as the training set and finally reaches 77% when all participants are involved in the training set.</p><p>We show the running process of our proposed approach when the incentive budget of each task is given as 200. In each round of iteration, the efficiencies of all unselected participants are calculated, and the participant with the highest efficiency is selected and paid. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the efficiency of the selected participant in each round of iteration. We observe that, when 600 allowed incentives are given from three tasks, 107 participants are selected. Moreover, the predicted efficiency of the selected participant in each step sharply decreases in the first 20 steps, followed by a long tail after 40 steps, where 511 unselected participants' efficiencies are lower than 1. This implies that our approach can provide considerable QoI satisfaction for all sensing tasks, although the budget is quite limited.  We further show the remaining budget after a participant is selected and paid in each iteration (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The remaining budget of the RS scheme decreases at an almost fixed rate, and the budget runs out after 62 steps. The remaining budget of our DPS scheme decreases at a much lower rate, since it considers both increasing the level of QoI satisfaction and satisfying the participant's incentive requirement, and it also runs out after 105 steps. The remaining budget of the RA scheme decreases at a lowest rate, since it only selects the cheapest participant without QoI guarantees, and it runs out after 145 steps.</p><p>In the experiment, when participants are selected, we are able to calculate their total collected data by their known trajectories. Next, we use the amount of collected data, the number of selected participants, and data uniformity as three indicators to evaluate their performance. Here, data uniformity is measured by the proposed method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. That is, the entire region contains n areas (n = |L| = 160 in our case), and let a denote the total amount of collected data. Then, n (n = 50 in our case) uniformly distributed areas are randomly generated, and the number of samplings on these areas is denoted as a accordingly. If n areas are randomly generated by enough times (e.g., 100 in our case), the average difference between a/n and /n  of each run will show the degree of inhomogeneity of sampling distribution. Thus, the disuniformity index of samplings can be denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">100 i=1 a (i) n - a n . (<label>35</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_60">)</formula><p>The larger the disuniformity index is, the more inhomogeneous the distribution of collected samplings is. First, we study the impact of tasks' total incentive budget on different approaches. We randomly generate 30 different combinations of incentive requests and sensing capabilities (i.e., the number of equipped sensors) for all participants. For each combination, we increase the allowed amount of incentives from each task every ten units, i.e., from 10, to 20, to 30, and so on, until it reaches 500 units. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the total amount of collected data by three participant selection strategies. We observe that the amount of collected data by RA and DPS methods is significantly larger (&gt;200%) than that of RS. Moreover, DPS exhibits 14.2% more data than that of RA. Furthermore, the overall trend for the amount of collected data, with respect to the task budget, is approximately linear for RS, whereas the amount of collected data rapidly increases for DPS and RA when the total task budget is inadequate. Thus, it is clear that DPS performs better in collecting more data (and, therefore, has better QoI experience), particularly under the condition that the total incentive is tight, consistent with what has been discussed in Section VI-B. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the impact when changing the task budget on the total number of selected participants, where we observe that, for fixed task budget, our DPS method involves significantly fewer participants, i.e., 19.3% fewer than that for the RA scheme. However, compared with RS, DPS involves 118% more participants. Since it is fair to relate the number of participants with the total energy consumption, we can safely conclude that DPS uses nearly 20% more energy if compared with the RA scheme. This is because in each round of iteration, RA selects only the participants with lowest incentive requests, whereas DPS selects those considering both the incentive requests and data collection efficiencies, and thus, DPS recruits less participants, which is consistent with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows the trend of the defined disuniformity of the collected data. It can be seen that RS achieves the best data uniformity, whereas DPS and RA behave closely. The indexes of DPS and RA rapidly increase when the budget is tight, which means that the collected data are more nonuniformly distributed in both temporal and spatial dimensions. However, when the budget reaches a certain threshold (200 from each task, as shown in the figure for the DPS scheme), the uniformity measurement stops increasing. This saturation is simply due to the spatially nonuniformity distributed participant trajectories-that when more budget is given, more participants are selected, thus leading to a higher degree of disuniformity. However, when all participants are given enough rewards, no more participants can be chosen, and thus, the defined disuniformity index stops increasing.</p><p>We further demonstrate the uniformity of data collection by DPS, RS, and RA approaches, when setting different incentive requests for different areas, i.e., incentive requirements are not uniformly distributed in the spatial dimension. Recall that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(d)</ref>, many mobile users spend much time in residential Region 5 and office Region 4; we therefore set higher incentive requirements (ranging from 10 to 20) for the 157 mobile users  near Region 4, and lower incentive requirements (ranging from 1 to 10) for the other 195 mobile users near Region 5. This is because users at home may have more time to contribute, whereas employees will have to be paid more to get them involved. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> shows the change in the disuniformity index of the collected data. It can be seen that RA is greatly affected by spatially different requested incentives, because it tends to select incentive-efficient mobile users in Region 5. Meanwhile, DPS is also affected, but the average value of the disuniformity index just slightly increases by 0.023. When the overall task budget is quite tight, participants selected by DPS and RA are both randomly distributed in the spatial domain, since the incentive requests of most participants are randomly generated. However, when more budget is given, RA rarely selects those users from the regions in which their incentive requests are high, but our proposed DPS scheme is driven to select expensive participants in those regions by Frobenius norm in (9); as a result, the achieved QoI metric increases much faster when the required data collection resides in those regions having less data collected.  Then, we verify our proposed DPS's performance while changing the number of tasks, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. It can be seen that when 5-17 tasks are required, the average amount of collected data of all tasks obtained by DPS increases by 53%, whereas that of RA increases by only 42%, which indicates that DPS is more efficient when handling more tasks. This is because the total task budget increases when the number of task increases. With this extra budget, DPS can select more efficient participants to collect data, rather than randomly selecting users by RA, as consistent with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, we conduct an experiment to verify the impact of the number of participants on DPS. We randomly select 100, 200, . . ., 600 trajectories as candidate participants. We decrease the budget of each task to 100, to motivate the selection of a subset of participants only. It is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> that the amount of collected data of RS does not increase with the increase in the number of participants, while the amount of collected data of DPS and RA increases. It indicates that both DPS and RA can select more efficient participants from the incremental extension of candidates, and thus, the achieved QoI satisfaction index will also increase.  Finally, we verify the impact of the participant's incentive requirement. In practice, most participants tend to request more rewards in return for contributing more sensory data. An extreme scenario is then simulated, where all incentive requirements are exactly proportional to their respective sensing capabilities or the number of equipped sensors on their smart devices. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref> shows that the amount of collected data from the RA scheme is lower than that from RS, whereas our proposed DPS still performs 43% better than RS. Higher QoI satisfaction is achieved by not only choosing participants whose incentive requests are relatively low, but more importantly, it fully considers how to best fit all participants' sensing capabilities to the task QoI requirements.</p><p>Finally, since our proposed DPS scheme selects participants based on their future trajectory estimations, this prediction accuracy eventually determines the overall system performance. To investigate this impact, we compare the amount of collected data and the number of selected participants achieved by DPS using the following three trajectories: 1) the probability-based trajectory prediction method we used in this paper; 2) trajectories known a prori; and 3) directional trajectory prediction. The directional trajectory prediction supposes that the first two locations of each mobile user are known, and then users keep moving toward the same direction with the same speed. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref> show the result in terms of the amount of collected data and the number of selected participants among the aforementioned three trajectory prediction-powered DPS schemes. It can be seen that if the location prediction accuracy improves, the total amount of collected data can improve by 37% on average, while the energy consumption can be further reduced by 35%. On the other hand, probability-based trajectory prediction involves almost as many participants as that of the directional prediction scheme, but it collects 29% more data on average. This indicates that the probability-based trajectory prediction can achieve higher accuracy in predicting the data collection of participants compared with the directional prediction scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>In this paper, DPS has been proposed to collect the maximum amount of sensory data for all sensing tasks in both temporal and spatial dimensions under budget constraints. A QoI satisfaction metric was introduced to quantify the degree of how collected sensory data can satisfy multidimensional task QoI requirements in terms of data granularity and quantity. The expected amount of collected data by each participant was then predicted by his/her sensing capability, initial location, and a probability model that together calculates his/her probability to move from one location to another, based on the historical trajectory information. Based on all these, DPS is thus established to select participants whose data collection expectations benefit the QoI satisfaction metrics of multiple tasks most compared with their incentive requirements. Extensive experimental results, based on a real trace in Beijing, show the effectiveness and robustness of DPS compared with other existing schemes.</p><p>As this paper mainly focuses on how to best fulfil multiple concurrent tasks' QoI requirements, incentive budgets of tasks and incentive requirements of participants are just taken as constraints to the optimization problem and are not expandingly discussed. However, to best fulfill the QoI requirements while minimizing the cost is another challenging research issue, particularly under the condition that participants' incentive requirements can be dynamically decided according to the amount of data (services) they provide or the energy status of their devices. In the future, we plan to extend our model to balance the incentive cost and the gain of QoI satisfaction, for as revealed by the experiment results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> in Section VI, the gain of QoI by providing extra incentive budget to those participants in the long tail section in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> is very limited. We also plan to dig into the field of selecting the most energy efficient participants, to extend the overall lifetime of the participants' network as well as collecting satisfactory sensory data for tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>; 1 : 18 :</head><label>118</label><figDesc>set of unselected participants B = M, set of selected participants A = NULL 2: incentive_left = C total 3: while 1 do 4: flag ← 0 5: selected_id ← 0 6: max_efficiency ← 0 7: for mobile user m ∈ B do 8: if d m &gt; incentive_left then 9m's efficiency ϑ(m, A) in (26) 12: if ϑ(m, A) &gt; max_efficiency then 13: if flag = 0 or selected_id = 0 then 19: break 20: end if 21: A ← A + selected_id 22: B ← B -selected_id 23: incentive_left ← incentive_leftd selected_id 24: end while 25: Return: final selected participant set X * = B.</figDesc></figure>
