<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study combines the Yale Model and Attribution Theory to examine the interaction among message, source, receiver characteristics, and receiver perceptions of information credibility. Receivers were examined as to whether negative messages would influence their perception and actual adoption. This was an experimental study that adopted Starbucks as the research context. 502 valid questionnaires were collected. The data analysis results indicated that both consensus and vividness led to information receivers forming external attributions and perceiving information as credible; receiver brand commitment had a moderating effect on both relationships. Additionally, external attributions about writers had a positive and direct relationship with source credibility but not with information credibility. Source credibility had a positive influence on receiver information credibility but not on negative e-WOM adoption. Based on the results and findings, this study suggested that companies should construct their own communication platform to collect negative consumer comments. In terms of brand commitment, they must establish brand commitment through marketing activities and corporate social responsibility policies in order to mitigate the effect of negative e-WOM messages.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The popularity of online communication and electronic word-ofmouth (e-WOM) has become important in e-commerce, both of which produce information for potential customers that lead to a sense of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. E-WOM communications possess unprecedented scalability and speed of diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Especially compared to positive e-WOM, negative e-WOM will have a strong impact on purchase decisions. Chang et al. pointed out that online complaint messages against a company may be easily and rapidly distributed to a high volume of potential consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which in turn causes damage to the company's reputation.</p><p>In the online communication environment, consumers can view e-WOM information from many platforms, such as blogs, search engines, virtual communities, and consumer review systems, among others. Gu et al. pointed out that online consumer reviews (i.e., e-WOM) are important resources by which consumers seek product or service quality information <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, why consumers are willing to believe and accept e-WOM messages shared by strangers is an interesting issue to both researchers and practicians, especially negative e-WOM. Consumers generally suspect the credibility of both positive and negative e-WOM information because of a lack of personal knowledge about the motivations of unseen strangers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, Yoo et al. pointed out that, online shoppers are much more sensitive to negative e-WOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref> because negative information is more diagnostic and informative than positive information and thus is weighted more heavily in judgments than is positive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>To judge the degree to which consumers are affected by negative e-WOM messages, this study uses information credibility and negative e-WOM adoption as the two outcome variables. If consumers believe and adopt what is said in the message, the possible effects will be changes in their attitudes, beliefs, and actions. Thus, a message learning approach, also called the Yale model, is adopted for the purpose of examining whether consumers are affected by negative e-WOM messages.</p><p>The Yale model proposed that in the entire communication process, people will be influenced by three components: message, source, and receiver. In online communication platforms, information receivers are directly affected by the received message; factors such as consensus and vividness will influence receivers' perceptions, whereas characteristics related to the message source are always limited because message writers can enjoy a certain level of anonymity. To resolve this issue, this study further adopts attribution theory and regards causal attributions as a concept of source characteristics. This means that information receivers will form attitudes toward the message writer (perceived as source credibility) on the basis of causal inferences they have made, and their attitude will then have an influence on the effectiveness of the message. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Ahluwalia et al.</ref> proposed that prior consumer characteristics, such as brand commitment, will affect their processing and also the impact of negative publicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Thus, to investigate the interactions among message, source, and receiver, this study regards brand commitment as a receiver characteristic that also plays an important role in the communication process.</p><p>Within the context of online communication or negative e-WOM, there are several research gaps that previous studies have not addressed. First, the Yale model can be viewed as a basic model in the communication field; however, it has typically been adopted in the offline environment, and there have been few studies extending the Yale model to the online communication context. Second, Cheung et al. used dual-process theory to examine topics concerning information credibility and adoption and adopted the Yale model concept to decide the informational determinants <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, they did not take the information attribution process of receivers into account after reading a message. Hilton mentioned that attribution theory appears to be particularly helpful in regard to understanding a receiver's interpretation of a writer's motives for sharing a message <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. On the contrary, Lee and Song adopted attribution theory to examine the effects of online complaints on receiver perceptions and company evaluations, but they did not consider factors such as information credibility and adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Lastly, Funk and Pritchard pointed out that strong commitment holds an inherent structural bias that favors the parsimonious processing of information, especially when diagnosing negative information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In the e-WOM context, message receivers should inherently have brand preferences; however, a receiver who is highly committed to a brand may resist undesirable information about that particular brand. In line with this concept, previous studies have demonstrated that commitment can moderate the effectiveness of negative information <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> but have only demonstrated a macro moderating effect, thus not providing studies with more detailed examination.</p><p>To address these research gaps and answer the research question, in this study, a framework is developed by extending the Yale model and combining it with attribution theory in which external attributions are taken as the source characteristic, and subsequently, the impact of negative e-WOM messages is investigated. In addition, this study also explores the moderating role receiver brand commitment plays in regard to information processing. The research objectives are as follows:</p><p>(1) The main purpose of this study is to examine the influences of message characteristics (consensus and vividness) on receivers making external attributions about the writer as well as perceiving information credibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> The influences of external attributions about the writer on a receiver's perceptions of information credibility and source credibility. (3) The direct effect among two credibility perceptions (source credibility &amp; information credibility) and receiver's intention to adopt a negative e-WOM message. (4) The moderating effect of brand commitment on the effectiveness of a negative e-WOM message.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical background</head><p>Over the years, many theories have explained how people are influenced after receiving related information, including the Yale model, the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), and the Heuristic Systematic Model (HSM). ELM and HSM have been used to investigate different levels/depths of information processing, such as in Tam and Ho <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> and Koh and Sundar <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Accordingly, both ELM and HSM posit two routes (the central vs. peripheral route and the systematic vs. heuristic route) for judging the persuasiveness of messages. That is, when the elaboration likelihood level increases, the effects of central factors on information readers' perception, attitudes or beliefs will also be enhanced, whereas the effects of peripheral factors become less important, and vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. They emphasized how message receivers are persuaded (e.g., through central or peripheral cues) and the ability of receivers to understand the presented message. However, the Yale model covers components, such as message (information), source (writer), channel (place), and audience (receiver or reader) that affect people's attention, comprehension, and acceptance of a message, which is a more comprehensive method by which to explain the messages being transmitted. It not only emphasizes how the messages are being exposed, but also how messages are retained by receivers and the consequences of consumer reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>In the e-WOM context, consumers can read most messages online. However, how consumers are persuaded by online messages that are shared by someone they do not know and why they accept and retain messages for subsequent reactions is the main issue being discussed in the current study. Thus, relative to ELM and HSM, the Yale model is more suitable for this purpose. This study regards the writer as someone who writes and shares opinions in an online communication environment, and it regards the receivers as the people who hear, read, and receive the online message.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Yale model</head><p>The Yale model, also called the Yale Persuasive Communication model (YPC model) was developed by Hovland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It identifies several processes of persuasive communication (e.g., exposure, attention, comprehension, acceptance, retention, and action). In online communication environments, the components preceding the persuasive communication process include the source (message originator), the message (information content), the medium used (or channel), and the receiver (person who receives the information). Possible effects of the interaction among these components and processes are the receiver's changes in beliefs, attitudes, and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. There are several message factors that may influence the effectiveness of the communication process, such as the order of arguments, the explicitness of requests, and the use of emotional appeals <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>The source is where the information comes from. The credibility of a source is a critical element with regard to affecting attitudes. According to Hovland et al., factors such as expertise, trustworthiness, and status determine source credibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The Yale model argues that receiver characteristics will also affect communication effectiveness (e.g., an individual's ability to persuade, as well as the individual's intelligence and personality) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Considering that the focus of this study is the effect of negative WOM messages in the online communication environment, message channels are not taken into account. Thus, in the case of either online discussion forums or blogs, only one channel will be adopted to examine the persuasiveness of negative e-WOM messages.</p><p>The three major components of persuasive communication process are elaborated as follows:</p><p>(1) Message characteristic-consensus and vividness Message characteristics, which are an important component in the Yale model, comprise a numbers of factors, such as message framing, the length of a message, presentation style, and other factors that are related to the message content. Referring to Lee and Song, the current study adopted consensus and vividness as two message characteristics to examine attribution and company evaluation under the negative e-WOM context <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Consensus is the extent that people act in a same way in a situation or toward a particular stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. In the negative WOM context, consensus refers to the degree to which others are likely to agree with the negative views of the communicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Because online communication platforms enable users to reply to the messages they read as well as the replies made by other receivers, receivers can easily compare message content on the Internet. This study follows the definition of Laczniak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and assesses message content by the replies of different receivers. When the replies support the writer's opinions, the consensus level is high, and vice versa.</p><p>Vividness is the information capacity to attract and hold attention in order to excite imagination <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. As defined by Steuer, vividness relates to the breadth and depth of a message <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Message breadth is the number of sensory dimensions, cues, and senses presented (colors, graphics, etc.), and the depth of the message is the quality and resolution of the presentation (bandwidth). This study follows the definition of Nisbett and Ross, who stated that information is vivid if it contains a degree of "emotionally interesting, concrete and imagery-provoking, and/or proximate in a sensory, temporal, spatial way" <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Sending messages is not limited to typing, it can also depend on the functional designs of websites, and people can upload photos, symbols, and provides concrete descriptions in order to enhance the quality of the information as well as to enrich the message content. (2) Receiver characteristic-brand commitment Receiver characteristics are another component in the Yale model. E-WOM information usually concerns consumer experience in regard to a specific product, brand or service. However, message receivers should have already established their own favorite brand before they read a message. They are typically committed to their favorite brands regardless of how the brand's product or services perform.</p><p>Scholars have demonstrated that commitment can moderate the effect of negative information <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. To examine the persuasiveness of a negative e-WOM message, it is necessary to take message receiver's prior belief towards a brand into account. Under this consideration, in this study, receiver brand commitment is adopted as a factor to examine the effectiveness of negative e-WOM messages.</p><p>Brand commitment is an enduring desire to maintain a relationship with a brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It can be defined as an emotional or a psychological attachment to a brand within a product category and can be seen as a condition in which consumers are firmly enchanted with the brand to the extent that there is no second choice. Although brand commitment can imply brand loyalty, the reverse does not hold true. Brand loyalty may merely reflect the consumer's need to reduce effort and simplify decision making. In the absence of a preferred brand, consumers who have brand loyalty are likely to switch to an alternative brand, whereas consumers who have brand commitment will not.</p><p>Chang and Chen mentioned that consumers who have strong levels of brand commitment tend to have strong connections between themselves and the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Following Bambauer-Sachse and Odekerken-Schroder, this study defines brand commitment as consumer's enduring desire to continue a relationship with a brand accompanied by the willingness to make effort to maintain it <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Therefore, if an information receiver has a high level of commitment to a brand, he/she will tend to keep a relationship with the brand. The actions of receivers with high/low commitment will be different when they receive a negative message talking about a target brand. Thus, the effects of receiver brand commitment are examined in this study. (3) Source characteristic-external attributions about writer &amp; source credibility Source is another critical component proposed in the Yale model. In WOM and other information-related research, source characteristics, such as credibility, reputation, and motivation, have been common factors under investigation. In the online communication environment, writers who share a message can enjoy the right of anonymity; the message becomes a problem by which to judge the genuineness of writers. Therefore, one objective of this study is to investigate receivers' attitudes toward anonymous writers. This study adopts concepts of attribution theory and source credibility to proceed; that is, the receivers' inferences to a negative e-WOM writer's motivation and the receiver's perceptions of the writer's credibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">External attributions about writer</head><p>In e-WOM research, attribution theory can be used to investigate a message sender's motivation toward information diffusion behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. If receivers form an attribution in which the diffusion of a WOM message is based on internal or writer motivation, the message credibility will be discounted. In contrast, if receivers think that the WOM message is based on external or product/company motivation, they will then perceive the message to be believable and credible.</p><p>According to Wangenheim, the ratio of reading negative WOM reviews is lower than that of reading positive ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>; however, the impact of a negative WOM review may be greater than that of a positive one <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This is because the transmission of negative WOM involves interpersonal and informal processes. Thus, attribution theory appears to be particularly helpful in understanding a receiver's interpretation of a writer's motives for sharing a message <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This study hence applies the theory to explain this topic.</p><p>Based on the discussion above, this study suggests that a receiver's causal attribution can play an important role in the formation of attitudes toward a message. After reading a negative e-WOM message, if receivers make external attributions about the writer's motivation, this means they consider the fault in the product or service to be caused by the company. In contrast, if receivers make internal attributions, this simply means that receivers perceive the motivation behind the information-sharing behavior to originate from the message writer's opinion. Thus, external attribution can be seen as the level to which receivers blame a company. To examine the negative impacts of negative e-WOM messages, external attribution is more suitable than internal attribution. Therefore this study only takes external attribution into consideration. Following the concepts of attribution theory and ideas of Sen and Lerman, the construct for external attributions about writers is interpreted as the reflection of receiver's inferences to a writer's information-sharing behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Source credibility</head><p>Yoo et al. pointed out that e-WOM is a sort of know-how exchange among consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>; it is preceded by opportunity, motivation and ability. Therefore, source credibility is the perceived ability and motivation of a message source to provide accurate and truthful information. The source of a message can be seen as credible if the source is an expert or is trustworthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>. However, not all message writers have expertise or sufficient trustworthiness. Therefore, the judgment on the credibility of a message writer becomes very important in the communication process.</p><p>Grewal et al. indicated that source credibility refers to information receiver's perceptions of the trustworthiness and expertise of the information writer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. According to Senecal and Nantel, expertise can be viewed as the information source's perceived ability to know the right answer, and trustworthiness can be viewed as the perceived information source's motivation to convey this expert information without bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Amos et al. pointed out that expert writers should supposedly have sufficient knowledge that enables them to make accurate product/ service evaluations, to provide sensible reviews for the products/ services, and to give objective opinions and useful recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Trustworthiness refers to the level of confidence consumers place in communicators' intentions related to making their assertions. According to O'Keefe, a trustworthy writer is expected to have strong intention to tell the truth to information receivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, this study follows the definition of Grewal et al. and adopts the trustworthiness dimension; that is, source credibility refers to the perceived inclination by information receivers that the message writer tells the truth <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Information credibility</head><p>Several studies have examined online consumer-created information from the perspective of credibility, which can be separated into source credibility and information credibility. Information credibility refers to the message itself, such as information quality, accuracy, currency, and language intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Because of the convenience of the Internet, it is easy for internet users to share and search for information. However, they can rarely process all messages within a single online discussion forum because online messages are shared by countless internet surfers, and the presence of unfiltered information makes information validity impossible <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In this situation, when consumers seek other people's opinions, they tend to pay much more attention to the credibility of online information as opposed to offline information and will only take highly credible information into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. Following the definition of Nabi and Hendriks, this study defines information credibility as the extent to which individuals perceive an e-WOM message as believable, true, or factual <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Wathen and Burkell mentioned that information credibility plays an important role in the message persuasion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. Therefore, to examine negative e-WOM, it is necessary to investigate information credibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Negative e-WOM adoption</head><p>Individuals always seek information before making decisions. Positive information can lead to positive attitude and high purchase intention; on the other hand, negative information can result in the formation of negative attitudes and low intention to buy. Under many situations, negative information has a more useful and diagnostic effect on consumer purchase decisions than positive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>The effects of negative WOM may include forming negative attitudes, switching to other brands, and decreasing purchase intention. These outcomes can have negative impacts on companies. It is possible that companies will lose their reputation and have lower revenue because of negative e-WOM messages. However, if consumers have no intention to accept the received message, nothing will change despite their exposure to a negative e-WOM message. Therefore, information adoption is an important antecedent to forecast negative e-WOM effects. Gershoff et al. described negative e-WOM adoption as the information receiver's willingness and intention to rely on negative online WOM messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. If receivers adopt a negative e-WOM message, they will gain more knowledge about the product/brand, avoid bad purchase choices, and change their prior attitudes toward a brand. Thus, examining the adoption of negative e-WOM messages is very crucial for enterprises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Conceptual framework</head><p>The purpose of this study is to examine the persuasiveness of negative e-WOM messages. Three major components from the Yale model, including message, source, and receiver, are adopted. First, the message characteristics, consensus and vividness can have influences on receivers with regard to their forming external attributions about message writers and also on receiver perceptions regarding information credibility. However, these two effects will be moderated by receiver brand commitment, which represents a receiver characteristic. Then, external attributions about writers can lead to receivers perceiving high source credibility, which subsequently affects information credibility and negative e-WOM adoption. The conceptual framework, which includes seven constructs and corresponding interrelationships, is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Hypotheses development 2.5.1. Message characteristics (consensus &amp; vividness) vs. external attributions about writer</head><p>According to Lapinski and Rimal, when people receive negative information, they often consider other people's reactions to the information prior to judging by themselves what the causes of the problem are <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Therefore, when people read a negative e-WOM message, they tend to read other people's opinions before making their own judgments. Lee and Song found that high consensus is associated with external attributions, such as attributions toward products or services <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. On the other hand, vividly presented information is usually interesting, attractive, and inspiring. Consequently, vivid information, opposed to plain information, tends to have a stronger influence on product judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Thus, receivers might easily be persuaded by a vividly presented negative online message. The salience of messages should also influence receiver attribution. Lee and Song also demonstrated that the vividness level of online complaints can affect the formation of external attributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Hence, it is assumed that receivers will make external attributions when a message is presented with a high level of consensus and vividness. The following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H1. The higher the level of consensus and vividness, the more likely that a receiver will form external attributions about message writers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2.">Message characteristics (consensus &amp; vividness) vs. information credibility</head><p>Message consensus not only has an effect on causal attributions, but Cheung et al. also mentioned that if a message is consistent with other forum users' opinions, the receiver will perceive the message to be highly credible <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In contrast, if the online review is inconsistent, the receiver will be confused and will perceive the e-WOM review as less credible <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. In online discussion forums or blogs, individuals can easily compare different people's opinions in the reply area. If there are lots of message responses that support the writer's opinions, receivers will believe that many people have similar thoughts and will in turn perceive the message to be credible.</p><p>Coyle and Thorson indicated that the vividness level of a website can positively influence user's attitudes toward the website <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; in other words, attitudes toward a more vivid website will be more positive than those toward a less vivid website. Also, vivid advertisements will generate more positive attitudes than non-vivid advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Likewise, information vividness should also have a positive effect on receiver's attitudes toward negative e-WOM messages or toward the perceived credibility of a message. Accordingly, this study demonstrates that message characteristics can positively influence a receiver's perceived credibility about a review. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: H2. The higher the level of consensus and vividness, the higher the perceived information credibility.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">External attributions about writer vs. source credibility</head><p>According to Chang and Chuang, when seeking information in an online communication environment, receivers tend to judge the motivations behind a writer's information-sharing behavior with their own causal inferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Qiu et al. argued that consumers' attributional thinking toward an e-WOM message will affect their perceptions of the credibility of that message <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Especially, a negative e-WOM message might be caused by personal retribution or other internal reasons, but it might also be taken as a complaint about poor performance of the product/service or other external reasons. According to attribution theory, the writer's motivation inferred by receivers will then affect subsequent actions. In other words, if receivers form external attributions about a writer, this means they believe the information-sharing behavior is caused by the companies involved and that the writer simply is telling other people his/her true experiences and feelings.</p><p>By the definition of source credibility, the focus is on the source's motivation (trustworthiness) to provide accurate and truthful information <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>. Thus, external attributions about writers are similar to the concept of trustworthiness, which is a main dimension of source credibility; hence, external attributions about writers should have a positive effect on source credibility. Additionally, Laczniak et al. demonstrated that if receivers attribute negative information to a brand, it will lead to negative brand evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In other words, receivers will form negative writer evaluations if they attribute the fault to the writer. Likewise, if receivers make inferences that what is written is based on actual experiences, they will attribute the fault to the companies involved and form negative company evaluations while forming positive writer evaluations that are related to writer trustworthiness or writer credibility. Thus, this study expects that: H3. External attributions about the writer have a positive relationship with source credibility perceived by receivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">External attributions about writer vs. information credibility</head><p>Sen and Lerman mentioned that reader's causal inferences regarding a writer's motivation to post a message can affect readers' subsequent attitudes toward the message <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. If receivers believe that writers' information sharing behavior is due to the writers' feelings of gratitude or resentment, they will then attribute it to internal motivation. Conversely, if writers do a review because of poor products or services or because of dissatisfaction with the brand, the information sharing behavior will be attributed to external motivation.</p><p>Thus, according to attribution theory, this causal inference behavior will influence receiver's subsequent actions. If receivers form an attribution that the review is based on external reasons, they will perceive the review as legitimate, believable and actionable. In contrast, if the readers believe that the review is based on internal reasons, they will then discount the credit of the review <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. E-WOM messages are generated by writers who have had experience with a product/service; thus, the writer's motivation to share his/her experiences should also affect the receiver's attitude toward and evaluation of the e-WOM message. In this study, attitudes toward a message are represented by information credibility. Therefore, the hypothesis is: H4. External attributions about a writer have a positive relationship with information credibility that is perceived by receivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.5.">Source credibility vs. information credibility</head><p>Source credibility and information credibility are important credibility concepts, both of which can be adopted to examine message effects in the context of online and offline communication environment. Cheung et al. indicated that attributes of an information source, such as source credibility, attractiveness, physical appearance, familiarity, and power, can have an impact on the credibility of a message <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the online environment, when individuals are seeking information on websites, they read not only the content of the messages, but also the writer's files, such as his/her ratings and reputation.</p><p>In many situations, individuals use this writer-related information to determine the message writer's credibility. People tend to make connections between an object and items related to the object. If information receivers are assured that a writer is credible, the receiver will show intention to trust the message. In the context of computersupported social networks, receivers tend to consider the information useful and credible when they perceive that the information is provided by someone who is trustworthy and has expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Ko et al. indicated that information provided by highly credible sources is perceived to be useful and reliable, thereby facilitating knowledge transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Luo et al. mentioned that source credibility can directly form or change a reader's attitude and that information provided by a highly credible source will produce a greater effect on perceived information credibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Thus, the hypothesis of source credibility and information credibility is as follows:</p><p>H5. Message source credibility has a positive relationship with information credibility that is perceived by receivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.6.">Source credibility vs. negative e-WOM adoption</head><p>Source credibility is commonly seen as an important construct of source characteristics. Callison indicated that source credibility and trust are keys to message acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Source credibility plays a central role in decision making concerning information persuasiveness. In many face-to-face communication situations, people tend to adopt opinions from someone they consider trustworthy, such as family members, friends, and important others. In an online environment without face-to-face communication, they always receive messages from strangers. The openness of e-WOM gives rise to some concerns about the accuracy and validity of online information.</p><p>Online information receivers still can judge source credibility through factors such as attractiveness, expertise, and trustworthiness, which then influences their intention to adopt a message. Writers share their views based on their own knowledge of products or brands, and receivers will then judge the message writer's expertise before agreeing with an opinion. Because it is hard to identify message writers in the online communication environment, this may entice marketers and companies to manipulate the system in order to mislead consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Therefore, it is important for receivers to ensure that e-WOM messages are from trustworthy sources.</p><p>Greer mentioned that a communicator's trustworthiness is important to message acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. When information receivers perceive high trustworthiness in writers, that is, high source credibility, they will follow the opinion of the received message. In contrast, if receivers perceive low source credibility, the message adoption intention tends to be low. Karakaya and Barnes indicated that if consumers perceive online sources to be credible, then the next step would naturally be to apply these implications to buying decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Thus, this study proposes that:</p><p>H6. Message source credibility has a positive relationship with negative e-WOM adoption by the receiver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.7.">Information credibility vs. negative e-WOM adoption</head><p>In the message persuasion process, the time before and after receivers make judgments on a message's credibility is a key early stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. Before making a purchase decision, consumers can search product/ service information in both online and offline environments. This information-seeking behavior before buying a product/service is based on the need to avoid potential risk. Potential risk includes not only bad quality products or poor service, but also risks related to the message itself. There are lots of message writers who are biased or have insufficient knowledge. Thus, before making a purchase decision or adopting the validity of a message, receivers must judge information credibility to reduce perceived risk, yet they may have no intention to accept the content of the message. In purchase intention research, Kim et al. indicated that trust can reduce consumer's perceived risk and enhance purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Since credibility and trust are similar concepts, information credibility can also reduce receiver's risk perception and enhance intention to adopt an e-WOM message.</p><p>Cheung et al. investigated the relationships between information credibility and information adoption and found receiver's perceived information credibility to have positive effects on the acceptance of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Therefore, an information receiver's perceived information credibility regarding a message should have a positive relationship with the intention to adopt a message. If a negative review is regarded as credible, then they will accept the message and follow the content. This leads to subsequent attitude changes or purchase decisions, where both of these two outcomes represent the effectiveness of e-WOM. Thus, this study proposes that: H7. There is a positive relationship between perceived information credibility and negative e-WOM adoption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.8.">Moderating effect of brand commitment</head><p>Commitment has been widely used as a moderator in a large amount of research. Ahluwalia et al. proposed that consumers' prior brand commitment may prevent them from accepting negative information <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. People prefer to create a sense of consistency; their prior beliefs toward a target should be similar to what they receive. People who have a positive attitude toward a brand will discount a negative message that criticizes the specific brand because of their preference for consistency.</p><p>Liu et al. mentioned that consumers with high commitment are likely to bias the processes concerning received information, and they are expected to counter negative information more extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>; hence, they resist attitude changes in response to negative information. In contrast, when commitment to a target brand is low, consumers are expected to process negative information in a relatively objective manner. Considering the context of this study, receivers with high brand commitment are likely to discount received information that offers a negative view toward the brand, and, as a result, will not change their attitude. Thus, when receivers' brand commitment levels are high, they tend to counter negative messages and do not believe the content. Furthermore, high-commitment receivers are expected to process negative messages in a less objective manner. This will lead them to make biased causal inferences when they receive negative information and to attribute negative information sharing behavior to internal reasons. Thus, brand commitment is expected to be a moderator that can decrease the positive effects of message characteristics on external attributions about writer and information credibility: H8. Receiver brand commitment can weaken the relationship between message characteristics and (a) external attributions about the writer and (b) perceived information credibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>A 2 √ó 2 factorial design was employed in this study to examine whether different levels of message characteristics (consensus and vividness) have a different impact on receiver perceptions of external attributions about a writer and information credibility. The blog website Wretch was used to conduct the experimental survey in the form of online questionnaires. After reading one negative e-WOM message out of four, participants were asked to answer the questionnaire.</p><p>Starbucks was selected as the target brand to be criticized in the negative e-WOM message. By selling coffees, quality service, and a comfortable atmosphere, Starbucks, as one of the most famous coffee shop brands around the world, has a large consumer base in Taiwan. Since many shared e-WOM messages talk about product/service experiences with a specific brand, Starbucks should be very suitable to examine the moderating effect of brand commitment in a service context. In the blog, there were four messages used for the study scenarios which are to be discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Study scenarios</head><p>The message characteristics of both consensus and vividness have two different levels-high and low. The experiment was designed with four treatment conditions: high consensus and high vividness, high consensus and low vividness, low consensus and high vividness, and low consensus and low vividness. The scenario descriptions are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Consensus scenario</head><p>Lee and Song used four replies in each treatment condition to design the consensus scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The high consensus scenario suggests that three of four replies shared experiences similar to that of the message writer. However, considering the fact that information receivers should have high level of consensus, the high consensus scenario in this study was devised in such a way that all four replies were similar to the experiences and notions of the writer; for instance, there was a complaint that an employee made a wrong beverage and allowed a frequent customer to do queue-jumping, and the complaint was followed by four affirmative replies showing dissent toward Starbucks. In contrast, the scenario for a low level of consensus shows that all four replies disagree with the message writer's opinions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Vividness scenario</head><p>According to Lee and Song, the scenario for a high level of vividness includes photos that present defects in products <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. To extend the scenario design to the service context, the high vividness scenario had four photos illustrating Starbuck's poor service and contained detailed descriptions about how the problem occurs and the way that the Starbuck employee responds to that situation. In contrast, the scenario for low level of vividness has no photos demonstrating the bad experience and only contains a briefing of the cause and effect of the event.</p><p>In this study, a 36-item questionnaire was used to measure seven constructs and eight hypotheses. The 36 items were composed of 6 items for consensus and vividness manipulation checks with the remaining 30 items for the measurement of the remainder of the five constructs. All items were designed to use a seven-point Likert scale.</p><p>The pilot test was conducted on 45 respondents with a total of 43 valid questionnaires. The purpose of the pilot test, firstly, was to check whether the manipulations of the message characteristics were successfully adopted. An independent sample t-test was adopted. With regard to the results of consensus manipulation (t-value = 11.033, p = .000), the level of high and low consensus showed statistical difference; likewise, there was a significant difference between high and low vividness (t-value = 3.676, p = .001). Therefore, the four scenarios were adopted into the formal questionnaire. Secondly, it was necessary to ensure that all items in the questionnaire were reliable. The pilot test results showed that Cronbach's Œ± of each construct ranged from .741 to .943; all constructs exceeded the standard of .70; and item-to-total correlations ranged from .279 to .921. However, ATT1, ATT2, CRE6, ADO8, COM1, COM3, COM4, and COM5 did not reach the standard of .50 although most of them were very close to the standard. In the end, only ADO8 and COM4 were deleted from the questionnaire. CRE6 was kept, but it was merely used to filter invalid samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research analyses and results</head><p>Respondents were asked to randomly link to one questionnaire website out of four and to read the designed blog message before being asked to answer the formal questionnaire. All questionnaires were checked by some items designed to ensure respondents actually read the blog message. After deleting the invalid questionnaires, there were 504 valid questionnaires for further analysis. Respondents consisted of 47.6% males and 52.4% females. The majority of the respondents were 20 to 24 years old (60.9%), had a university education (51.1%) or graduate school (45.8%). 92.4% of the respondents had more than 5 years' experience with the Internet, and about 47.1% of them spent more than 30 h per week in using the Internet.</p><p>A two-step SEM was used to conduct the data analysis. First, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to check the convergent validity of all variables. The CFA results are also shown in Appendix A, with item-tototal correlation ranging from .389 to .907 and factor loadings from .410 to .964. The results of the AVE, Cronbach's alpha, and CR for each variable exhibited high convergent validity, internal consistency, and reliability. The Measurement Model Fit for the CFA were: the Chi-square (œá 2 ) = 402.694 (p = .000); the degree of freedom (df) = 142; œá 2 / df = 2.836; the GFI = .832; the AGFI = .775; CFI = .932, and the RMSEA = .091. All model fit index values reached the recommended values except for the AGFI and RMSEA. Since the value of the AGFI and RMSEA were close to the recommended value, the measurement model fit was considered to have an acceptable fit.</p><p>The results of discriminant validity are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Based on the results of a pair wise correlation matrix, the tolerance value was larger than .10, and the VIF ranged from 1.063 to 2.581. Thus, the multicollinearity of this study was acceptable. An independent samples t-test was adopted in this study to check the manipulation of the two message characteristics.</p><p>Furthermore, the means and standard deviations of the two levels of consensus and vividness, the mean score of high consensus (5.601) and high vividness <ref type="bibr">(5.446)</ref> were greater than the mean score of low consensus (1.838) and low vividness (2.056), respectively. In addition, the analysis of independent samples t-test also demonstrated a significant difference between high and low levels of consensus (t-value = 32.587, p = .000) and vividness (t-value = 27.599, p = .000). It was thus proven that the manipulations of the two message characteristics worked as expected in the main study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Message characteristics vs. external attributions about writer/information credibility</head><p>One-way ANOVA and Scheff√© post hoc tests were adopted to determine the statistically significant differences between the responses of each sample group. As presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, H1 was supported (F = 9.624, p = .000), implying message characteristics were significantly related to external attributions. Message characteristics were significantly related to the perception of information credibility; thus, H2 was supported (F = 6.681, p = .000). Based on the results of the Scheff√© post hoc tests, external attributions about writers showed no distinctions between configurations of high consensus and high vividness, high consensus and low vividness, as well as low consensus and high vividness. As for information credibility, there were no distinctions between configurations of high consensus and high vividness, high consensus and low vividness, and low consensus and high vividness. Moreover, there were also no distinctions between configuration of high consensus and low vividness, and low consensus and low vividness.</p><p>To examine the moderating effect of brand commitment, it was divided into two sample groups based on the median of 2.333. As a result, the mean difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (high mean = 3.642; low mean = 1.812; t-value = 16.874, p = .000). The ANOVA and Scheff√© post hoc tests were then conducted based on the divided data in order to determine the statistically significant differences between the responses of high consensus √ó high vividness sample group and the low consensus √ó low vividness sample group. The data analysis only compared these two sample groups because there were absolute distinctions between the high consensus √ó high vividness sample group and the low consensus √ó low vividness sample group, whereas the differences between the high consensus √ó low vividness and low consensus √ó high vividness sample groups were hard to identify.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, when the brand commitment level rose from low to high, the mean values of external attributions about the writer became lower under the condition of high consensus and high vividness (HH) (M from 6.036 to 5.182). For two treatment conditions, low consensus and high vividness (LH) as well as high consensus and low vividness (HL), the mean value of external attributions about the writer became slightly lower. However, the mean values of external attributions about the writer became slightly higher under the condition of low consensus and low vividness (LL) (M from 4.938 to 4.973). Based on the Scheff√© post hoc test, the mean difference of external attributions about the writer between HH and LL was significant when brand commitment level was low (HH-LL = 1.098, p b .001), whereas this difference became insignificant when the brand commitment level was high (p N .05). This means that receiver brand commitment can weaken the positive relationships between message characteristics and external attributions about a writer. As presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the HH, LH, and HL line became closer to the LL line LL line when the brand commitment level rose. The change in the HH line was the most significant. Therefore, H8a was supported.</p><p>When the level of brand commitment was enhanced, the mean value of information credibility became lower under the HH message characteristics condition, and under the LH condition, it was the same. These results indicated that the level of brand commitment could also weaken the positive relationships between message characteristics and information credibility. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the HH line and LH line became closer to the LL line when brand commitment level rose, but the HL line did not. Based on these results, H8b was supported.</p><p>SEM analysis was employed in this study to check the coefficients in the structural equations and to ensure the adequacy of H3, H4, H5, H6, and H7. The model included external attributions about the writer as the endogenous variable and information credibility, source credibility, negative e-WOM adoption as the exogenous variables. The path diagram of the SEM model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. The Chi-square (œá 2 ) = 358.681 (p = .000); the degree of freedom (df) = 99; œá 2 /df = 3.623; the GFI = .819; the AGFI = .752; CFI = .926, and the RMSEA = .108.</p><p>The results represented model-data fit because these three indices were approximately the recommended value. Among the five hypotheses, there were three that were significant (p b 0.05), whereas the other two hypotheses showed no significant relationships. H3 was supported; the formation of external attributions about the writer had a positive relationship with information credibility perceived by the receiver (Œ≤ = .497, p b .000). However, external attributions about the writer didn't have a significant impact on the receiver's perceived information credibility (Œ≤ = -.046, p N .05); therefore, H4 was not supported. H5 was supported since the message source credibility had positive relationships with information credibility. However, H6 was not supported, which means that information receivers did not exhibit adoption intention toward a negative e-WOM message even if they perceived high source credibility (Œ≤ = .016, p N .05); whereas, information receivers tended to adopt the negative e-WOM message they read when they perceived high information credibility; thus, H7 was supported.</p><p>To sum up, the results of the proposed hypotheses testing are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. Among the eight hypotheses, six were supported (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, H8a, and H8b), and the other two were not supported (H4 and H6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and recommendations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Research findings</head><p>This study, by using three components proposed in the Yale model (message, source, and receiver), examined whether an information receiver would perceive credibility about a negative message and at the end would adopt the opinions shared with the message writer through the interactions of message characteristics, external attributions about the writer, source credibility, and brand commitment. The results showed that two of the eight hypotheses were not supported. The following sections provide more details about the findings of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Effects of message characteristics</head><p>This study revealed that H1 and H2 were supported. The data analysis results proved two expectations. First, information receivers formed external attributions about a writer based on the messages they read. This finding was in accordance with the results of Lee and Song, who suggested that when a consumer reads a blog complaint message, and other consumers share their supportive replies, the consumer is very likely to attribute the writer's information-sharing behavior to be motivated by truly poor service <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, this feeling was found to be slightly weaker under both conditions in which the message was composed of non-supportive replies with literal and abstract descriptions as well as including detailed supportive replies. However, if the received message didn't contain both supportive replies and concrete descriptions, the information receiver was less likely to place blame. The results further revealed that as long as one message characteristic is at a high level, receivers will be more likely to form external attributions about a writer.</p><p>Second, the relationship between message characteristics and receiver-perceived information credibility was developed and proven by this study. Cheung et al. demonstrated that in an online context, receivers will perceive a message as credible if it is consistent with other messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. When seeking information in the online communication environment, receivers not only can compare opinions with several messages in online discussion forums, but also can view the replies within only a blog so that they can, based on opinion consistency, ensure whether the message is believable. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that the vividness of an object such as a website <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> can influence people's attitudes. There have been no studies examining this relationship in the e-WOM context. This study proved that the level of vividness of a blog message could lead receivers to form positive attitudes toward the message and that the positive attitude was perceived information credibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Effects of external attributions about writer on credibility perceptions</head><p>H3 was supported; after reading a negative message, receivers formed external attributions when they believed the message writer had motivation to tell actual experiences and feelings regarding poor service performance. In an online communication environment such as a blog, information receivers cannot obtain much information about the writer. However, after reading a blog message that contains service complaints, receivers will naturally make inferences on what motivated the writer to post this message. Such motivational inferences will be seen as information about the writer and will in turn become the foundation of the judgment with regard to writer credibility.</p><p>H4 was not supported. This finding is inconsistent with the findings of Sen and Lerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Furthermore, H5 was supported and was in accordance with the viewpoint of Grewal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Sussman and Siegal <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and Ko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Atkin et al. indicated that the motivation of an advertiser attributed by consumers could affect their evaluations of the advertisement <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Although message receivers may have felt that the writer wrote the message based on external attributions, the negative messages may have expressed some highly negative emotional tone in the wording. Under this circumstance, the message receiver may evaluate the message writer (i.e., source) as credible but may view the information as unreliable. Because message receivers may not consider the actual situation of the writer, they may agree that poor service performance was caused by the company, but may not agree with negative emotional information as expressed by the writer. However, when considering writer credibility, messages can be more persuasive, which resulted in support for H5. It can be concluded that external attribution about a writer has no direct effect on information credibility, but there is an indirect effect via source credibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3.">Effect of source credibility and information credibility on negative e-WOM adoption</head><p>Karakaya and Barnes indicated that if consumers perceive a source to be credible, they will logically be affected by the message that comes from the source <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Unfortunately, the results of this study (H6) did not indicate support for this assumption. On the contrary, the relationship between information credibility and information adoption (H7) was supported. As mentioned by Bambauer-Sachse and Mangold, online consumers weight negative information more heavily than positive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Moreover, Sen and Lerman indicated that negative cues are perceived as counter normative because the social environment contains a greater number of positive as compared to negative cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Therefore, the process by which consumers cope with negative information may be more deliberate. Consumers may not simply take action just because a writer is viewed as credible without considering what they have written, especially when it comes to negative messages. Furthermore, the key to persuasiveness should be from the message content and the meaning of information presented. Writer credibility plays a role of supporting the message information as more credible; in turn, the degree of persuasiveness will be enhanced, which will result in an increase in the possibility of adoption possibility on the part of the message receiver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4.">Moderating role as brand commitment</head><p>Ahluwalia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Chang and Chuang <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> suggested that consumers' prior brand commitment may prevent them from acceptance of negative information that talks about the brand. That is, consumers will have evaluation bias when negative messages are related to their brand preferences. The study results supported H8a and H8b, indicating that brand commitment not only can weaken the positive relationship between message characteristics and external attributions formed about a writer, but also can weaken the effects of message characteristics on information credibility.</p><p>In the case of receivers who had low levels of commitment to a famous brand, the reactions between receivers who perceived high message vividness and consensus and low message vividness and were shown to be significantly different. People who experienced high message vividness and consensus were shown to be more likely to agree with the message writer and to place blame on Starbucks as compared to receivers who received low message vividness and consensus. However, for receivers whose commitment levels to Starbucks were high, the reaction between the receivers of the two message configuration was not significantly different. To sum up, regardless of whether they experienced high/low message vividness and consensus, reader's motivation inference and perceptions of information credibility were similar.</p><p>The findings indicate low brand commitment receivers to be strongly affected by negative blog messages and suggested that they showed less suspicion toward unfavorable information about Starbucks, whereas receivers who had higher commitment levels to Starbucks were only slightly influenced by the negative message and tended to discount the writer's opinions and to show disbelief toward the blog message. Therefore, the results are consistent with the notion proposed by Ahluwalia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that brand commitment can moderate information receiver's attribution formation and credibility perceptions. To conclude the above discussion, firstly, when information receivers evaluated the message characteristics as both having higher consensus and more vividness, they were more likely to judge the message writing motivation as externally motivated and viewed the information as being more credible. Secondly, in term of judging the credibility of the negative message through the process of attribution theory, writer (or source) credibility played an important mediating role in persuading the message receiver's credibility perceptions toward the message. However, in terms of adoption action, credible information was shown to be the key to persuading consumers to act rather than merely a credible writer. That is, when a credible writer produces a credible message, the message receiver will be more likely to adopt it even if it is a negative message. Lastly, brand commitment was shown to play a critical moderating role in the process of information persuasiveness, which can affect message receiver adoption of negative messages.</p><p>In addition, the role of attribution theory in the information persuasiveness process may be not too obviously presented in this study. This may be a result of the design of the message characteristics, which attempted to tell the message receiver that the problem was a result of poor staff service performance. The wordings and the sentences used may have been too emotionally strong; therefore, the message receiver may have felt that the message was too intense for such a small matter. Furthermore, the brand (i.e., Starbucks) that we chose could be another reason for a lack of persuasiveness. Since Starbucks is a favored and popular brand in the market, consumers initially generally have good impressions of the brand and services. Message receivers may have felt that the scenario was a special case that could not be over-generalized. Accordingly, we can conclude that the external attribution message design is limited to the message receiver's ability to determine the information credibility of the negative message.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Theoretical implications</head><p>The results of this study contribute some theoretical and managerial implications. From the theoretical perspective, firstly, the Yale model has been adopted by a limited number of studies to explore e-WOM issues. Cheung et al. extended the concepts of the Yale model to determine the informational determinants that possibly affect the credibility of e-WOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It was anticipated that information receivers would form attitudes based on their casual attributions and take actions after reading an online message. To examine a receiver's perceptions of credibility and adoption toward a negative e-WOM message, this study took the receiver's attribution process into account. The results indicated that a receiver's perception of information credibility could be affected by external attributions through source credibility, which in turn could lead receivers to adopt the negative e-WOM message. Therefore, attribution theory actually exists in the information persuasiveness process.</p><p>Secondly, by extending the research of Lee and Song in which two message characteristics (consensus and vividness) were adopted to explore receiver's responses, such as receiver's attribution and company evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the current study adopted the causal attribution concept for further examination such as using attribution theory to explore receivers' perceptions of credibility as well as their intention to adopt a message. The study showed that message characteristics not only affected receiver's external attributions making, as proven by Lee and Song, but also that they influenced information credibility perceptions. Meanwhile, these information credibility perceptions could lead receivers to adopt the negative e-WOM message, and the outcomes may be negative company evaluations. As compared to Lee and Song, the findings of this study provided a more complete explanation about consumer's information processing activities in the online communication environment.</p><p>Thirdly, since blog message writers are unseen strangers to information receivers, it is problematic to adopt the source characteristic, which   is a vital component in the Yale model, to examine message persuasiveness in the online communication environment. This study addressed this source issue by using external attributions about the writer as the source characteristic. The results supported the expectation that message characteristics can lead receivers to form external attributions and that the causal attributions would be the basis upon which information receivers judge source credibility. Perceptions of source credibility will reduce receiver anxiety related to information credibility and further lead to negative e-WOM adoption.</p><p>Lastly, according to the Yale model, receiver characteristics are influential in the communication process. Prior studies have pointed out that commitment can moderate the effect of negative information <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Accordingly, this study extended previous findings about the moderating role of brand commitment into a detailed examination. The results demonstrated that the level of brand commitment could hamper information receivers from forming external attributions as well as their perceptions regarding information credibility. Furthermore, the results also showed that the moderating role of brand commitment existed in the online communication environment and that it could prevent receivers from accepting a negative e-WOM message.</p><p>To sum up, based on the findings of this study, it can be said that the Yale model can fit the online communication context. By combining the Yale model and attribution theory, the question as to how and when an information receiver is affected by a powerful negative e-WOM message can be answered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Managerial implications</head><p>From the managerial perspective, firstly, consensus and vividness are key factors for understanding the online attribution process as well as credibility perceptions. As long as one of the message characteristics is at a high level, the negative impact of the message increases. This means that if unsatisfied customers post highly vivid and agreed upon messages, the negative impact on a company's reputation will be substantial. Therefore, for service companies such as Starbucks, it is critical to find ways to lessen the powerful impact of a negative e-WOM message.</p><p>Secondly, to manage complaints shared by unsatisfied customers, service firms such as Starbucks can set up their own online discussion forum or blog, which can provide a space to customers to express their unhappiness and unsatisfied feelings. Companies can then easily gather unfavorable opinions, and then improve their service based on these opinions. To do this efficiently, these companies also should consider offering feedback to customers who share their comments.</p><p>Lastly, there is another way for service firms to avoid negative information that can potentially damage the company's image and reputation, which is to generate consumer brand commitment. Managers can develop strategies to highlight company values and deliver these values and beliefs to their consumers. For example, they could conduct marketing activities, such as providing a loyalty program, VIP membership, or a frequent-buyer program, to emphasize their company's values and beliefs. In addition, they should also conduct good customer relationship management. Furthermore, according to Salmones et al., corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be seen as a viable concept to increase consumer commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Therefore, to generate consumer brand commitment, managers can take CSR into account when making strategies. Whatever strategy is adopted, companies should view a strategy that increases consumer brand commitment before the release of a negative message as more valuable than any strategy intended to remedy the impact after a negative message is released.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Limitations and directions for future research</head><p>This study used the Yale model and attribution theory to examine the effects of negative e-WOM message; however, there are still some limitations. Future study that is intended to examine a similar context must consider sample randomness in the online research context for the distribution of questionnaires.</p><p>Secondly, information credibility regarding negative e-WOM message is a vital variable of this study; however, the design of the negative messages must be done very carefully. Future studies should use some neutral words and descriptions in the design of the messages. This could be more persuasive for message receivers with regard to information credibility.</p><p>Lastly, this study was targeted at negative e-WOM messages; nevertheless, every approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Messages containing both positive and negative views should hence be a normal condition. Therefore, future researchers should be aware of this fact and should conduct an examination on the effects of two-sided messages that are composed of both positive and negative opinions.</p></div>
