<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite many advances in the field of computational reliability analysis, the efficient estimation of the reliability of a system with multiple failure modes remains a persistent challenge. Various sampling and analytical methods are available, but they typically require accepting a tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, a surrogate-based approach is presented that simultaneously addresses the issues of accuracy, efficiency, and unimportant failure modes. The method is based on the creation of Gaussian process surrogate models that are required to be locally accurate only in the regions of the component limit states that contribute to system failure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The aim of computational reliability analysis is to assess the safety, or ''reliability,'' of an engineered system by considering how its performance is affected by random variations and uncertainties in demands, system properties, boundary and initial conditions, etc. The objective is to compute an estimate of the probability that the performance of the system will satisfy a given requirement, or, conversely, the probability that the system will fail. However, most systems have multiple modes in which failure can occur. The system might consist only of a single component that is subject to multiple different failure mechanisms (e.g., stress and displacement in a mechanical component), or it might be made up of multiple components. The analysis of such systems is referred to as ''system reliability analysis'' where multiple failure modes are considered, as opposed to ''component reliability analysis'' where only a single failure mode is considered.</p><p>Two types of methods are available for reliability analysis. Monte Carlo sampling methods are easy to use, but such methods are often computationally prohibitive because of the number of performance model evaluations that they require. This has given rise to a number of alternative, ''analytical'' methods that are based on the concept of a most probable point (MPP) of failure.</p><p>Such methods are drastically more efficient, but they also introduce additional approximations that are sometimes unacceptable.</p><p>For large structures requiring time-consuming finite element analysis, component-level reliability analysis can be a computationally expensive task and system-level reliability analysis can be even more so. Monte Carlo sampling methods can be used for system analysis, but the expense is increased n-fold when applied to a system made up of n components if each response function is defined in a separate model. The MPP-based efficient analytical reliability methods have also been adapted for system analysis by developing an approximation of the combined system failure region. However, these analytical methods already involve approximations at the component level, and calculating the reliability given this combined failure region involves yet another approximation that has the potential to introduce substantial error.</p><p>The efficiency and accuracy tradeoffs between sampling and analytical methods have been well studied for component reliability analysis, but an additional feature arises with system reliability analysis: some component failure modes may contribute more than others to the probability of system failure. For example, in a series system, the probability of failure is driven primarily by the weakest component. However, the previously proposed sampling and analytical methods for system reliability analysis treat all of the component performance functions equally, ignoring the fact that in many cases one or more failure modes are significantly more important than the others. In such a situation, the computational effort expended in evaluating the performance functions associated with unimportant failure modes or in locating the corresponding most probable point of failure is wasted. This paper presents an approach based on the use of surrogate models that is designed to take advantage of this special feature of system analysis. The performance models associated with the various failure modes are only evaluated as necessary to construct an accurate surrogate model of the system failure surface. The method is an extension of previous work on component reliability analysis, and it is based on the creation of Gaussian process surrogate models that are required to be locally accurate only in the regions of the component limit states that contribute to system failure.</p><p>Section 2 provides an introduction to reliability analysis methods for component-and system-level problems. Section 3 describes the use of Gaussian process models for component reliability analysis. Section 4 reformulates this approach for reliability analysis at the system level. Three potential methods are explored, but one is determined to be clearly superior to the others. Section 5 applies this newly derived method to three system problems including both series and parallel systems, comparing its accuracy to sampling methods and its efficiency, where available, to results from the literature. Section 6 provides some conclusions on the proposed method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Reliability analysis</head><p>The goal of reliability analysis is to determine the probability that an engineered component or system will fail in service given that its behavior is affected by random inputs. This behavior is defined by a response function gðxÞ, where x is the vector of random inputs with the joint probability density function f x . Failure is defined to occur when the response function exceeds (or fails to exceed) some threshold value z. The probability of failure, p f , is then computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p f ¼ Z Á Á Á Z g 4 z f x ðxÞ dx<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where the integration is performed over the failure region where g 4 z. It is rarely practical to evaluate this multiple integral analytically <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and several methods for approximating this integral have been created. Sections 2.1 and 2.2 briefly review common methods for solving the component-level problem (where only one failure mode is considered). Section 2.3 then discusses how these methods ''scale-up'' for system-level reliability analysis (where multiple failure modes are present).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Analytical methods</head><p>These methods involve solving a nonlinear optimization problem to locate the point on the limit state (the contour on the response function where g ¼ z) that has the greatest probability of occurring. This point is known as the most probable point or MPP. An approximation to the limit state is then formed at this point to facilitate the integration required to compute the probability of failure.</p><p>The MPP search optimization problem is formulated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> minimize</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u T u subject to GðuÞ ¼ z<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where u is a vector describing the location of the MPP in the uncorrelated standard normal ''u''-space and GðuÞ gðxÞ by definition. The optimal MPP solution u n defines the reliability index from b ¼ 7 Ju n J 2 , which is used to determine the probability of failure through the probability integration. The first-order reliability method (FORM) approximates the limit state as a linear function. In this case, because b represents the distance from the mean response to the MPP in standard normal space, the probability integration simplifies to</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p f ¼ FðÀbÞ ð<label>3Þ</label></formula><p>Second-order approximations are also available <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, but these methods still rely on only the location of the MPP and local information in its immediate vicinity (e.g., the curvature) to construct an approximation to the limit state. For problems where the limit state possesses a higher degree of nonlinearity or is multimodal, the information at a single point is not sufficient to construct an accurate approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Sampling methods</head><p>Sampling methods are alternatives to MPP-based methods, in which the probability integration is performed numerically by sampling the response function. These methods do not rely on a simplifying approximation to the shape of the limit state, so they can be more accurate than analytical methods, but they can also be prohibitively expensive because they generally require a large number of response function evaluations. Various importance sampling methods have been developed to reduce this expense by focusing the samples in the important regions of the random variable space <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Another method of reducing this cost is through the use of surrogate models. Typically, a relatively small set of points are selected through a design of experiments and the true response is calculated at each. These points are then used to construct an approximation to the true response using polynomial regression, polynomial chaos expansions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Gaussian process modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, multiple adaptive regression splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, etc. This model is then used as a surrogate to produce response function values in the sampling, thereby greatly reducing cost. However, the accuracy of the probability estimate will be poor if the approximation is inaccurate, and increasing the accuracy of the surrogate model typically requires additional samples from the true response function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">System-level reliability analysis</head><p>As with component-level reliability analysis, methods for solving system-level reliability analysis can be generally broken into two groups: analytical methods based on the MPP, and sampling methods. MPP-based methods are more efficient but rely on approximations that may be inaccurate while the sampling methods are generally more accurate, but only if enough samples are used, which can make them prohibitively expensive. This section provides a brief introduction into how both classes of methods can be applied to system-level reliability analysis. See Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for more detailed explanations.</p><p>The probability of failure of a series system is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p series f ¼ P [ i g i ðxÞ Zz i " #<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>and for a parallel system,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p parallel f ¼ P \ i g i ðxÞ Z z i " #<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where each component failure is defined as the response g i exceeding the limit z i , but could also be defined as not exceeding z, and could be different for each component i.</p><p>It is important to note that this is the system definition for which the method presented in this paper has been formulated: an engineered system with multiple failure modes, each defined by a response function g i , in either a series or parallel configuration. Analyzing the reliability of complex systems defined by combinations of series and/or parallel ''subsystems'' or by large numbers of cut sets have been recently explored by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, but are not the subject of this work. Future research may investigate the applicability of this method to these types of complex systems. The method described here is intended for systems whose complexity arises from component limit states that are potentially defined by highly nonlinear or computationally intensive response functions. Additionally, some research on system reliability methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> concentrates on systems where the component reliabilities are known; the focus of the methods presented in that research is then on how to accurately compute the system reliability given the reliabilities and connectivity of the components that make up the system. The method presented in this paper does not require that the component reliabilities be known. In fact, a key feature of this method is its ability to identify components that do not contribute to failure of the system, and avoid spending computational effort estimating their reliability.</p><p>Solving either Eqs. (4 or 5) via sampling is conceptually simple. For each random realization of x, all of the component response functions g i are evaluated. For a series system, if any component fails, then the random sample is counted as a system failure. Accordingly, for a parallel system, if all of the components fail, the sample is counted as a system failure. The system probability of failure is then simply the ratio of the number of system failures found to the total number of samples drawn, i.e., p system f ¼ N system f =N.</p><p>Solving the system-level problem via MPP-based methods is more complicated. These methods are generally broken into two steps: First, the MPP for each component problem is located, which defines the reliability index b for that component. Second, one of several methods is used to combine this component information to approximate the system reliability. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> provides a good summary of these methods.</p><p>In general, any appropriate method can be used to locate the MPP for each of the components. With these located, let B represent the vector of reliability indices for each of the components, and let A represent the correlation matrix between the component failure modes (calculated as the dot products of the negative normalized gradients of the component response functions at their respective MPPs). Then, approximating the limit states as linear, for a series system, the probability of failure can be calculated as 1ÀFðB,AÞ; for a parallel system it is FðÀB,AÞ, where F is the standard normal multivariate cumulative distribution function. If only two failure modes are present, these can be evaluated using the bivariate normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, but the more general multivariate case is more difficult. Options include methods to bound the system probability of failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, or various methods to approximate the multinormal integral using importance sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, multiple linearizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, or moment-based approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. (The computational examples in Section 5 simply evaluate the multinormal integral numerically via Monte Carlo sampling.) Because these methods require that (1) the MPP be successfully located for each component, and (2) the component reliability be accurately quantified with the applied approximation, these methods may not lead to accurate reliability estimates.</p><p>The next section provides a summary of previous work that achieves both efficiency and accuracy for component-level reliability analysis, referred to as efficient global reliability analysis (EGRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, followed by a discussion of three possible ways that EGRA might be applied to the system-level problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Efficient global reliability analysis</head><p>Efficient global reliability analysis was recently introduced by the authors in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. EGRA locates multiple points in the vicinity of the limit state and uses these points to construct a Gaussian process model that provides a global approximation for the entire limit state. By adaptively focusing the samples in the only region of the space where accuracy is important (near the limit state) an effective model is created with a minimal number of samples. The resulting model is then used as an inexpensive surrogate to provide function evaluations in a sampling method to perform the probability integration, which leads to highly accurate probability estimates. The method's name is derived from its connection with efficient global optimization (EGO), which was originally proposed by Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for application to unconstrained minimization problems.</p><p>The feature that sets EGRA apart from other surrogate-based reliability methods is its iterative process based on the expected feasibility function (EFF) described in Section 3.2. The EFF is used to select the location at which a new training point should be added to the Gaussian process model by maximizing the expectation that the point lies on the limit state contour. A point could be expected to lie on the limit state contour if its predicted value is near the limit state value, or if the uncertainty in its prediction is such that there is a significant probability of its true value being near the limit state value. Because the uncertainty is higher in regions of the space with fewer observations, this provides a balance between exploiting areas that predict good solutions, and exploring areas where more information is needed. The general procedure of EGRA is:</p><p>1. Build an initial Gaussian process model of the response function. 2. Find the point that maximizes the EFF. If the EFF value at this point is sufficiently small, stop. 3. Evaluate the response function at the point where the EFF is maximized. Update the Gaussian process model using this new point. Go to Step 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Gaussian process models</head><p>Gaussian process (GP) modeling is a powerful technique based on spatial statistics that can be used to construct a surrogate model for an expensive performance function. A statistical model describes the performance function as a random function observed at a set of locations (known as the ''training points''), and predictions for the values of the function at unobserved locations are derived based on conditional probability theory. Some examples of the use of GP models in this fashion include Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. One advantage of this approach is that it is nonparametric, meaning no assumptions about the functional form are required. Another advantage is that the method gives more meaningful variance estimates than other statistical modeling techniques (for example, the GP variance estimates can correctly identify training data locations as having zero variance, which is useful when approximating deterministic computer models). These variance estimates can be used to guide the selection of future training point locations.</p><p>A brief outline of the GP modeling procedure used in this work is given here, but further details can be found in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Note that the specific modeling choices described here (for example the mean and covariance functions) are those used by the authors, but the applicability of the EGRA algorithm is by no means predicated on these modeling choices, and other GP formulations could certainly be employed.</p><p>The response function, gðxÞ (defined in Section 2), is modeled by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">gðxÞ ¼ hðxÞ T bþZðxÞ ð 6Þ</formula><p>where hðxÞ T b is the mean function, b is a vector of coefficients, and</p><p>ZðÞ is a stationary Gaussian process with zero mean (and covariance defined below) that describes the departure of the model from its underlying trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The mean function is a representation of the central tendency of g. In practice, the most common formulations for the mean function are a constant or linear function of the inputs x. Our implementation adopts a constant mean both for parsimony and because we have not seen gains from employing higher order mean functions, but of course any mean function could be used as part of the EGRA algorithm.</p><p>The covariance function plays the role of capturing the deviations of g from the mean. Among other things, the covariance regulates the magnitude of these deviations, the roughness of g, and the typical lengthscale of changes in g. A variety of covariance functions have been proposed in the literature. The Ma ´tern family is often recommended by statisticians (see, for example Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>), whereas the use of the Gaussian family appears to predominate in the engineering literature for applications involving the approximation of deterministic computer models <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. The Ma ´tern covariance is more flexible, because in addition to length-scale parameters, it includes a parameter that governs the degree of differentiability of the underlying random process. However, the use of a Gaussian covariance function drastically reduces computational expense, and in fact the Gaussian covariance is the limiting case of the Ma ´tern covariance as the smoothness parameter approaches infinity. In this paper, a Gaussian covariance function is used, but this is not a requirement for EGRA. Further details and discussion regarding covariance functions can be found in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p><p>Let the covariance between outputs of the Gaussian process ZðÞ at points a and b be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Cov½ZðaÞ,ZðbÞ ¼ s 2 Z Rða,bÞ ð 7Þ</formula><p>where s 2</p><p>Z is known as the process variance and RðÞ is the correlation function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Expected feasibility function</head><p>The expected feasibility function is used to select the location at which a new training point should be added to the Gaussian process model.

In this case, z À , z þ , m g , s g , and e are all functions of the location x, while z is a constant. Note that the EFF provides a balance between exploration and exploitation. Points where the expected value is close to the threshold (m g % z) and points with a large uncertainty in the prediction will have large expected feasibility values. See Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for details on the implementation of the EGRA algorithm for component reliability analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">System-level formulations for EGRA</head><p>There are multiple ways in which EGRA might be extended to the system-level reliability analysis problem. This section will explore three of them, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Component solutions</head><p>The first way that EGRA can be used to estimate the reliability of a system is conceptually very simple. The basic idea is to first use EGRA to independently train a GP model for each of the component response functions. Note that this step only constructs the models, it does not sample them to calculate the component reliability (though that could optionally be performed if the analyst desired this information). Once a GP model has been built for each component limit state, these models can be sampled in the same way that sampling might be used to solve the system reliability problem directly on the ''true'' response functions (see Section 2.3). Because EGRA has already been shown to be an efficient and accurate method for constructing surrogate models of the component limit states <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, this would similarly provide an efficient and accurate method for solving the systemlevel problem. However, consider the case where one (or more) component limit state does not contribute to the system probability of failure because the probability of the system violating this limit state is much smaller than that of other components. In such a case, the effort spent constructing the GP model for this component limit state is essentially wasted. While this method of applying EGRA to the system-level problem would be accurate, its efficiency can be further improved. The next two methods present ways that EGRA can focus its efforts only on the limit states that bound the failure region of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Composite Gaussian process model</head><p>In this second method, rather than construct an independent GP model for each of the components, EGRA attempts to train a single GP model to capture the so-called ''composite'' limit state. This limit state is made up of the portions of the component limit states that bound the system failure region. Consider the system problem depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> consisting of the following component response functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">g 1 ðxÞ ¼ x 2 1 þ x 2 À8<label>ð15Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">g 2 ðxÞ ¼ x 1 5 þ x 2 À6<label>ð16Þ</label></formula><p>The lines in this plot represent the component limit states (g 1 ¼ 0 and g 2 ¼ 0); the shaded area is the system failure region (g 1 r 0 \ g 2 r 0). The composite limit state clearly has ''sides'' defined by the g 1 limit state and a ''top'' defined by the g 2 limit state.</p><p>EGRA can be adapted to search for this composite limit state through a simple modification of the response function. Let the system reliability problem be defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">p f ¼ P½g 1 ðxÞ r0 \ g 2 ðxÞ r 0 ð<label>17Þ</label></formula><p>Because both of these component limit states are defined via a r operator and their limit state values are both z ¼ 0 (in general, these conditions can always be met through a simple rearrangement of the component response functions) this problem can be redefined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">p f ¼ P½maxðg 1 ðxÞ,g 2 ðxÞÞ r0 ð<label>18Þ</label></formula><p>where maxðg 1 ðxÞ,g 2 ðxÞÞ is now the composite response function on which EGRA will operate. Note that if this system was concerned with the union of these events rather than the intersection (a series rather than a parallel system), then the ''max'' could simply be replaced with a ''min''. Additionally, this concept can be scaled up for any number of response functions. With this composite response function in place, EGRA now operates as in the case of an individual failure mode. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the results of this method applied to the system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. For each of the 52 training points at which EGRA requests the true response, all of the component response functions are evaluated and either the minimum or maximum (depending on the definition of the system failure) response is returned.</p><p>Conceptually, this method should be more efficient than building GP models separately for each response function because EGRA might be able to ''ignore'' portions of the component limit states that do not contribute to the composite limit state. However, it is clear from the plot that this is not the case. While EGRA does a good job of focusing the training data near the composite limit state, it requires a relatively substantial number of samples to do so (note the large number of wasted samples far from the limit state) and the final form of the GP limit state contour does not compare well to the true limit states near the corners where the component limit states meet. There are two issues with solving the system problem in this way that create fundamental problems with the composite GP model.</p><p>The first issue is the relative scaling between the responses. At each sample point, EGRA receives the response value from only one of the components. Each of the components has the same limit state value, but they may diverge from this value as they move away from the limit state at much different rates. This creates discontinuities in the composite GP because points that are relatively near one another might have largely different responses because they actually come from different components. Because the GP relies on determining the correlation between points based on their distance from one another and the magnitude of their responses, it is clear how this kind of response creates difficulty in fitting a GP to the data. This leads to greater variance in the GP predictions, which leads to greater expected feasibility values, which leads EGRA to request more training data Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Graphical depiction of the composite limit state. The lines are component limit states; the shaded area is the system failure region. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Results from running EGRA on the composite response function. Note the disagreement between the GP contour and the true limit states near the corners.</p><p>to converge the model, making this method far more expensive than hoped.</p><p>The second problem with fitting a composite GP model is the presence of sharp corners in the composite limit state. As formulated, the GP model creates smooth responses, so it is incapable of accurately modeling sharp changes in the limit state contour. For any case where the composite limit state is made up of portions of the component limit states, there will be corners where the separate component limit states cross. While the ''sharpness'' of these corners may differ, they will always be nonsmooth and thus create difficulties for the composite GP model.</p><p>An additional problem with this method is the computational expense. As was just discussed, the difficulty with fitting a GP model to the composite response requires EGRA to request a relatively large number of training points, so it is important to realize that at each of these training points all of the component response functions must be evaluated. So while the result in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows that 52 training points were requested, it actually represents 104 function evaluations.</p><p>The final method for applying EGRA to system-level reliability analysis retains the concept of the composite limit state, but keeps the GP models of the components independent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Composite expected feasibility function</head><p>The first system-level EGRA method provided an accurate reliability estimate, but might be overly expensive if one or more components does not contribute greatly to failure of the system. The second method introduced the concept of the composite limit state in an effort to reduce this expense, but attempting to form a composite GP model created problems that actually led to additional expense. The third method investigated here utilizes the composite limit state, but moves its effect on EGRA internally to the expected feasibility function (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">19</ref>) below), rather than replacing the response function itself. By keeping the component GP models independent, this removes the difficulty in training the composite model while still retaining the cost benefit of seeking only the composite limit state.</p><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">14</ref>), the EFF was derived with only a single component GP model in mind, ĝ . Forming the composite EFF involves simply selecting the appropriate mean and standard deviation to use from among the component GP model predictions, m i g and s i g . This is done using the same min/max logic as was used to form the composite response function in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the selection of the mean value used in the composite EFF m n g depends on the type of system and the definition of failure for the components.</p><p>The value used for the composite standard deviation, s n g , is then the standard deviation from the corresponding model i that maximized/minimized the function in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The composite EFF is now written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">EFðxÞ ¼ ðm Ã g ÀzÞ 2F zÀm Ã g s Ã g ! ÀF z À Àm Ã g s Ã g ! ÀF z þ Àm Ã g s Ã g ! " # Às Ã g 2f zÀm Ã g s Ã g ! Àf z À Àm Ã g s Ã g ! Àf z þ Àm Ã g s Ã g ! " # þe F z þ Àm Ã g s Ã g ! ÀF z À Àm Ã g s Ã g ! " #<label>ð19Þ</label></formula><p>Using this max/min relationship to select the values for m n g and s n g will create discontinuities in the EFF throughout the search space, but because the maximizing point of this function is sought using gradient-free global optimizer, such as DIRECT <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, the method is easily implemented.</p><p>The point x that maximizes this function is the point at which there is the greatest expectation that it lies on the composite limit state. Of course, there may not be a large expectation that it lies on more than one component limit state. Once this point has been found, the EFF value for each of the components is calculated at this point. Only the components with a non-converged EFF value are evaluated and added to that component's GP model training data. By restricting the evaluation of the ''true'' response functions to only those components that have a large expectation of contributing to the composite limit state, the wasted evaluations that were found in the first two methods are eliminated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">System-level EGRA algorithm</head><p>The following process makes up the EGRA algorithm for system-level problems, utilizing the composite EFF described in the previous section:</p><p>1. Generate a small number of samples from the true response functions. (a) Only ðn i þ1Þðn i þ 2Þ=2 samples are used (where n i is the number of random variables in response function i). This initial selection is arbitrary, but the number of samples required to define a quadratic polynomial is used as a convenient rule of thumb. (b) The samples uniformly span the random variable space over the bounds x i ¼ F À1 i ½Fð 7 5Þ, though the bounds of this search space can be adjusted if needed. (c) Latin hypercube sampling is used to generate the samples. 2. Construct an initial Gaussian process model for each response from these samples. 3. Find the point with maximum composite expected feasibility. (a) For only the response function(s) with a component EFF value greater than the convergence tolerance, evaluate the true response function at this point. 5. Add the new samples to the previous sets and build new GP models. Go to step 3. 6. The resulting GP models are now used to calculate the probability of failure using any sampling method.</p><p>Convergence of this method is measured based on the composite EFF value. When this value is less than the convergence tolerance, then the entire composite limit state has been located even though there may be substantial uncertainty remaining for portions of the various component limit states.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Computational experiments</head><p>The third method detailed in the previous section for using EGRA to solve system-level reliability analysis problems is clearly more promising than the others, so only this method is applied to the collection of test problems explored in this section. EGRA is compared to first-order analytical methods and varying levels of Latin hypercube sampling to demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy.</p><p>The example problems explored here were chosen to emulate the type of complex response functions for which EGRA was created. In these examples, the response functions are defined by analytical equations rather than computationally intensive models, but this does not limit the applicability of the method to such functions. This type of problem was chosen so that the accuracy of the method could be compared directly to results of exhaustive random sampling, which would not be possible for computationally intensive problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Multimodal system</head><p>This problem is an adaptation of the component multimodal example presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Two additional nonlinear response functions have been added to form a system problem. The component response functions are described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">g 1 ðxÞ ¼ ðx 2 1 þ 4Þðx 2 À1Þ 20 Àsin 5x 1 2 À2<label>ð20Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">g 2 ðxÞ ¼ ðx 1 þ2Þ 4 Àx 2 þ 4<label>ð21Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">g 3 ðxÞ ¼ ðx 1 À4Þ 3 Àx 2 þ 2<label>ð22Þ</label></formula><p>The distribution of x 1 is Normalðm ¼ 2,s ¼ 1Þ and x 2 is Normalðm ¼ 5,s ¼ 1Þ; the variables are uncorrelated.

This parallel system problem can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">p f ¼ P½g 1 ðxÞ o 0 \ g 2 ðxÞ o 0 \ g 3 ðxÞ o 0 ð<label>23Þ</label></formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows a plot in x-space of the three limit state contours throughout the 75 standard deviation search space. The shaded area represents the system failure region. It is clear from this plot that the composite limit state is made up of only portions of the g 1 and g 2 component limit states; the g 3 limit state does not bound the system failure region.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows an example of the resulting GP models when EGRA is applied to this problem. The solid lines are the approximations to the limit state contours from the GP models; the dashed lines are the true limit states shown in the previous plot. Consider, first, the limit state g 2 ¼ 0, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(b). This entire limit state is well captured by the GP model because a significant portion of it bounds the system failure region. The limit state g 1 ¼0 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(a)), however, is only accurately modeled near the system failure region. Far from this region, it is highly inaccurate. The limit state g 3 ¼0 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4(c)</ref>) is not accurately modeled anywhere because no portion of this limit state bounds the system failure region. This demonstrates EGRA's ability to not only seek accuracy of the model near the component limit state, but also to further focus that accuracy near only the portion of that limit state where accuracy is needed.</p><p>These individual plots are combined in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. There are six points at which all three response functions were evaluated. These are the initial points used to begin the EGRA process. Note that after these initial points, g 3 is never again evaluated. Because EGRA is searching only for the composite limit state, and the g 3 component limit state is far from the system failure region, EGRA needs no additional accuracy for this function and thus never requests another evaluation of it. There are several additional data points evaluated for g 1 and g 2 , but it is clear that these are focused near the composite limit state.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> gives a summary of the results for this test case. To establish an accurate estimate of the true solution, 20 independent simulations were performed using one million Latin hypercube samples per simulation. The average probability from these simulations is assumed to be the ''true'' solution. Because the sample points used to train the initial GP models are randomly selected, EGRA is stochastic, so it was also run 20 times and the average probabilities are reported. To measure the accuracy of the method, two errors are reported for the EGRA results: the error in the average probability, and the average of the absolute errors from 20 independent simulations. For comparison, the same errors are given for 20 runs of LHS studies comprised of 10,000 and 100,000 samples. Note that for the FORM solution, because the multinormal integral is evaluated using Monte Carlo sampling, a level of sampling variance is introduced. However, because this sampling is performed with ten million samples, the error it introduces is negligible in comparison to any error that may be introduced by approximating the limit states with linear functions. For this reason, the FORM solution is treated as deterministic and only a single error value is reported.</p><p>EGRA is able to provide an estimate of the system reliability that is as accurate as using three million LHS samples at an average cost of about 33 function evaluations-approximately 0.0011% of the cost. EGRA is also more efficient than FORM, requiring only approximately half as many function evaluations, and is clearly more accurate.</p></div>

As noted in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> (and confirmed by this study), the probability of failure for the L, D u , VC u , VC m , and VC l components is 0.0, so they clearly do not cause failure of the system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presented the application of the efficient global reliability analysis method to system-level reliability analysis. Three formulations for applying EGRA to this class of problems were explored, but one was identified as the best option. This formulation uses independent Gaussian process models for each of the component response functions, and selects the training data for these models based on a search for the composite limit state. At each new training point selected by EGRA, only the response functions for which this point is expected to improve the approximation of its component limit state are evaluated, i.e., all component response functions are not necessarily evaluated at all points.</p><p>By focusing the GP training data (points at which the true response functions are evaluated) near only the portions of the component limit states that bound the system failure region, locally accurate models can be built with very few samples. This makes EGRA a highly efficient method for performing systemlevel reliability analysis. The efficiency and accuracy of this method were demonstrated through its application to a collection of example problems. Each of the computational experiments performed involved only normally distributed random variables, but because EGRA models the response function in x-space, any type of distribution could be used with identical performance. Both parallel and series systems were explored, and EGRA proved equally efficient and accurate for both formulations. Future work needs to investigate the applicability of EGRA to general system formulations that contain combinations of series and parallel systems, and systems defined by fault/event trees.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/ress Reliability Engineering and System Safety 0951-8320/$ -see front matter &amp; 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
