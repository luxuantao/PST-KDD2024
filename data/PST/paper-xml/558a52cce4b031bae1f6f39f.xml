<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since the 1960's, many research activities have been developed to deal with the problem of state estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems. The main motivation for doing so is that most physical processes are described by nonlinear mathematical models. Thus, several nonlinear state estimation methods have been performed to increase the accuracy and performances of the control system design.</p><p>Generally, we distinguish two approaches for nonlinear observers' design. The first one is based on some nonlinear state transformation using the Lie algebra. This approach brings the original system into a canonical form from which the design of state observers is performed using linear techniques in the new coordinates. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a standard nonlinear system to be state equivalent to the nonlinear canonical form, for both continuous and discrete-time cases, have been established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref>. We notice that only a few classes of forced nonlinear systems are considered by this nonlinear transformation.</p><p>The second approach is without transformation and is based on the linearized model. In spite of the local convergence of this method, it is widely used in practice and generally gives good results under less restrictive conditions than the first approach <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[16]</ref>. One of the most popular estimation techniques largely investigated for state estimation of nonlinear systems is the extended Kalman filter (EKF).</p><p>The EKF consists of using the classical Kalman filter equations to the first-order approximation of the nonlinear model about the last estimate. The literature is vast about this subject, and we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[16]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref> and the references therein. However, few works have been performed to analyze the stability and convergence of the filter. The main difficulty arises from the fact that the EKF equations are only approximate ones. So, the corresponding propagation equations are available only if the estimate belongs to a neighborhood of the actual state.</p><p>An interesting study of asymptotic behavior of the EKF, used for the joint parameter and state estimation of linear time-invariant systems, was developed by Ljung in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[11]</ref>. For this particular case, some modifications, such as coupling between parameters vector and the Kalman gain, were introduced to enhance convergence of the EKF. More recently, in a synthesis work on nonlinear discretetime systems, sufficient conditions of the EKF for noisy systems used as a local asymptotic observer for the deterministic case have been established by Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[15]</ref>. They have also shown that conditions needed to ensure the uniform boundedness of certain Riccati equations are related to the observability properties of the considered nonlinear system.</p><p>Recently, Cicarrella et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[18]</ref> have developed a robust observer, which uses n output values and the inverse of the observability matrix at each step, and the local convergence analysis for a multi-input/single-output (MISO) nonlinear discrete-time system was studied.</p><p>Motivated by the identification problem of time-invariant nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, we address here the problem of stability and the convergence of the EKF when used as a deterministic observer for multi-input/multi-output nonlinear discrete-time systems written in their general form. Based on a new formulation for the exact linearization technique, we introduce instrumental time-varying matrices for the stability and convergence analysis. It is pointed out that, under mild conditions, asymptotic behavior of the EKF may be improved significantly even for bad first-order approximation. To show accuracy and performances of this technique, we use the modified EKF at first as a parameter estimator for the Hammerstein model and secondly as a simultaneous state and parameter estimator of a nonlinear model.</p></div>

However, for nonlinear noisy systems, optimality has not been proved, but in general we continue to consider Q k and R k as covariance matrices.</p><p>Hereafter, we will show that the design of R k plays an important role in improving the convergence of the EKF when used as an observer of (1a), (1b).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section we give a simple approach for setting up the convergence analysis of the considered nonlinear systems. It is emphasized that under the local reconstructibility condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref>, the asymptotic convergence of the EKF is ensured when the arbitrary matrix R k is adequately chosen.</p><p>Let us note by xk+1 and xk+1=k the state estimation and state prediction error vectors respectively defined by xk+1 = x k+1 0 xk+1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(10)</ref> xk+1=k = x k+1 0 xk+1=k <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(11)</ref> and the candidate Lyapunov function V k+1 as V k+1 = xT k+1 P 01 k+1 xk+1 :</p><p>Our aim here is to determine conditions for which fV k g k=1111 is a decreasing sequence and to show the EKF limitations when the first-order approximation is used. One classical approach consists of using the convergence analysis performed in the linear case when e k+1 and xk+1=k are approximated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">e k+1 H k+1 xk+1=k<label>(13)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">xk+1=k F k xk :<label>(14)</label></formula><p>However, this approximation is available only if xk+1=k and xk belong to a neighborhood of x k+1 and x k , respectively, otherwise the EKF diverges.</p><p>For a rigorous convergence study we have to show that fV k g k=1111 decreases without any approximation. We notice that there always exist residues, due to the first-order linearization technique, of each output error prediction component e ik+1 (i = 1; 111 ; p) of e k+1 and each state error prediction component xjk+1=k (j = 1; 11 1;n) of xk+1=k ; for all k: To take these residues into account, in order to obtain an exact equality, we introduce here unknown diagonal matrices k+1 and k so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">H ik+1 xk+1=k = ik+1`eik+1<label>(15)</label></formula><p>xjk+1=k = jk F jk xk :</p><p>H ik+1 and F jk are the ith and jth rows of H k+1 and F k , respectively.</p><p>The exact equality represented here by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">16</ref>) is the key point of our approach since the convergence study will be performed without any approximation while e ik+1 and xjk+1=k are written in a first-order representation.

Unfortunately, the convergence of the EKF is not ensured even if fV k g k=1111 is a decreasing sequence. So, some additional conditions in relation to the reconstructibility are needed. For nonlinear systems, the local reconstructibility may be defined in the same way as in the linear case <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref>. Let us recall this property, which will be partly investigated in our developments.

Thus, we obtain the following lemma.  Now, we propose a simple method to prove local convergence of the EKF applied to deterministic nonlinear systems.</p><p>Theorem: Suppose that (33), (44), and (50) hold, then the EKF (2)-( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), when used as an observer for the nonlinear discrete-time system (1a)-(1b), ensures that lim k!1 (x k 0 xk ) = 0:</p><p>Proof: Under (33) and (44), it has been shown (according to Lemmas 1 and 2) that fV k g k=1111 is a decreasing sequence which converges to a positive scalar V , i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">lim k!1 V k = V:</formula><p>On the other hand, we have  As ik+1 and jk are unknown factors, R k+1 have to be chosen so that the interval ]1 0 p 1 0 1 k+1 ; 1 + p 1 0 1 k+1 [ is large enough to fulfil ( <ref type="formula">33</ref>). An a priori choice of R k+1 is to set it much higher than H k+1 P k+1=k H T k+1 : Notice that within the maximum limits we have ]1 0 1 0 1 k+1 ; 1 + 1 0 1 k+1 [!]0; 2[: However, setting high values of R k+1 leads to a very slow convergence rate (the gain matrix K k+1 goes to zero).

Its main drawback is the requirement of a long simulation run to obtain accurate performance estimators. Variances of performance measures converge typically at rate O(1=t) in time t. and these rates are usually unsatisfactory when the number of candidate designs is important.</p><p>Ordinal optimization approaches first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[10]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[11]</ref> for an overview) reduce the computation burden by "combining some mind-set changes" concerning the problem of optimization of discrete-event systems. The primary concern of the ordinal optimization is the rankings of candidate solutions instead of their criterion values. Simulations conducted by various authors for a wide range of problems have shown that the rankings stabilize before the convergence of performance estimates. To achieve further reduction of simulation time, ordinal optimization approaches typically relax the goal of optimization to the isolation of a set of good candidate solutions. Experiments indicate that it is possible to determine whether a solution is good or bad very early in the simulation with high probability. Recent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[12]</ref> has demonstrated that impressive improvement in computation efficiency can be achieved using ordinal optimization approaches.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to provide theoretical evidence of the efficiency of ordinal optimization approaches. It is an extension of a recent work <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> which considers the convergence of the probability that the best observed design is indeed a "good" design. We consider the following fundamental indicator: the probability that at least k of the observed top-s designs are the actual top-g designs (i.e., satisfactory designs). It is called alignment probability and is meaningful in the perspective of simulation budget allocation. Our contributions include:</p><p>1) monotonicity properties of the alignment probability with respect to s; g; and k are established. They show that goal relaxation improves the computation efficiency; 2) the association, a kind of positive correlation, of simulated systems improves the convergence rate of the probability that the observed best design is the actual best one; 3) informal arguments of the exponential convergence rate of the alignment probability in the general case; </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>where s i is the associated eigenvector.Pre-and post-multiplying the left side of (31) by s T i and s i , using relations (35) and (36) in (37) yields to</figDesc></figure>
