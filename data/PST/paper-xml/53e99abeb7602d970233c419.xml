<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In many applications of graph visualization and graph theory, it is often useful to draw the edges of a graph with multiple colors or in multiple layers. The general class of thickness problems deals with determining the minimum number of these colors needed under various conditions. Traditionally, the (graph) thickness of a graph G is defined to be the minimal number of planar subgraphs whose union forms G. From an edge coloring perspective, we can also define the thickness to be the smallest number of edge colors needed so that we can draw the graph in the plane with no intersections between two edges having the same color. In this variant, the only constraint on how a graph's edges are drawn is continuity. Essentially, the thickness of a graph is a minimum edge coloring of the graph such that each color represents a planar graph. Initially, the notion of thickness derived from early work on biplanar graphs, graphs with thickness two <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Generalized by Tutte <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the research in graph thickness problems is too rich to summarize here. The interested reader is referred to the survey by Mutzel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>By adding the constraint that all edges must be represented by straight-line segments, we arrive at the geometric thickness problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. If we further constrain the problem such that the vertices must lie in convex position, the edge coloring number is known as the book thickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Although the values of graph, geometric, and book thickness are related, there are graphs that have different values for each <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p><p>We can also constrain the graph thickness in other ways. For example, the arboricity of a graph G is de-fined to be the smallest number of forests whose union is G <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. In other words, the minimum number of edge colors such that the subgraph induced by each color is a forest of trees. In linear arboricity the resulting colored subgraphs must be collections of paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. In outerthickness, the resulting colored subgraphs must be outerplanar graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Outerplanar graphs are analogous to graphs with book thickness one; however, outerthickness and book thickness are not identical.</p><p>Another way to look at the problem is to divide the edges of the graphs into different layers and draw the layers independently as planar graphs such that the vertex positions are identical in each layer. In this case, the problem is to minimize the number of layers. A common related application of this problem is in VLSI design where wires are placed in various layers to avoid crossings, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Minimizing the number of layers reduces cost and improves performance of the created circuits.</p><p>Another related problem is the area of simultaneous embeddings. In simultaneous embedding problems, the edges are already assigned to various layers, and one must determine a placement of vertices to realize each drawing without crossings, if possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>Our work is motivated by and related to recent results in characterizing the geometric thickness of graphs. In particular, Eppstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> characterizes a class of graphs having arboricity three and thickness three, for which the geometric thickness grows as a function of n, the number of vertices. The proof relies on Ramsey theory and so the lower bound on the geometric thickness is a very slow growing function of n. Eppstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> also characterizes a class of graphs with arboricity two and geometric thickness two having a book thickness that grows as another slow function of n.</p><p>Using results on the simultaneous embedding of two paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Duncan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proved that graphs with linear arboricity two have geometric thickness two. Arboricity-two graphs are not as simple. Geyer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> show two trees which cannot be embedded simultaneously. In the context of geometric thickness, this would imply that one cannot simply take a graph of arboricity two, decompose it into two forests arbitrarily, and then embed the two graphs simultaneously. However, because the union of the two trees described does have geometric thickness two, it is still in fact open as to whether arboricity two implies geometric thickness two.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Malitz characterizes the book thickness of graphs with E edges to be O( √ E). This result immediately implies that thickness-t graphs have geometric thickness O( √ tn). There has also been work on characterizing the geometric thickness of a graph in terms of its degree. In particular, graphs with degree less than two trivially have geometric thickness one, graphs with degree three and four have geometric thickness two <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and there exist graphs with degree δ ≥ 9 having geometric thickness at least c √ δn 1/2-4/δ-for sufficiently large n and constants c and &gt; 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Dujmović and Wood <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> discuss the relationship between geometric thickness and graph treewidth. In particular, they show that graphs with treewidth k have geometric thickness at most k/2 . This is complementary to our work as even planar graphs can have arbitrarily large treewidth. For example, the n × n grid graph has treewidth n. However, the treewidth is known for many types of graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Our Results</head><p>In this paper, we provide further analysis into the relationship between geometric thickness and thickness. In particular, we show that graphs with arboricity two and outerthickness two have a geometric thickness of O(log n). We show these by providing a more generalized solution for graphs that can be decomposed into two subgraphs having some separation property. This allows for further relations between the two thickness measures. For example, we can also show that graphs with thickness two have a geometric thickness of O( √ n), which is also immediately implied by the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Additionally, if the graph can be decomposed into two K h -minor free graphs, then the graph has geometric thickness O(h 3/2 √ n).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Using a Separator Theorem</head><p>A cut set for a graph G = (V, E) is a set of vertices C ⊂ V (G) such that the subgraph of G induced by the removal of the vertices in C consists of at least two connected components G 1 and G 2 . Note, if the cut set produces more than two connected components, we can treat multiple components as one subgraph. Therefore, we assume that the removal of the cut set creates two subgraphs G 1 and G 2 such that there are no edges in E(G) between vertices in G 1 and G 2 . We refer to G C as G -G 1 -G 2 , which consequently is the set of all edges having at least one endpoint in C. For convenience, we also let</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V 1 = V (G 1 ), V 2 = V (G 2 ).</formula><p>For two functions f and g and constant c, let G be a class of graphs having a separator property on f and g that states for any graph G ∈ G with n = |V (G)| &gt; c, there exists a cut set C such that G 1 , G 2 ∈ G and |V i | ≤ f (n) for i = 1, 2 and |C| ≤ g(n). Our primary result uses the following key lemma:</p><p>Lemma 1 Let G be a graph in G with n vertices. There exists an assignment of colors to e ∈ E(G) in the range 1 to F(n), and unique x-coordinate values to v ∈ V (G), in the range 1 to n, such that for any assignment of ycoordinates to v, with all vertex points being in general position, no two edges with the same color assignment intersect, except at common endpoints, when drawn as straight-line segments from their respective endpoints. Here F(n) is defined by the following recurrence relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F(n) = c if n ≤ c F(f (n)) + g(n) otherwise.</formula><p>Proof. In our arguments, we shall also color each vertex as c(v) so that an edge e = (u, v) ∈ E(G) has color either c(u) or c(v).</p><p>We prove this lemma inductively. If n ≤ c, we simply (arbitrarily) assign the vertices v ∈ V (G) with increasing x-coordinates from 1 to n and the colors c(v) as 1 to n. We then assign each edge (u, v) ∈ G with u, v ∈ V (G) as color c(u), the choice of u or v is arbitrary. This process requires the assignment of at most c colors. Since edges with similar colors also share a common endpoint, the only color crossings possible are between adjacent edges but if the points are in general position, the only intersection is at the endpoints. Therefore, our lemma holds for the base case.</p><p>Assume now that the lemma holds for all graphs with size less than n. Let G have size n. Since G belongs to the class G with the separator property, we can partition</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V (G) into the three sets V 1 , V 2 , C. Let n 1 = |V 1 |, n 2 = |V 2 |, n c = |C|.</formula><p>We then compute color and x-coordinate assignments separately for G 1 and G 2 . From our inductive assumption, both G 1 and G 2 can be assigned values independently without any invalid crossings in their respective graphs.</p><p>To combine the two assignments and provide assignments for the remaining vertices and edges, we proceed as follows. Let V 1 have x-coordinate assignments ranging from 1 to n 1 and V 2 have x-coordinate assignments ranging from 1 to n 2 . We assign the x-coordinates of C in (arbitrary) order from n 1 + 1 to n 1 + n c . We shift the x-coordinates of V 2 over by n 1 + n c . Notice that shifting the values of V 2 does not affect the intersection properties of G 2 , as the entire graph is moved. Let c 1 and c 2 be the number of colors assigned to G 1 and G 2 . Let c = max(c 1 , c 2 ). We color the vertices of G C with n c distinct colors ranging from c +1 to c +n c . We then color the edges in E as follows. If e ∈ E(G 1 ∪ G 2 ), we use the color assigned during the construction of G 1 and G 2 . Otherwise, e ∈ E(G C ) and let v ∈ C be an endpoint of e, because the separation property guarantees that there are no edges between V 1 and V 2 . We then color the edge e with the value c(v). If both endpoints are in C, the choice of v is arbitrary.</p><p>This assignment process guarantees that the vertices have x-coordinates in the range of 1 to n. To see that there are no crossing violations, observe that from our inductive assumption there are no crossing violations between edges in G 1 or between edges in G 2 . In addition, because of the placement of the vertices for V 1 and V 2 , there can be no edge crossings between an edge in G 1 and an edge in G 2 . Therefore, any crossing violations must involve at least one edge in G C . Since edges in G C are colored differently than edges in G 1 or G 2 , the other edge must also be in G C . However, two edges in G C with the same color must also have a common endpoint in C and so cannot intersect if the vertices are in general position. Therefore, there can be no crossing violations.</p><p>To complete the proof, recall that n c ≤ g(n) and n 1 , n 2 ≤ f (n). The number of colors used is consequently bounded by c + n c ≤ F(f (n)) + g(n).</p><p>We now use this lemma to prove our main theorem.</p><p>Theorem 2 Assume we have a graph H whose edges can be colored into two layers H 1 and H 2 such that H 1 , H 2 ∈ G.</p><p>Then H has geometric thickness O(F(|H|)) where F is defined as in the preceding lemma.</p><p>Proof. From Lemma 1, we know that there is an assignment of colors and x-coordinates for both H 1 and H 2 separately. For H 2 we simply transpose the x and y coordinates. Therefore, each vertex v ∈ V (H) has xcoordinate defined by H 1 's assignment and y-coordinate defined by H 2 's assignment. From Lemma 1, we know that the choice of y-coordinate does not affect H 1 and symmetrically for H 2 . The only caveat is that the vertices may not be in general position, which could cause overlap. A simple solution is to perturb the positions slightly resulting in no new crossings and eliminating any overlapping edges.</p><p>The colors between the two assignments are kept distinct. That is, we color the edges in H 1 with a different color set from any edges in H 2 , thereby avoiding any new crossing violations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Specific Examples</head><p>In this section, we show specific examples of graphs with varying thickness values. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, we know that every planar graph has a separator property with f (n) = 2n/3 and g(n) = 3 √ n/2. Solving for F(n) yields the following (known) corollary: It is also well known that trees have centroid vertices yielding a separator property with f (n) = 2n/3 and g(n) = 1. Solving for F(n) yields the following corollary:</p><p>Corollary 4 Any graph with arboricity two has geometric thickness O(log n).</p><p>We can easily extend this tree property to outerplanar graphs.</p><p>Corollary 5 Any graph with outerthickness two has geometric thickness O(log n).</p><p>In fact, since k-outerplanar graphs have 2k separators <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we also get the following:</p><p>Corollary 6 Any graph that can be decomposed into two k-outerplanar graphs has geometric thickness O(k log n).</p><p>We can also use more general separator theorems. For example, Alon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> show that any graph with n vertices and no K h -minor has a separator with f (n) = 2n/3 and g(n) = h 3/2 n 1/2 . This yields the following: Corollary 7 For any h &gt; 0, any graph that can be decomposed into two K h -minor-free graphs has geometric thickness O(h 3/2 n 1/2 ). K 4 -minor-free graphs including series-parallel graphs have a separator of size 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Corollary 8 Any graph that can be decomposed into two K 4 -minor-free graphs has geometric thickness O(log n).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Closing Remarks</head><p>We have shown that for certain classes of graphs the geometric thickness can be bounded by a non-trivial function of the number of vertices in n. In particular, we have related arboricity two and outerthickness two to geometric thickness O(log n). Given that some arboricity three, and hence thickness three, graphs have been shown to have ω(1) geometric thickness, albeit using a very slow-growing function, it would be interesting to show a lower bound for thickness two graphs. Also, it remains open to show that the geometric thickness bound for arboricity two graphs is tight.</p><p>We would like to thank David Eppstein for several helpful discussions on this topic leading to the results in this paper and the referees for their helpful comments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Corollary 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Any graph with (graph) thickness two has geometric thickness O( √ n).</figDesc></figure>
