<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we propose to use spatial modulation (SM) and the generalized spatial modulation (GSM) MIMO schemes in indoor line-of-sight (LOS) millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication at 60 GHz. SM/GSM are known but only at low-GHz frequencies where the channels are typically rich scattered and characterized by Rayleigh or Rician distribution. However, 60 GHz indoor channels are typically not rich but rather sparsely scattered and dominated by the LOS component, thus making them different from low-GHz fading channels and our work novel. We first seek to optimize SM in LOS by finding the channel conditions that minimize its symbol error probability (SEP). Then we extend our studies to LOS GSM and derive its channel capacity and SEP. Furthermore, we present numerical studies on the behavior and performance of SM/GSM in LOS. LOS spatial multiplexing (SMX) and beamforming (BF) MIMO schemes are used as benchmarks for comparison. At last, we propose novel TX and RX hardware architectures, both of which use only a single RF chain, for implementation of SM/GSM at mmWave frequencies. Both simplicity and good performance are exhibited by LOS SM/GSM thus making them very attractive techniques for short-range indoor mmWave communications at 60 GHz.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>M ILLIMETER-wave (mmWave) communication, which is largely motivated by the global spectrum shortage at the current 2G, 3G, and 4G frequencies, is an emerging technology that provides us with multi-GHz bandwidth and enables transmission rates of multi-Gbps <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Especially, with up to 7 GHz unlicensed bandwidth available worldwide, the 60 GHz band (57 -64 GHz) has gained significant interest in the industry which is evidenced e.g., by the standardization of Wireless HD, IEEE 802.15.3c, and IEEE 802.11ad <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>A major concern with communications at mmWave frequencies is the much higher free space path loss (FSPL) due to smaller wavelength, e.g., the FSPL at 60 GHz is 35.6 dB higher than at 1 GHz. High gains are usually needed at the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) to compensate for the FSPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. There have been many practical works on using phased arrays and beamforming (BF) to achieve high gains for single-stream transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. However, the mmWave propagation in indoor environments is dominated by line-of-sight (LOS) components and BF achieves only array gain. On the other hand, even in LOS, enormous spatial multiplexing (SMX) gain can be achieved by using SMX-MIMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, thus motivating us to consider multi-stream MIMO also in indoor mmWave communications.</p><p>On one hand, multi-stream MIMO schemes based on conventional SMX are able to achieve higher data rates than single-stream transmission. On the other hand, they need N full TX chains to transmit N data streams, thus introducing significant cost and processing complexity to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, SMX-MIMO, due to the use of multiple TX RF chains, is significantly inefficient in terms of the bits/J energy efficiency. Cost and power consumption of mmWave components are high, therefore it is unlikely to dedicate a separate RF chain and digital-to-analog converter (DAC)/analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for each antenna, but it is more likely to use fewer RF chains than the number of antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, a hybrid BF/SMX architecture, which uses a smaller number of RF chains than the number of antennas, was proposed for LOS mmWave communications. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, a hybrid RF/baseband precoder architecture, which uses N RF t TX RF chains to transmit N data streams via N t TX antennas (where N ≤ N RF t ≤ N t ), was proposed for sparsely scattered mmWave channels. However, in both examples, N (or more) RF chains are still needed for transmission of N data streams.</p><p>We propose to use the simpler and more energy-efficient spatial modulation (SM) and its generalization the generalized spatial modulation (GSM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in indoor mmWave communications. As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, SM/GSM is capable of transmitting two streams -one in the spatial domain and the other in the conventional in-phase and quadrature (IQ) domain -using a single TX RF chain. The benefits of using SM/GSM are comprehensively addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Here we highlight: 1) reduced complexity and cost due to the fact that SM/GSM needs only one TX RF chain; 2) significantly improved energy efficiency at the TX <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; and 3) the single RF plus antenna switching architecture seems to be a very attractive solution for large scale MIMO.</p><p>At mmWave frequencies, the indoor propagation is quasi-optical, sparsely scattered and with large reflection and blockage losses (see Section II-C). Therefore, in this paper, we only consider the dominant LOS components. In a rich-scattering environment at low-GHz frequencies, antennas with separations down to λ/2 can lead to sufficiently small channel correlations and a high rank 1 MIMO channel can easily be established to support simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, in a strong LOS environment, the principle of so-called LOS-MIMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> should be utilized to achieve high capacity. LOS-MIMO relies on appropriate separation of the antennas, which is in general much larger than λ/2, to achieve a high rank channel and thus high capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The optimal antenna separation depends on both the wavelength and the TX-RX distance (see Section III-C). A shorter wavelength and smaller TX-RX distance both lead to a smaller optimal antenna separation, thus making LOS-MIMO more practical for short-range indoor mmWave communications.</p><p>We first study the symbol error probability (SEP) and channel capacity of LOS SM/GSM based on a (full-complexity) maximum likelihood (ML) RX. Then we propose and study practical TX and (reduced-complexity) RX architectures. The SEP of the ML RX is used as a benchmark in the SEP study of the proposed RX. The novelty and major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p><p>• We propose to use SM/GSM for indoor LOS mmWave communication at 60 GHz, which is not yet seen in the mmWave literature. Although SM/GSM are known schemes, they have only been considered and applied at low-GHz frequencies, where the channel characteristics are typically Rayleigh or Rician fading. Due to the randomness and low correlation of rich scattered fading channels, SM/GSM in low-GHz fading channels generally does not need excess antenna separations and down to λ/2 antenna separations were used in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. However, the 60 GHz indoor channel is not rich but rather sparsely scattered and dominated by LOS components and thus is different from typical low-GHz channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. • We try to minimize the SEP of SM in LOS by maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of the RX-side SM symbols Φ min . As a result, we find that the (column) channel orthogonality condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">21</ref>) is a condition that maximizes Φ min and thus optimizes the SEP. Since it requires proper (inter-element) separation of the TX and RX antennas in order to achieve <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, it turns out that optimized SEP of LOS SM requires proper separation of TX and RX antennas. • We derive the channel capacity and SEP for LOS GSM, which is a natural generalization of LOS SM for higher data rates while still using a single TX RF chain and the same number of antennas. The analyses and results based on LOS channels are novel. Our numerical results and further analysis in Section V bring further insight into the behavior and performance of SM/GSM in LOS. In addition, we study the robustness of condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">21</ref>) and the impact of not having perfect orthogonality. 1 The rank of a channel matrix is equal to the number of linearly independent rows or columns of the channel matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. • We propose novel TX and RX hardware architectures, both of which use only a single RF chain, for implementation of SM/GSM at mmWave frequencies. The proposed TX features a parallel shunt switching structure and a flexible power delivering network. The number of power amplifiers (PAs) (at design phase) can be selected according to the link power budget. The proposed RX features hybrid RF/digital processing and separate detection of the spatial and IQ streams. To the best of our knowledge, the only closely related works are <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, a so-called antenna subset modulation (ASM) scheme, which is also based on the antenna switching principle, was introduced to mmWave communication. However, in ASM the purpose of antenna switching was for communication security but not directly used for carrying information bits. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, LOS space shift keying (SSK) was proposed for indoor mmWave communication and the same orthogonality condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> was used. However, since SSK does not transmit an IQ stream, there was no consideration of an IQ constellation and the optimality of the orthogonality condition for LOS SM/GSM was not clear.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the principle of SM/GSM and the system and channel models. In Section III, we optimize LOS SM by finding the channel conditions that minimize its SEP. In Section IV, we derive the channel capacity and SEP generally for LOS GSM. In Section V, we present numerical results for LOS SM/GSM and compare with LOS SMX and BF. Furthermore we perform an analysis of the robustness of the orthogonality condition and the impact of not having perfect orthogonality. In Section VI, we propose novel TX and RX hardware architectures for implementation of SM/GSM at mmWave frequencies. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRINCIPLE AND SYSTEM MODEL A. Principle of SM/GSM</head><p>As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, SM/GSM can transmit two data streams, namely an IQ stream and a spatial stream, using a single TX RF chain. The bits of the IQ stream are modulated using a conventional IQ modulation scheme, e.g., quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase shift keying (PSK), and the bits of the spatial stream are mapped into TX antenna indices, based on which one or more TX antennas are activated. In SM, only a single TX antenna is activated per channel use. However, in GSM, N u TX antennas can be activated per channel use, where N u can be varied for different symbols. For simplicity, we restrict our studies to SM and fixed-N u</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">β t D β r ϕ r z x 1 N t 1 Nr</formula><p>TX array RX array ϕ t = 0 2 2 0 y Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>. LOS MIMO using arbitrarily placed ULAs. The coordinate system is chosen such that the center of the TX ULA locates at the origin and the center of the RX ULA lies on the x-axis. Furthermore, the TX ULA lies in the xz-plane, i.e., ϕt = 0. GSM (a.k.a. GSM-N u ). Apparently, SM is a special case of GSM-N u with N u = 1. SM achieves a rate of log 2 N t in the spatial domain and a total rate of log 2 N t + log 2 M , where M is the IQ constellation size. GSM-N u achieves a spatial rate of log 2</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Antenna Array</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>, we consider an N t × N r LOS MIMO system using two arbitrarily placed uniform linear arrays (ULAs), where N t is the number of TX antennas and N r is the number of RX antennas. The antenna separations in the TX and RX ULAs are respectively s t and s r , and the TX-RX distance is D, which is measured between the center points of the TX and RX ULAs. Geometrically, the ULAs each have two degrees of freedom, namely the azimuth angle ϕ and the tilt angle β (or equivalently the elevation angle θ = π/2-β). Since we are only interested in their relative geometric relations, only three angles are used -the tilt angles β t and β r respectively at the TX and RX and the azimuth angle ϕ r at the RX. Note that we limit β t and β r to [0, π/2] yet are still being able to cover all cases.</p><p>We do not consider the physical implementation and radiation pattern of the antennas, but assume that the antennas have the same gain at the LOS directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. 60 GHz Indoor Channel Model</head><p>As stated in Section I, in this paper we consider only a pure LOS channel. In this section, before we describe the pure LOS channel model, we first elaborate on why we only consider LOS components and in which scenarios the pure LOS channel model fits.</p><p>Indoor propagation at 60 GHz shows the following characteristics:</p><p>1) The propagation at mmWave frequencies exhibits a quasi-optical behavior with most of the signal energy being received along the LOS path and a few reflected paths. Measured results show that geometry-optical raytracing covers the transmission characteristics well and the transmission path loss is well predicted by the Friis transmission equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. 2) High reflection loss. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> by measurements that each reflection at the walls or ceiling typically introduces a reflection loss of 10 dB. It is thus common to consider only up to second order reflections, which have 20 dB reflection loss on average and additional path loss due to increased path lengths as compared to the LOS path. 3) Blockage and penetration losses are generally higher at higher frequencies. The blockage loss of a human body is typically 20 dB and the blockage loss of a 1-cm-thick wooden barrier is about 10 dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The practical indoor operation range at 60 GHz is likely to be limited by penetration loss and therefore mostly confined to a single room <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. According to the above description of the propagation characteristics and further details of the IEEE802.11ad (60 GHz WLAN) indoor channel model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, it is evident that the 60 GHz indoor channel is dominated by LOS components. The non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, depending on the beamwidth and position of the antennas, include only few highly attenuated rays 3 . These facts motivate us to design our scheme only based on LOS components, while ignoring the NLOS components.</p><p>The LOS MIMO channel can be described using an N r ×N t matrix as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H =     h 11 • • • h 1Nt . . . . . . . . . h Nr1 • • • h NrNt     ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where h ji is the LOS component of the channel impulse response from the i-th TX antenna to the j-th RX antenna, and is normalized by the FSPL due to the TX-RX distance D.</p><p>According to the Friis equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, h ji is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h ji = λ 4πd ji exp(-jkd ji ) • 4πD λ ≈ exp(-jkd ji )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where k = 2π/λ is the wave number, d ji is length of the LOS path between the i-th TX antenna and the j-th RX antenna, j is the complex unit. For the approximation in (2) to hold, we have assumed that the TX and RX array lengths L t , L r are much smaller than D, i.e., L t , L r D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ERROR PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION OF LOS SM</head><p>In this section, we seek to find the channel conditions that optimize the error performance of SM in LOS. We first give the SEP expression for LOS SM using an ML detector. Then 3 For example, in the STA-STA (device-to-device) sub-scenario [24, Section 3.3], if the azimuth beam angles of the TX and RX antennas do not exceed ±62 • , all the first order clusters from walls will be eliminated, because none of them have TX and RX azimuth angles simultaneously falling in this azimuth beam range <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure 9</ref>]. If the elevation beam angles of the TX and RX antennas are less than 56.6 • , the (only) first order cluster reflected by ceiling is eliminated as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure 10]</ref>. Meanwhile, most of the second order clusters [24, <ref type="bibr">Figure 11]</ref>, which are weaker than the first order clusters due to one more reflection and longer path lengths, are eliminated as well.</p><p>we formulate the optimization problem in a tractable manner, i.e., in terms of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of the RX symbols. Upon solving the optimization problem, we will find the channel conditions that can optimize the error performance of SM in LOS. At the end, we compare the optimal channel conditions found for LOS SM with the optimal conditions for LOS SMX.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Spatial Modulation and ML Detection</head><p>The SM modulation alphabet is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S =      q m • [ • • • , 0, i-th 1 , 0, • • • ] T ei i = 1, • • • , N t m = 1, • • • , M      ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where q m is an IQ symbol, and M is the IQ constellation size. The definition of S reflects the fact that in SM the information is modulated not only in the traditional IQ domain but also in the spatial domain (by selecting one out of N t TX antennas for activation). The received signal vector y ∈ C Nr×1 is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = Hs i,m + n = q m h i + n<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where s i,m ∈ S is the transmitted SM symbol, h i is the i-th column of H, n ∈ C Nr×1 is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector with covariance matrix N 0 I Nr (where I Nr is an N r × N r identity matrix). Due to single antenna activation at the TX, the received signal vector at the RX contains only a single column of the channel matrix multiplied by an IQ symbol. This is different from SMX-MIMO, in which the received signal typically contains a combination of all columns of the channel matrix. The optimal (ML) detection of the SM symbols requires joint detection of i and m <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, i.e., (î, m) = arg max i,m p y y s i,m , H</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= arg min i,m y -q m h i ,<label>(5a)</label></formula><p>where p y (•) is the probability density function (PDF) of y, and • evaluates the Euclidean distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. SEP of LOS SM and Optimization</head><p>A tight upper bound for the SEP of LOS SM, which is based on the union bound method and derived for the ML detector (5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P s ≤ 1 M N t i,m i ,m (i ,m ) =(i,m) Pr[(i, m) → (i , m )|(i, m)],<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Pr[(i, m) → (i , m )|(i, m)</formula><p>] is a pairwise error probability that denotes the probability of (i , m ) being detected</p><p>given that (i, m) was sent.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Pr[(i, m) → (i , m )|(i, m)] can be calculated as Pr[(i, m) → (i , m )|(i, m)] = Pr y -q m h i &lt; y -q m h i = Pr q m h i -q m h i + n 2 &lt; n 2 = Pr (q m h i -q m h i + n) H (q m h i -q m h i + n) &lt; n H n = Pr q m h i -q m h i 2 &lt; 2 ¶ (q m h i -q m h i ) H n © nΣ (7) = Q Φ 2N 0 ,</formula><p>where n Σ , which is a simplified notation for n Σ (i, m, i , m ), is Gaussian distributed</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">n Σ ∼ N Ä 0, 2 q m h i -q m h i 2 N 0 ä ,</formula><p>and Φ, which is a simplified notation for Φ(i, m, i , m ), is the squared Euclidean distance between two RX-side SM symbols</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Φ = q m h i -q m h i 2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Q(•) is the Gaussian Q-function.</formula><p>Although sharing the same union bound method, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>) is different from the average error probability given in <ref type="bibr">[34, (9)</ref>] for SM in fading channels.</p><p>In fading channels, the error probability must be averaged over the fading channel statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. However, in our case, the channel is deterministic and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>) including its optimization below are unique to (pure) LOS channels. Furthermore, for conventional SM in a rich scattered environment, the channel is random and only the IQ constellation {q m } can be taken as a parameter for optimization but not the channel. In this paper, since the channel is deterministic and determined by the geometric relations between the antennas, we can optimize the performance of LOS SM by optimizing the channel via choosing suitable antenna separations. This is a novelty of our work, and in Section III-D we will further address this. Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> indicates that the SEP depends on all possible pairs of the SM symbol Euclidean distances. To minimize the error probability, in general we wish to maximize all the SM symbol Euclidean distances simultaneously. However, we maximize the minimum symbol Euclidean distance since at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) P s is limited by the smallest symbol Euclidean distance <ref type="bibr">[35, ch. 4</ref>].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparison with LOS SMX-MIMO</head><p>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> is the same as the column orthogonality condition used in LOS SMX-MIMO for the case of N r ≥ N t <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, it is important to notice that the underlying problems are different. We address the main differences as follows:</p><p>1) The optimization problems are different. In the LOS SMX-MIMO literature, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the goal was to find the optimal antenna separations that maximize the SMX channel capacity, and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">21</ref>) was found as a solution for the case of N r ≥ N t . The essence is that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">21</ref>) guarantees H having N t equal eigenvalues, thus the SMX capacity is maximized <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, in our case, due to the unavailability of a closed-form expression for the SM channel capacity (see Section IV-B), we instead seek to optimize the SEP of SM. The essence here is that <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> minimizes the SEP of SM by maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of the RX-side SM symbols.</p><p>2) The requirements on the array dimensions are not exactly the same. In our case, we need N r ≥ N t in order to achieve the column orthogonality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. However, in LOS SMX-MIMO, there are two cases: if N r ≥ N t , the column orthogonal condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">21</ref>) is optimal; if N t ≥ N r , the optimal solution is a row orthogonal condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>As a result, in any case, min(N t , N r ) number of data streams can be transmitted. The min. optimal ASP for capacity</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">2 × 4, SMX-2 4 × 4, GSM-1 4 × 4, GSM-2</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The minimum optimal ASP needed to maximize the channel capacity of different LOS systems. The optimal ASPs are found by numerical optimization of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> for SM/GSM and the first step of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> for SMX. For all systems we assume parallel and aligned ULAs (i.e., ζ = 1), f = 60 GHz, st = sr and D = 3 m. In the legend, the MIMO size is indicated in the format Nt × Nr, and SMX-2 denotes SMX with two parallel IQ streams. The SNR is defined as the ratio of the TX power to the RX noise power.</p><p>3) The meaning of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">21</ref>) is different for the two kinds of systems. To maximize Φ min (thus to minimize SEP), it is confirmed by numerical results (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> for the cases with 4-QAM and 8-QAM) that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">21</ref>) is in general a necessary and sufficient condition for LOS SM/GSM using QAM and M (M ≤ 8)-PSK constellations; however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, though sufficient, is not a necessary condition to maximize Φ min for LOS SMX. If we seek to optimize the capacity, the simulation results in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> indicate that <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, which corresponds to η = 1, is necessary to optimize the capacity of LOS SMX. This result was already proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and therefore is expected. However, to maximize the capacity of LOS SM/GSM, (21) tends to be needed only at moderate SNR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CAPACITY AND SEP OF LOS GSM</head><p>As introduced in Section II-A, GSM is a generalization of SM which can achieve higher data rates in the spatial domain by activating more than one TX antenna per channel use. In this section, we consider fixed-N u GSM (a.k.a GSM-N u ) and derive its capacity and SEP based on the framework of LOS SM. The meaningfulness of LOS GSM is enhanced by the fact that (21) also maximizes Φ min for LOS GSM (see also item 3 in Section III-D). In the capacity derivation, we assume no channel state information at TX (CSIT) but perfect channel state information at RX (CSIR). In the SEP derivation, as already implicitly done in the previous section, we assume that H is known at the RX.</p></div>

The optimal signaling of i and s, and the (total) channel capacity C can be found by maximizing I(i, s; y) with respect to p(i) (the probability mass function (PMF) of i) and p(s) (the PDF of s). However, because the channel input contains both discrete and continuous signals, finding a solution for the optimal signaling of i and s is not easily possible. Below we use a simple signaling schemezero-mean complex Gaussian (ZMCG) signaling in the IQ domain and uniform signaling in the spatial domain -that was first used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. ZMCG signaling is known to be optimal in the IQ domain, and equal use of the antenna groups is also reasonable when CSIT is not available due to two reasons: 1) without CSIT we have no information about which antenna group should be more often used; 2) uniform distribution of i maximizes the information modulated on the spatial dimension.</p><p>On the other hand, the signaling scheme is strictly not optimal and we will address the sub-optimality issue at the end of this subsection.</p><p>Theorem 1.

To evaluate it, we can resort to numerical methods e.g., Monte Carlo averaging.</p><p>The suboptimality of the above two step optimization of I(i, s; y) lies in the fact that although Gaussian signaling of s maximizes I(s; y|i) and uniform signaling of i maximizes H(i), it is not immediately clear if the sum of I(s; y|i) and I(i; y) is maximized. Due to randomness, a Gaussian s is intuitively not an optimal signaling to maximize I(i; y). As confirmed in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>(a), compared to the above C 2 which results from a Gaussian s, a constant s (over i) leads to a larger spatial mutual information which we denote as C 2 . The derivation of C 2 is similar to that of C 2 except for a constant s and therefore omitted here. Note that due to a constant GSM simplifies into generalized space shift keying (GSSK) which transmits information only in the spatial domain. Therefore, C 1 + C 2 is an upper bound that results from independent maximization of the two terms in I(s; y|i) + I(i; y). We will show in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(a)</ref> that the upper bound is actually achieved by uniform i and ZMCG s at high SNR. At low SNR, the gap between C 1 + C 2 and C 1 + C 2 , however, is not significant.</p></div>

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND FURTHER ANALYSIS</head><p>The purpose of this section is twofold: 1) to develop a quantitative understanding of the performance achieved by LOS SM/GSM, including a look into the robustness of the scheme and the impact of not having perfect channel orthogonality, and 2) to compare the performance of SM/GSM with SMX and BF in (pure) LOS. A. LOS MIMO Channel 1) Array Dimensions: To see the physical dimensions needed to achieve condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">21</ref>) at 60 GHz, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> we plot the array length L and antenna separation s versus the number of receive antennas N r for various indoor-relevant TX-RX distances (D = 1 -10 m) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. We see that for typical indoor distances of a few meters and within an array length of 20 -50 cm, which lies within the dimensions of laptops, desktop PC monitors or HD TV's, setting up a perfectly orthogonal LOS MIMO channel with 10 to 20 (TX) antennas is possible.</p><p>2) Robustness: The optimal ASP to achieve channel orthogonality was found based on a deterministic analysis for given λ, D, and ζ. Perfect orthogonality can be achieved only at a single frequency for given D and ζ. Therefore, in this part, we investigate the robustness of the channel orthogonality against 1) a change of these parameters, and 2) errors in CSIR which may be caused by a sudden change of the relative geometric relations between the TX and RX arrays (because of user movement or vibration of the terminal).</p><p>At 60 GHz, a communication bandwidth of e.g., 2.16 GHz as used in IEEE802.11ad and Wireless HD <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, should be easily covered, since, if centered at 60 GHz, 2.16 GHz translates into a very small span of η = 0.98 -1.01. Regarding the tilt factor since LOS MIMO relies on the broadside of the TX and RX arrays to face each other, ζ should not be too large. As an extreme example, if both arrays lie on the x-axis (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>), we have ζ = ∞ and the system cannot operate in an LOS mode. Below we assume parallel and aligned arrays, i.e., ζ = 1 and investigate the impact of varying D.</p><p>We consider a 4 × 4 MIMO system with parallel and aligned ULAs, i.e., ζ = 1 and s t = s r = 5 cm, where the s t s r is chosen to be optimal, i.e., η = 1 for D = 2 m at 60 GHz. The normalized channel Euclidean distance</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">Φ h (i, i ) = 1 2N r h i -h i 2 (<label>45</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_63">)</formula><p>for various η are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> by varying D from 0.2 m to 20 m (where D = 0.2 m and 20 m respectively correspond to η = 0.1 and 10). We see that when η becomes large (η 1)  due to increased D, the channel Euclidean distances decrease and tend to vanish. When η becomes small (η 1) due to decreased D, there are two kinds of variations of Φ h over η: 1) the full scale variations within the range 0 -2, and 2) the smaller variations within the range 0.7 -1.3. Comparing this with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> in Section V-D, we find that the capacity in the high SNR regime is only sensitive to large variations of Φ h , but not to the small variations. In Section V-D, we will provide a further in-dept analysis of the impact of the variations of Φ h on the GSM capacity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">0.1 1 10 0 0.5 0.7 1 1.3 1.5 2 η Φh(i, i ) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 4)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_65">onto {h i } | h1, h 1 | 2 | h1, h 2 | 2 | h1, h 3 | 2 | h1, h 4 | 2</formula><p>To look into the impact of errors in CSIR due to a sudden change of the geometric relations between TX and RX arrays, we use the same 4 × 4 system as parameterized above, and obtain the perfect CSIR, i.e., {h i } at D = 2 m.

The same number of TX and RX antennas are used in the comparison between GSM-MIMO and BF-MIMO since 1536-1276 (c) 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. both schemes use a single TX chain. For SMX-MIMO, the number of RX antennas is the same as for the other schemes we consider, but we assume each TX antenna is equipped with a dedicated TX chain, i.e., in total N t TX chains and the number of TX antennas is varied. The reason why different numbers of TX antennas are used in SMX-MIMO originates from the fact that the cost and power consumption are related to the number of RF chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In GSM-MIMO we exploit larger number of antennas in a more energy-efficient manner by using a single TX chain.</p><p>The capacity of LOS GSM-N u under the orthogonal channel condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> for different N u 's, and the capacities of LOS BF and LOS SMX <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are plotted for comparison. The array setup according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> is used for both GSM-N u and SMX, and the curves for GSM-N u and SMX are generated respectively according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> and the second (non-inline) equation on page 7 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_66">C SMX = log 2 I Nr + P t N t N 0 HH H = N t log 2 Å 1 + N r P t N t N 0 ã ,<label>(46)</label></formula><p>where P t is the total transmit power.

With more TX antennas activated per channel use, i.e., N u &gt; 1, GSM-N u achieves higher capacity at moderate and high SNR. At low SNR, larger N u leads to lower capacity, but the capacity differences between GSM-N u with different N u 's are marginal. Since the upper limit of 2 in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_50">35</ref> Comparison of GSM-N u and SMX: As expected, SMX shows a huge capacity gain over GSM-N u and BF. However, SMX needs N t full TX chains to transmit N t data streams. A major advantage of GSM lies in its simplicity due to the single-RF architecture. Actually as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(b)</ref>, for large N t and particularly when N u = N t /2 , a significant portion of the capacity gap between SMX and BF is filled up by GSM-N u .</p><p>Comparison of GSM and BF: At high SNR, BF achieves the asymptotic capacity log 2 (N t N r E s /N 0 ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nt</head><p>Nu . Thus BF achieves the same capacity as GSM-1. Depending on N u , the gap between the capacities of BF and GSM-N u at high SNR can be large, despite the fact that GSM also only uses a single TX chain. The strength of BF is at low SNR, where it achieves a higher capacity than both GSM-N u and SMX.</p><p>We remark that:</p><p>• At low SNR, BF gain is more important than SMX gain, i.e., BF is more suitable in the power-limited regime. • GSM-N u under the orthogonal channel condition does not achieve any TX array gain in the IQ domain, but it attains spatial domain capacity. The spatial domain capacity attained by GSM-1 at sufficient SNR is equal to the amount of capacity increase due the N t -fold TX array gain in BF. • It is thus shown that by separating the antennas appropriately and using GSM or SMX, much higher capacities than that of BF can be achieved in LOS. • With GSM-N u , we only need one TX RF chain, while SMX needs the same number of full TX chains (baseband and RF) as the number of data streams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Symbol Error Probability (SEP)</head><p>In this subsection, we study the SEP of GSM-MIMO in comparison with SMX-MIMO and BF-MIMO in LOS. Similarly as in Section V-B, the same number of TX and RX antennas are used in the comparison between GSM-MIMO and BF-MIMO. For SMX-MIMO, the number of RX antennas is the same as for the other schemes we consider, but we assume each TX antenna is equipped with a dedicated TX chain and the number of TX antennas is varied. Different from Section V-B is that here the purpose is to compare the error probabilities for the same data rate. Therefore the parameters N t , N u and M are chosen, on top of the aforementioned assumptions, in a way that the same data rate is achieved with different schemes.</p><p>The SEP for GSM-N u versus per-bit-SNR E b /N 0 is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> for data rates of 6 bpcu, 8 bpcu and 16 bpcu respectively in three subfigures <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref> . The curves for GSM-N u , BF and SMX are generated respectively according to ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">41</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">57</ref>) and (59), and these SEP expressions are validated by simulated results that are indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(a) by magenta dots. Furthermore, the simulated results show that the upper bound given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">41</ref>) becomes tight at moderate and high SNR.</p><p>It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> that the SEP of GSM-N u depends on the IQ symbol distances {d mm } and magnitudes {r m }, and the distance between the spatial symbols {d ii }. Optimized error performance is expected if we make a balanced use of the parameters N t , N u and M . We notice in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> that to achieve the given rates, GSM-N u with 4-QAM outperforms both GSM-N u with 1-QAM 6 and GSM-N u with M (M &gt; 4)-QAM. Therefore, to achieve a certain data rate, keeping M = 4 and moving to larger N u is more efficient than keeping a small N u and moving to a larger M than 4.</p><p>Comparison of GSM-N u and SMX: As expected, for a fixed data rate SMX with larger number of TX antennas and lower order QAM in general performs better than a configuration with smaller number of streams but with higher order QAM. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(b), 8 × 8 MIMO using GSM-4 with performs similar as 4 × 8 MIMO using SMX with 4-QAM, despite the fact that the latter has much higher capacity as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(a)</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(c), 16 × 16 MIMO using GSM-8 with 4-QAM performs only marginally worse than 8 × 16 MIMO using SMX with 4-QAM, despite the fact that the latter has much higher capacity as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(b)</ref>.</p><p>Comparison of GSM-N u and BF: In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(a), BF can achieve relatively good error performance at a data rate of 6 bpcu. However, to achieve higher data rates BF requires higher order QAM, which always gives (much) worse error performance compared to GSM-N u . This again shows that BF is a suitable scheme only in power-limited regime for lower data rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Impact of Non-Orthogonal Channel on GSM Capacity</head><p>In this subsection, we investigate the impact of not having perfect channel orthogonality, i.e. η = 1. In order to take advantage of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, we use exactly the same set of parameters of the 4 × 4 system that was used to generate Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, and similarly we vary D from 0.2 m to 20 m. The capacities of GSM-1 and GSM-2 are simulated according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> at "high SNR" E s /N 0 = 15 dB and plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> with respect to η.</p><p>First we consider GSM-1 and analyze C 1 and C 2 separately. If we ignore any approximation errors due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> He i / √ N u 2 = N r is a constant and C 1 does not depend on η. The first part of C 2 in (30), i.e. H(i), is constant. However, the second part, H(i|y), which measures the average uncertainty of i given y, depends on the Euclidean distance between the spatial symbols. The larger the Euclidean distance between the spatial symbols, the less is the uncertainty of i given y at a certain SNR level, and vice versa. It is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> that when η &lt;1, which means the actual ASP is larger than the optimal value, the Euclidean distance between some channel pairs can become 0, thus making detection of those pairs impossible. For example, because of Φ h (1, 3) = 0 and Φ h (2, 4) = 0 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> at η = 0.5, which implies that there are only two distinguishable spatial symbols, C 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> at η = 0.5 reduces to 1 bpcu. When η increases above 1, which means the actual ASP is smaller than the optimal value, as expected the spatial capacity decreases. However, even at η = 10, i.e, D = 20 m, more than 1 bpcu of the spatial capacity is still attained. Now we consider GSM-2. Unless the channel is perfectly orthogonal, {h k } k∈Ii in (30) can add both constructively and destructively thus causing C 1 to vary. When η gets larger than 1, the vectors {h k } k∈Ii move closer to each other and tend to add constructively. This means that when η &gt; 1, GSM-N u (N u &gt; 1) can exploit some TX array gain and larger η suggests higher C 1 . Apparently the upper limit of C 1 is equal to the capacity of an N u × N r BF-MIMO. When η gets larger than 1, C 2 of GSM-2 faster than in the case of GSM-1. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>, at η = 10, C 2 of GSM-2 ends up with the same value as GSM-1. This means that when the spatial degree of freedom is limited due to insufficient ASP, creating more spatial symbols by switching on a larger number of TX antennas per symbol does not lead to a higher spatial domain capacity.</p><p>On one hand, good capacity is achieved under the orthogonal channel condition at η = 1, and, overall, the total capacity C of GSM-N u is rather robust over η. On the other hand, the maximum total capacity for GSM-2 is reached at η = 4 but not η = 1, thus showing the sub-optimality of the orthogonal channel condition (see also Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>When the normalized channel Euclidean distance Φ h (i, i ) is too small, i.e., close to 0, it becomes difficult or impossible to distinguish the pair of h i and h i , thus implying a reduction of the spatial domain performance; when Φ h (i, i ) is too large,    i.e., close to 2, the pair of h i and h i cancel each other, thus implying a reduction of the IQ domain performance. Therefore, the channel Euclidean distance as a partial channel information may be needed for the TX to adapt for optimized operation by skipping or grouping together some of the TX antennas.</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">[bpcu] GSM-1, C GSM-1, C1 GSM-1, C2 GSM-2, C GSM-2, C1 GSM-2, C2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>Although SM/GSM has been extensively researched at low-GHz frequencies and has shown to be a simple scheme in concept, its practical implementation has not been sufficiently addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and remains an open issue. In this section, we try to address this issue by proposing two novel hardware architectures -one for TX and one for RX -with special considerations for implementation at mmWave frequencies. The proposed TX and RX are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11,</ref> and<ref type="figure">,</ref> in what follows, we introduce their working principles and show some simulation results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. TX</head><p>The implementation of fixed-N u GSM at mmWave frequencies is facing the following main challenges: 1) fast N u -to-N t switching at symbol rate, 2) large routing loss due to the excess antenna separations necessary to achieve optimized SEP in LOS, and 3) tight link power budget due to limited output power of mmWave PAs, lossy routing and high FSPL at mmWave frequencies. We therefore propose a novel TX architecture that is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>(a) to address these issues.</p><p>In the proposed TX, the (single) modulated IQ signal is up-converted to RF and split into N p branches, each of which is equipped with a PA. And each PA is connected to a sub-group of TX antennas, out of which a fixed number which is smaller than N u is activated, but the total number of activated antennas must be N u . For example, in a system with N t = 8, N u = 4 and N p = 2, we can let each sub-group contain N t /N p = 4 antennas and activate N u /N p = 2 antennas from each sub-group within each time slot. The switching within each sub-group of TX antennas is based on the single-pole multi-throw (SPMT) switching structure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, but in our case more than one TX antennas may have to be activated within each time slot. A TX antenna is activate and deactivated respectively by switching OFF and ON the corresponding shunt switch (SW). The quarter-wave transformer serves two purposes: 1) when an SW is ON, it transforms the short circuit into an open circuit; 2) to match the total load impedance of the activated (or non-short-circuited) branches to the source impedance. The switching speed should not be a bottleneck, since the shunt SWs are just single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches, which have been reported to be able to switch at a maximum rate of 13 GHz (rise/fall time: 25/50 ps) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>The selection of N p is mainly a consideration of the total transmit power and the routing loss. Increasing N p can increase the total transmit power and reduce the routing loss (because each PA would then only need to cover a smaller number of adjacent TX antennas). In this paper, we stick to N p = 1, which leads to the simplest implementation with single-RF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. RX</head><p>At the RX, we have to detect the IQ symbol and the indices of the activated TX antennas in order to recover the IQ and spatial streams, either jointly or separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Depending on the detection strategy, the architecture and complexity of the RX may look differently. For example, an ML detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> may require N r full RX chains and this may be acceptable only for small scale (i.e., small N r ) systems. For large scale systems, the cost and power consumption of mmWave components <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> force us to consider other cost-effective and power-efficient RX architectures. Therefore we propose the RX architecture in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11(b)</ref>, which features hybrid RF/digital processing and separate detection of the IQ and spatial streams.</p><p>In the proposed RX, we use RF phase shifters to equalize the received signal vector, which is largely motivated by the hybrid architecture for mmWave SMX MIMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The purpose of the N t × N r equalizer matrix, which is formed by the phase shifters, is to separate the N r × N t MIMO channel into N t individual SISO channels, which correspond to the N t branches as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11(b</ref>). In each time slot, the spatial symbol is detected by identifying the N u branches that contain an IQ symbol. Since the equalization is conducted at RF, the detection of the presence of an IQ symbol at each branch is just a matter of detecting the magnitude of the signal. For this purpose, we can use the envelope detectors that are widely used in non-coherent on-off keying (OOK) receivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The spatial symbol detector may use N t low-resolution or even 1-bit ADCs. Based on the detected spatial symbol, the N u detected branches are combined (e.g., using MRC), downconverted to baseband, and quantized in full resolution for IQ symbol detection. As a result, we need N t low-resolution ADCs for spatial symbol detection, and one mixer and two full resolution ADCs for IQ symbol detection. The hardware complexity has been greatly reduced thus making the scheme practical for large N t and N r . This is in contrast to the ML RX, which needs N r mixers and 2N r full resolution ADCs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Simulated SEP</head><p>For an exemplary demonstration of the SEP performance using the proposed TX and RX, we assume a 8 × 8 system with parallel and aligned ULAs (i.e., ζ = 1), and choose an ASP such that the channel is orthogonal at D = 3 m. The component values and link parameters are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">I</ref>. Furthermore, we use a zero forcing (ZF) equalizer, i.e., H H , for simulation. More precisely, we apply only the phases of H H to the corresponding phase shifters. The spatial symbol detection is based on a strategy of finding the N u (out of N t ) maxima of the magnitudes of the equalized signals. For IQ detection, the detected N u equalized signals are simply summed up and an ML detector is applied to detect the IQ symbol.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we studied LOS SM/GSM for indoor mmWave communication at 60 GHz. We sought to optimize the error performance of SM in LOS by maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of received SM symbols. As a result, we found that the error performance of LOS SM/GSM can be optimized by making the channel matrix column-orthogonal. We derived the capacity and SEP for LOS SM/GSM and presented numerical results which gave insight into the behavior and performance of SM/GSM in LOS. Finally, we proposed novel TX and RX hardware architectures for implementation of SM/GSM at mmWave frequencies. Overall, we have shown that LOS SM/GSM is a promising scheme, especially for short-range indoor mmWave communications, in which the short wavelength enables us to pack a large number of antennas within the device dimensions. On-going research is concerned with an exact analysis of the power efficiency of the proposed TX architecture and an in-depth analysis of the proposed RX architecture.
