<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Advances in communication and networking technologies are rapidly making ubiquitous network connectivity a reality. Wireless networks are indispensable for supporting such access anywhere and anytime. Due to its open air nature, the wireless environment imposes greater challenges on ensuring network security than in wired networks. Because of the broadcast nature of the wireless medium, communication can easily be eavesdropped or intercepted. The wireless devices can be compromised and modified to behave maliciously or selfishly. These vulnerabilities in wireless networks could undermine the authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and availability if they are not carefully addressed. On the flip side, the inherent and unique characteristics of the wireless medium or devices can be exploited to enhance network security <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Among the various types of attacks in wireless networks, identity-based attacks (i.e., medium access control [MAC] address spoofing) are easy to launch and can significantly degrade network performance. Identity-based attacks are considered the first step in an intruder's attempt to launch a variety of attacks, including denial of service (DoS), session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, data modification, and sniffing. Although traditional cryptographic techniques can potentially prevent identity-based attacks in wireless networks, they are either inefficient or fall short in certain existing scenarios. A few shortcomings can be identified as follows.</p><p>First, although existing 802.11 security tech-niques provide authentication for data frames, management and control frames are usually not protected. Second, most cryptographic techniques are ill suited for a less equipped distributed wireless network due to high complexity and computational requirements. In addition, the conventional cryptographic security mechanisms need key management to distribute, refresh, and revoke the keys. However, key management is difficult in ad hoc networks where nodes join and leave the network frequently. Third, even when traditional cryptographic means are feasible, wireless devices are subject to physical compromises in an adversarial environment. Any unprotected keying materials used for authentication stored on the device may be compromised through physical attacks, which will diminish the strength of the security mechanisms. Furthermore, in emerging wireless networks such as cognitive radio networks, the (primary) users shall be identified at the signal level without relying on higher-layer cryptographic means.</p><p>In light of these circumstances, there is increasing interest in enhancing or supplementing traditional authentication protocols in wireless networks with various lower/physical layer fingerprint/signature schemes. The existing lower/physical layer signature schemes can be broadly classified into three categories: softwarebased, hardware-based, and channel/locationbased. Most of the schemes proposed in the literature are applicable only to static networks. Limited work has considered mobile scenarios. In this article we review and discuss the existing and ongoing research on non-cryptographic authentication/identification in both static and mobile wireless networks. In addition, we propose two RSS-based authentication schemes in mobile networks.</p><p>This article is organized as follows. In the next section we give an overview of different non-cryptographic techniques for user authentication or identification in static networks. We then present physical layer assisted authentication schemes in mobile networks. We then present a summary of the lower/physical layer authentication schemes. Future work on crosslayer security for emerging networks is then discussed, and concluding remarks are outlined in the final section.</p><p>The authors offer an overview of various non-cryptographic mechanisms for user authentication and device identification in wireless networks using lower/physical layer properties or information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC WIRELESS USER AUTHENTICATION AND DEVICE IDENTIFICATION</head><p>Non-cryptographic wireless user authentication and device identification techniques can be broadly classified into three categories:</p><p>• Software-based fingerprinting • Hardware-based fingerprinting • Channel/location-based fingerprinting A pictorial representation of the different categories of wireless user/device authentication/ identification schemes is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In this section we provide an overview of these schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SOFTWARE-BASED FINGERPRINTING</head><p>Software-based fingerprinting techniques are essentially based on the unique characteristics and style of the software programs or protocols running on the devices. IEEE 802.11 standards are de facto MAC protocols for wireless networks. Due to their large and complex specifications, they are usually implemented in slightly different ways by different device manufacturers and driver developers. These variations in implementations can be exploited as a signature to identify different wireless devices. Depending on the combination of the chipset, firmware, and device driver, different devices may exhibit different MAC layer behaviors. For example, the probe requests sent by wireless nodes vary between manufactures. Frame sequence numbers can also be used to detect the presence of multiple 802.11 devices using the same MAC address <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The traffic patterns (e.g., packet sizes and destination addresses) of wireless users have been exploited to identify different users <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Merits -Software-based fingerprinting can easily be recorded or extracted using off-the-shelf wireless devices and existing software. Specifically, by putting the wireless card in monitor mode and using tcpdump or wireshark, all frames sent over the air can be sniffed. Therefore, the frame/beacon interval, frame size, and source and destination addresses of a frame can be obtained easily.</p><p>Demerits -The disadvantage of software-based fingerprint is that it cannot distinguish between different physical devices running the same software. An adversary may be able to learn the behavior of a genuine user and mimic its behavior by changing its device driver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HARDWARE-BASED FINGERPRINTING</head><p>Hardware-based fingerprinting is the reflection of defects/unique design of the hardware on the transmitted waveforms. Although the hardwarebased fingerprinting techniques can be broad, we identify three important hardware-based fingerprinting techniques in this article: radiometric fingerprinting, clock skew fingerprinting, and physically unclonable functions.</p><p>Radiometric Fingerprinting -Radiometric fingerprinting is a recently explored technique to identify the wireless devices uniquely. The underlying assumption in security schemes based on radiometric fingerprinting is that the unique characteristics of a hardware transceiver cannot be replicated or copied from one device to another as how human nature/behavior cannot be replicated. Radiometric identification can be further classified into two categories: signal transientbased identification and modulation domain based identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The transient-based approach extracts the transient portion of the signal associated with the start-up period of a transceiver prior to transmission. Since this transient feature reflects the unique hardware characteristics of a transceiver, it can be used to classify different transmitters. The modulation domain based scheme uses a feature space consisting of five distinct features from the modulation domain of the 802.11 frame. Merits -This signature scheme uses the inherent hardware imperfections and characteristics. It is hard to spoof the signature by using off-theshelf wireless devices.</p><p>Demerits -The disadvantage of radiometricbased signature schemes is that they are vulnerable to impersonation and replay attacks if the attacker is more powerful. Specifically, if the attacker is a software defined radio (SDR) or high-end arbitrary waveform generator, it can mimic the radiometric features <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Furthermore, the schemes are only suitable for the static case, where the signal properties can be extracted reliably without being affected/distorted by other factors such as mobility or interference. Finally, existing schemes need expensive signal analyzers to profile and verify the radiometric signature. It is likely infeasible to deploy an expensive vector signal analyzer in an unsecured and hostile physical environment.</p><p>Clock Skew Fingerprinting -Clock skew fingerprinting works based on the concept that no two clocks run the same. The clocks in modern wireless devices are built based on inexpensive crys- tal oscillators, which are affected by a number of environmental factors and aging effects. Therefore, the clocks in wireless devices will always have some skew with respect to the reference clock. This skew is unique on different wireless devices, so it can be used as a signature to identify different wireless devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Merits -This scheme does not require any additional hardware to realize as it exploits the already existing defects in the clock crystals. Physically Unclonable Functions -Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are a novel method of generating signatures based on the complex physical characteristics of the integrated circuits (ICs) in wireless devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. For instance, a unique signature for a wireless device can be generated based on the random delay characteristics of the wires and transistors in the microelectronic chips of a particular wireless device.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demerits</head><p>An arbiter circuit can be implemented to take the wire delay between different signals as the input and output of a unique signal that represents the delay between wires.</p><p>Merits -It is hard to mimic the signature obtained with PUFs as the signal characteristics are highly random and influenced by the environmental and location effects.</p><p>Demerits -The disadvantage of this scheme lies in its requirement for specially manufactured ICs in wireless devices. Such hardware is not widely available and would be expensive or impractical to retrofit into existing devices. Moreover, it requires exchanging a large number of challenge-response messages. Like the radiometric and clock skew based signatures, it is hard to change/mitigate once the attacker mimics the characteristics of the signature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHANNEL/LOCATION-BASED FINGERPRINTING</head><p>Both channel state information (CSI) and received signal strength (RSS) have been used to identify wireless users or detect identity-based attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. The CSI commonly indicates the channel impulse response, while RSS is usually determined by both the transmission power and the CSI. The foundation behind these schemes is that the CSI and RSS are location-specific due to path loss and channel fading. An attacker who is at a different location from the genuine userwill incur different CSI or RSS profiles as observed by monitors/access points. Most work in this category assumes users are static. In a mobile scenario these schemes generate excessive false alarms.</p><p>Based on the fact that wireless channel response decorrelates quite rapidly in space, a physical layer algorithm is proposed to combine channel probing with hypothesis testing to determine whether current and prior communication attempts are made by the same user (same CSI).</p><p>Although CSI provides detailed information about the channel, it is not available in the current device driver, which prevents its practical use for commodity wireless devices. Instead, coarser information (i.e., RSS), which is readily available in the current device driver, is widely used in real systems. A recent mechanism employs minimum distance testing in addition to cluster analysis to determine the number of attackers and localize them using RSS information <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Merits -Channel-based fingerprinting schemes exploit the naturally available random and location-distinct characteristics of the wireless channel hence very hard to mimic. The RSS based schemes are easy to implement in the current wireless systems. It has been proven to be effective. Unlike the hardware-based schemes, it is easy to tune the characteristics of this signature once the attack is detected.</p><p>Demerits -The approaches might not work well in a highly dynamic environment where the channel state or RSS changes drastically over time. The detection algorithm may need a large number of samples to ensure a desirable performance.</p><p>As channel/location-based fingerprinting has a relative advantage in terms of its uniqueness, adaptiveness, and difficulty of mimicking, we concentrate on channel-based fingerprinting in the rest of this article. In the following section we discuss channel-based authentication in a more challenging scenario (i.e., the mobile network).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHANNEL-ASSISTED AUTHENTICATION IN MOBILE WIRELESS NETWORKS</head><p>The challenge of using CSI or RSS to assist authentication in a mobile scenario lies in the fact that CSI and RSS tend to change over time due to nodes' mobility and changing environment. It is hard to obtain a relatively stable CSI or RSS profile for a mobile node. Hence, it becomes difficult to decide if a CSI or RSS change is due to the node's mobility or an impersonation attack.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CSI-BASED AUTHENTICATION</head><p>A recent work proposes an intraburst and interburst authentication framework using CSI in mobile networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For intraburst authentication, the channel responses of consecutive frames are assumed to be highly correlated. When the difference of channel responses exceeds some threshold, the receiver will assume the subsequent frame is sent from an attacker. However, interburst authentication is missing in the literature. In the following sections we propose two RSS-based intra-and interburst authentication schemes. We have conducted an indoor experiment on the second floor of a campus building, where Bob is sitting in a room, while Alice and Eve are randomly moving through a hallway. All parties are on Dell Latitude E5400 laptops and transmit packets from a fixed antenna. Both Alice and Eve send UDP packets to Bob at an interval of 10 ms. The packets from Alice and Eve received by Bob are interleaved at intervals of about 5 ms. We consider the average case where Eve launches an attack from a random location. The distance between Alice and Eve changes randomly in the range of 0.5 to 20 m. RSS Similarity-Based Authentication -In RSS similarity-based authentication (SA), in order to authenticate the nth frame DATA n , Bob compares its RSS with that of DATA n-1 . If the difference is within a certain range, Bob assumes the signal comes from Alice. Otherwise, he generates an alarm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RSS-BASED AUTHENTICATION</head><p>Most recent 802.11 devices have two (or more) antennas to support diversity. Specifically, in our experiment the laptops are equipped with three antennas. Therefore, for each data packet received by Bob, he can observe three RSS values. This increased dimension of RSS readings can help Bob detect an impersonation attack more accurately.</p><p>Similar to the intraburst authentication in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the SA can be formulated as a hypothesis test. We can apply the Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test to evaluate the trade-off between false alarm rate and detection rate.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the probability distribution of RSS changes with/without attack in the indoor test. The RSS change is mainly determined by the large-scale path loss or distance difference between the Alice-Bob and Eve-Bob links when there is an attack. Therefore, the RSS changes on Bob's three antennas should be modeled as identically correlated Gaussian distribution under attack. However, the changes can be modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian without attack due to spatial diversity. The RSS changes are much larger or more variable under an attack than when there is no attack, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>We use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for performance evaluation. ROC is a classical method for representing the trade-off between false alarm rate (α) and detection rate (β). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the ROC obtained from the indoor experiment. It shows that multiple antenna diversity improves the performance of SA.</p><p>We also conducted a worst case experiment, where Eve shadows Alice within 0.5 m. We found that it is harder for Bob to distinguish Alice from Eve. We obtained 74 percent detection rate with 5 percent false alarm rate when Bob uses three-antenna RSS information. To improve the performance of SA in this worst case scenario, Bob needs either more antennas to increase the RSS information dimensions or finer-grained CSI.</p><p>Temporal RSS Variation Authentication -When the time interval between two consecutive frames is larger than some threshold, or the sender has already moved to another location, the RSS of the received data becomes uncorrelated with the previous one. In such situations we apply a temporal RSS variation authentication (TRVA) scheme, in which Alice sends Bob a list of RSS variations of acknowledgment (ACK) frames she has received in her previous communication with Bob. If this observation is similar to Bob's version, Bob assumes it is Alice. Otherwise, Bob triggers an alarm. TRVA is motivated by the wireless channel reciprocity principle, which has recently been exploited to generate a secret key between two parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The reciprocity principle indicates that the channel state between two transceivers should be identical at any instant of time. RSS is mainly determined by channel state (it may also be affected by ambient noise or measurement error) and transmission power. Intuitively, when Alice and Bob transmit at the same power, they expect to observe similar RSS variations.</p><p>We define the temporal RSS variation with lag k (k &gt; 1) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ΔS(n,k) = S(n) -S(n -k), (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where S(n) and S(nk) are the RSS of the nth and (n -k)th DATA frames received by Bob or the corresponding ACK frames received by Alice. In order to authenticate DATA n to Bob, Alice sends Bob the temporal RSS variation list corresponding to the ACK frames she received in their previous communication. For example, Alice can construct a list consisting of three tem-</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">poral RSS variations, [ΔS(n -1, k), ΔS(n -1 -g -k,k), and ΔS(n -1 -2g -2k,k)],</formula><p>where g is a guard parameter. Bob can generate the corresponding list based on his observation. In Eq. 1, if the unit of RSS is dbm, the temporal RSS variation is transmission power independent, since the transmission power effect is canceled when we subtract RSS in dbm. Therefore, even when Alice and Bob transmit at different power, they should still observe similar RSS variations.</p><p>Attack Model for TRVA -There are two attack models considered for TRVA: eavesdropping and replay. In an eavesdropping attack, Eve overhears the channel and measures the RSS of the ACK frame sent from Bob to Alice. She generates the temporal RSS variation list based on her measurement using the same method as Alice and Bob, and sends the list to Bob hoping to pass authentication. In a replay attack Eve replays Alice's RSS variation list to Bob.</p><p>Performance of TRVA -Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the ROC of TRVA under the indoor test with different lags and list lengths. The guard parameter g is fixed at 3. We can observe that for the same lag, longer list lengths improve detection performance. Similarly, for the same list length, larger lags provide better performance. With larger lags, the variation is more unpredictable and variable. However, list length plays a more important role. As we can see, TRVA performs better when lag = 5 and list length = 10 than the case when lag = 10 and list length = 5. We found that when g is less than 3, which implies a 30 ms packet interval, the consecutive variations may be correlated; but when it is larger than 3, they are nearly uncorrelated (i.e., the correlation coefficient is less than 0.1).</p><p>We also observed that even when Eve shadows Alice within 0.5 m, TRVA can achieve 99 percent detection rate with 5 percent false alarm rate in the indoor test under eavesdropping and replay attacks. It is quite consistent with the theory that when Eve is several wavelengths away from Alice, the channel variations she observes should be uncorrelated with Alice's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPLICABILITY OF SA AND TRVA</head><p>SA is based on the assumption that the channel state or RSS of consecutive data packets are highly correlated. This correlation is usually indicated by the channel coherence time, during which the channel state is considered to be stable or predictable. In an 802.11 system, if we assume a walking speed of 1 m/s and a carrier frequency of 2.4 GHz, we can calculate that the channel coherence time is about 53 ms. However, when the moving speed is increased, the channel coherence time is shortened. For example, in a driving scenario with 10 m/s speed, the channel coherence time is 5.3 ms. In this case the packet interval may not be shorter than the channel coherence time; thus, SA may not work well in a highly mobile scenario.</p><p>The SA scheme is based on the assumption that DATA n-1 is already authenticated when Bob is going to authenticate DATA n . We note that at the outset of this scheme, in order for Bob to get an initial RSS for Alice, it may be necessary to employ a higher-layer authentication protocol to bootstrap the association between Alice and a corresponding RSS. However, this is a one-time procedure.</p><p>The applicability of TRVA is largely dependent on reciprocity. In practice, since the radio is half-duplex, the bidirectional Alice and Bob channel cannot be measured at the same time. Specifically, in our scheme, the RSS of DATA and ACK cannot be measured simultaneously. However, the time difference between the two measurements is about 0.5 ms assuming a transmission rate of 12 Mb/s and packet size of 512 bytes. This time difference is much smaller than the channel coherence time even in a highly mobile scenario. Therefore, TRVA should work well in a more dynamic scenario. The TRVA scheme assumes that all the DATA packets whose RSS is used in calculating the variation list are already authenticated. These DATA can be authenticated by the SA scheme or some higher-layer authentication protocol. TRVA requires Alice to send extra information, the variation list. Therefore, we consider TRVA a more expensive authentication scheme than SA.</p><p>Note that SA and TRVA can be used in the scenario even when cryptographic mechanisms such as hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) are available. For example, when the authentication key used by HMAC is compromised, SA and TRVA can be used as a complementary authentication mechanism to verify the identity of the sender. Furthermore, SA introduces less communication and computation overhead than traditional cryptographic mechanisms. Specifically, SA does not need the sender to append any authentication code with the message. It only requires the receiver to cache the RSS information of the previous received DATA. Depending on security strength, TRVA may also introduce less communication overhead than cryptographic mechanisms. For example, if each RSS variation is represented by a byte, TRVA only needs to append a 10-byte variation list to achieve desirable authentication strength as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. However, HMAC needs 20 bytes if SHA-1 is used. Both SA and TRVA are more computationally efficient than HMAC since they use the simple Neyman-Pearson test.</p><p>For storage, TRVA introduces extra overhead than traditional cryptographic mechanisms, since it requires both the sender and receiver to cache the RSS variation list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY OF NON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC AUTHENTICATION AND IDENTIFICATION SCHEMES ADVANTAGES</head><p>Non-cryptographic authentication and identification schemes can be used to augment or enhance existing cryptography-based mechanisms. These schemes exploit the inherent defects/characteristics of the devices or wireless channel to extract fingerprints. Among the software, hardware, and channel-based signature schemes, channel-based fingerprinting is most robust in terms of its uniqueness, location distinction, adaptiveness, and difficulty to mimic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS</head><p>Although these schemes can be used to detect identity-spoofing attacks or authenticate/identify a particular user, they cannot achieve a 100 percent detection rate without introducing false alarms. There is always a trade-off between the detection rate and false alarm rate in these schemes. Furthermore, most of the schemes are only applicable in static cases, where the device, signal, or channel characteristics are relatively stable. Although CSI-and RSS-based authentication schemes are proposed for mobile networks, the trade-off between the detection rate and false alarm rate still remains.</p><p>To mitigate these shortcomings, a holistic cross-layer approach using multiple layer information combined with traditional cryptographic means is desirable, as explained in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FURTHER RESEARCH SCOPE</head><p>So far the proposed authentication schemes are based on either cryptography or physical layer information. Integration of these two primitives is desirable to secure the emerging wireless networks. For example, in highly dynamic networks, such as mobile ad hoc, vehicular ad hoc, or delay tolerant networks, it is hard to maintain a central authority to efficiently distribute and manage the key. Therefore, users with no pre-established contact have to initialize a shared secret or associate with each other on the fly. The traditional cryptography-based Diffie-Hellman key exchange technique can serve for this purpose. However, it is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. In order to prevent this, two parties usually rely on a shared secret. Thus, it brings the dilemma that Diffie-Hellman is used to generate a shared key between two parties, but in order to prevent the man-in-themiddle attack, we need a pre-shared secret between the two parties. A possible and promising solution to this problem can be a cross-layer security design. By exploiting the unique properties of the wireless channel, the two parties can somehow identify or authenticate the message exchanged in the Diffie-Hellman protocol without relying on a pre-shared key. For example, Alice knows it is Bob sending the Diffie-Hellman key exchange messages to her when she observes a signal characteristic associated with these messages, and this characteristic can only be induced at a particular location where Bob is.</p><p>For intrusion or malicious behavior detection, it is also desirable to examine multiple layer information to improve the probability of detection. The dependence and correlation between multiple layer behaviors or observations can be used to detect malicious/selfish nodes. An illustrative example of a cross-layer signature scheme for authentication as well as misbehavior detection is given in Fig.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>In this article we provide an overview of various non-cryptographic means of user authentication and device identification in both static and mobile wireless networks using lower/physical layer properties or information. We discuss advantages as well as limitations of these schemes and their implementation issues. Although most of the existing schemes show usefulness in static wireless networks, limited efforts have considered mobile cases. To advance the existing research, we propose two RSS-based authentication schemes in mobile networks. We conclude that a holistic crosslayer security approach using multiple layer information combined with traditional cryptographic mechanisms are desirable in emerging wireless networks.</p></div>			</div>
