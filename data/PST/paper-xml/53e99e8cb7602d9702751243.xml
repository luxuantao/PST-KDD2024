Specifically, we consider decentralized controllers such as proportional-integral-derivative-based and sliding-mode ones and model-based controllers such as the classical computed-torque one and a neural-network-based controller. A simple procedure for the estimation of the dynamic model of the manipulator is given. Experimental results provide a detailed framework about the cost/benefit ratio regarding the use of the different controllers, showing that the performance obtained with decentralized controllers may suffice in a large number of industrial applications, but in order to achieve low tracking errors also for high-speed trajectories, it might be convenient to adopt a neural-network-based control scheme, whose implementation is not particularly demanding.</p><p>Index Terms-Decentralized control, neural networks, selective compliance assembly robot arm robot, trajectory tracking control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A N INDUSTRIAL robot manipulator is, in general, a highly nonlinear coupled dynamic system and, therefore, achieving high performance in trajectory tracking control is a very challenging task. For this reason, a large number of solutions have been provided in the literature. In spite of this, the most adopted controller in industrial settings is still the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) one, with additional features like filters, feedforward actions, and so on. This seems due to the fact that, many times, the proposed innovative solutions are not discussed from an industrial point of view (implementation problems, tuning of the parameters, etc.) and not a large number of comparative experimental results have been presented yet. Furthermore, it is not always clear in which situations we really need a complex (nonlinear) controller and which improvement in the performance we can achieve with its use. For example, the dynamics of some axis of the robot might be completely decoupled from the others or the presence of the reduction gears can reduce the coupling effect between the joints, so that a linear controller might suffice. In other words, the improvement achieved by using model-based approaches A. Visioli is with the Dipartimento di Elettronica per l'Automazione, University of Brescia, 25123 Brescia, Italy (e-mail: visioli@ing.unibs.it).</p><p>G. Legnani is with the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Meccanica, University of Brescia, 25123 Brescia, Italy (e-mail: legnani@ing.unibs.it).</p><p>Publisher Item Identifier S 0278-0046(02)00917-6.</p><p>has to be quantitative evaluated in order to determine the improvement in the cost/benefit ratio with respect to the use of a decentralized controller. Summarizing, it seems that there is a lack of a detailed framework regarding the use of new control laws and, since PID-based controllers are widely known and experienced by industrial practicioners, they are still thought to represent, in general, the best solution from an industrial point of view.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on a particular kind of industrial robot, the selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA), which is a three-(or four-) degrees-of-freedom manipulator widely adopted in industrial environments and widely used by researchers as a benchmark for simulation examples in order to show the effectiveness of newly devised controllers. Actually, the third axis, devoted to the vertical motion of the end-effector, is dynamically decoupled from the others, so that, in general, only the first two links are considered (i.e., the robot is assumed to be planar).</p><p>In this framework, we experimented with different decentralized and centralized (model-based) controllers in order to make a comparison between them, evaluating the trajectory tracking performance and discussing the implementation issues in an industrial environment.</p><p>Specifically, in the context of decentralized controllers, we considered a typical PID-based control and a kind of sliding-mode control, i.e., the recently developed discontinuous integral control (DIC) [1]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which appears to be very interesting for applications in mechanical systems, for its capability to reduce the chattering effect. Performance of the above controllers is compared to that obtained with model-based controllers, that is, the typical computed-torque control <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and a neural-network-based control <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> which has been proved to be the most effective among many others proposed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The parameters of the dynamic model of the manipulator can be estimated with a simple procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the considered decentralized controllers are described. Section III is devoted to the presentation of the model-based controllers. The experimental setup is presented in Section IV. Results are shown in Section V and discussed in Section VI. Conclusions are drawn in Section VII.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Generalities</head><p>The dynamic model of an -joint manipulator can be written as follows:</p><p>(1) 0278-0046/02$17.00 Â© 2002 IEEE where is the joint angle vector, is the input torque vector, is the inertia matrix, is the matrix representing the centrifugal and Coriolis terms, is the vector of the frictional terms, is the vector of the gravity terms, and is a vector representing unknown disturbances. Decentralized or independent joint control means that the torque to be generated by the th actuator is based only on the value of the position of the th joint and on its time derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where is the actual value of the th joint coordinate, and is its desired value. Generally, defining the position error as , ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is rewritten as This approach is widely adopted in industrial settings because of its simplicity (no dynamic model is required, in general) and because of its fault-tolerant feature, since, in case a single joint is affected by a failure, the robot can be retrieved in a safe position by means of the other joints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. PID-Based Control</head><p>The standard controllers adopted for industrial robots are based on the well-known PID control law, which can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where is the proportional gain, and and are, respectively, the integral and derivative time costants. In the common case where the robot is actuated by dc or brushless motors, the control structure consists of two nested loops, i.e., an inner loop for velocity and an outer loop for position regulation. However, the implementation of the velocity control loop can be avoided, which requires that the motor amplifiers are configured in "current" mode. When it is present, it can be implemented by an analog or digital device embedded in the drive of the motor. On the contrary, the position control loop is always realized by a digital microprocessor. Nowadays, in addition to the classical three actions, different functionalities are available to improve the control performance. For example, the input of the PD part can be low-pass filtered to avoid the amplification of high-frequency noise, and antiwindup schemes can be exploited. Then, feedforward terms, based on the desired velocities and accelerations, can be utilized to increase the transient performance. Furthermore, saturations have to be applied to the resulting control variable to avoid exceeding the maximum digital-to-analog converter (DAC) output and, most importantly, that velocity/torque limits of the motors are not surpassed; the control variable can also be low-pass filtered to prevent the excitation of high-frequency modes and the occurrence of vibrations that may damage the system or decrease the tracking performance. In some cases, a notch filter can be adopted for this purpose. It is worth stressing that the properties of PID controllers are generally well understood by the industrial operators and many tuning techniques have been devised <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The tuning of the other additional parameters is a more critical issue and the operator might not be capable of setting them in order to ameliorate the control performance; therefore, he/she may decide not to exploit these additional features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. DIC</head><p>One of the most interesting approaches for the robust control of nonlinear multivariable systems is the variable-structure sliding-mode control, which has been widely investigated by a large number of researchers over the last 40 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The main drawback of this methodology is the presence of a switching term in the control law that might produce a significant undesirable chattering effect and, therefore, much effort has been spent in order to reduce it. Recently, the so-called DIC has been recognized as particularly effective in achieving this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and, therefore, to be applied to mechanical systems. In the devised control law, there is the presence of an integrator with a nonlinear switching input whose purpose is to track the unknown disturbances. In this way, the switching term, which causes the chattering, has to compensate only for the difference between the real disturbances and its estimations, so that its amplitude can be significantly reduced. If we choose the following sliding surface for each joint: where , then, for the continuous-time case, the expression of the torque command can be stated as ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">sgn sgn (4)</formula><p>where , , and are constant parameters, and is an estimation of an external disturbance which is assumed to be continuous and to be limited, as well as its time derivative It can be demonstrated that if parameters , , and are chosen in such a way that then the controlled system is globally stable and, after a finite time, a sliding mode arises on the surface , so that the error asymptotically converges to zero. In practical implementations, the integral term is evaluated numerically after a standard discretization procedure. In the following, we will refer to the control law (4) as DIC. The simple discretized version of (4) can be slightly modified in order to try preventing oscillations which occur once the estimation of the disturbance is constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It follows that the torque command for the discretized discontinuous integral control (DDIC) can be written as sgn sgn</p><p>(5)  In order to guarantee that a discrete sliding mode occurs, it has to be , where is the bound of the discrete derivative of the disturbance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MODEL-BASED CONTROLLERS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Computed-Torque Control</head><p>In the computed-torque control scheme, the dynamic model of the manipulator is exploited. Taking into account (1) with (no uncertainties are considered in the model) and defining we can derive the control scheme shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> where and are user-chosen diagonal matrices. Thus, it results that the system is decoupled and linearized, so that the error dynamics is arbitrary, given by the following expression:</p><p>where, again, is the difference between the desired joint position vector and the actual one.</p><p>Obviously, the assumption of the exact knowledge of the robot dynamic model cannot be satisfied in practical cases.</p><p>Hence, the achievement of the desired tracking performance cannot be guaranteed. For this purpose, it would be desirable to add a term in the controller that compensates for the modeling errors. In this context, the use of a neural network can be considered, as will be shown in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Neural-Network-Based Control</head><p>The neural network's capability to approximate arbitrary nonlinear mappings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> can be exploited for trajectory tracking control. Generally, a neural network has to learn the whole dynamic model or to compensate for the uncertainties in a previously estimated one. In this context, many control systems adopting multilayer perceptron neural networks with a backpropagation learning algorithm have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the authors of the present paper experimentally compared many solutions for the control of the SCARA robot described in Section IV, finding that the best performance is achieved by the scheme proposed by Ishiguro et al. in which the neural network has to compensate for the uncertainties in the estimated model at the torque level (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). In this scheme, the network training is performed by the backpropagation algorithm based on the difference between the actual measured torque and the one estimated by the inverse dynamic model [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>]. The employed multilayer perceptron is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. It has an input layer with four inputs (the actual position and velocity signals for the two joints), one hidden layer with four neurons with sigmoidal functions, and an output layer with two neurons with linear functions. With respect to the solution proposed by Ishiguro et al. as we did in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> we avoid adopting the acceleration signals as inputs. This is because they are too noisy, since they are computed by finite-difference approximation and, therefore, their use leads to a decrease in the tracking performance, as stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and confirmed by our experiments. The output of the network, that is, the additive torque to be applied to each joint can be expressed as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> It is worth stressing that, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the control performance is robust to the choice of the design parameters such as the number of hidden neurons and the learning rate value (eventually fixed to 10 ) and the momentum coefficient (fixed to 0.9) for the backpropagation algorithm. Furthermore, the neural network satisfies the generalization property, namely, it is able to also improve performance on trajectories that are different from the one utilized during the training procedure (i.e., it really learns the robot dynamics more than the single trajectory).</p><p>Note that, with respect to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, in this paper the PD controller coefficients have been modified, both for the computed-torque and the neural network cases, yielding better results (see Section V).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND ESTIMATION OF THE DYNAMIC MODEL</head><p>For the evaluation of the performance of the considered controller, we adopted the ICOMATIC SCARA 03, built by ICO-MATIC of Gussago (Brescia, Italy) and installed in the Applied Mechanics and Robotics Laboratory, University of Brescia (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). It has three degrees of freedom, but, as already mentioned, only the first two links have been utilized in the experiments, since the third link, which is devoted to move the end-effector vertically, is completely decoupled from the others from a dynamic point of view. Therefore, in this section, we present the dynamic model of the first two (coupled) joints. The two rotational joints are actuated by two dc motors with harmonic drive reduction gears, which assure a good dynamic decoupling between the two links (whose length is equal to 0.33 m). The nominal velocity of the two motors is 4000 r/min for the first joint and 3000 r/min for the second joint, while the nominal torque is 1.7 and 0.7 N m for the two motors, respectively. Position measurements are obtained by means of incremental encoders (one encoder step is equal to rad) and velocity measurements by tachometers. The system is controlled by means of a PC-based controller which consists of a PC Pentium 133 with I/O boards. The control software runs under a QNX operating system, which assures real-time functionalities and a control loop frequency of 1 kHz.</p><p>In order to implement the model-based controller, the dynamic model of the manipulator has to be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Some assumptions can be made in order to simplify the model and permit an easier parameters estimation procedure. Since the motors of the second and third links are situated at the end of the first and second link, respectively, the masses of the first and second link can be considered as lumped at the end of the same links (i.e., the distances of each center of mass of the two links from the related joint can be considered as equal to the link length and the values of the inertia moments of the two links with respect to the center of mass can be neglected). By assuming that no external forces and torques are applied, the dynamic model with respect to the actual torque generated by the motors can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>  where the functions , , , and express the dynamic friction in the two motors and in the two harmonic drive reduction gears, respectively.</p><p>In the above model, many parameters are not known, in general, and they need to be somehow estimated. The first estimation that can be performed is the one regarding the dynamic friction. From ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), it appears that moving only a single joint at a time at a constant velocity, only the term regarding the friction of the other joint is different from zero. In other words, ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</p><p>Once the friction functions have been estimated, the approximate values of the inertial parameters can be determined. The method we adopted consists of executing different experiments in which the two links are moved separately with piecewise-constant accelerations (i.e., a triangular velocity profile). In these cases, the dynamic model can be written as follows:</p><p>Hence, measuring the torque and knowing the values of the acceleration (obtained by deriving twice the position measurements) and of the previously estimated friction function, the in- ertial parameters can be easily determined. It results that kg and kg. The knowledge of these values permits us to determine, at every instant of the motion, all the elements of the inertia matrix and also of the matrix representing the Coriolis and centrifugal torques, so that the inverse dynamic problem is completely solved once the motors' positions and velocities are known.</p><p>Many tests were performed to verify the accuracy of the estimated parameters. A typical result is presented in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>, where the estimated and the actual torques for a point-to-point motion followed by a circular trajectory are reported. This trajectory has been chosen since it consists of different dynamic situations: high velocities and accelerations for the two links are present at the same time and they also change their sign. Moreover, a significant portion of the workspace is involved. It appears that, despite the simplified assumptions we have made, the obtained model is sufficiently accurate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. RESULTS</head><p>The considered controllers have been tuned by applying an exhaustive trial-and-error procedure, in order to exploit their full capabilities in the trajectory tracking task. Different trajectories have been employed in selecting the parameters, which, in any ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) case, once the tuning procedure has been performed, remain the same for each trajectory tracking task.</p><p>In particular, in the PID-based controllers, only the three main actions have been adopted, with the exception of the implementation of a saturation level in the integral action (to avoid the windup effect). The use of additional features such as feedforward actions (see Section II-B) has been avoided, since we verified that, in our case, it does not lead to an improvement in the performance. We experimented with both the single-position-loop scheme (in the following, denoted by PIDS) and the double-loop (position and velocity) structure (denoted by PIDD). The values of the parameters for all the controllers are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. Note that, in the control software, the position and the velocity are expressed in encoder steps and encoder steps per second, respectively.</p><p>The tracking performance has been evaluated imposing the condition that the end-effector has to follow a circular trajectory (in the Cartesian space), to be accomplished in different time intervals. Specifically, a circular trajectory with center in (0,0.5) and diameter equal to 0.2 m (see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>) have been adopted, to be accomplished in 2, 3, and 4 s, respectively. The desired joint positions, velocities, and accelerations have been determined by applying the inverse kinematics (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> for the case of 2 s). It has to be noted that, with the faster trajectory, the torque limits of the actuators are almost achieved. The tracking errors have been determined along the whole trajectory. On a single joint, it has been calculated (in encoder steps) as the difference between the desired position and the actual one at the same time instant. On the contrary, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the end-effector tracking error (in millimeters) has been calculated as the minimum difference (with sign) between the real end-effector position and the reference trajectory (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref>). Note that the end-effector position has been determined by applying the direct kinematics, therefore neglecting elasticities and compliances of the joints and considering only the errors due to the control action. In Tables III-V, the tracking errors are reported for the different controllers and the different trajectories. Results for the neural-network-based controller have been achieved after a training of ten epochs, i.e., after performing ten times the 2-s circular trajectory.</p><p>In addition to the maximum and mean absolute errors, an error index has been determined, defined as where is the mean absolute error and is the standard deviation of the absolute value of the tracking error . The definition of is inspired by the concept of accuracy and repeatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Note that an error of one encoder step on both joints produces a maximum error of about 0.03 mm on the end-effector. However, it has to be remembered that large errors on the joints can generate high position errors on the end-effector (i.e., distance in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref>), but do not always generate large tracking errors (i.e., distance in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref>). Finally, it has to be stressed that the robot adopted in the experiments has been built for assembly tasks of light pieces (the maximum nominal payload is 4 kg). Experiments adopting different values of the payload have been performed with the different controllers, but results are very similar to the ones obtained without the payload and, therefore, are not shown for the sake of brevity. This is reasonable, considering the inertia torques required by the masses of the links and by the friction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head><p>From the above results, it results that, for low-speed trajectories, the simple single-loop PID controller performs very well, despite its simplicity. For example, for the 4-s trajectory the maximum error on the end-effector is 0.058 mm, which is very close to the resolution of the system. Hence, in these operative conditions, the use of a more complex (i.e., model based) controller appears to be unworthy. On the contrary, as might be expected, for high-speed trajectories, the use of a model-based controller assures significantly higher performance (up to about 50% of inprovement on the mean absolute error) if the adopted dynamic model is accurate, that is, a neural network is employed to compensate for the model uncertainties. In other words, model-based controllers assure constant performance regardless of the operating speed, while a strong correlation between the operating speed and the maximum and mean absolute tracking errors is present for the decentralized controllers. In any case, it has been shown how the implementation of a neural-network-based control scheme does not present any particular problem (note that a few training epochs on a single trajectory guarantee good performance). However, it has to be said that, also, for the 2-s trajectory the single-loop PID controller guarantees low tracking errors (0.179 mm as maximum error on the end-effector) and, therefore, its use might be justified in a large number of industrial applications. This is true despite the fact that the PID controllers are particularly suitable to be applied to purely linear systems, which is not the case of a robot manipulator. This contrast can be explained by analyzing the actual SCARA robot employed for the experiments, in which the high reduction rate of the harmonic drive reduction gears reduce the degree of dynamic coupling between the two links. The DIC, both in its continuous and discretized versions, performs similarly to the single-loop PID controller and, therefore, it can be seen as a good candidate to replace it in industrial settings, since, in general, it provides a better rejection of high load disturbances (which were  not present in the previously considered experiments), as we showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The worst tracking performance is achieved with the double-loop PID control; this is mainly because of the noisy tachometer signal adopted for the velocity control loop. The use of a low-pass filter introduces a delay that does not permit, in any case, a decrease in the tracking error.   Summarizing, it can be said that a standard PID controller provides high performance in the trajectory tracking of an industrial SCARA robot and, therefore, proposed new solutions regarding this kind of manipulator have necessarily to be compared with PID in order to show their effectiveness. The computed-torque control scheme that uses a neural network to compensate for the dynamic uncertainties surely represents a very valuable approach in this context, taking into account the easiness of the overall implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we have presented an experimental comparison between different decentralized and centralized controllers for an industrial SCARA robot manipulator. Results presented in this paper are important from a practical point of view since they provide a detailed framework about the choice of the control structure for the trajectory tracking task. In particular, the implementation of the examined controller has been described and, therefore, its cost can be considered with respect to the achievable tracking performance. Summarizing, it has been shown how, for the SCARA robot, the performance obtained with decentralized controllers might be considered sufficiently accurate for a large number of industrial applications, but it can be improved with a neural-network-based controller with a modest extra effort in implementation . This solution allows a reduction of the tracking error and makes it almost independent from the operating speed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Manuscript received November 17, 1999; revised August 13, 2001.
