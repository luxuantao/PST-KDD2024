<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Furmant tracking is an old problem that has received much attention lately, mainly because of the deficiencies of the well established algorithms. Most formant tracking algo rithms are based on linear prediction (LP) analy sis and en counter problems with nasal formants, spectral zeros and bandwidth estimation. These deficiencies stem from the fact that LP is a parametric method that does not model spectral valleys; in addition, LP is a linear model unable to adequately model speech acoustics. Alternatively, we pro pose a multi band demodulation approach to speech analy sis in the framework of the AM-FM modlliation model that overcomes these problems.</p><p>Motivated by several nonlinear and time-varying phe nomena during speech production Maragos, Quatieri and Kaiser <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> proposed an AM-FM modulation model that rep resents a sjngle speech resonance R(t) as an AM-PM signal R(t) = aCt) COS(2'1l-[Jet + l' q ( r)drJ + 8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1 )</ref> where fe is the center value of the formant frequency, q(t) is the frequency modulating signal, and a( t) is the time varyin g amplitude. The instantaneous formant frequency signal is defi ned as fi(t) = fe + q(t). To obtain the amplitude envelope la(t)1 and the insta.n taneous frequency fi(t) signals from a speech resonance R(t), a demodulation algorithm must be used. In addi tion, a filtering scheme is needed to isolate a single reso nance signal R( t) from the spectrum before demodulation can be performed. 'T'hese two steps of speech analysis will be referred to as multiband demodulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. Multiband demodulation yields rich time-frequency information.</p><p>In section 3, we propose and compare two short-time estimates of the average frequency of a speech (frequency) band R(t): the mean instantaneous frequency, which has been used for formant tracking in [3J and the mean ampli tude weighted instantaneous frequency, a time-domain equiv alent of the first central spectral moment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. Next , based on the weighted frequency estimate, the modulation model and a multiband filtering/demodulation scheme, we pro .. pose the multiband demodulation formant tracker. The al gorithm produces accurate formant tracks and realistic for mant bandwidth estimates, is easy to implement bot.h in the time and frequency domain, and avoids most of the drawbacks of LP-based formant trackers.</p></div>

These results hold also when la(t)l, fi(t) are com puted via ESA (with slight modifications when a l � a2).</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1</ref> (a) , (b) we display the short-time frequency estimates Fl and F2 computed via the ESA (x) and the HTD (0) for the signal in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref> with ft = 1.5 kHz, h = 1.7 kHz , al(t) = lOt, az(t) = I-lOt and t E [0,0.1] sec. The amplitudes of the two sinusoids are antagonizing so that for the first 50 msec the sinusoid h is dominant while for the remaining 50 msec ft dominates. We can see that Fl locks on the sinusoid with the greater amplitUde (greater amplitude frequency product for the ESA), while F2 being the mean (square amplitude) weighted frequency, provides a more 'intuitive' short-time frequency estimate.</p><p>For a sum of more than t.wo (AM-FM) sinusoids: F2 � (2:: " a� In) / (2:: " a�), i.e., each frequency is weighted with the square amplitude. In general, the behavior of PI is complicated. If there are only one or two prominent sinu soids/harmonics in the spectrum though , FI will lock on the frequency of the sinusoid wit.h the greatest amplitude.  A speech resonance can be thought of as the sum of a few slowly time-varying (AM-FM) sinusoids , one for each harmonic. Thus, FI has the tendency to lock on the har monic with the greatest amplitude in the formant band, while F2 weights the frequency of each harmonic with its square amplitude. In general , F z provides a more accurate formant frequency estimate; FI can be superior , however , when the bandpass filter used to extract the formant is not placed exactly on the spectral resonance (e.g. off by 100-200 Hz). Finally , there are cases where no major formant har monics are 'inside' the bandpass filter; there the behavior Fl is unpredictable (and thus unstable). Overall , the Fl esti mate is computationally simple , and converges faster to the formant frequency when the bandpass filter is 'misplaced'. The weighted frequency estimate F2 is more robust for low energy bands (i.e. , spectral valleys) and provides more ac curate formant frequencies.</p><p>Similarly, B2 bandwidth estimates are more robust than BI estimates. For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure">l</ref>(a), (b) we display B1 and B2 (computed via HTD) for the sum of two sinusoids in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. The bandwidths are shown as error bars around their respective frequency estimates. Note that for al � a2 (i.e., when there is not a single prominent harmonic in the spectrum) Bl takes unnaturally large values.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, the (square amplitude) weighted estimates F2 and B2 are shown to be time domain equivalents of the first and second central spectral moments of the signal; this offers an alternative way of computing F2 and B2 in the frequency domain (see also section 5).</p><p>Overall, the HTD and the ESA provide similar esti mates F, B, because of the smoothing effects of bandpass filtering. The ESA , however, has lower computational com plexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. When the center frequency of the bandpa�� filter approaches the pitch frequency , though, the HTD pro duces smoother B2 estimates than the ESA. Thus, if for mant bandwidth estimates are needed in the 0-500 Hz fre quency range (first formant) , the HTD should be preferred; otherwise, for higher formants, the ESA should be used for computational efficiency.   Tn Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2</ref>(h), we plot the value of the short-time fre quency estimates F2(t, J) for each and every frequency band (centered at frequency J) vs. time t for the sentence in (a), i.e., unlike a typical time-frequency plot, here, the y-axis represents the range rather than the domaiu of F2. Note the deuse concentration of points (frequency estimates) around the formants tracks. The plot density plays the role that the Fourier magnitude plays in a speech spectrogram, so we refe r to this time-frequency representation as the speech pvknogram. The pyknogram displays both the formant po sitions (and bandwidths) and the location of the spectral zeros (low d ensity areas).</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we show the frequency F�(f) and bandwidth B2 (f) estimates for a single analysis frame, vs. the center frequency of the Gabor filters f. We have observed that ba.ndwidth R2 minima consistent.ly indicate the presence of formants.</p><p>In order to determine robust raw formant estimates for 786 �80 iD 90 � <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">170   ��---------------------</ref>  a frame of speech we search for points where F2(J) and the Gabor filter center frequency f are equal (i.e., F2(f) = /, or in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> the points where the solid line meets the dotted one) and dFAf)/df &lt; 1. In addition, there are cases where a weak formant is 'shadowed' by a st.rong neighboring one; then F2(J) approaches the line f without reaching it. Thus, we also search for points where F2(J) -f has local maxima and F2(f) &lt; f• These points are also considered formant estimates if the difference f -F2(J) is less than a threshold (typically 50 Hz). Finally, we improve the accuracy of the formant estimates by linear interpolation.</p><p>An alternative way of determining the raw formants is by determining the dense regions of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2</ref>(b), i.e., determin ing the minima of dF2(f)/df. This approach may produce better formant estimates when two form aut t.racks are close together. However, a threshold must be provided for the plot density, which makes this approach less reliable.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref>(a), we display the raw formant estimates for the sentence of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2</ref> addition, the formant accuracy is affected by the preempha sis and the harmonic structure of the spectrum (LP tends to 'ride with the harmonics' as does the Fl frequency esti mate). Finally, LP does not provide accurate formant band width estimates. By using the multiband demodulation al gorithm one avoids these problems. Overall, the multi band demodulation formant tracking algorithm has the attractive featmes of being conceptually simple and easy to implement in parallel. It behaves well in the presence of nasalization (it tracks an extra 'nasal formant ') and provides realistic formant bandwidth estimates.</p><p>We saw in section 3 that the choice of Fl vs. F2 is the choice between fast convergence and robust raw formant es timates. Since convergence is not the issue here, we prefer to use the more reliable weighted estimate F2• Note, though, that when the frequency axis is poorly sampled (i.e., when only a few Gabor filters are used), Fl can produce better results than F2, since Fl provides good formant estimates even when the Gabor filter is not centered exactly on the formant frequency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> an iterative algorithm (iterative ESA) is proposed for formant tracking: initial formant estimates are refi ned through an iterative filtering/demodulation scheme. For the iterative ESA, the Fl frequency estimate is preferred to F2, since FI increases substantially the convergence speed to a formant. In general, the iterative ESA and the parallel mlllt.iband algorithm (proposed above) yield similar results. In the case where two formants tracks merge, though, the mult.iband algorithm performs better due to its more flexi ble decision about raw formant values.</p><p>In the multiband formant tracking algorithm we use a bank of uniformly spaced (in frequency) Gabor filters. Al ternatively, a Gabor wavelet bank with constant logarith mic spacing can be used, which gives uniform performance (for ESA demodulation) across channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. Logarithmic spacing (over 1 kHz) is also compatible with the formant frequency perceptual resolution (limens) of the ear. In [3], using logarithmic spacing has improved the performance of the iterative ESA formant tracker. We mentioned in section 3 that the estimates F 2 and B2 can be computed in the frequency domain as the first and second spectral moments (computation via FFT). This results in significant computational savings since the Ga bor filtering can be implemented by multiplicat.ion in the frequency domain and no demodulation is needed. The F2 and B2 estimates computed in the frequency domain take similar values to their time domain equivalents when ad equately 'long' FFT implementation is used (512 or 1024 point FFT gives good results).</p><p>Finally, one may use multiband demodulation for spec tral zero tracking. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2</ref>(b), zeros manifest themselves as areas of low plot density (e.g., for nasalized sounds an anti formant can be observed between the second and the third formant track). More work is on the way for anti-formant tracking using the multiband ESA.</p><p>Overall, the multiband demodulation formant tracker produced very promising results, which suggest that the modulation model and the demodulation algorithms are a useful alternative modeling/analysis approach to speech processing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Finally, the speech signal Set) is modeled as the sum Set) = EN_ Rk(t) of N such AM-FM signals, one for each formant. k_l This work was supported by the US National Science Foun dation under Grant MIP-9396301. 0-7803-2431-5/95 $4.00 © 1995 IEEE</figDesc></figure>
