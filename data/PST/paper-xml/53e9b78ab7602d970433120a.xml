<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>W HILE for linear finite dimensional systems many adap- tive schemes have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, adaptive control techniques have been developed for only a few classes of partial differential equations (PDEs) restricted by relative degree, stability, or domain-wide actuation assumptions. In this paper, we develop the first adaptive controllers for parabolic PDEs controlled from a boundary and containing unknown destabilizing parameters affecting the interior of the domain. Our control laws are given by explicit formulae and open the door for the use of a wealth of certainty equivalence and Lyapunov techniques developed for finite dimensional systems. They initiate an effort towards developing adaptive controllers for physical systems such as fluid, thermal, and chemical dynamics, where actuation can be only applied non-intrusively, the dynamics are unstable, and the parameters, such as the Reynolds, Rayleigh, Prandtl, or Peclet numbers are unknown because they vary with operating conditions. Our method builds upon our explicitly parametrized control formulae in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to avoid solving Riccati or Bezout equations at each time step.</p><p>1) Literature Overview: Early works on adaptive control of infinite-dimensional systems, surveyed by Logemann and Townley <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, were for plants stabilizable by non-identifier based high gain feedback, under a relative degree one assumption. Model reference (MRAC) type schemes were designed by Hong and Bentsman <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Bohm, Demetriou, Reich, and Rosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Solo and Bamieh <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, Orlov <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and Bentsman and Orlov <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.While the strength of these results are the proofs of identifiability of infinite dimensional parameter vectors, their limitation is that they require control action throughout the PDE domain. Demetriou and Rosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> developed robust parameter estimation schemes using parameter projection and sigma-modification.</p><p>Other efforts such as Demetriou and Ito <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Wen and Balas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> have employed tools from positive realness; they have also provided some cunning examples that go beyond the relative degree one restriction. Systems with structural perturbations, including some boundary control problems, are addressed by Curtain, Demetriou, and Ito <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Adaptive linear quadratic control with least-squares estimation was pursued by Duncan, Maslowski, and Pasik-Duncan <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for linear stochastic evolution equations with unbounded input operators and exponentially stable dynamics. Adaptive control of nonlinear PDEs has also received some attention. Liu and Krstic <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Kobayashi <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> considered a Burgers equation with various parametric uncertainties; Kobayashi <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> also considered the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Jovanovic and Bamieh <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> designed adaptive controllers for nonlinear systems on lattices, which include applications like infinite vehicular platoons or infinite arrays of microcantilevers. An experimentally validated adaptive boundary controller for a flexible beam was presented by de Queiroz, Dawson, Agarwal, and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>2) Results of the Paper: For several unstable parabolic PDE systems controlled from the boundary we assume that physical parameters like reaction, diffusion, or advection coefficients are unknown. No adaptive controllers for such models have been proposed, even though they are frequent in applications that incorporate thermal-fluid or chemically reacting dynamics. An obstacle to the development of adaptive controllers has been the lack of parametrized families of nonadaptive controllers. This obstacle was removed by Smyshlyaev and Krstic <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> who developed explicit formulae for boundary control of a class of parabolic PDEs that includes the problems considered here. Those formulae are not only explicit functions of the spatial coordinates of the PDE, but also depend explicitly on the physical parameters of the plant. This feature is absent from standard methods like linear quadratic regulator (LQR) extensions to PDEs because parametrized solutions to Riccati equations cannot be obtained. While an adaptive version of an LQR approach would require a solution to a high-dimensional Riccati equation at each time step, our approach only requires that new parameter updates be substituted into the control formula.</p><p>For clarity, in this paper we present the results for scalar and vector parameter problems. They can be extended to functional parameters as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. With the controllers parametrized in the physical parameters, our schemes are of indirect type.</p><p>Three basic approaches to the design of parameter identifiers for adaptive control exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>: the Lyapunov approach, the passivity-based approach (pursued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>), and the swapping approach. The Lyapunov approach, which ensures the best transient performance properties is seldom possible without changing the control law to compensate the potentially destabilizing effect of adaptation, even in the linear case. We exploit the structural opportunities within the class of PDEs we are considering and develop Lyapunov adaptation schemes. In companion papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> we develop estimation-based schemes (see Section XI for some comments on the contents of those papers).</p><p>Our Lyapunov design is inspired by an idea Praly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> developed for adaptive nonlinear control under growth conditions. Since our PDE problems are linear, we have found a way to significantly simplify this approach, however, we retain its main feature-a logarithm weight on the plant state in the Lyapunov function. This results in a normalization of the update law by a norm on the plant state, which is uncommon for Lyapunov designs. Except for some special examples, projection is needed to keep the parameters within an a priori set. Projection is not used as a robustification tool but to prevent adaptation transients that would require overly conservative restrictions on the size of the adaptation gain. The projection set may be taken conservatively (large), however, in order for stability to be guaranteed, the adaptation gain needs to be taken inversely proportional to the size of the parameter set. The bounds on the gain can be derived explicitly and are a priori verifiable.</p><p>Most of the designs presented require full state feedback, however, two examples are given that use only output feedback-scalar sensing at the boundary. These output feedback designs employ adaptive observers which we construct as infinite-dimensional extensions of Kreisselmeier-type filters used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Only 1-D results are presented here. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> we show that our tools extend readily to higher dimensions, in appropriate geometries.</p><p>Simulation results are presented for one of the problems. It is shown that the adaptive controller works in the presence of additive disturbance in the plant and measurement noise. The standard deadzone prevents the parameter drift.</p><p>Our adaptive boundary control results can be developed both for Dirichlet and Neumann actuation. Most of the controller we present are for the notationally easier Dirichlet actuation but in the introductory example in Section II we use Neumann actuation.</p><p>To avoid tedium and keep the concepts clear we present designs for the simplest classes of systems for which the con-cepts are nontrivial. For example, it is shown separately how to deal with parametric uncertainties in boundary conditions or reaction terms involving boundary values. A skilled designer can combine these tools with the method for reactionadvection-diffusion systems to craft solutions to more general problems.</p><p>Throughout the paper we assume well-posedness of the closed-loop systems, except for the very first benchmark problem, for which well-posedness is shown under strong assumption on initial conditions in Section IV. We later demonstrate numerically in Section X that our design is successful for non-smooth initial conditions as well.</p><p>3) Structure of the Paper: In Section II we present an adaptive scheme for a benchmark plant with unknown reaction coefficient. Closed-loop stability and well-posedness of this scheme are proved in Sections III and IV correspondingly. The robustness properties of the adaptation laws are discussed in Section V. An alternative approach to the design is presented in Section VI. In Sections VII and VIII, statefeedback and output-feedback designs are developed for two other benchmark plants. The extension to reaction-advectiondiffusion plants is presented in Section IX. The designs are illustrated with simulation results in Section X. The paper ends with a discussion in Section XI.</p><p>Notation: The spatial norm is denoted by . The symbols , , denote the first order Bessel function of the first kind and the first and second order modified Bessel functions of the first kind, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CONTROL DESIGN FOR A SYSTEM WITH AN UNKNOWN REACTION COEFFICIENT</head><p>We start the paper with a design for a benchmark system and present extensions in subsequent sections. The benchmark system has a destabilizing reaction term and employs control only at the boundary. The unknown reaction coefficient is scalar, however, an extension to spatially-varying functional coefficients is discussed in Remark 3. A problem with multiple parameters is discussed in Section IX.</p><p>While most of the paper, and this section in particular, assumes availability of full state feedback, Section VIII presents designs that employ only boundary sensing.</p><p>Consider the following plant:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where is an unknown constant parameter that can have any real value. We use a Neumann boundary controller designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> in the form <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>(3) which employs the measurements of for and an estimate of . Consider an invertible change of variable (4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Lemma A.2 in Appendix establishes that (4) maps ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) into (6) (7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where is the parameter estimation error. We will show that the update law <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> achieves regulation of to zero for all , for arbitrarily large initial data and for an arbitrarily poor initial estimate . Theorem 1: Suppose that the system (1)-( <ref type="formula">3</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) has a well defined classical solution for all . Then, for any initial condition compatible with boundary conditions, and any , the solutions and are uniformly bounded and uniformly in . Moreover, the following performance bounds hold in the closedloop nonlinear system: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> for all , , and</p><p>for all , where . Remark 1: Well-posedness of the closed-loop system, assumed in Theorem 1, will be shown later in Section IV, which can be skipped if the reader is interested only in the design procedure.</p><p>Remark 2: While the bound (10) obviously quantifies the "peak transient" performance, the bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> quantifies the rate of convergence to zero.</p><p>Remark 3: In this paper we consider only parameters without spatial variation. The extension to spatially-varying problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> will be a subject of another paper. Preliminary results are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 4: The non-negative form of the adaptive law ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is coincidental for this particular benchmark plant and it is further discussed in Section V.</p><p>Remark 5: It is also important to note that the update law (9) contains normalization. Normalization is uncommon in Lyapunov designs and is the result of including the logarithm in the Lyapunov function <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Normalization is necessary because the control law (3) is of certainty equivalence type-unlike the Lyapunov adaptive controllers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> which employ non-normalized adaptation and strengthened nonlinear controllers that compensate for time-varying effects of adaptation. An additional measure of preventing overly fast adaptation in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is the restriction on the adaptation gain .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROOF OF THEOREM 1</head><p>Consider a Lyapunov function candidate <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> The time derivative along the solutions of ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) can be shown to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> (the calculation involves one step of integration by parts).

From the definition of it follows that and remain bounded for all time. However, we need to show that is bounded for all time and for all . To do this, consider</p><p>Integration by parts was used several times to obtain the above equalities. Using Agmon's inequality (noting that ), then Young's inequality, and finally Poincare's inequality (noting that ), one gets that <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Substituting ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) into ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">16</ref>), it follows that <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Integrating the last inequality, we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> To obtain this bound, on one hand we have from ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) that <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> On the other hand ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>)</p><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> we have and therefore it follows from (12) that <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> Integrating <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> we get <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> Substituting ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) into <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, and then, along with <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, into <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, we get <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> By combining Agmon's and Poincare's inequalities (and using the fact that ), we get , thus is uniformly bounded.

By combining ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) with Poincare's inequality we also get that is integrable in time over the infinite time interval. By Barbalat's lemma it follows that as . To show regulation also in the maximum norm, we note that, from Agmon's inequality, .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. WELL POSEDNESS OF THE CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM</head><p>Since the purpose of our paper is stabilization, we focus our effort on proving boundedness and regulation. As evident from Section III, this is not a routine task due to the nonlinear character of the closed-loop system (34) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> (36)</p><p>The well posedness of the closed loop system, although important, is of less interest because the systems are parabolic and therefore are always "well behaved." For the sake of completeness, in this section we show how the well posedness is proved for the plant considered in the previous section.</p><p>Consider the system ( <ref type="formula">34</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">36</ref>). Let us denote and introduce the operator where either , i.e., there is a unique global solution, or and . To show that there is no blow-up, we make a-priori estimates. We first observe from the first line of ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) that is square integrable over infinite time. The same property holds for . It is then shown that (42) and ( <ref type="formula">43</ref>) where ( <ref type="formula">44</ref>) is bounded because of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. From the boundedness of , , , and the square integrability in time of , , by integrating (42) it follows that is bounded and is square integrable. Then, by integrating (43) and using the square integrability of and the other functions mentioned above, it follows that is bounded and is square integrable. By Agmon's inequality, we get that is uniformly bounded for all values of its arguments, and the same holds for . Therefore, we proved that is bounded so that and the solution (44) is actually global. The existence and uniqueness of the classical solution of the closed-loop system (1)-(3) now follow from the invertibility of the transformation (4)-( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), which can be used to show that , have the same properties as , . We shall not belabor on well posedness issues in the rest of the paper both in the interest of space and due to the parabolic character of the systems which ensures it. As in Theorem 1, in the rest of the paper we shall simply assume well posedness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PARAMETRIC ROBUSTNESS</head><p>Let us suppose that the adaptation is turned off, i.e., , i.e.,</p><p>. Then the closed loop system is (45</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">) (46) (47)</formula><p>where is a constant parameter estimate. By studying the eigenvalue problem of this system, it can be shown that parameter estimates which are greater than are exponentially stabilizing, whereas those smaller than are destabilizing. This means that, if an upper bound on is known-let us denote this bound by -then (3) is a stabilizing linear controller whenever is replaced by (or any constant value higher than ).</p><p>This robustness property explains why in the adaptation law ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is nonnegative: overestimating cannot be harmful within the controller structure (3). 2 A caveat however is that, in the presence of measurement noise, the parameter estimate will drift. In the update law ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) the estimate has nowhere to drift but up <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> (which is consistent with the structure of the control law but still undesirable). In practical implementation one would add leakage, deadzone, or projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to reduce or completely stop the drift.</p><p>The linear/frozen-parameter robustness is an unusual feature of the control formula (3). It is different than the "infinite gain margin" property of inverse optimal controllers, which allow an arbitrary increase of a scalar gain in front of the optimal control law. Infinite gain margin allows only an unplanned increase in the "control authority" but does not guarantee robustness to changes in the physical parameters of the system. The robustness exhibited with (3) is with respect to the physical parameter .</p><p>Due to the ability of the controller (3) to remain stabilizing when is overestimated, it might be tempting to view the backstepping design as being "high-gain." This would not be appropriate because (3) resorts to high gain only when generates a high number of unstable eigenvalues in the plant.</p><p>The form of high gain that controller (3) is capable of employing should not be confused with adaptive high gain controllers surveyed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> where a multiplicative gain is tuned for a controller of the form (48) where is the gain and is an output operator such that is relative degree one. For the present system an operator independent of the unknown cannot be found, therefore, tuning of a multiplicative gain could not be successful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. ALTERNATIVE APPROACH</head><p>The use of a logarithm in the Lyapunov function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> was inspired by Praly's Lyapunov adaptation designs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We do not exactly follow that method in this paper because our PDE plants are linear. It is however of interest to see what an exact application of that method results in, as it has potential beyond our class of problems. 2 While the update law (9) can take the estimate only "up," the growth of the estimate stops as kw(t)k goes to zero. Since V (t) is nonincreasing and bounded from below (by zero), it has a limit. Hence (t) has a limit. So does (t) and it is higher than 0 =4. The size of (1) depends on the size of the initial condition u . </p><p>We have written the two update laws in a way to highlight as much as possible the parts that are similar about them. Three gains are employed, which need to satisfy the conditions , ,</p><p>. The last two conditions are related to the fact that . These conditions ensure that the denominator in the first line of (51) remains positive.</p><p>Besides its complexity, a disadvantage of the update law (51) is that it employs , i.e., it requires the measurement of the spatial derivative . Theorem 2: Suppose that the system (1)-( <ref type="formula">3</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">51</ref> The properties stated in Theorem 2 readily follow from this equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. OTHER BENCHMARK PROBLEMS</head><p>In this section we will show that our method extends beyond the basic reaction-diffusion class of parabolic PDEs. We will consider two benchmark problems-one with a boundary value appearing on the right-hand-side of the PDE model and another with a parametric uncertainty in an uncontrolled boundary condition. Both benchmark problems are unstable in the absence of feedback.</p><p>These benchmarks will expose one limitation of the 'log-Lyapunov paradigm:' in general it requires not only a restriction on the value of the adaptation gain but also the use of parameter projection. A small is the main tool for preventing destabilizing transients. Projection is only used to make the restriction on a priori verifiable.</p><p>The projection operator that would be used in implementation is defined as and and else <ref type="bibr">(56)</ref> where is the parameter estimate ( is used as a generic symbol for an unknown parameter, which will in subsequent presentation be replaced by specific parameters labeled by , , , , ), the interval is the interval within which is being kept by projection, and denotes the nominal update law.</p><p>Unfortunately, the projection operator (56) is discontinuous. This presents a problem at two levels: 1) in the analysis it is not possible to obtain classical solutions but only Filippov solutions and 2) in implementation the presence of noise may induce frequent switching of the update law. This issue is not as serious as controller switching in sliding mode control because the projection operator does not drive an actuator. Since the projection drives only the update law there would be no discontinuities in and therefore no jumps in the control action. However, obtaining classical solutions and not having to deal with Filippov solutions is a good enough reason to consider a continuous version of the projection operator where, instead of a hard switch, a boundary layer of width is introduced and and else (57</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where the update law is scaled linearly with in the boundary layer.

All of the properties in Lemma 3 except Lipschitzness also hold for the discontinuous projection (56), with . The discontinuous projection would be preferable in applications for its simplicity which does not come at the expense of control switching, and because it is a standard feature in the integrator block in Simulink. For these reasons and to avoid clutter in our further presentation, we employ (56) where projection is needed.</p><p>Now we return to our presentation of the benchmark problems.</p></div>

It should also be noted that stability can be achieved without projection, by selecting to satisfy (70) where is determined using the initial state and the initial parameter estimate . While it may be unusual to choose the adaptation gain based on the initial state , it is acceptable as a theoretical result and consistent with the Lyapunov function (65), yielding estimates on and that depend on and . However, in application one would prefer projection due to its added assurance against parameter drift. Other than the use of projection, the of the results of this section are qualitatively the same as those in Section II.

A lengthy calculation yields (71) which can be majorized by ( <ref type="formula">72</ref>) Integrating ( <ref type="formula">68</ref>) and (72) one gets boundedness of .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. DESIGN FOR SYSTEMS WITH UNKNOWN DIFFUSION</head><p>AND ADVECTION COEFFICIENTS For the sake of clarity we started in Section II with a reactiondiffusion system with only an unknown reaction coefficient. In this section we show how one can also incorporate adaptation for unknown diffusion and coefficients. Consider the system (130) <ref type="bibr">(131)</ref> where , , are unknown constants.</p><p>The control law for this system is <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> (  <ref type="formula">136</ref>), which is a bounded operator in both and . While the Lyapunov design requires the use of projection and a low adaptation gain, one of its remarkable properties is that, even though the plant has parametric uncertainties multiplying and , the adaptive scheme does not require the measurement of neither nor . The update laws (142)-(144) employ only the measurement of . This is in contrast with adaptive controllers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> for reaction-advection-diffusion systems which require the measurement of to estimate the unknown diffusion coefficient .</p><p>The update laws employ which is given in quadratures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. SIMULATION</head><p>To illustrate the designs, we present the simulation results for the plant (1)-(2) with the unknown parameter . The initial estimate is set to . The initial condition of the plant is chosen to be non-smooth to show that theorems' restriction for initial conditions to be in is not crucial. Even though the bound on the adaptation gain used in the proof of the closed loop stability is , in simulation we took so that the adaptation is not too slow. To model the realistic situation, we assume that there is an additive disturbance in the plant: zero-mean white noise (both in time and space) of intensity 3. We also assume that measurements are corrupted by noise. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref> the evolution of the parameter estimate is shown. We can see that the estimate reaches the stabilizing value and starts to drift due to the noise. To prevent the drift we use the standard robustification tool-deadzone. As can be seen from Fig.   (solid line), introducing the deadzone prevents the parameter from drifting. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref> the closed loop response is shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. CONCLUSION</head><p>The need for projection and a bound on the adaptation gain are the key limitations of the Lyapunov approach. In a companion paper on "estimation-based" approaches to adaptive control of PDEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> we present methods which do not require projection and which work without limits on the adaptation gain. These methods employ 'passivity/observer-based' and 'swapping-based' identifiers presented for finite-dimensional systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, in the case of uncertain diffusion and advection coefficients, these schemes require the measurement of (and in some cases of ), like the schemes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The Lyapunov schemes in Section IX require only the measurement of .</p><p>While, for the sake of clarity, we chose to present our design tools through benchmark problems, it is possible to develop an adaptive controller for the class of systems (167) (168) where , , , , are unknown. It is also possible to do so when these coefficients are spatially varying, as explained in Remark 3.</p><p>At present we have not worked out how to extend the result of Section IX to the output-feedback case. Even though boundary observers for this class of systems were developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for the case where , , are known, the design of adaptive observers will be more complex than for the systems in Section VIII. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> we present the estimation-based versions of the Lyapunov output-feedback designs presented here.</p><p>It is possible to extend the results of this paper to special geometries in arbitrary dimension. For example, in 3-D it is possible to extend them to domains in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped with in (167) replaced by and replaced by .
