<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach was initially developed for fluid dynamics studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Having various advantages (conceptual simplicity, efficient implementation on massively parallel computers, etc.), it has become a central simulation tool for a wide range of physics studies, from semiconductors to cosmology or accelerator physics, and in particular to plasma physics. Today, the kinetic simulation of plasmas in various environments, from the laboratory to astrophysics, strongly relies on PIC codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present the new, open-source PIC code Smilei. It has been developed in a collaborative framework including physicists and high-performance computing (HPC) experts to best benefit from the new HPC architectures.</p><p>Smilei's development was initially motivated by recent advances in ultra-high intensity (UHI) laser technology, and new projects aiming at building multi-petawatt laser facilities. UHI laser-plasma interaction has indeed been successfully applied to probing matter under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure, opening the way to various promising applications such as charged-particle (electron and ion) acceleration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, ultra-bright light sources of unprecedented short duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, or abundant electron-positron pair production <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. This wide range of applications, as well as the associated deeper understanding of fundamental processes, lead to the creation of the Centre Interdisciplinaire de la Lumière EXtrême (CILEX) 1 [12]. This academic center will host, in the forthcoming years, the laser Apollon that will deliver ultra-short (15 fs), ultra-intense (beyond 10 22 W/cm 2 ) laser pulses, corresponding to a record peak power of 10 PW. This path toward the study of light-matter interaction at extreme intensities represents a significant experimental and technological undertaking. New numerical tools have to be deployed as laser-plasma interaction, at intensities beyond 10 22 W/cm 2 , is not only relativistic but also highly nonlinear and of quantum nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, a paradigm shift has occurred in HPC. The number of cores available on massively parallel supercomputers has skyrocketed. Recent and future supercomputer architectures are also hydrid systems relying on both distributed and shared memory. This introduces challenges in workload management, resource scheduling and data structure at the algorithmic and software development levels. These tendencies are progressing quickly, and software development lags behind. Today, most of the codes used by the plasma community face difficulties when confronted with these new challenges. As a result, running today's software technology on the most recent and forthcoming machines is intractable as well as a tremendous waste of resources and electric power. These limitations are inherent to the internal structure of the codes, and can be overcome only through a strong collaboration between physicists and HPC specialists, to build, from the ground up, a new HPC-relevant simulation.</p><p>In this context, in early 2013, a consortium of laboratories of the Plateau de Saclay decided to join their efforts in developing the new PIC code Smilei (for Simulating Matter Irradiated by Light at Extreme Intensities). Intended as a multi-purpose and collaborative PIC code, Smilei addresses a wide range of physics problems, from laserplasma interaction to astrophysics. This paper presents an overview of the code's principles, structure, performance and capabilities, as well as benchmarks and examples. Section 2 reviews the general PIC approach for simulating collisionless plasmas (the governing equations, and the associated numerical methods), and specifies the algorithms used in Smilei. The C++ object-oriented programming and polymorphism, highlighted in Sec. 3, illustrates the multi-purpose, multi-physics and multi-geometry aspects of the code and its modularity and maintainability. We outline Smilei's components, their interactions and the I/O management strategy. Section 4 then presents the innovative parallelization strategy devised for Smilei. In particular, the hybrid MPI-OpenMP (for synchronization in between distributed and shared memory processes) and dynamic load balancing designs are built around "patches", which extend the notion of domain decomposition and improve data locality for faster memory access and efficient cache use. The code performance on massively-parallel super-computers is then discussed. The following Sec. 5 describes additional modules (binary collisions, ionization, etc.), and Sec. 6 explains the input interface and the output diagnostics. Section 7 features applications to different physical scenarii, the first two related to UHI laser-plasma interaction and the other two to astrophysics. Finally, Sec. 8 concludes on Smilei capabilities and perspectives.</p><p>2. The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for collisionless plasmas</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Maxwell-Vlasov model</head><p>The kinetic description of a collisionless plasma 2 relies on the Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations. In this description, the different species of particles constituting the plasma are described by their respective distribution functions f s (t, x, p), where s denotes a given species consisting of particles with charge q s and mass m s , and x and p denote the position and momentum of a phase-space element. The distribution f s satisfies Vlasov's equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂ t + p m s γ • ∇ + F L • ∇ p f s = 0 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where γ = 1 + p 2 /(m s c) 2 is the (relativistic) Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light in vacuum, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F L = q s (E + v × B)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>is the Lorentz force acting on a particle with velocity v = p/(m s γ). This force follows from the existence, in the plasma, of collective electric [E(t, x)] and magnetic [B(t, x)] fields satisfying Maxwell's equations 3 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∇ • B = 0 , (3a) ∇ • E = ρ/ 0 ,<label>(3b)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">∇ × B = µ 0 J + µ 0 0 ∂ t E , (3c) ∇ × E = -∂ t B ,<label>(3d)</label></formula><p>where 0 and µ 0 are the vacuum permittivity and permeability, respectively. The Vlasov-Maxwell system of Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) -( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) describes the self-consistent dynamics of the plasma which constituents are subject to the Lorentz force, and in turn modify the collective electric and magnetic fields through their charge and current densities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ρ(t, x) = s q s d 3 pf s (t, x, p) ,<label>(4a)</label></formula><p>J(t, x) = s q s d 3 p vf s (t, x, p) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Reference units</head><p>Smilei is a fully-relativistic electromagnetic PIC code. As such, it is convenient to normalize all velocities in the code to c. Furthermore, charges and masses are normalized to e and m e , respectively, with -e the electron charge and m e its mass. Momenta and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: List of the most common normalizations used in Smilei. The value of ωr is not defined a priori, but can be set a posteriori as a scaling factor. For simulations requiring the use of ionization and/or collision modules (see Sec. 5), ωr needs to be defined, in SI units, by the user.</p><p>energies (and by extension temperatures) are then expressed in units of m e c and m e c 2 , respectively.</p><p>The normalization for time and space is not decided a priori. Instead, all the simulation results may be scaled by an arbitrary factor. Denoting the (a priori unknown) time units by ω -1 r , distances are normalized to c/ω r . Electric and magnetic fields are expressed in units of m e c ω r /e and m e ω r /e, respectively. We define the units for number densities as n r = 0 m e ω 2 r /e 2 , while charge and current densities are in units of e n r and e c n r , respectively. Note that this definition of n r is chosen for best simplification of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, but does not correspond to the reference distance c/ω r to the power of -3.</p><p>Let us now illustrate by two simple examples this choice of normalization. When dealing with a plasma at constant density n e , it is convenient to normalize times by introducing the electron plasma frequency ω pe = e 2 n e /( 0 m e ). Choosing ω r = ω pe , distances are now expressed in units of the electron skin-depth c/ω pe , while number densities are normalized to n e , and the electric and magnetic fields are in units of m e ω pe c/e and m e ω pe /e, respectively.</p><p>In contrast, when considering the irradiation of a plasma by a laser with angular frequency ω 0 , it is convenient to use ω r = ω 0 . From this choice, it follows that distances are measured in units of k -1 0 = c/ω 0 , while the electric and magnetic fields are in units of E c = m e cω 0 /e and m e ω 0 /e, respectively. Note that E c is the Compton field, which is widely used to measure the importance of relativistic effects in laser-plasma interaction. In addition, number densities are expressed in units of n c = 0 m e ω 2 0 /e 2 , the well-known critical density delimiting plasmas that are transparent or opaque to an electromagnetic radiation with angular frequency ω 0 .</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> gives a list of the most common normalizations used in Smilei. In what follows (and if not specified otherwise), all quantities will be expressed in normalized units.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Quasi-particles and the PIC method</head><p>The "Particle-In-Cell" method owes its name to the discretization of the distribution function f s as a sum of N s "quasi-particles" (also referred to as "super-particles" or "macro-particles"):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f s (t, x, p) = Ns p=1 w p S x -x p (t) δ p -p p (t) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where w p is a quasi-particle "weight", x p is its position, p p is its momentum, δ is the Dirac distribution, and S(x) is the shape-function of all quasi-particles. The properties of the shape-function used in Smilei are given in Appendix A.</p><p>In PIC codes, Vlasov's Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is integrated along the continuous trajectories of these quasi-particles, while Maxwell's Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) are solved on a discrete spatial grid, the spaces between consecutive grid points being referred to as "cells". Injecting the discrete distribution function of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) in Vlasov's Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), multiplying the result by p and integrating over all p leads to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Ns p=1 w p p p • ∂ xp S(x -x p ) + ∂ x S(x -x p ) v p + Ns p=1 w p S(x -x p ) [∂ t p p -q s (E + v p × B)] = 0 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where we have introduced v p = p p /(m s γ p ) = dx p /dt the p th quasi-particle velocity, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">γ p = 1 + p 2 p /(m<label>2</label></formula><p>s ) its Lorentz factor. Considering all p quasi-particles independently, and integrating over all (real) space x, the first term in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) vanishes due to the properties of the shape-function (see Appendix A) and one obtains that all quasi-particles satisfy the relativistic equations of motion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">dx p dt = u p γ p (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">du p dt = r s E p + u p γ p × B p ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where we have introduced r s = q s /m s the charge-over-mass ratio (for species s), u p = p p /m s the quasi-particle reduced momentum, and the fields interpolated at the particle position:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">E p = dx S(x -x p ) E(x) ,<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">B p = dx S(x -x p ) B(x) .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Note that, because of the finite (non-zero) spatial extension of the quasi-particles (also referred to as quasi-particle size, Appendix A), additional cells (called ghost cells, see Sec. 4) have to be added at the border of the simulation domain to ensure that the full x y z j y (j + 1) y</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(k + 1) z k z i x (i + 1) x E y , J y E z , J z E x , J x B z B x B y ⇢ Figure 1:</formula><p>Representation of the staggered Yee-grid.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Time-and space-centered discretization</head><p>As will be discussed in Sec. 2.6.4, Maxwell's equations are solved here using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> as well as refined methods based on this algorithm (for a review of these methods see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). In these methods, the electromagnetic fields are discretized onto a staggered grid, the Yee-grid, that allows for spatial-centering of the discretized curl operators in Maxwell's Eqs. (3c) and (3d). Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> summarizes at which points of the Yee-grid the electromagnetic fields, as well as charge and density currents, are defined. Similarly, the time-centering of the time-derivative in Maxwell's Eqs. (3c) and (3d) is ensured by considering the electric fields as defined at integer timesteps (n) and magnetic fields at half-integer time-steps (n + 1  2 ). Time-centering of the magnetic fields is however necessary for diagnostic purposes, and most importantly when computing the Lorentz force acting on the quasi-particles. It should also be noted, as will be discussed in Sec. 2.6.2, that a leap-frog scheme is used to advance the particles in time, so that their positions and velocities are defined at integer (n) and half-integer (n - 1  2 ) time-steps, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">The PIC loop</head><p>At the end of the initialization stage [time-step (n = 0)], all quasi-particles in the simulation have been loaded and the electromagnetic fields have been computed over the whole simulation grid. The PIC loop is then started over N time-steps each consisting in (i) interpolating the electromagnetic fields at the particle positions, (ii) computing the new particle velocities and positions, (iii) projecting the new charge and current densities on the grid, and (iv) computing the new electromagnetic fields on the grid. In this section, we describe these four steps taken to advance from time-step (n) to time-step (n+1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1.">Field interpolation at the particle</head><p>At the beginning of time-step (n), the particles velocities and positions are known at time-step (n - 1  2 ) and (n), respectively. For each particle p, the electromagnetic fields [at time-step (n)] are computed at the particle position using a simple interpolation technique:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">E (n) p = dx S x -x (n) p E (n) (x) ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">B (n) p = dx S x -x (n) p B (n) (x) ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where we have used the time-centered magnetic fields</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">B (n) = 1 2 [B (n+1/2) + B (n-1/2)</formula><p>].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2.">Particle pusher</head><p>Knowing, for each quasi-particle, the electromagnetic fields at its position, the new particle momentum and position are computed using a (second order) leap-frog integrator. In Smilei, two different schemes have been implemented, the well-known Boris pusher <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and the one developed by J.-L. Vay <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Both schemes compute the new particle momentum according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">u (n+ 1 2 ) p = u (n- 1 2 ) p + r s ∆t   E (n) p + v (n+ 1 2 ) p + v (n- 1 2 ) p 2 × B (n) p   ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>as well as the new particle position:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">x (n+1) p = x (n) p + ∆t u (n+ 1 2 ) p γ p ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where ∆t denotes the duration of a time-step. The Boris pusher is a widely-used second-order leap-frog solver. However, Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> shows that it introduces errors when calculating the orbits of relativistic particles in special electromagnetic field configurations (e.g. when the electric and magnetic contributions cancel each other in the Lorentz force). Vay's solver proposes an alternative formulation of the leap-frog solver that prevents such problems with an additional (albeit not large) computational cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.3.">Charge conserving current deposition</head><p>Charge deposition (i.e. charge and current density projection onto the grid) is then performed using the charge-conserving algorithm proposed by Esirkepov <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The current densities in the dimensions of the grid (i.e., the x-direction for 1-dimensional simulations, both x-and y-directions for 2-dimensional simulations, and all three x-, y-and z-directions for 3-dimensional simulations) are computed from the charge flux through the cell borders (hence ensuring charge conservation) while the current densities along the other dimensions are performed using a simple projection. To illustrate this point, we take the example of current deposition in a 2-dimensional simulation. The current densities in the x-and y-directions associated to a particle with charge q are computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">(J x,p ) (n+ 1 2 ) i+ 1 2 ,j = (J x,p ) (n+ 1 2 ) i- 1 2 ,j + q w p ∆x ∆t (W x ) (n+ 1 2 ) i+ 1 2 ,j<label>(17)</label></formula><p>(J y,p )</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">(n+ 1 2 ) i,j+<label>1 2</label></formula><p>= (J y,p )</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">(n+ 1 2 ) i,j-<label>1 2</label></formula><p>+ q w p ∆y ∆t (W y )</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">(n+ 1 2 ) j,i+<label>1 2 (18)</label></formula><p>where (W x ) (n+ 1 2 ) and (W y ) (n+ 1 2 ) are computed from the particle present and former positions x (n+1) p and x (n) p , respectively, using the method developed by Esirkepov. The particle current in the z-direction (not a dimension of the grid) is, in this geometry, computed using the direct projection technique described in Appendix A:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">(J z,p ) i,j = qw r v p dx S(x -x p ) P D (x -x i,j ) . (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>The charge density deposited by the particle can be obtained, if required e.g. for diagnostic purpose, using a similar direct projection. The total charge and current densities henceforth gather the contributions of all quasiparticles of all species. It is worth noting that, within a charge-conserving framework, charge densities are only projected on the grid for diagnostics purposes (as we will see in next paragraph, it is not used to advance the electromagnetic fields).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.4.">Maxwell solvers</head><p>Now that the currents are known at time-step (n + 1 2 ), the electromagnetic fields can be advanced solving Maxwell's Eqs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.

(3c) and (3d) is sufficient to get a complete description of the new electromagnetic fields. Indeed, it can be shown that this conserves a divergence-free magnetic field if Gauss' Eq. (3a) is satisfied at time t = 0. Similarly, Poisson's Eq. (3b) is verified as long as it is satisfied at time t = 0 as long as the charge deposition algorithm fulfills the charge conservation equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">∂ t ρ + ∇ • J = 0 (22)</formula><p>This motivated the use of Esirkepov's projection scheme discussed in the previous paragraph.</p><p>We conclude this Section by discussing in more details the discretization of the curloperators in Eqs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.5.">Boundary conditions</head><p>After having computed new quasi-particle positions and velocities, boundary conditions (BCs) are applied to each quasi-particle that may be located in a ghost cell, i.e. outside of the 'real' grid. Quasi-particle species may have a different BC for each boundary of the simulation box: the quasi-particles can either loop around the box (periodic), be stopped (momentum set to zero), suppressed (removed from memory), reflected (momentum and position follow specular reflection rules) or thermalized. In the latter case, the quasi-particle is set back inside the simulation box, and its new momentum is randomly sampled in a Maxwellian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> with a given temperature and drift velocity, both specified by the user.</p><p>BCs are applied to the electromagnetic fields after Maxwell's equations have been solved. Each boundary of the simulation box can feature a different BC.

In contrast, the reflective electromagnetic BC will reflect any outgoing electromagnetic wave reaching the simulation boundary. Lastly, periodic BCs are also available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">An evolutive, multi-purpose code</head><p>Smilei's objectives are high performances, a large user community and support for a variety of applications. Its C++ approach reflects these goals, providing structure to separate physics from computing aspects, to encourage their progress, to facilitate their maintainability and to ensure a multi-purpose capability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">C++ elements and flow</head><p>Smilei's core program is written in the C++ language. Its multi-purpose and mature technology ensures great flexibility and strong support for the new HPC machines. Moreover, C++'s object-oriented programming provides an efficient way of structuring the code. Importantly, this eliminates a few bad habits such as passing large lists of parameters through functions, or usage of global variables, inefficient in parallel computing. Components can be constructed almost independently. It offers a good separation between the purely computing/performance aspects and the physics calculations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the various elements of Smilei's main code: C++ classes, data structure, and the program flow. The main classes, namely "particle species" and "electromagnetics", are the counterparts of particle and cell in Particle-in-cell, respectively. The particle species class hold the particle object, which is the data structure for the quasiparticles positions and momenta. It also contains operators on the quasi-particles such as the boundary conditions and the pusher. On the other side, the electromagnetics class contains the fields, i.e. the data structure for the electric and magnetic fields. Note that these fields also describe the charge and current densities projected onto the grid. Electromagnetics also includes operators such as the Maxwell solver and the boundary conditions for the fields.</p><p>Two additional operators are external to those structures because they operate between particles and fields. The interpolator takes the field data and interpolates it at the particles positions. The projector takes the particle data and projects it at the grid points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Polymorphism</head><p>The C++ language supports the definition of polymorphic classes. These classes contain functions, called virtual functions, that are selected at runtime among several options. In other words, the behavior of an object is not decided a priori, but may be defined during the simulation.</p><p>Smilei relies on C++ polymorphism to handle its multi-purpose ambition. For instance, the basic polymorphic Field class may be derived into different classes such as Field1D, Field2D, etc. All these derived classes inherit their functions from the base class, but they include different data structures. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, examples of polymorphic (virtual) classes are highlighted. Note that, in Smilei, selecting the class from which each object will be created is ensured by a "factory design pattern".</p><p>There are several advantages to polymorphism. First, it allows for straightforward inheritance of properties between objects of similar structures. It also improves the readability of the code by removing the complexity of all the multi-purpose capabilities from the program flow. Lastly, it standardizes the form of the objects for easier maintenance. In these conditions, a single executable file can perform simulations in various dimensions, interpolation orders, or physics components, without the complexity of many code versions.</p><p>However, an excess of virtualization, or a large number of objects layers could have a significant computational cost. For instance, the use of a virtual method to access a single data element (e.g., a single particle property) would have an unacceptable data access overhead. This pitfall is avoided by passing the whole data structures to computational operators. They are passed in their virtual form, then cast to the required class by the operator itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Uncoupling operators from data</head><p>An other fundamental ambition of the project is to provide an efficient tool of simulation on current and future supercomputers whose architectures are in permanent evolution. For instance, they may have complex memory hierarchy, whether distributed or shared between several processors. For ideal performances, the code must be adapted to these specific architectures. Besides this multi-machine aspect, a multi-purpose code (able to simulate various physical scenarii) may require a different optimization strategy depending on the subject of each simulation.</p><p>For these two challenges, Smilei's solution is based on its object-oriented design: it consists in uncoupling the computing algorithms from the data formalism. In all operators (solvers, interpolators, projectors, etc.), algorithms do not rely on raw data but on wrappers (Field and Particles) which encapsulate and provide access to the data. Operators can thus be defined independently from the chosen data structure, provided the "protocol" for accessing to the data is respected. As a consequence, performances can be optimized separately in operators and in the data structures.</p><p>Along the same principle, parallelism management tends to be decoupled from the physics calculations by implementing different levels of parallelism, as detailed in Sec. 4.2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">HDF5 data management</head><p>A significant amount of output data is generated by PIC simulations. We examine here the representation of these data, focusing on the data access convenience and performances on a large super-computer.</p><p>Classical output management would simply consist in gathering data on a "master" processor which writes everything out, or in generating one file for each processor. The former technique is limited by the cost of communicating data and its memory overhead, while the latter requires heavy post-processing. In both cases, the larger the simulation, the more expensive the overhead.</p><p>Parallel I/O libraries are optimized to avoid these pitfalls, and their development continuously improves their performances. They can share and write data in parallel to a single file. Famous examples are MPI-IO<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref> , HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref> ) and NetCDF (Network Common Data Form<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">8</ref> ). Although no parallel I/O library is yet fully optimized for the most recent parallelism techniques, they greatly enhance the simulations efficiency.</p><p>MPI-IO has demonstrated good performances, but it generates unformatted data, thus requiring an additional effort from the user to access and analyse the simulation data. In contrast, both HDF5 and NetCDF rely on a structured data model, which is also opensource and widely used. HDF5 also benefits from a large panel of open-source software for post-processing and visualization. To sustain the required level of performance while maintaining its user-friendly and open-source approach Smilei currently uses HDF5.</p><p>During preliminary studies done for the IDRIS Grand Challenge (see in Sec. 7.2), Smilei achieved a write bandwidth of 2.6 Gb/s on the Turing (BlueGene/Q) GPFS file system. The simulation domain consisted in a grid of size 30720 x 15360 cells, and 18 fields were written every 1755 timesteps (for a total of 135000 timesteps). The amount of 60 Gb of data was written in 24 seconds for each of the selected timesteps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Parallelization</head><p>As high-performance computing (HPC) systems are evolving towards the exascale, there is an admitted risk that today's algorithms and softwares will be subpar, at best, for the upcoming architectures. Manufacturers have been unable to improve the existing "standard" microprocessor technologies for the last decade. Instead, the trend is oriented towards the multiplication of the number of computing units by several orders of magnitude. This is achieved either using co-processors or massively multi-core processors. In order to face this emerging complexity, codes must expose a tremendous amount of parallelism while conserving data locality and minimizing load imbalance. In this Section, we first present the overall parallelization strategy chosen for Smilei, and follow with accurate descriptions of its elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Strategy</head><p>For the sake of generality, all fundamental computing items (cores, MPI processes, openMP threads, cuda threads, openCL work items, etc.) will be referred to as computing elements (CE) in this subsection.</p><p>The difficulty in parallelizing a PIC code lies in the coupling between the grid and particle aspects of the code. In a typical run, most of the load is carried by the particles. It is therefore very tempting to distribute particles equally between CEs: benefits would be huge. First, simplicity. No particle communications are required because particles only interact with fields and are independent from each other. Second, an almost perfect load balance is maintained at all times. The drawback of this approach is that it implies that all CEs have access to a shared global array of grid quantities (fields and currents). These accesses must be synchronized and require frequent global communications which, in practice, prevent any form of scalability above a couple hundreds of CEs.</p><p>A purely particle-based decomposition being impossible, we must apply a grid-based decomposition technique. Domain decomposition is the technique used in all state-ofthe-art PIC codes such as Osiris <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> or Calder-Circ <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> in laser-plasma interaction or Photon-Plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> in astrophysics.</p><p>It has shown very good scalability but comes with a cost. As most of the computational load is carried by particles, having a grid-based decomposition is inconvenient. Its efficient implementation is more involved, and load balance is very difficult to achieve. The biggest issue is that particles are volatile objects traveling throughout the entire domain, forcing (i) communications between CEs when particles cross their local domain boundary, and (ii) random access to the grid at every interpolation and projection phases. Communications are limited to neighbor domains and are not a fundamental threat to performance or scalability. In contrast, the randomness of the particle positions is much more problematic. Random access to the grid arrays breaks the principle of data locality paramount to the performance via a good cache use. Conversely, a proper access to the data avoids multiple load operations when the same data is used several times. And on top of that, if the access is well organized, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) operations can be executed thus accelerating the computation by a significant amount.</p><p>Most of the time, this issue is addressed by sorting particles. Different kind of algorithms can ensure that particles close to each other in space are also well clustered in memory. Particles can be sorted at the cell level by a full count-sort algorithm every now and then during the simulation, or they can be subject to a more lax but more frequent sorting as proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. Note that the domain decomposition technique is already a form of sorting. Particles of a given sub-domain are naturally stored in a compact array of memory and attached to the grid portion they can interact with. If each sub-domain is sufficiently small to fit in the cache, very good performances can be achieved. This approach was suggested in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31]</ref> and is the one used in Smilei. It consists in a very fine-grain domain decomposition referred to as "patch-based" decomposition where patches denote the very small sub-domains. In addition, Smilei still performs a very lightweight particle sorting within the patches, as in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>, in order to minimize cache misses. It brings a convenient flexibility in the patches size without loss of performances as quasi-particles remain well sorted even if the patches are large.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Patches distribution between MPI processes</head><p>The first layer of parallelism in Smilei is similar to the standard domain decomposition: the simulation box is divided into sub-domains that can be treated in parallel. In a standard "traditional" MPI approach, each MPI process handles one sub-domain. But in Smilei, the simulation box is divided into many more sub-domains than there are MPI processes. They are called "patches" specifically to make this distinction: each MPI process handles many patches. Note that the content of a patch is not different than that of a sub-domain: particles and a portion of the grid.</p><p>The obvious cost of this fine-grain domain decomposition is an additional, but necessary, synchronization between patches. Synchronization between patches belonging to the same MPI process is very cheap. It consists in a simple copy of a relatively small amount of ghost cells and exchange of particles in a shared memory system. Synchronization becomes more expensive when it occurs between patches belonging to different MPI processes. In that case, data has to be exchanged through the network between distributed memory systems via costly calls to the MPI library. In order to limit this cost, we need a distribution policy of the patches between the different MPI processes which minimizes MPI calls. This is achieved by grouping patches in compact clusters that reduce the interface between MPI sub-domains as much as possible. In addition, this policy must be flexible enough to support an arbitrary number of MPI processes and varying number of patches per process. In order to satisfy both compactness and flexibility, patches are ordered along a Hilbert space-filling curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. An example of the Hilbert curve is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. This curve is divided into as many segments as MPI processes and each process handles one of these segments. The mathematical properties of the Hilbert curve guarantee that these segments form compact clusters of patches in space (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) independently of their number or length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">OpenMP parallelization and load balancing</head><p>Patch-based decomposition, in addition to its cache efficiency, is a very convenient way to expose a lot of local (inside MPI sub-domains) parallelism. Each patch being independent, they can be easily treated in parallel by the threads owned by the MPI process. Without this structure, the projection of particles might result in race conditions (threads overwriting each other's computation) and would require costly atomic operations.</p><p>In Smilei, patches are treated by openMP threads. In practice, this allows the user to start the simulation with less (but larger) MPI domains than in a pure MPI implementation. A similar level of computational performance is retained while decreasing the global amount of communications. The number of macro-particles per patch may differ significantly and so does the computational load associated to each patch. The use of the openMP dynamic scheduler therefore provides local load balancing at a reasonable cost. If a thread is busy treating a patch with a lot of macro-particles, other threads will be able to handle the remaining lighter patches thus avoiding idle time (see performance results in Sec. 4.3.2 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>Patches also act as sorting structures. Indeed, quasi-particles of a given patch only interact with this patch's local grid. Small patches therefore provide a finer-grain load balancing and optimized cache use at the cost of more inter-patch synchronization. This cost is assessed in Sec. 4.3.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Load management</head><p>The objective of load management is to harmonize the computational workload between CEs as homogeneously as possible, in order to avoid idle, underloaded CEs waiting for overloaded CEs. In Smilei, the load is dynamically balanced. Note that load balancing is not the only approach for load management: it can also involve load-limiting techniques such as the k-means particle-merging algorithm implemented in Photon-Plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>.</p><p>We have seen in Sec. 4.2.2 that openMP already provides some amount of load balancing at the node level, but it doesn't help managing the load between MPI processes. Smilei balances the load between MPI processes by exchanging patches (defined in Sec. 4.2.1). This technique is efficient because a single patch workload is much smaller than the total workload of a process. The patch size defines the balance grain and the smaller the patches the smoother the balance.</p><p>This is yet another argument in favour of using patches as small as possible. At this point, it becomes interesting to understand what limits the patch size. The minimum size of a patch is dictated by the number of ghost cells used. We consider reasonable that a patch must have more cells than ghost cells. The number of ghost cells is defined by the order of Maxwell's equations discretization scheme, and by the shape function of the macro-particles. A standard second-order Yee scheme, for instance, uses 4 ghost cells per dimension (2 on each side). The minimum patch size in that case is therefore 5 cells per dimension. This criteria also guarantees that ghost cells from non-neighbour patches do not overlap, which is convenient for the synchronization phases. The influence of the patch size is illustrated in Sec. 4.3.</p><p>We have seen in Sec. 4.2.1 that patches are organized along a Hilbert space-filling curve divided into as many segments of similar length as there are MPI processes. Each process handles the patches located in its segment of the Hilbert curve. Dynamically balancing the load simply consists in exchanging patches between neighbour MPI processes along the curve. That is to lengthen or shorten the segments depending on how loaded they are. When an MPI process is overloaded, it sends patches to its neighbours along the Hilbert curve; therefore its segment becomes shorter. Inversely, an underloaded process will receive patches from its neighbours; its segment becomes longer.</p><p>The following describes the dynamic load-balancing algorithm (it is summarized in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). First, the computational load P [p] of each patch p is evaluated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">P [p] = N part + C cell × N cells + C frozen × N frozen (<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_46">)</formula><p>where N part is the number of active particles in the patch, N cells is the number of cells in the patch, N frozen is the number of frozen (immobile) particles in the patch, and C cell and C frozen are user-defined coefficients representing the computational cost of cells (mostly solving Maxwell equation) and frozen particles. In most cases, the active particles are the major source of computational load. By default Smilei uses C cell = 1 and C frozen = 0.1. The total computational load of MPI rank r is L[r] = Σ p P [p] (sum over all the patches owned by r) and the total computational load of the simulation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">L tot = Σ r L[r].</formula><p>The optimal computational load per process L opt = L tot /N MPI , where N MPI is the number of MPI processes. The balancing algorithm proceeds to a new decomposition of the Hilbert curve so that each segment carries a load as close to L opt as possible. This balancing process is typically done every 20 iterations in order to follow the dynamics of the simulation. Frequent and small corrections give superior performance than rare and dramatic adjustments (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). The three global communications required involve only a single number by MPI rank thus minimizing the total volume of data exchanged and memory occupation. Sharing the details of the computational load of each patch is needed only between two consecutive MPI ranks and is done via local communications. The amplitude of the readjustment is limited: each MPI process keeps at least one of its original patches. This reduces the performance impact of strong, high-frequency, oscillatory variations of the load observed in some cases. Once the segments are defined, the actual exchange of data is done.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">MPI</head><p>We study here the case of an MPI-only parallelization. The series of simulations presented here were performed on the CINES/Occigen system (Bull) and focused a physics study devoted to Brillouin amplification of short laser pulses (see Sec. 7.2), for which the plasma remains rather homogeneous throughout the simulation. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> displays Smilei's strong scaling for a pure MPI parallelization. The same simulation is run on different number of cores and a single MPI process is attached to each core. As the number of cores increases, the size of the data handled by each core, or "domain size", decreases because the global domain is divided between all cores. The efficiency remains close to 100% as long as the domain size remains larger or equal to the L1 cache size. For the specific global domain size used in this test, this occurs around 20,000 cores. As the domain size approaches the L1 size, an improved cache-use slightly improves the performances. Using a larger number of MPI processes then decreases the efficiency as the domain size becomes significantly smaller than the cache. At this point, the system computing units occupation is too small to deliver proper performances, and the cost of additional MPI communications starts being significant. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates the fact that the pure MPI decomposition performs well in Smilei up to the optimal (for this given Table <ref type="table">3</ref>: Load balancing algorithm used in Smilei. After initialization, a segment of patches along the space filling curve is attributed to each MPI rank.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">MPI + openMP</head><p>In this section we present the performances achieved with the hybrid MPI+openMP parallelization described in section 4.2, when the plasma does not remain homogeneous.</p><p>The case study is now, and until the end of the section, an ultra-high-intensity laser propagating in a plasma. It is a typical laser wakefield acceleration case, well known for being strongly impacted by load imbalance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. It is a two-dimensional simulation consisting of 1024×128 patches (except in section 4.3.5 where this parameter varies), each having 8 × 5 cells and 196 particles per cell. The global box size is therefore 8192 × 640 cells for a total of more than a billion particles. The plasma is homogeneous with a density of 4.94 × 10 -4 n c , where n c is the critical density. The laser has both transverse and longitudinal Gaussian profiles and its strength parameter is a 0 = 8. The scale of the simulation is based on the laser's inverse wavenumber [k -1 0 = λ 0 /(2π), see Sec. 2.2]. For laser wakefield electron acceleration, a standard value for the laser wavelength is λ 0 = 0.8 µm. In that case, the electron number density is 8.6 × 10 17 cm -3 , the waist is w 0 = 18 µm and the pulse full width half-maximum is τ 0 = 35.3 fs. The longitudinal cell size is ∆x = 0.125/k 0 and the transverse cell size is ∆y = 1.5/k 0 . The timestep is ∆t = 0.124/ω 0 , where ω 0 = ck 0 is the laser angular frequency.</p><p>Each run ran on 32 nodes of the OCCIGEN system. This represents 64 processors of 12 cores each for a total of 768 cores. The plasma is initially homogeneous but load imbalance gradually builds up, then rises quickly after 6000 iterations before stabilizing.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows the evolution of the wall-clock time necessary to complete 100 iterations as a function of the number of iterations already completed for different numerical settings. The runs only differ by the number of openMP threads per MPI process and total number of MPI processes. The total number of threads is kept constant and equal to 768 in order to have 1 thread per core. The openMP dynamic scheduler is used in all cases.</p><p>Several interesting features can be noticed on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. First, as long as the plasma is relatively homogeneous (first 1000 iterations), all runs perform similarly. It means that the overhead for having a hybrid parallelization is negligible in this situation. Later in the simulation, the pure-MPI case shows an extreme sensitivity to the load imbalance. The wall-clock time spent to perform 100 iterations is almost multiplied by 20 with respect to the initial homogeneous plasma. Cases using more than one openMP thread per MPI process are much less sensitive to this effect. And the more threads per MPI process, the smoother the performances. This is perfectly in line with the local load balancing analysis given in section 4.2.2. Nevertheless, even in the best case 64 × 12, a performance loss of a factor superior to 4 is still impacting the simulation. This is explained by the fact that openMP can only balance the load within a given MPI domain. Imbalance across MPI domains will keep slowing the simulation down.</p><p>Using more openMP threads, or equivalently more cores, per MPI process allows the use of larger MPI domains and therefore provides a better load balancing. But the number of openMP threads is limited to the number of cores accessible on the shared memory system. In our case, this is a single OCCIGEN node made of two processors of 12 cores each so up to 24 openMP threads could be used. But going from 12 to 24 openMP threads per MPI process results in a drop of the performances because of the synchronization required between the two processors of the node. The best performances are achieved when a single MPI process is given to each processor and when all cores of the processor are managed by the openMP scheduler. The quality of the load balancing via the openMP dynamic scheduler thus directly depends on the size (in number of cores) of the processors composing the nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">MPI + openMP + dynamic load balancing</head><p>This section presents results obtained with the dynamic load balancing (DLB) algorithm described in section 4.2.3. With DLB activated, the MPI domains are now capable of exchanging patches and therefore their shape evolves with respect to the computational load distribution. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> shows this distribution and the corresponding evolution of the shape of the MPI domains. As expected, they tend to become smaller in areas where the computational load is high and, reversly, larger where the patches are underloaded. The least loaded patches have approximately 1% of the average patch load. These under loaded patches are empty of particles and their computational load is limited to solving the maxwell equations. On the opposite, the most loaded patches have almost 100 times as much computational load as the average and their load is completely dominated by particles. Note that the computational load map looks very much like the density map for the simple reason that the computational load is mostly carried by the macro-particles as in most PIC simulations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows a performance comparison between the two best cases obtained in the previous section (without DLB) and the same cases with DLB activated.</p><p>The balancing here is done every 20 iterations and C cell = 2. No difference is observed during the balanced stage of the run (first 1000 iterations). As expected, the cost of the balancing is negligible when actual balancing is not required. In the imbalanced stage of  the run, DLB provides an additional gain of almost 40% with respect to the previous best case "64×12". A side benefit is also to reduce the dependency on the large number of openMP threads. Indeed, it appears that almost similar results are obtained with only 6 openMP threads when DLB is active. As DLB balances the load between MPI processes, the local balancing via openMP becomes much less critical than before. Note that the openMP parallelization remains necessary for an efficient fine grain balancing but it can be achieved with only a limited number of threads thus removing the dependency on a large shared memory hardware.</p><p>Note also that the cost of the imbalance is still significant in spite of all the efforts to balance the load. The additional cost is mainly due to the imbalance of the particles communication cost which is not as well balanced as the computational cost of particles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Balancing frequency</head><p>The load is balanced every N b iterations. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows the influence of this parameter. As expected, as N b decreases, the load balance gets more accurate and the performances increase. A more frequent balancing also means smaller adjustments each time. Consequently, the overhead of load balancing remains low, even for low N b . The cost of load balancing has a negative impact on performances only when N b is much lower than the number of iterations over which imbalance builds up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.5.">Number of patches</head><p>The number of patches is an important parameter. It influences the quality of both the openMP implementation and DLB. A large number of patches allows for finer-grain openMP parallelization and DLB, but also implies more ghost cells and synchronization costs.  Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> shows several interesting features. First, while imbalance is weak (between iterations 2000 and 6000), having more patches noticeably costs additional synchronization. The cost of particles dynamics far outweighs the cost of synchronization, but this overhead is measurable. On the other hand, in the second stage of the simulation where a strong imbalance kicks in (after iteration 6000), having smaller and more numerous patches is clearly beneficial.</p><p>Another interesting result comes from the comparison between the 256 × 64 and 128 × 128 cases. Despite an equal number of patches, much better performances are achieved in the latter topology. This can be explained by the way the Hilbert curve is generated. The case of a "square" topology (N x = N y , N x being a power of 2) corresponds to the usual Hilbert curve. If the number of patches is larger in one direction, the Hilbert curve is generated over a square of the smaller dimension's size, then repeated along the longer dimension. The constraint on N x and N y being powers of 2 remains but they can be different. The cost of this generalization is that the resulting space-filling curve loses some of its compactness. This translates into additional synchronization cost.</p></div>

Both benchmarks consist in irradiating a thin (one cell long) neutral material (hydrogen or carbon) with a short (few optical-cycle long) laser with wavelength λ 0 = 0.8 µm.</p><p>In the first benchmark, featuring hydrogen, the laser intensity is kept constant at I L = 10 14 W/cm 2 , corresponding to a normalized vector potential a 0 6.81 × 10 -3 , over 10 optical cycles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Binary collisions</head><p>As detailed in Sec. 2, the PIC method aims at describing the self-consistent evolution of a collisionless plasma by solving the coupled system of Vlasov-Maxwell Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) -(3). Consequently, PIC codes must introduce additional modules to account for collisions. In Smilei, the effects of relativistic collisions have been implemented following the scheme described in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. It is based on Nanbu's approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>, with the addition of a few enhancements: relativistic particles, low-temperature correction to the collision rate, and variable Coulomb logarithm. We briefly review this scheme here and illustrate it with typical applications.</p><p>Nanbu's theory first considers real particles, assuming that collisions occur many times during one time-step, and that each collision introduces a deflection angle θ 1 (although the total deflection angle may be large). By simulating a large number of Coulomb collisions, he finds that the total deflection angle χ is well described by a unique function of s = θ 2 N/2, where θ 2 is the expectation of θ 2 and N is the number of collisions during one time-step (N 1). He also provides a probability density function f (χ) to pick randomly the deflection angle χ accumulated during one time-step. Colliding each quasi-particle with all other quasi-particles nearby would be timeconsuming. Instead, quasi-particles are randomly paired so that each collides with only one other quasi-particle at a given time-step. After many time-steps, each of them will have sampled the overall distribution of target particles. This pairing follows Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. It is split in two cases: intra-collisions, when a group of particles collides with itself, and inter-collisions, when two distinct groups of particles collide. Intra-collisions can occur, for example, within all the electrons in the plasma. In this case, the group is split in two halves and one half is randomly shuffled to provide random pairs. In the case of inter-collisions, the two halves are simply the two groups: only one group is randomly shuffled. When the two halves do not contain the same number of particles, the extra particles (not paired yet) are randomly assigned a companion particle from those which have already been paired. Thus, one particle may participate in several pairs. Whereas many codes naturally make quasi-particles collide within their own cell, Smilei makes them collide with all those in the same patch. This is only accurate when the plasma parameters do not vary significantly within one patch, but it greatly reduces the amount quasi-particle sorting required.</p><p>The parameter s is normally calculated from the point of view of one particle traversing a cloud of numerous target particles. However, this picture is broken by the quasiparticles of the PIC code having variable weights. To ensure a deflection angle common to both quasi-particles (in the center-of-mass frame), thus momentum conservation, the parameter s must be the same from both quasi-particles' point of views. Unfortunately, this condition is not fulfilled when the weights or densities are different. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref> provides a detailed solution consisting in modifying s by a factor which makes it symmetric when exchanging the quasi-particles in a pair. This modification is later compensated by randomly picking quasi-particles which will not actually undergo a deflection, so that energy and momentum are conserved in average.</p><p>In addition to these considerations, Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> provides the relativistic expressions of s and χ, specifying the relativistic changes of frames, and gives corrections for lowtemperature plasmas and a varying Coulomb logarithm. Note that these expressions, just like those of the field ionization module, cannot be normalized to dimension-less equations when using Smilei's units: the value of the reference frequency ω r must be specified in the SI system of units.</p><p>As a first example of the possible effects of collisions, let us consider the thermalization between ions and electrons: a fully-ionized hydrogen plasma of density 10 22 cm -3 is set with an ion temperature of 50 eV and an electron temperature of 100 eV. The left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> shows the evolution of both temperatures due to the e-i collisions, well matched by the theoretical solution taken from Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. Note that, for a simpler comparison between simulation and theory, the Coulomb logarithm was set to 5 and e-e and i-i collisions were also applied to ensure maxwellian distributions of each species.</p><p>This example of the effect of e-i (inter-) collisions has the following counterpart for e-e (intra-) collisions. We set an hydrogen plasma of the same density with an anisotropic electron temperature: T = 150 eV and T ⊥ = 50 eV. The right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> shows the evolution of both temperatures due to the e-e collisions, again well matched by the theoretical solution in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Another important consequence of Coulomb collisions is the slowing down of high-32 energy electrons passing through an ionized plasma (due to e-e collisions). We simulated this situation for various electron energies traversing a fully-ionized hydrogen plasma, and present the resulting stopping power in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>. It is in good agreement with theoretical calculations from Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Collisional ionization</head><p>The collision module described in section 5.4 hosts an electron-ion impact-ionization model that makes use of the particle pairing to compute the ionization probability of each pair. The scheme is identical to that of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> with the exception of a few improvements detailed in the following.</p><p>The overall approach consists in calculating quantities averaged over all orbitals of a given ion with atomic number Z and charge Z , instead of dealing with each orbital individually. This greatly reduces the amount of random numbers to generate. In this regard, this scheme is partially deterministic.</p><p>At the beginning of the simulation, the cross-section formulae from Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref> are averaged over all the ions orbitals for each value of Z and for a given set of incident electron energies. In addition to these tabulated average cross-sections σ, the average energy e lost by the incident electron, and the average energy w transferred to the secondary electron, are tabulated at the same time. For each particle pair that collides during the simulation, these tables are interpolated, providing an ionization probability. When an ionization occurs, the incident electron energy is reduced by e, a new electron with energy w is created, and Z is incremented.</p><p>In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, the ionization probabilities and the energy transfers assume that the ion frame is the laboratory frame. To overcome this limitation, Smilei introduces the following changes. The electron Lorentz factor in the ion frame is calculated using the relativistic transformation γ e = γ e γ ip e • p i /(m e m i ) and the probability for ionization can be expressed as: where v e is the electron velocity in the laboratory frame, n is the particle density in the laboratory frame, σ is the cross-section in the ion frame, and V = γ 2 e -1/(γ e γ i ). If ionization occurs, the loss of energy e of the incident electron translates into a change in momentum p e = α e p e in the ion frame, with α e = (γ ee) 2 -1/ γ 2 e -1. To calculate this energy loss in the laboratory frame, we apply the relativistic transformation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">P = 1 -exp (-v e σn∆t) = 1 -exp (-V σ n∆t)<label>(39</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_65">p e = α e p e + ((1 -α e )γ e -e) m e m i p i .<label>(40)</label></formula><p>A similar operation is done for calculating the momentum of the new electron in the laboratory frame: it is created with energy w and its momentum is p w = α w p e in the ion frame, with α w = (w + 1) 2 -1/ γ 2 e -1. In the laboratory frame, it becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">p w = α w p e + (w + 1 -α w γ e ) m e m i p i .<label>(41)</label></formula><p>Finally, equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(41)</ref> ensure that all quantities are correctly expressed in the laboratory frame.</p><p>To test this first improvement, let us consider the inelastic stopping power caused by e-i collisions when a test electron beam is injected in a cold, non-ionized Al plasma of ion density 10 21 cm -3 . Electrons of various initial velocities are slowed down by the ionizing collisions and their energy loss is recorded as a function of time. The left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">14</ref> provides the corresponding stopping power, compared to the theory of Rohrlich and Carlson <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Knowing that this theory is valid only well above the average ionization energy (here ∼ 200 eV), the agreement is satisfactory. At energies above 10 7 keV (the ion rest mass), the center-of-mass frame is not that of the ions, thus the agreement with the theory confirms the validity of our correction.</p><p>Another modification has been added to the theory of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> in order to account for multiple ionization in a single time-step. This approach closely follows that presented for field ionization in Sec. 5.3, the only difference being in the computation of the ionization ] ∆t = 0. 0003 ps ∆t = 0. 17 ps ∆t = 0. 17 ps Figure <ref type="figure">14</ref>: Left: inelastic stopping power of a cold aluminium plasma of density 10 21 cm -3 as a function of the incident electron energy. Right: evolution of the secondary electron density caused by a beam of 1 MeV electrons traversing a cold zinc gas (both electrons and target have a density of 10 21 cm -3 ), for various simulation time-steps. The open circles correspond to the multiple-ionization scheme. rates (described above). It was tested and validated for a wide range of materials and incident electron energies. An example is given in the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">14</ref>, where a fast electron beam ionizes a zinc plasma. The ionized electrons' density is plotted against time, for two vastly different time-steps. With these parameters, the multiple-ionization scheme matches better the well-resolved case than the single-ionization scheme. We found that it takes a reduction of an order of magnitude in the time-step for the singleionization approach to work as well as a the multiple-ionization scheme. It therefore brings a significant accuracy improvement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Python input file</head><p>End-users only need to know how to write an input file, or namelist. Although the core of Smilei is written in C++, the namelist is written in the python language. This has many advantages over the typical text-only inputs. Indeed, python can process complex operations that may be necessary to initialize the simulation. It can generate arbitrary numbers of simulation elements at run-time, without the help of an external script (which would have to be pre-processed). It supports thousands of additional packages, often helpful for specific physics calculations. It is widely used and becoming a reference for all sorts of applications. Very importantly, python functions can be passed as arguments to Smilei. For instance, a density profile can be directly defined as a function of the coordinates.</p><p>When Smilei is run, it starts a python interpreter that parses the namelist line-byline, and executes all the python commands. Throughout the initialization of the simulation elements (particles, fields, diagnostics, etc.) the interpreter stays active. Smilei gathers required data from it, processes all required initialization steps, and finally closes the interpreter. Note that, if a python function needs to be evaluated throughout the simulation, the interpreter is kept active at all times. This happens, for instance, when defining a custom temporal profile for a laser envelope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Diagnostics</head><p>Data collection and analysis are performed by diagnostics. They are not postprocessing modules, but are part of the main code and executed at runtime. All of these diagnostics have the capability of being performed only at user-defined times during the simulation.</p><p>Scalar diagnostic -The simplest diagnostic is called scalars: it processes a large set of field and particle data, and combines the results from all processors before writing out scalar quantities in a dedicated file. Among these quantities, one can find the overall energy balance (with contributions from the different fields, particles, and losses at the boundaries), averaged particle quantities (charge, energy, number of particles), and global field information (minima, maxima and Poynting flux through boundaries).</p><p>Fields diagnostic -The diagnostic fields provides a direct copy of all the arrays in the code, after concatenating them from all the processors. Note that, in addition of the E and B fields, the particle densities and currents are also written as they are projected on arrays at each time-step. Moreover, these data may be temporally averaged over a number of time-steps requested by the user.</p><p>Probe diagnostics -The drawback of the diagnostic fields is that the whole arrays are written out. To reduce the file space footprint, the probes have been implemented: one probe corresponds to a series of points at which locations the fields are interpolated and written in a dedicated file. This series of points can be either regularly arranged in a line, in a rectangle (for a two-dimensional simulation), or in a parallelepiped (for a three-dimensional simulation). The spatial separations between consecutive points is defined by the user. Note that several probes can be added to a single simulation.</p><p>Trajectory diagnostics -Histories of individual quasi-particles are stored by the tracking diagnostic. Each species of particles may be tracked independently, with custom output frequencies. In order to follow individual particles, each tracked particle is assigned a unique number which is transported throughout the simulation.</p><p>Particle distribution diagnostics -Tracking the position of all quasi-particles with a high frequency would be time-and memory-consuming. To obtain digested data with flexible capabilities, the particle diagnostic has been implemented. One diagnostic is defined by an arbitrary number of axes, which overall define a grid: all the quasi-particles in the selected species deposit their weight in the grid cell they belong to (the cell size is unrelated to the PIC grid). These axes are not necessarily spatial (x, y or z), but can also be one of p x , p y , p z , p, γ, v x , v y , v z , v or the particle charge q. A large number of combinations can thus be designed. For instance, using one axis [x] will provide the density distribution vs. x; using two axes [x, y] will provide the two-dimensional density distribution vs. x and y; using one axis [p x ] will provide the x-momentum distribution; using two axes [x, p x ] provides the phase-space along x; using three axes [x, y, γ] provides density maps at different energies; using one axis [q] provides the charge distribution. Further versatility is possible by choosing which piece of data is deposited in each cell instead of the quasi-particle weight w. For instance, depositing the product w q v x results in the j x current density and depositing w v x p x results in a component of the pressure tensor. A final feature of these particle diagnostics is the capability for temporal averaging over an arbitrary number of time-steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Physics highlights</head><p>In this section, we present a few examples of simulations highlighting physics studies relying on Smilei. The first two are related to laser-plasma interaction studies, the latter two to astrophysics.</p><p>7.1. High-harmonic generation and electron acceleration from intense femtosecond laser interaction with dense plasmas The interaction between an ultra-intense (I &gt; 10 18 W/cm 2 ) femtosecond laser pulse with a solid target generates a dense "plasma mirror" at its surface that reflects the laser in a strongly non-linear manner. The temporal distortion of the reflected wave creates a train of ultra-short attosecond pulses, associated, in the frequency domain, to a comb of high-order harmonics. This scheme is considered as one of the best candidates for attosecond light sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Recent experiments have shown that it also produces high-energy (relativistic) ultra-short and very-high-charge (nC) electron bunches <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>, of interest for electron injectors.</p><p>In what follows, we present a 2-dimensional Smilei simulation of laser-solid interaction, in conditions relevant to experiments at the UHI 100 laser facility <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">10</ref> . The laser pulse with wavelength λ 0 = 0.8 µm has a peak intensity I 2 × 10 19 W/cm 2 (normalized vector potential a 0 = 3) when focused to a 4λ 0 waist, at 45 • -indidence with p-polarization, onto an overdense plasma slab. This overdense plasma mimics the solid target considered fully ionized with a constant electron density n 0 = 200 n c (n c 1.7 × 10 21 cm -3 being the critical density), 5λ 0 -thick, with an exponential pre-plasma of gradient length 0.1 λ 0 down to a cut-off density n c-off = 0.05 n c . The full box size is 80 λ 0 × 60λ 0 and the simulation time 150 λ 0 /c. The cell size is ∆x = ∆y = λ 0 /256 (for a total of 25600 × 26880 cells) and the timestep is c∆t = λ 0 /384 0.95 ∆t CFL . Eight to 49 quasi-particles are set in each cell, for a total of ∼ 1.4 billions of quasi-particles in the entire box. They are frozen (not moved) until t = 50 λ 0 /c, i.e. until the laser pulse reaches the target.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15</ref> presents the simulation set-up and a summary of the results obtained. The top panel represents half of the simulation box in the y-direction, and the laser field is reported at three different times. The reflected laser pulse (at time t 2 ) shows a different spectral content than the incident pulse (at time t 0 ). The plasma electron density is shown in black. A close-up view of the interaction region is given in the bottom panel, illustrating the electron bunches being pulled out from the plasma surface.</p><p>Fourier analysis of the reflected laser magnetic field B z in space and time provides the angular distribution of the frequency spectrum of the reflected light. High harmonics (up to order 16) are observed as seen in the top panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">16</ref>. In addition, electron  acceleration was observed, as highlighted in the bottom panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">16</ref>, showing the trajectories of electrons ejected from the target. The most energetic electrons (with energies up to 10 MeV) are found to propagate in the direction of the reflected light pulse. The angular histogram also shows that the momenta of the escaping energetic electrons are mostly directed along two directions which are close to the reflected laser direction. This is consistent with vacuum electron acceleration suggested in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>.</p><p>This simulation was run on the CINES/Occigen (Bullx) machine using 256 MPI × 14 OpenMP threads for about 10700 CPU-hours. Considering only the simulation time during which particles are not frozen, the characteristic time to push a particle (complete time to run one full PIC loop divided by the product of the number of particles by the number of timesteps) is of the order of 0.717 µs, 25% of which were devoted to diagnostics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Short laser pulse amplification by stimulated Brillouin scattering</head><p>The generation of short high-intensity laser pulses is limited by the damage threshold of solid optics materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref>, but such limitations could be overcome using a plasma as an amplifying medium. This can be achieved by coupling, in a plasma, a long energetic "pump" pulse of moderate intensity and a short counter-propagating "seed" pulse of initially low intensity. Energy transfer from the pump to the seed thanks to the excitation of a plasma wave can then be obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">57]</ref>. In what follows, we focus on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) amplification, where the excited waves are ion-acoustic waves.</p><p>In the case of a pump with intensity I p 10 15 W/cm 2 (with the laser wavelength λ 0 = 1 µm), SBS amplification operates in its "strong-coupling" regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61]</ref>. This scheme is particularly robust with respect to plasma inhomogeneities and does not require any frequency shift of the seed pulse.</p><p>Multi-dimensional kinetic simulations are required to describe the competing processes (spontaneous Raman scattering, filamentation, saturation), to study the nonlinearities intervening in the amplification mechanism, and to optimize the resulting phase front (for later focusing <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">63]</ref>), but they appear very challenging as inherently multi-scale. We present here two 2-dimensional Smilei simulation of short-pulse SBS amplification in conditions close to actual experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">65]</ref> Typical simulation results are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">17</ref> showing pump and seed intensities at three different amplification stages. At t = 5.8 ps (panel a), the seed starts interacting with the pump. At t = 7.6 ps (panel b), the seed reaches the middle of the simulation box. At that time, the seed is still in the linear amplification regime, and the pump is not depleted yet. At t = 9.7 ps (panel c), the seed has travelled through the entire simulation box and the pump is depleted. The final intensity of the seed is I out s 4.6×10 15 W/cm 2 , i.e. nearly 5× its initial intensity. The spot size and phase front are also well conserved, suggesting that such a beam could be further focused using plasma mirrors to reach even larger intensities.</p><p>The second simulation deals with an innovative plasma-laser configuration to further optimize SBS amplification. The seed pulse is now interacting with two pump lasers, both with a cos 2 -temporal shape with duration 4.2 ps FWHM, and top intensity I p = 10 15 W/cm 2 that are propagating with an angle of ±6 • degrees with respect to the xaxis. Taking two pump pulses is an experimentally convenient configuration that has the advantage to increase the pump intensity in the 3-pulse-interaction region while keeping  a relatively low pump intensity during propagation in the non-overlapping region (thus reducing spurious Raman losses). Moreover, this laser-plasma configuration allows to separate the Raman backscattering of the pump from the amplified signal (as will be shown in what follows). The transverse size of the pump pulses is, for this simulation, reduced to 30 µm FWHM and the plasma has a constant density profile with electron density n = 0.05 n c .</p><p>The typical interaction set-up and simulation results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">18</ref>(a). The vertical white-dashed lines delimit the constant plasma, and the amplified seed exiting the simulation box at t = 10 ps reaches a final intensity I out s 3 × 10 15 (3× the initial intensity). Of outmost interest is the spatio-temporal (ω, k) spectrum of the light recorded on the left-boundary of the simulation box presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">18(b)</ref>. As expected, this set-up allows the Raman signal (at ω 0.76 ω 0 with ω = 2πc/λ 0 the laser angular frequency) originating from the backscattering of the pump to propagate mostly in the opposite pump directions (the signal is mainly at k ±0.11 k 0 , with k 0 = 2π/λ 0 ), thus angularly separating its contribution from the seed. Furthermore, this spectrum confirms the dominant role of SBS amplification in the seed amplification. Indeed, both broadening and red-shift (toward small temporal frequencies ω &lt; ω 0 ) shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">18(b)</ref> [and insert (c)] are signatures of SBS amplification. The signal at ω ω 0 and k ±0.11 k 0 correspond to the (forward-propagating) pump lasers. Notice that, at the end of the amplification, the transverse focal spot size of the seed at FWHM in intensity is of the order of 28 µm, i.e. of the same order than the initial one.</p><p>Both simulations have been performed on the IDRIS/Turing (BlueGene/Q) supercomputer using 1.8 million CPU-hours on 32768 MPI processes, and 4 OpenMP threads per core to take best advantage of the architecture. The average time to push a particle was ∼ 1.9µs, 5% of which were devoted to diagnostics. The typical memory footprint for these simulations was of the order of 1 Tb, and each simulation generated over 1 Tb of output data. On the CINES/Occigen (Bullx) machine, we obtained an average time of 0.43 µs to push one particle (without diagnostics).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Magnetic reconnection at the Earth magnetopause</head><p>Magnetic reconnection at the Earth magnetopause regulates the transport of matter, momentum and energy from the solar wind to the internal magnetosphere. Because of their different origins, the properties of the plasma and magnetic field on both side of the magnetopause are quite different. The solar wind plasma temperature is typically one tenth that of the magnetospheric plasma, but its density is about ten times larger. The magnetic field is typically 2-3 times larger on the magnetospheric side than on the solar wind side. This asymmetry makes the reconnection dynamics vastly more complex than in symmetric environments, and has only been studied for a decade via numerical simulations and spacecraft observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">67]</ref>. Among all possible asymmetries, those in the particle density and magnetic field amplitude have by far the most important impact on the reconnection rate.</p><p>Following times of strong magnetospheric activity, very dense and cold plasma from the plasmasphere can be transported all the way up to the Earth magnetopause, forming an elongated tongue of dense material. As it impacts the magnetopause, it drastically changes the asymmetry described above. If it reaches the magnetopause at a location where magnetic reconnection is already on-going with a typical asymmetry, the filling of the reconnection site with cold plasma, which density can even exceed the solar wind density, should affect importantly the reconnection dynamics, first by lowering the reconnection rate.</p><p>Studying the impact of a plasmaspheric plume on magnetopause reconnection via kinetic numerical simulation is difficult. Indeed, the simulation first needs to reach a quasi-steady state reconnection with a typical magnetopause asymmetry, see the arrival of the plume and then last longer for a quasi-steady state plume reconnection regime to settle. Due to the large particle density of plumes, the transition and last phases have substantially longer time scales than the early phase, which makes the simulation heavy. The domain must be long enough in the downstream direction for the plasma, expelled during the early and transition phases, to be evacuated from the reconnection region. Otherwise, upstream plasma would not inflow, thereby stopping reconnection.</p><p>We designed a simulation so that typical magnetopause reconnection can proceed and form a reconnection exhaust of about 100 c/ω pi , where ω pi is the ion plasma frequency corresponding to the reference (solar wind) density n 0 , long before the plume reaches the reconnection site. Using the Cassak-Shay estimate of the inflow velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>, we need to position the plume on the magnetospheric side at about 20 c/ω pi from the initial magnetopause position. Three ion populations are present. The solar wind and magnetospheric populations have densities equal to n 0 and n 0 /10, respectively, on their side of the current sheet, and fall to zero on the other side. The plume population increases from 0 to 2 n 0 at 20 c/ω pi from the initial current sheet on the magnetospheric side. The magnetic field amplitude goes from 2 B 0 in the magnetosphere to B 0 = m e ω pe /e in the solar wind and is totally in the simulation plane. The temperature is initially isotropic and its profile is calculated to balance the total pressure.</p><p>The domain size is 1280 c/ω pi ×256 c/ω pi for 25600×10240 cells, in the x (downstream) and y (upstream) directions. The total simulation time is 800 Ω -1 ci with a time step 0.00084 Ω -1 ci , where Ω ci = eB 0 /m i is the ion gyrofrequency. We used a reduced ion to electron mass ratio m i /m e = 25, and a ratio c/V A = 50 of the speed of light by the Alfvén velocity. There are initially 8.6 billion quasi-protons for the three populations, and 13 billion electrons.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">19</ref> presents some of the simulation results: the electron density at three different times. In the top panel, reconnection is in steady state between the solar wind plasma of density n 0 and the magnetosphere plasma of density 0.1 n 0 . At this time, the exhaust is filled with mixed solar wind/hot magnetospheric plasma as the plume (of density 2 n 0 ) is still located at 10 c/ω pi from the magnetospheric separatrix. The reconnection rate during this period has a typical value around 0.1 Ω -1 ci , with impor-tant fluctuations caused by plasmoid formation. The plume, originally at 20 c/ω pi from the magnetopause, is slowly advected towards the magnetosphere separatrix and finally touches the reconnection site at about t = 300 Ω -1 ci . The second panel at t = 370 Ω -1 ci shows the plume starting to fill the exhaust after reaching the reconnection site and mixing with solar wind plasma. At this time, the reconnection rate collapses to about half its previous value. The transition phase lasts for about 100 Ω -1 ci before a plume reconnection regime reaches a quasi-steady state. The third panel shows the electron density at the end of the simulation, where the exhaust is filled with plume and solar wind plasma.</p><p>This large-scale simulation has run for a total of 14 million CPU-hours on 16384 cores of the CINES/Occigen (Bullx) supercomputer within a GENCI-CINES special call. Overall, the characteristic (full) push-time for a single particle was of the order of 1.6 µs, 31% of which were devoted to diagnostics. Note that no dynamic load balancing was used for this simulation.</p></div>

The long-standing problem of describing collisionless shock formation has gained renewed interest as PIC simulations provide insight into the micro-physics of these non-linear structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72]</ref>.</p><p>In the absence of particle collisions, the shock is mediated by collective plasma processes, produced by electromagnetic plasma instabilities, taking place at the shock front. In particular, we study the Weibel (or current filamentation) instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75]</ref> that is observed in most of the astrophysical relativistic outflows interacting with the interstellar medium. It can be excited by counter-streaming unmagnetized relativistic flows, and it has been shown to dominate the instability spectrum for a wide range of parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref>. It converts part of the kinetic energy of the counter-propagating flows into small-scale magnetic fields, which are then amplified up to sub-equipartition levels of the total energy. The resulting strong magnetic turbulence can isotropize the incoming flow (in the center-of-mass frame), hence stopping it and leading to compression of the downstream (shocked plasma) and shock formation.</p><p>The density compression ratio between the upstream relativistic flow (with density n 0 ) and the downstream (with density n d ) plasma can be derived from macroscopic conservation laws giving the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) jump conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref>. The shock is considered formed when the density jump becomes n d /n 0 = 1 + (γ 0 + 1)/[γ 0 (Γ ad -1)]. Considering an ultra-relativistic incoming flow γ 0 1 and adiabatic index Γ ad = 3/2 for a 2-dimensional downstream plasma at ultra-relativistic temperature, we expect a compression factor n d /n 0 = 3. Another clear signature of the shock formation is the isotropization of the downstream plasma. This physical picture has been confirmed by various PIC simulations using counter-penetrating relativistic flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71]</ref>.</p><p>In what follows, we present a 2-dimensional PIC simulation of a Weibel-mediated collisionless shock driven in an initially unmagnetized electron-positron plasma. The simulation relies on the "piston" method that consists in initializing the simulation with a single cold electron-positron plasma drifting in the +x-direction at a relativistic velocity v 0 0.995 c (γ 0 = 10). A reflecting (for both fields and particles) boundary condition is applied at the right border of the simulation box, hence creating a counter-penetrating (reflected) flow, the reflected beam mimicking a flow with velocity -v 0 .</p><p>The simulation box size is 2048 δ e × 128 δ e , δ e = c/ω p being the (non-relativistic) electron skin-depth of the initial flow. The spatial resolution is set to ∆x = ∆y = δ e /16, the timestep to c∆t = ∆x/2 and 16 particles-per-cell were used for each species leading to a total of 2.15 × 10 9 quasi-particles. Temporal Friedman filtering (with θ = 0.1) and binomial current filtering (using 3 passes) have been applied in order to avoid spurious effects (e.g. upstream heating) due to the grid-Cerenkov numerical instability (see Sec. 5.1).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">20</ref> presents the characteristic simulation results at time t = 1000 ω -1 p . The overlapping region of incoming and reflected flows is Weibel-unstable which results in the creation, before the shock (50 δ e &lt; x &lt; 400 δ e ), of filamentary structures in both the magnetic field (panel a) and the total plasma density (panel b). The magnetic field at the shock front (400 δ e &lt; x &lt; 600 δ e ) becomes turbulent and it is strong enough to stop the incoming particles leading to a pile-up of the plasma density up to n d 3.2 n 0 (panel c), as predicted by the RH conditions. The simulation also indicates that the shock propagates toward the left with a velocity v sh (0.46±0.01) c. The RH conditions predict a shock velocity v sh = c (Γ ad -1)(γ 0 -1)/(γ 0 v 0 ) 0.452 c, in excellent agreement with the value observed in the simulation. Isotropization and thermalization of the downstream distribution function was also observed (not shown), with a typical temperature close to that predicted from the RH conditions T Finally, the simulation also demonstrates the build-up of a supra-thermal tail in the downstream particle energy distribution, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">21</ref>. At an early time after shock formation, t 500 ω -1 p , the particle distribution in the downstream (shocked plasma, here taken at 800 c/ω p &lt; x &lt; 900 c/ω p ) is found to have relaxed to an isotropic, quasithermal, distribution with a temperature initially only slightly larger than that predicted from RH conditions T d 4.5 m e c 2 (dashed line). At later times (t → 2000 ω -1 p ), a supra-thermal tail of energetic particles has built up, even more pronounced for particles located in the downstream plasma closer to the shock front (here taken in a region 500 c/ω p &lt; x &lt; 600 c/ω p , solid black line). This tail is characteristic of first order Fermi acceleration at the shock front, and appears following a dN/dγ ∝ γ -s scaling with s = 2.5, a power index consistent with previous PIC simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71]</ref> and theoretical investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref>.</p><p>This simulation run on the TGCC/Curie machine using 512 MPI × 8 OpenMP threads over a total of 26100 CPU-hours for 65536 timesteps.

The shape functions of higher order n &gt; 0 are then obtained recursively:</p><p>with the crenel function P (x) = 1 if |x| ≤ ∆x/2 and P (x) = 0 otherwise. In what follows, we write explicitly the shape-functions ŝ(n) = ∆x s (n) for n up to 4 (i.e. up to fourth order):</p><p>(A.7)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field interpolation at the particle position</head><p>In Sec. 2.3, it is shown that the quasi-particles are subject to the electric and magnetic fields interpolated at their positions, these interpolated fields being given by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, respectively. For the simplest case of a one-dimensional grid, the field (either electric or magnetic) seen by the quasi-particle at position x p = x p x can thus be written in the form:</p><p>where field F (x) can be reconstructed from the grid as:</p><p>i denoting the grid point index and x i the location of the i th grid point. Injecting Eq. (A.9) in Eq. (A.8), and using the recursive definition of the shape-function Eq. (A.2), one obtains a simple way to interpolate the field at the quasi-particle position:</p><p>The generalisation to an arbitrary number of spatial dimension is straightforward.</p><p>Direct projection of the charge and current densities onto the grid Direct projection of the charge and/or current densities onto a grid point x i can be performed considering the projected quantity [Q = (ρ, J)] as the amount of charge and/or current contained in the cell located around this grid point:</p><p>Using the recursive definition of the shape-function Eq. (A.2), one obtains:</p><p>For the sake of completeness, it is worth noting that using the same shape-function for both interpolation and projection is mandatory to avoid unphysical self-force acting on the quasi-particles.</p></div>			</div>
