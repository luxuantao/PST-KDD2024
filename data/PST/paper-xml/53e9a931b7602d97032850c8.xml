<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents two classes of propositional logics (understood as a consequence relation). First we generalize the well-known class of implicative logics of Rasiowa and introduce the class of weakly implicative logics. This class is broad enough to contain many "usual" logics, yet easily manageable with nice logical properties. Then we introduce its subclass-the class of weakly implicative fuzzy logics. It contains the majority of logics studied in the literature under the name fuzzy logic. We present many general theorems for both classes, demonstrating their usefulness and importance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the last decades many so-called fuzzy logics were introduced and developed. Also some well-established many-valued logics, like Łukasiewicz or Gödel-Dummett logic, have been adopted into a general framework of fuzzy logics (as extension of Hájek's Basic Fuzzy Logic). Since Hájek's monograph <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> the fuzzy logics are considered as mathematical non-classical logics sui juris. After</p><p>The work was supported by grant A100300503 of the Grant Agency of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and by Institutional Research Plan AVOZ10300504. P. Cintula (B) Institute of Computer Science, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Pod Vodárenskou v ěží 2, Prague 8 182 07, Czech Republic e-mail: cintula@cs.cas.cz then the above mentioned dozens of logical systems were studied by prominent logicians and (theoretical) computer scientists. It is the opinion of the author that this development has gone to the point when we know hundreds of particular results for particular logics and so we can (and should!) generalize them and get results for classes of (fuzzy) logics.</p><p>In this paper we introduce two classes of logics. First, we generalize implicative logics of Rasiowa <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and get the so-called weakly implicative logics. Although this can be viewed as a rather minor generalization, it forces us to leave the algebraic semantics and move towards semantics provided by the so-called logical matrices (weakly implicative logics are not (in general) algebraizable in the sense of Blok and Piggozzi <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). From the point of view of Abstract Algebraic Logic (see survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) this is a subclass of the so-called equivalential logics (more comments on this topic are before the definition of weakly implicative logics). Roughly speaking, equivalential logics "deal with equivalence/equality" and weakly implicative logics "deal with preorder/order". We show that they can be viewed as the "logics of ordered matrices". In this paper the class of weakly implicative logics serves as a background for the second class of weakly implicative fuzzy logics (WIFL). Thus we leave more thorough investigation of this class of logics (and especially its connection with other classes of logics known in AAL) for some future paper.</p><p>The class of WIFL is an attempt to formally define and delimit an informal notion of fuzzy logic. We try to provide mathematical arguments demonstrating the importance of this class of logics (whereas philosophical, methodological, and pragmatical reasons are to be find in a joint paper by the author and Libor B ěhounek <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). We define WIFL as a class of logics complete w.r.t. linearly ordered matrices and we show several equivalent definitions using well-known concepts of the theory of the fuzzy logics, like prelinearity property or subdirect decomposition theorem.</p><p>The fact that WIFL is defined formally and closed under intersection, allows us to speak about the weakest fuzzy logic with some properties. So we can extend the known result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> that MTL (Monoidal t-norm logic) is an extension of FL ew (Full Lambek calculus with exchange and weakening), to the following one: MTL is the weakest fuzzy logic that extends FL ew . In fact, for each logic we can assign the weakest (weakly implicative) fuzzy logic extending it. This turns out to be an important methodological guideline: the weakest fuzzy logic having some property seems to be a good starting point for the investigation of the property in the context of fuzzy logics.</p><p>The rest of the paper is devoted to the study of (variants of) Local Deduction Theorem and of the unary connective (the so-called Baaz delta) which is heavily used in fuzzy logic literature. In both cases the two above-defined classes of logics serve as our "playgrounds" and the achieved results support our belief that they are well-defined and have their "right for existence".</p><p>In many aspects this paper gives only basic definitions and shows directions towards possible future development. Some issues are already (partially) handled by the author's PhD. thesis <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, especially predicate weakly implicative (fuzzy) logics, embedding (some) of the existing fuzzy logic into the proposed general framework, and general concept of expansions of fuzzy logics by rational truth constants. Other important direction of the research leads towards exploration of the relation between WIFL and AAL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Weakly implicative logics</head><p>We start with some obligatory introductory definitions. For a comprehensive survey into the theory of the general approaches towards the logical systems, consequence relations, logical matrices, etc., see Czelakowski's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or the survey to AAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In the first subsection we introduce weakly implicative logics. Then, in the second subsection, we present the semantics for them (using the well-known notion of logical matrix).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Syntax</head><p>Definition 1 A propositional language L is a triple (VAR, C, a), where VAR is a non-empty set <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> of the (propositional) variables, C is a nonempty set of the (propositional) connectives, and a is a function assigning a natural number to each element of C.</p><p>The set VAR is usually taken as a fixed countable set, and so we usually define the propositional language L as a pair (C, a). Later on, we fix symbols for some basic connectives (→, ∧, ⊥, . . . ) together with their arities and then we define a propositional language just as a set of these connectives. Sometimes we write (c, n) ∈ L instead of c ∈ C and a(c) = n. Definition 2 (Formula) Let L be a propositional language. The set of (propositional) formulae FOR L is the smallest set which contains VAR and is closed under connectives from C, i.e., for each (c, n) ∈ L and each ϕ 1 , . . . ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ϕ n ∈ FOR L we have c(ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ n ) ∈ FOR L . Definition 3 (Substitution) Let L be a propositional language. A substitution is a mapping σ : FOR L → FOR L , such that σ is compatible with connectives, i.e., σ (c(ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ n )) = c(σ (ϕ 1 ), . . . , σ (ϕ n )) holds for each (c, n) ∈ L.</formula><p>The set of all substitutions will be denoted as SUB L .</p><p>Of course, a substitution is fully determined by its values on propositional variables. If v ∈ VAR and ϕ, ψ ∈ FOR L , then by ψ[v := ϕ] we understand the formula σ (ψ), where σ is the substitution mapping v to ϕ and mapping all the remaining propositional variables to itself. The term consecution in the following definition is from the Restall's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. However, we use it in a very simplified way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 4 (Consecution)</head><p>A consecution in the propositional language L is a pair &lt; X, ϕ &gt;, where X ⊆ FOR L and ϕ ∈ FOR L . The set of all consecutions will be denoted as CON L .</p><p>Instead of &lt; X, ϕ &gt; we write X ϕ. Since CON L = P(FOR L )×FOR L , each subset X of CON L can be understood as a relation between the sets of formulae and formulae (we identify the set X and the relation X in the following way X X ϕ iff (X ϕ) ∈ X ). For X ⊆ FOR L , X ⊆ CON L and substitution σ we fix the following convention:</p><p>-By σ (X) we understand the set {σ (ϕ</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">) | ϕ ∈ X}. -By σ (X ) we understand the set {σ (X) σ (ϕ) | (X ϕ) ∈ X }. -By SUB L (X ) we denote the set σ ∈SUB L σ (X ).</formula><p>Definition 5 (Logic) Let L be a propositional language. A non-empty set L ⊆ CON L is called a logic in the language L when it satisfies:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">-if ϕ ∈ X, then X L ϕ. -if Y L ϕ for each ϕ ∈ X and X L ψ, then Y L ψ. -if X L ϕ, then σ (X) L σ (ϕ) for each σ ∈ SUB L .</formula><p>Thus the logic is a structural (substitution-invariant) consequence relation in the sense of Tarski. The elements of a logic are consecutions. Sometimes, when the logic L is known from the context, we write just instead of L . We denote the set {ϕ | ∅ L ϕ} as T HM(L). Now we introduce the notion of an axiomatic system. Observe that both axiomatic systems and logics are objects of the same kind. Both are sets of consecutions closed under substitution, logics only satisfy two more conditions (of a consequence relation). This observation simplifies formulations of some upcoming theorems. Definition 6 (Axiomatic system) Let L be a propositional language. An axiomatic system AS in language L is a non-empty set AS ⊆ CON L , which is closed under arbitrary substitution (i.e., SUB L (AS) = AS).</p><p>The elements of AS of the form X ϕ ∈ AS are called axioms for X = ∅, n-ary deduction rules for |X| = n, and infinitary deduction rules otherwise.</p><p>An axiomatic system is said to be finite if there is a finite set X ⊆ AS such that SUB L (X ) = AS. Furthermore, an axiomatic system is said to be finitary if all its deduction rules are finite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 7 (Proof)</head><p>Let L be a propositional language and AS an axiomatic system in L. A proof of the formula ϕ in theory T is a well-founded tree labelled by formulae; the root is labelled by ϕ and the leaves by either axioms or elements of T; and if a node is labelled by ψ and its preceding nodes are labelled by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ψ 1 , ψ 2 , . . . then &lt; {ψ 1 , ψ 2 , . . . }, ψ &gt; ∈ AS. We write T p AS ϕ if there is a proof of ϕ in T.</formula><p>By theory we mean just a set of formulas. The fact that tree is well-founded just means that there is no infinitely long branch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 1</head><p>Let L be a propositional language and AS an axiomatic system in L. Then p AS is the least logic containing AS.</p><p>Proof Obviously p AS is a logic and AS ⊆ p AS . The proof that for each logic</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L if AS ⊆ L, then p AS ⊆ L is simple: if T p AS ϕ,</formula><p>then there is a proof of ϕ in T, by the induction over the well-founded relation representing the proof we show that for each formula ψ, being a label of some node, we have T L ψ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 8 (Presentation)</head><p>Let L be a propositional language, AS an axiomatic system in L, and L a logic in L. We say that AS is an axiomatic system for (a presentation of) the logic</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L iff L = p AS .</formula><p>Logic is said to be finitely axiomatizable (finitary) if it has some finite (finitary) presentation.</p><p>Observe that each logic has at least one presentation. Now we show that our definition of finitary logics coincides with the usual one: Lemma 2 (Finitary logic) Let L be a logic. Then L is finitary iff for each theory T and formula ϕ we have: if T ϕ, then there is finite T ⊆ T such that T ϕ.</p><p>Proof If L is finitary, then there is its finitary presentation AS. Observe that for each finitary AS the proofs are always finite (because the tree has no infinite branch and because AS is finitary, each node has finitely many preceding nodes and so we can use König's Lemma to get that the tree is finite). The reverse direction is almost straightforward.</p><p>Observe that in the finitary case we can linearize the tree, i.e., define the notion of the proof in the usual way. Our notion of the proof allows us to illustrate one important (and usually overlooked) feature of our way of introducing a logic. The deduction rule {ψ 1 , ψ 2 , . . . } ϕ gives us a way how to construct a proof of ϕ using proofs of ψ 1 , ψ 2 , . . . . However, the "meta-rule": from ψ 1 , ψ 2 , . . . get ϕ only tells us that if there are proofs of ψ 1 , ψ 2 , . . . , then there is a proof of ϕ without any hint how to construct it. It should be stressed that rules are rules of inference between formulae, whereas "meta-rules" are in fact rules of the inference between consecutions. The conditions in Definition 5 are in fact meta-rules of consequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 9</head><p>Let L 1 and L 2 be propositional languages and L i a logic in L i . We say that L 2 is an expansion of L 1 iff L 1 ⊆ L 2 . The expansion is axiomatic if L 2 is axiomatized by logic L 1 (understood as an axiomatic system) with some additional axioms.</p><p>The expansion is conservative if for each theory T and formula ϕ in language L 1 we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T L 2 ϕ entails T L 1 ϕ. In that case L 1 is also called the L 1 -fragment of L 2 .</formula><p>If L 1 = L 2 , we speak about extension rather than about expansion. Now we define the crucial concept of this paper: the notion of a weakly implicative logic. We assume that there is a binary connective → in the propositional language. There is an obvious generalization of this approach; if we drop the condition of the presence of the connective → in language and following the AAL tradition, we would understand the term ϕ → ψ as a set of formulae of two propositional variables, where the formula ϕ is substituted for the first one and the formula ψ for the second one. Observe that some theorems proven in this paper remain theorems under this interpretation (more thorough development of this generalization will be a subject of an upcoming paper). It is easy to see that in this more general approach (which we will not pursuit in this paper) the defined class of logics would be a subclass of the so-called equivalential logics, and in the more specific approach (we use in this paper) the class of logics defined by the following definition is a subclass of the so-called finitely equivalential logics. In fact, all weakly implicative logics are finitely equivalential logics with the set of equivalence formulae E = {p → q, q → p}. The name, weakly implicative logics, is inspired by the notion of implicative logics by Helena Rasiowa,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> see her book <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. As we will see, our notion is really a generalization of her notion (her only additional assumption is ϕ ψ → ϕ).</p><p>Definition 10 (Weakly implicative logics) Let L be a propositional language, such that (→, 2) ∈ L and let L be a logic in L. We say that L is a weakly implicative logic iff the following consecutions are elements of L:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(Ref) L ϕ → ϕ (MP) ϕ, ϕ → ψ L ψ (WT) ϕ → ψ, ψ → χ L ϕ → χ (Cng i c ) ϕ → ψ, ψ → ϕ L c(χ 1 , . . . , χ i-1 , ϕ, . . . , χ n ) → → c(χ 1 , . . . , χ i-1 , ψ, . . . , χ n ) for each (c, n) ∈ L and each i ≤ n.</formula><p>(Ref) is for reflexivity, (MP) is for modus ponens, (WT) is for weak transitivity, and (Cng) is for congruence. Let (c, n) ∈ L, then by (Cng c ) we understand the set of consecutions {(Cng i c ) | i ≤ n}. Furthermore, by (Cng L ) we understand the set of consecutions c∈L (Cng c ). Observe that we assume neither Exchange nor Weakening nor Contraction as a rule for implication. However, we have all of them as meta-rules, i.e., the connective → is by no means an internalization of . We can say that our approach towards corresponds to derivability from assumptions in some Hilbert's style calculus. It is defined in the same fashion as the Hilbert calculi for particular substructural logics. This paper can be seen as a contribution to the general (universal, abstract) theory of these calculi. For another (even more) general treatment of this topic, see Restall's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. Let ϕ ↔ ψ be a shortcut for {ϕ → ψ, ψ → ϕ}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 3 (Alternative definition)</head><p>The set of consecutions (Cng L ) can be equivalently replaced by one of the following sets of consecutions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">-ϕ 1 ↔ ψ 1 , . . . , ϕ n ↔ ψ n c(ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ n ) → c(ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n ) for each (c, n) ∈ L.</formula><p>ϕ ↔ ψ χ → χ for each formula χ ∈ FOR L , where χ is a result of replacing some occurrence of subformula ϕ with formula ψ in formula χ .</p><p>The proof is simple. Notice that the second part of this lemma can be understood as a substitution rule and we will use it heavily in the formal proofs in this paper. Now we list several simple lemmata with rather trivial proofs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 4</head><p>Let L be a weakly implicative logic in a language L and L a logic in a language L , which is an expansion of L. Then L is a weakly implicative logic iff for each n-ary connective c in L \ L and each i ≤ n we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ϕ → ψ, ψ → ϕ L c(χ 1 , . . . , χ i-1 , ϕ, . . . , χ n ) → c(χ 1 , . . . , χ i-1 , ψ, . . . , χ n ).</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 11 (Consistency)</head><p>Let L be a weakly implicative logic. A theory T is consistent if there is formula ϕ such that T L ϕ. The logic L is consistent iff the theory ∅ is consistent.</p><p>Observe that a logic L is inconsistent iff L = CON L , i.e., each consecution is provable. Now we introduce the notion of the linear theory. In the existing fuzzy logic literature the term complete theory is usually used. However, we think that a complete theory is a different concept (also known as a maximal consistent theory). However, this notion is crucial in our paper and we want to avoid any potential confusions we decided to pick new neutral name. The reason for choosing the name "linear" will be obvious after Lemma 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 12 (Linear theory)</head><p>Let L be a weakly implicative logic. A theory T is linear if T is consistent and for each formulae ϕ, ψ we have T ϕ → ψ or T ψ → ϕ.</p><p>To end this subsection we introduce the notion of power of the implication, to write ϕ 3 → ψ instead of ϕ → (ϕ → (ϕ → ψ)) (for example).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Semantics</head><p>We start again by recalling some well-known definitions. The completeness theorem for weakly implicative logics (which we prove in this section) is a consequence of some more general theorem known in AAL. However, our concern is not to reprove known facts, we concentrate on the notion of linearity of a logical matrix, which (as far as the author knows) was not so deeply studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 14 (Algebra and matrix) Let L = (C, a) be a propositional language. An algebra A = (A, C) with signature (C, a) is called L-algebra. Let us denote the realization of c in A as c A . A pair B = (A B , D B ), where A B is L-algebra and D B is a subset of A, is called L-matrix. The elements of D B are called designated elements of matrix B.</head><p>Notice that substitution can be understood as a endomorphism of the absolutely free L-algebra.

Furthermore, MOD(L) is the greatest class w.r.t. which the logic L is sound.</formula><p>The proof of the following lemma is almost straightforward. Observe that the congruence relation defined in the following lemma is the so-called Leibnitz congruence (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). The matrix B is said to be ordered iff the relation ≤ B is order. We denote the class of ordered L-matrixes by MOD * (L).</p><p>The matrix B is said to be linearly ordered (or just linear) iff the relation ≤ B is linear order. We denote the class of linearly ordered L-matrixes by MOD (L).</p><p>Matrices for weakly implicative logics coincide with the class of the so-called prestandard matrices (see Dunn and Hardegree <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), whereas the ordered matrices coincides with the so-called standard matrices. The ordered matrices also coincide with the class of the so-called reduced matrices in AAL (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>), thus we use their notation. Obviously, MOD (L) ⊆ MOD * (L) ⊆ MOD(L). An interesting question is where the opposite of Lemma 6 holds, i.e., whether the logic L is complete w.r.t. class MOD(L). Since all weakly implicative logics are equivalential, we know that the answer is positive (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). As we are interested in a stronger claim, than just completeness w.r.t. all matrices, we recall the well-known concept of a Lindenbaum-Tarski matrix and prove some of its not so well-know properties (Lemma 8 Parts (3) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)). It is also interesting to observe how the abstract concepts of AAL are rendered in our not so abstract setting.</p><p>Definition 21 (Lindenbaum-Tarski matrix) Let L be a weakly implicative logic in L, T a theory in L.

Here we give only one example: the class of fuzzy logics includes the classical logic and that can seem a little odd. However, we think that the classical logic is a (very special) example of a fuzzy logic: fuzzy logic is a generalization of the classical logic, designed to encompass also vague predicates. Thus the classical logic is a fuzzy logic usable in those special occasions when, by chance, the realizations of all predicates are crisp. We also think that a good definition should include its limit cases and to exclude the classical logic in the general definition would be inconvenient, because most results on (non-classical) fuzzy logics hold for the classical logic as well. Now we are going to show several equivalent definitions of the class of WIFL.</p><p>Definition 24 (Linear extension) A weakly implicative logic L has linear extension property (LEP) if for each theory T and formula ϕ such that T ϕ there is a linear theory T , such that T ⊆ T and T ϕ. Reverse direction: we need to prove that L = | MOD (L) . One inclusion is trivial consequence of Theorem 1, the reverse one we prove by contradiction: assume that T ϕ. Let us take a linear supertheory T ϕ. We know that Lind T ∈ MOD (L) (from Lemma 8) and for the Lind T -evaluation e defined as e(ψ) = [ψ] T holds e ∈ Mod(T , Lind T ). This entails that also e ∈ Mod(T, Lind T ). The rest of the proof is analogous to the proof of completeness for weakly implicative logics (Theorem 1).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 4 (Deduction theorem)</head><p>Let L be a logic. Then L has DT → iff L is MP-based and L is an expansion of BCI.</p><p>Proof First direction: all we have to do is to show that L Sf ax and L E ax (the rest is the immediate consequence of the definition of DT → ). Observe that ϕ, ψ, ϕ → (ψ → χ) L χ and each of the premises is used exactly once, applying DT → three times we get L E ax . Since ϕ, ϕ → ψ, ψ → χ L χ and each of the premises is used exactly once, applying DT → three times we get L Sf ax . Reverse direction: we use the induction over the AX -proof P. We show that for each formula χ in P the condition from Definition 35 holds. Since the precise formulation of the proof of the induction step would be extremely technical, we give (an unnecessarily) detailed proof of the initial steps and leave the rest to the reader. 1. χ is in a leaf of P and χ = ϕ. The proof of T, ϕ χ is one element tree (consisting of the formula ϕ). Since ϕ → ϕ we get T ϕ → ϕ. Since ϕ occurs once in the proof of T, ϕ χ and no formula of T occurs in the proof of T ϕ → ϕ our condition holds. 2. χ is in a leaf of P and χ = ϕ. Thus χ ∈ T or χ is an axiom. Again the proof of T, ϕ χ is one element tree (consisting of the formula χ ), the same tree is a proof of T ϕ 0 → χ . Observe that our condition holds (we have not used the formula ϕ and if χ ∈ T we used χ exactly once in both proofs and no other formula from T occurs in any of the proofs). 3. χ has predecessors ψ 2 = ψ 1 → χ and ψ 1 . Using the induction property we get T ϕ n → (ψ 1 → χ) and T ϕ m → ψ 1 . From Lemma 20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. we get T ψ 1 → (ϕ n → χ) and Lemma 20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. gives us T ϕ m → (ϕ n → χ).</p><p>Thus T ϕ m+n → χ . Observe that our condition holds.</p><p>We have proved even more: given proof of ψ in T, ϕ, we have a constructive procedure which produces the proof of ϕ n → ψ in T. The proofs of the following two corollaries are almost straightforward. The first one formulates DT → in a way more resembling the usual formulations of deduction theorems (it mentions the number of occurrences of ϕ but we do not mention the formulas from T). It also entails an interesting open problem: what happen if we formulate it for two or one formula only?</p><p>Corollary 7 Let L be a logic.

Since we have ¬ x → x ≤ x we also have ¬ x &gt; x (otherwise 1 ≤ ¬ x → x and so 1 ≤ x-a contradiction). Observe that from part 4 of Lemma 26 we get ( x → ¬ x) ≤ ¬ x. We know that x ≤ ¬ x so ( x → ¬ x) = 1 and so 1 ≤ x → ⊥. Finally, x ≤ ⊥.</p><p>2. One direction is obvious. We show the reverse one contrapositively: if T ϕ → ψ, then there is linearly ordered L-matrix B and B-model e of T and e( ϕ → ψ) &lt; 1 (again we omit the subscripts B). Then obviously 1 ≤ e(ϕ) (otherwise e( ϕ) = ⊥ and we would get 1 ≤ e( ϕ → ψ)-a contradiction), thus e( ϕ) = 1 and so 1 → e(ψ) = e( ϕ → ψ) &lt; 1.

Observe that from (1 → ⊥) → ⊥ we get ¬1 → χ and also from (⊥ → ⊥) → 1 we get χ ¬⊥ → χ . We use part 3 of this lemma: first notice that ϕ 1 ↔ ϕ so ϕ ¬ ϕ → ¬1 and thus ϕ ¬ ϕ → ¬ ϕ. Second, we know that ¬ ϕ ⊥ ↔ ϕ and thus ¬ ϕ ¬ ϕ → ¬⊥. since ¬ ϕ ¬ ϕ we get ¬ ϕ ¬ ϕ → ¬ ϕ. To prove the reverse direction just set ϕ = 1 in one case and ϕ = ⊥ in the second one. We get ¬ 1 → ¬ 1 and ¬ ⊥ → ¬ ⊥. Lemma 26 completes the proof.</p><p>5. We use Lemma 23.

Let us (for now) use symbol for globalization. Let us recall that for each Heyting algebra B holds: B x = 1 B if 1 B ≤ B x and B x = ⊥ B otherwise. (It can be easily shown that extensions of Intuitionistic logic by connective with this semantics proves all matching rules for .) This condition looks similar to that from part 1 of the previous lemma but there is a huge difference: the latter condition speaks about linear matrices only! Since the fuzzy logics have SDP, each non-linear matrix is a subdirect product of linear ones and so the interpretation of on this non-linear matrix will not behave according to the condition for (easy computation). Now we try to formulate the "essence" of the connective , when used in fuzzy logics.</p><p>Definition 38 Let L be a language such that ⊥, ∈ L and L a fuzzy logic in L. We say that L is a logic with Baaz delta if for each formula in language {→, ⊥, 1}, if we define substitution σ (v) = v then L σ ϕ iff ϕ is a theorem of classical logic.</p><p>Obviously, not each logic with connective is logic with Baaz delta (take Intuitionistic logic, and in all Heyting algebras interpret as identity). Observe that if L is a logic with Baaz delta, it is consistent. This definition can be viewed as rather peculiar, but we are going to present more convenient alternative definition. The following lemma works for the fuzzy logics only: even if Intuitionistic logic fulfills properties 1-5 from the upcoming definition it is not a logic with Baaz delta, analogously it can be easily shown that Łukasiewicz logic with globalization is not a fuzzy logic and so it is not a logic with Baaz delta.</p><p>Lemma 28 Let L be a consistent fuzzy logic. Then L is a fuzzy logic with Baaz delta iff the following holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">1. (¬ ϕ → ϕ) → ϕ 2. (1 → 1) → 1 3. (⊥ → 1) → 1 4. (⊥ → ⊥) → 1 5. (1 → ⊥) → ⊥.</formula><p>Proof One direction is obvious (only non-trivial part is to show part 1 -to do this just notice that (¬p → p) → p is a theorem of the classical logic).</p><p>To prove the converse direction we need to show two things: first, if ϕ is a theorem of the classical logic, then L σ ϕ. We prove this contrapositively: assume that L σ ϕ, then there is linear L-matrix B and B-evaluation e such that e(σ ϕ) &lt; 1. Observe that from Lemma 27 part 1 we know that e( v) is either 1 or ⊥, from the form of the formula σ ϕ and from assumptions 2-5 we know that e(σ ϕ) = ⊥ and if we define the evaluation f (v) = e( v), then f is a classical evaluation not satisfying ϕ.</p><p>Second, we need to show that if L σ ϕ, then ϕ is a theorem of the classical logic. We prove this by a contradiction: assume that there is a classical evaluation e, such that e(ϕ) = ⊥. Then there is substitution ρ(v) = e(v) (we identify constants 1 and ⊥ with two truth values of the classical logic) and ρϕ → ⊥ is a theorem of the classical logic. Thus L σ (ρϕ → ⊥) (using the previous direction). Because σ (ρϕ → ⊥) = ρϕ → ⊥ (there are no variables in ρϕ → ⊥) and Assumptions 2-5 we get L ρϕ → ⊥. Since L σ ϕ we also have L ρσ ϕ and so finally ρϕ (because ⊥ ↔ ⊥ and 1 ↔ 1). Thus together we have L ⊥-a contradiction with the consistency of L.</p><p>In the literature, it is common that for fuzzy logic L there is defined its conservative expansion by the connective (usually denoted as L ), which is also a fuzzy logic. It is usual that L is a logic with Baaz delta and has DT (even if L has not some variant of the deduction theorem). Now we introduce a general way of expanding the logic L into the logic L . First we give an indirect definition and then we show how to find a presentation of L based on the presentation of L.</p><p>Definition 39 Let L be a consistent fuzzy logic in L, ⊥ ∈ L, and ∈ L. By L we denote the weakest fuzzy logic in the language L ∪ { } which has Baaz delta and expands L.</p><p>The soundness of this definition is guaranteed by Lemma 13. In the literature, we see other axiomatic systems for logics with Baaz delta than the one which we are going to present. However, this one has several advantages. First, it is formulated in the language with →, ⊥, and only and second, it does not assume any structural rules of the starting logic. (1 → 1) → 1.</p><p>Proof Let L be the logic with the above presentation. First we have to show that L is a fuzzy logic with Baaz delta (it obviously expands L). We show that if T L ϕ → χ and T L ¬ ϕ → χ then T L χ . In that case we get (from 4a and 4b) that T L (¬ ϕ → ϕ) → χ and T L ( ϕ → ¬ ϕ) → χ . To complete the proof of this part just observe that because L is a fuzzy logic we know that (ϕ → ψ) → χ , (ψ → ϕ) → χ L χ and so we also have (ϕ → ψ) → χ , (ψ → ϕ) → χ L χ .</p><p>We use this observation for T = { (ϕ → ψ) → χ , (ψ → ϕ) → χ }. We have T L (ϕ → ψ) → χ (obvious) and T L ¬ (ϕ → ψ) → χ (by 5). Thus { (ϕ → ψ) → χ , (ψ → ϕ) → χ } L χ . From Theorem 6 we know that L has DT , so L is a fuzzy logic (using Lemma 24). Now we observe that L is a conservative expansion of L (Lemma 27 tells us that any linear L-matrix B, which is counterexample to T ϕ, can be extended into the linear L -matrix B and it is a counterexample as well-since L is fuzzy). So we know that L is consistent (because L is consistent).</p><p>Thus we can use Lemma 28 to prove that L is a logic with Baaz delta.

Then for each theory T and formula ϕ it holds: T ϕ iff T | L ϕ. Proof One direction is Lemma 6. Reverse direction: from Lemma 8 we get Lind T ∈ MOD(L) and for Lind T -evaluation e defined as e(ψ) = [ψ] T holds e ∈ Mod(T, Lind T ). Thus from T | L ϕ we get that [ϕ] T = e(ϕ) ∈ D Lind T and so T ϕ.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>) A weakly implicative logic L has prelinearity property (PP) if for each theory T we get T χ whenever T, ϕ → ψ χ and T, ψ → ϕ χ . Definition 26 (Subdirect decomposition) A weakly implicative logic L has subdirect decomposition property (SDP) if each ordered L-matrix is a subdirect product of linear L-matrices. Theorem 2 (Characterization of fuzzy logics) A weakly implicative logic is a fuzzy logic iff it has LEP. Proof Assume that L is a fuzzy logic. If T ϕ, then there is a linear L-matrix B and B-evaluation e such that e(ϕ) ∈ D B . We define T = T ∪ {ψ | e(ψ) ∈ D B }. Obviously T ⊆ T and T ϕ. Since ≤ B is a linear order we get e(χ ) ≤ B e(δ) or e(δ) ≤ B e(χ ) for each χ and δ. Thus either e(χ → δ) ∈ D B or e(δ → χ) ∈ D B .</figDesc></figure>

Using PP of L we know that σ (T ) L σ χ. Definition of L completes the proof of this part. Now we can define theory T = {c(v a 1 , . . . , v a n ) ↔ v c B (a 1 ,...,a n ) | (c, n) ∈ L and a 1 , . . . , a n ∈ A} ∪ {v a | a ∈ D}. Observe that B is an L -matrix. Let us define B-evaluation e(v a ) = a and observe that e ∈ Mod(T, B). Now we show T v a → v b iff a ≤ b: one direction is simple (from e ∈ Mod(T, B) we get that e(v a ) → B e(v b ) ∈ D and so a ≤ b); the other direction is similar (if a ≤ b then a → b ∈ D thus T v a→b and so T v a → v b</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Acknowledgements Special thanks go to Libor B ěhounek for helping me to create the notion of weakly implicative logics in the current general form (by his constant "Do you really need to assume …"). Then, I would like to thank Josep Maria Font for helping me a lot, mainly by pointing me to the important results related to my work which I was not aware of, and for suggesting the name "weakly implicative logics". Finally, I would like to thank to both of them and to Rostislav Horčík and Petr Hájek for the repeated reading of the drafts of this paper and helping me to improve it a lot in many aspects.</p></div>
