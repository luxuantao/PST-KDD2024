<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Irregular streaks are important clues for Melanoma (a potentially fatal form of skin cancer) diagnosis using dermoscopy images. This paper extends our previous algorithm to identify the absence or presence of streaks in a skin lesions, by further analyzing the appearance of detected streak lines, and performing a three-way classification for streaks, Absent, Regular, and Irregular, in a pigmented skin lesion. In addition, the directional pattern of detected lines is analyzed to extract their orientation features in order to detect the underlying pattern. The method uses a graphical representation to model the geometric pattern of valid streaks and the distribution and coverage of the structure. Using these proposed features of the valid streaks along with the color and texture features of the entire lesion, an accuracy of 76.1% and weighted average Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 85% is achieved for classifying dermoscopy images into streaks Absent, Regular, or Irregular on 945 images compiled from atlases and the internet without any exclusion criteria. This challenging dataset is the largest validation dataset for streaks detection and classification published to date. The data set has also been applied to the 2-class sub-problems of Absent/Present classification (accuracy of 78.3% with AUC of 83.2%) and to Regular/Irregular classification (accuracy 83.6% with AUC of 88.9%). When the method was tested on a cleaned subset of 300 images randomly selected from the 945 images, the AUC increased to 91.8%, 93.2% and 90.9% for the Absent/Regular/Irregular, Absent/Present, and Regular/Irregular problems, respectively.</p></div>

In conjunction with the fact that the incidence of the disease has been increasing rapidly and steadily in the last thirty years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, there is an urgent need for early detection tools.</p><p>A popular in-vivo noninvasive imaging tool among dermatologists is dermoscopy, also known as epiluminescence microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Specially trained dermatologists, dermoscopists, can use the tool to examine pigmented skin lesions based on a set of complex visual patterns, such as streaks, pigmented networks, blue white veil, dots, and globules <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. According to the presence, absence and the degree of irregularity of these visual patterns, a diagnosis can be derived by following one of the dermoscopic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Streaks, one of the important visual features, can be considered interchangeably with radial streaming or pseudopods because of the same histopathological correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Radial streaming is a linear extension of pigment at the periphery of a lesion as radially arranged linear structures in the growth direction, and pseudopods represent finger-like projections of dark pigment (brown to black) at the periphery of the lesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">1-a</ref> shows an example of a lesion with the radial streaming pattern, enlarged in 1-b. Figure <ref type="figure">1-c</ref> shows an example of a lesion with the pseudopods pattern. The enlarged image is shown in 1-d. Streaks are local dermoscopic features of skin lesions, however when streaks appear symmetrically over the entire lesion (as seen in Figure . 1-a), the feature is referred as a starburst pattern.</p><p>Streaks are important morphologic expressions of malignant melanoma, specifically melanoma in the radial growth phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Irregular streaks are one of the most critical features (included in almost all of dermoscopy algorithms) that show high association with melanoma. In addition, Menzies et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> found pseudopods to be one of the most specific features of superficial spreading melanoma which is a subset of malignant melanoma. Furthermore, symmetric streaks (starburst pattern) are one of the specific dermoscopic criteria to differentiate usually benign Spitz nevi (a dark nevus common in children) from melanoma, thus increasing diagnostic accuracy for pigmented Spitz nevi from 56% to 93% <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, all lesions in adults exhibiting a starburst pattern should be excised for histopathological evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows lesions with Absent, Regular, and Irregular streaks.</p><p>Based on the clinical definitions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Irregular streaks are never distributed regularly or symmetrically around the lesion. They also should not be clearly attached to pigment network lines. These definitions are used later in the paper to define discriminative models towards automated Regular/Irregular (a) is taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, (b) and (c) are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with permission.</p><p>classifications of streaks.</p><p>Automating the recognition of streaks would help in building a computer-aided system for melanoma detection. Such a system would not only help physicians diagnose melanoma as a second reader, it could also teach the technique of dermoscopy. This paper presents a novel automated method, which builds upon and extends the earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> identifying the presence of valid streak lines from the set of candidate streak lines. This method analyzes further the orientation and spatial arrangement of streak lines and classifies the lesion as a lesion with Absent, Regular, and Irregular streaks.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes previous work on streaks analysis in dermoscopy images. Section 3 describes the new contributions in this paper, analyzing streak orientation, feature extraction and classification.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PREVIOUS WORK</head><p>As a fundamental step towards computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancers, automatic detection and analysis of local dermoscopic structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and global patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> have been frequently addressed in the literature. However, even though the presence of Irregular streaks is highly suggestive for malignancy of a lesion, the modeling, detection and analysis of streak lines and starburst pattern have very rarely been used for automated skin lesion diagnosis. There have been only a few previous studies directly on streak detection. Fleming et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> first proposed and outlined a method to detect streaks; they argued that the presence and absence of radial streaming and pseudopods and their characteristics could be tested from a skeleton of the pigment network. However, they did not publish the details of their algorithm. Betta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> developed a method in which streaks were detected by simultaneously looking for occurrence of finger-like tracks along the contour of a lesion, and brown pigmentation for the corresponding region. Dividing an image into 16 sub-images, they computed, in each sub-image, the irregularity of the lesion border and also the hue component of the original color image in the HSV color space <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The final diagnostic decision was made by a simple threshold on these computed values. Also in a recent work, Mirzaalian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> combined a physicsbased flux model and machine-learning approach to classify streaks in dermoscopic images. Although the methodology is interesting, it has been tested on only ninety-nine dermoscopic images with wide exclusion criteria.</p><p>Our previous method for detecting the presence and absence of streaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> was tested on a large database of 300 skin lesions. Because this paper's algorithm to classify a lesion into Absent, Regular, and Irregular is an extension of our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the previous algorithm which utilizes a fingerprint recognition model is briefly outlined here</p><p>The algorithm to locate streak lines is divided into four steps: preprocessing, blob detection, feature selection and two-class classification. In the preprocessing step, lesions are segmented using Wighton et al.'s method <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Then lesions are oriented with the major axis parallel to the x-axis and their sizes are standardized. Then the RGB skin images are converted to L*a*b*, and L* is used for the rest of the analysis.</p><p>In the blob detection step, linear structures with a Gaussian cross-section profile near the border are located by four Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filters with different sizes, hsize = 3, 5, 7, 9 such as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h(x, y) = ∇ 2 [g(x, y) * f (x, y)] = [∇ 2 g(x, y)] * f (x, y) (1) ∇ 2 g(x, y) = ( x 2 + y 2 -2σ 2 σ 4 ) -(x 2 +y 2 ) 2σ 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where f (x, y) is the intensity value at (x, y), g(x, y) is the Gaussian filter whose standard deviation σ is set to a small value of 0.1, in order to achieve high sensitivity even to a small change in intensity. 25 experiments with 5 different sigmas and 5 filter sizes were performed, and the results show that the current setting gives the best results. At the end, the union of the results from the four scales were used to form a multiscale result.</p><p>After finding linear structures, their orientation is estimated using the Averaged Squared Gradient Flow (ASGF) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, a technique commonly used in fingerprint detection. A squared gradient vector G s at the pixel (x, y) is defined from a gradient vector [G x , G y ] T by doubling its angle and squaring its magnitude such as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[ G s,x G s,y ] = [ G ρ 2 cos(2G θ ) G ρ 2 sin(2G θ ) ] = [ G 2 x -G 2 y 2G x G y ]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G ρ = √ G 2 y + G 2 x , G θ = tan -1 (G y , G x )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The average directional flow for a block can be determined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ G s,x G s,y ] = 1 |W | [ ∑ W G 2 x -G 2 y ∑ W 2G x G y ]<label>(5)</label></formula><p>For each block the reliability of the local orientation (the coherence of the squared gradients) is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Reliability = | ∑ W (G s,x , G s,y )| ∑ W |(G s,x , G s,y )|<label>(6)</label></formula><p>When all squared gradient vectors inside a block are pointing in the exactly the same direction, Reliability is 1. On the other hand, a value 0 indicates the vectors point in random directions. Reliability is used to filter the gradient vectors; only those vectors with Reliability greater than 0.5 are kept. The ridge frequency, the frequency of the detected linear parallel structures, is determined by rotating the block so that the ridges are vertical. The columns are projected down to find the peaks. The frequency of ridges is calculated by dividing the distance between the first and last peaks by (number of peaks -1). The candidate linear streak structures can then be enhanced by a Gabor filter tuned with the ridges frequency and orientation such as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">g(x, y; f, θ, σ) = exp ( - x ′2 + y ′2 2σ 2 ) cos (2πf x ′ ) ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>x ′ = x cos θ + y sin θ, y ′ = -x sin θ + y cos θ (8)</p><p>Then 25 features are extracted from the candidate linear streak structures and from the lesion to be used for the two-class classification. One set of 12 features is based on properties of the detected candidate streak lines. There are three structural, six chromatic and three textural features. Another feature set contains the 13 common color and texture features of the entire lesion. These 25 features are fed to a SimpleLogistic classifier implemented by Weka. Testing the 2-class algorithm for the absence and presence of streaks, using 10 fold cross-validation on 300 dermoscopic images (105 Absent and 195 Present), an accuracy of 0.85 (precision = 0.835 and recall = 0.87) was achieved. The accuracy for starburst pattern detection was 0.815.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. METHOD FOR 3-CLASS CLASSIFICATION FOR STREAKS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DETECTION</head><p>The method for recognizing partial and complete radial streaming patterns builds upon and extends the earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, through identification of valid streak lines from the set of candidate streak lines, to reduce false positive streaks such as hairs and skin lines. The method also extends the analysis to identify the orientation and spatial arrangement of streak lines. These novel geometric features are used to identify not only the presence of streak lines, but whether or not they are Irregular or Regular; important for melanoma diagnosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Identifying valid streak lines from candidate streaks</head><p>Skin lesions are mainly circular in dermoscopy images, but they can be any shape. The lesion shape is generalised as an ellipse that has the same normalized second central moments as the lesion region. Two foci F 1 and F 2 are computed using the eccentricity of the ellipse. To test whether a line segment, for example the red line segment with the angle β 1 with respect to the horizontal direction and the centroid of A 1 in Figure <ref type="figure">3-a</ref>, is a streak or not, A 1 is connected to F 1 and F 2 and the angle between A 1 F 1 and A 1 F 2 is computed and its bisector line (A 1 B 1 ) is found. It is expected that the orientation of a true streak line segment will coincide with the bisector line A 1 B 1 . To test such a condition, the angle between A 1 B 1 and the line joining the foci F 1 F 2 (α 1 ) is compared to the orientation angle β 1 of the line. All orientations counterclockwise from the horizontal axis are measured in the range of [0, 2π]. By comparing |α -β| to a constant threshold of π/6, non-streak line segments are eliminated from the set of detected lines, and reliable line segments at every scale are found to form a multi-scale result to be used for feature extraction. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>-a, the line segment with centroid A 1 will be kept, but the line segment with the centroid A 2 will be removed. Reliable lines detected after orientation enhancement are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>-b, and the result of valid streaks selection is illustrated in the Figure <ref type="figure">3-c</ref>. These valid streaks are ordered in the direction of the red arrow from 0 to 2π for feature extraction in the next step.</p><p>Based on the mathematical definitions of streaks proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, a new set of 18 features is proposed for streaks, called STR (streaks), which includes three Structural, three Geometric, six Orientation, and six Chromatic characteristics of valid streaks. Common color and texture features <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> of the lesion itself, called LCT (Lesion Color Texture) has also been used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. New STR features</head><p>STR is a clinically inspired feature set, based on the mathematical definitions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to model characteristics of Absent, Regular, and Irregular streaks.</p><p>1) Geometric Graph Features (3 features):: Clinically, there is an emphasis on the 'uniformity' and smoothness of the orientation change in streaks for irregularity detection. There is also another important characteristic which is connectivity of the structure that represents the completeness of the pattern. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Sadeghi et al. proposed the 'Density Ratio' feature which represents the density of the dermoscopy structure called pigment network (PN). A similar concept has been used here with some modifications to measure the density of streaks on the image. This feature is useful to discriminate Absent images from Present images. For geometric analysis, a graph of the N valid streak lines found in the previous section was created by reducing each line L to v n nodes, based on the average length of streaks in the image. For N lines, the total number of nodes equals to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">|V | = N ∑ i=1 (( |L i | ∑ N j=1 |L j |/N ) + 1)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where |L i | is the length of the line segment L i in the image and ∑ N j=1 |L j |/N denotes the average length of streaks. This helps to increase the contribution of longer streak lines in feature calculation while shorter streak lines (shorter than the average length) will only have one node in the graph. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates the node placement on streak lines based on their size to create the streak graph G. Detected streaks on a sample image are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4-(a</ref>) and corresponding nodes and graph lines for the green box are shown on Figure <ref type="figure">4-(b</ref>) where the arrows point to the two streak lines longer than the average size of line segments that contribute more than one node to the graph. The white arrow points to a streak line longer than the average length, and the yellow arrow points to a streak line which is longer than 2 times the average length. All of the other streaks are shorter than the average length and contribute only one node each.</p><p>Density Ratio: A graph G = (V, E) consists of pairs with vertices (nodes) v ∈ V and edges E⊆ (V × V ). The standard Density of graph G is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> as which is the ratio of edges in G to the maximum possible number of edges |E|, and |V | is the number of vertices in graph G. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the density measure of the graph of streaks was defined as following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Density = 2 × |E| |V | × (|V | -1)<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">Density streaks = |E|(log |E|) |V | × log(LesionSize) (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where LesionSize is the size of the segmented lesion in pixels. The density feature is useful in discriminating between the Absent and Present images, however it does not say much about the regularity or irregularity of the streaks, nor the completeness and coverage of the pattern. Often there is a complete pattern with a high graph density in Regular streaks all over the lesion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>-a, 5-c, 5-e), whereas in Irregular streaks, there may be a dense graph but over only small parts of the lesion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>-b, 5-d, 5f). Therefore, another measurement is needed to find out if the dense pattern is distributed all over the lesion or if it is just partially covering the lesion. Thus two new features called pattern coverage, and completeness are proposed.</p><p>Coverage: To measure the coverage of the streaks pattern, the histogram of the number of streaks in different areas (arcs) of the lesion is computed for bins of π/6 in the range of [0, 2π]. According to the mathematical definition of streaks inspired by the clinical definitions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, streaks are 3 or more linear structures co-radially oriented over the boundary of the lesion. Therefore the graph coverage was defined as the fraction of bins with more than 2 streak lines. Coverage ranges from 0 to 1 and the perfect coverage is equal to one that often belongs to Regular streaks which are distributed symmetrically among the bins (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5-g</ref>). Lesions with Irregular streaks often have a lower Coverage because of the partial distribution pattern (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5-h</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>-a shows a lesion divided by red arrows into 12 areas and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>-g shows the Coverage histogram of the lesion with Regular streaks. As shown in the figure, the number of streaks in the horizontal bins π/6,π, 7π/6, and 2π are often higher than other bins because of the growth pattern of the lesion in the horizontal (major) axis.</p><p>Completeness: If each vertex v i in G is reachable from the other vertices v j , then G is connected and a maximal connected subgraph G w = G(V w , E w ) is the largest connected subset W of the vertex set V for which no larger set Z containing V is connected. Based on the above definitions Pattern Completeness is equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Completeness = Density streaks |G w | (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where |G w | is equal to the number of disconnected subgraphs (components) in the image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Orientation Features (6 features)::</head><p>The orientation information of valid streaks can also reveal valuable information about the presence and regularity or irregularity of streaks. The valid streaks are ordered in order to track the orientation change to detect the underlying pattern, if any. The line segments are ordered based on their location and their orientation from the major axis starting from 0 to 2π in the counter-clockwise direction (Figure <ref type="figure">3-c</ref>). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>-a, streaks are ordered in the x axis and their corresponding orientation in the y axis are shown for a typical lesion with Regular streaks (in red) and a lesion with Irregular streaks (in green). Regular streaks tend to have smooth orientation changes without major jumps between consecutive data points, compared with Irregular streaks. After ordering the line segments, based on the fact that they should be co-radially oriented, linear regression is applied to measure the error from an expected perfect orientation change pattern, so that informative features of regularity or irregularity of the orientation change can be extracted. Assume that the ordered valid streaks x i are indexed by the subscript i, where i ranges from 1 to N (the total number of valid streaks), and y i is the corresponding orientation. In the linear regression, the predicted orientation y i can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">y i = β 0 + β 1 x i f or i = 1, . . . , N<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where β 0 and β 1 are the intercept and slope of the regression line. The residual, e i = y i -y i , is the difference between  the predicted orientation of the line segment i by the model ( y i ), and the true direction of line (y i ). The slope of the fitted line, β 1 , is used as one of the orientation features. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> shows also the linear regression on the orientation data of the Regular and Irregular images. The slope β 1 for the Regular streaks and Irregular streaks are 0.67 and 4.6, respectively. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the model is calculated as eqn ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">14</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">RM SE = √ ∑ i ( y i -y i ) 2 N (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Experiments show that images with Regular streaks have lower β 1 and RMSE which is because of the large number of streaks in the x axis with smooth orientation change in y. The bottom part of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> shows the residuals of the regression corresponding to the ordered streaks above. In this example, the RMSE of the Irregular streaks (green plot) is 47.7 and the RMSE of the Regular streaks (red plot) is 13.2. Another feature involving residuals is the RMSE of the first derivative of orientations as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">RM SE d = √ ∑ i ( y ′ i -y ′ i ) 2 N (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where y ′ i and y ′ i are the derivative of y i and y i . Another is a normalized count of outlier streak lines, where outliers are defined as lines which are oriented more than +/-30 degrees outside the defined range. These outliers can be seen outside the blue box in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. All residuals outside of the blue box in the bottom figure are counted and normalized by the number of line segments.</p><p>The entropy of the lines orientations and residuals are also used, to characterise the randomness or existence of a specific pattern in the orientation change. The entropy is a statistical measure of randomness and the motivating idea behind the entropy is that Irregular streaks with unpredictable orientation change have a high entropy while Regular streaks with a specific smooth orientation change show a relatively low entropy. For X with N lines {x i : i = 1, . . . , N }, entropy is denoted by H(X), and is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">H(X) = - n ∑ i=1 p(x i ) log b p(x i )<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where p(x i ) is the probability function of x i and contains the histogram counts of b bins where b = 2π π/18 = 36.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Chromatic Features of Streaks (6 features)::</head><p>The color features of streaks include the mean and standard deviation of intensity values in S and V channel of HSV color space as well as the choice of the color channel for luminance image (L* in the experiment) used for streak detection over segmented streak lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Structural Features (3 features)::</head><p>Diagnostically important characteristics of streaks include the shape, length, and variability of lines. Therefore, the length of each line is computed, which is the number of pixels of the line segment. The features are the mean of the lengths of streaks, and the total number of line segments in the image. The ratio of the streak size to the lesion size (# of streak pixels/# of pixels in the lesion area) is also included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Lesion Color Texture features:LCT (13 features)</head><p>LCT includes the following 13 features: The mean, standard deviation and reciprocal of coefficient of variation (mean/stdev) of the values in S and V from HSV and L* of L*a*b*, and four of the classical texture measures; energy, contrast, correlation, and homogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. These textural features are calculated from a Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The GLCM, constructed over the entire lesion, is a tabulation of how often different combinations of pixel brightness values (gray levels) occur in a pixel pair in an image.</p><p>The streak detection algorithm and the validation procedure outlined in the paper likely miss and/or exclude some "true" streak lines. In addition, the streak-specific features reported in Section 3.2 may not cover "all" streak properties. Thus the lesion color texture feature (LCT) set was constructed, in order to capture the "missing" information globally from the entire lesion. (As seen in the quantitative results in Section 4.2, combining LCT and STR features achieved the highest accuracy and confirmed our hypothesis). Potentially, the LCT set could include other dermoscopic features such as border asymmetry, irregularity and the color counts. However, the LCT set was restricted to the color and texture information that is more obviously useful for modeling streak patterns. In future, these streak features will be compared with other dermoscopic features to determine the predictive power of each of them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Classification</head><p>Finally, these 31 features are fed into the SimpleLogistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> classifier implemented in Weka (a general data mining tool developed by University of Waikato in New Zealand) which uses a powerful boosting algorithm, LogitBoost <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Boosting is a method for combining the performance of many weak features to produce a powerful classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. SimpleLogistic fits logistic models by applying LogitBoost with simple regression functions as base learners. This choice of classifier was better than others such as Logistic, and BayesNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EVALUATION AND RESULTS</head><p>In the following section, results for 3 sets of features (LCT, STR, and LCT+STR) are reported in classifying lesions into 3-classes of streaks Absent/Regular/Irregular, 2-classes of streaks Absent/Present, and the 2-classes of streaks Regular/Irregular.</p><p>In these experiments, two image sets with 945 and 300 images (a subset of the 945) were used to evaluate the proposed method. First, to evaluate the method on an inclusive image set, 945 images from different resources were used, without excluding any. Some of these images were challenging due to the acquisition parameters such as lighting and magnification, being partial (entire lesion was not visible), or due to the presence of an unreasonable amount of occlusion by either oil or hair. These challenging images are usually discarded from test sets in previous work, but we kept these images in the test set. work, but these images were kept in this test set. The method was applied to this set of 945 dermoscopic images (570 Absent, 245 Irregular, and 130 Regular) taken from three different resources. The first subset included 745 images from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> where each image was labeled as (Absent, Regular or Irregular) representing the presence and regularity of streaks in the image. For the second subset, 100 images reported as streak Regular or Irregular were collected from the web, and for the third subset 100 images with Absent, Regular or Irregular labels were taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. By adding all these three subsets, a set of 945 images (Set1) was used for the first experiment to demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over a large number of dermoscopic images from different imaging devices.</p><p>In the second experiment, a set of 300 "clean" and high resolution images were randomly selected (105 Absent, 110 Irregular, and 85 Regular) with a complete lesion and without artifacts such as hair or oil bubbles (Set2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Evaluation-Qualitative Results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> illustrates five examples of qualitative results with streak lines overlaid on the images, and associated streak graphs. The first row of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> shows an Absent image, with a few lines detected as potential streak lines in the second column and very sparse and low density graphs in the third column. The second and third rows illustrate results of streak detection and graphs on two images with Regular streaks in which Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>-d has the radial streaming streaks and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>-g shows pseudopod streaks, demonstrating how the method successfully detects pseudopods. The last two rows of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> show melanomas, with Irregular streaks. The high difference in graph densities and spatial arrangements and distribution is clear for different classes.</p><p>Streaks on dermoscopy images usually are difficult to detect since they are not perfect linear structures, but often fuzzy and low-contrast oriented intensities. Furthermore, streaks may have unpredictable spatial distribution (partial pattern) with just a few streak lines in a small region of a lesion. Therefore, it is not easy to detect them using general oriented pattern analysis. Detection and diagnosis of Absent, Regular and Irregular streaks is challenging even for experts. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> there was an average disagreement of 24.5% on 2-class problem (Absent/Present) between 40 Experts. The difficulty and disagreement is even more on the 3-class problem for detecting Irregular streaks. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> shows 3 examples of challenging images from the difficult image set with 945 images.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>-a shows the result of streak detection on a difficult case (case 43, page 150 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>) that is labeled as: Absent (33.3%), Regular (17.9%), and Irregular (48.7%). The proposed method assigns a label of Irregular with 68% probability. Detected streak lines are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>-b in green. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8-c</ref> shows an Absent image that has co-radial linear pigmented structures which belong to clods and maple leaf structures in a pigmented basal cell carcinoma. The method classified the image correctly because of the low number of detected streak lines and the low density and coverage of the graph. Another challenging lesion with a strong pigment   network is shown in (e) and the result of streak detection is shown in (f) with a very few false positive lines in green, and correctly classified as Absent. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>-g shows one of the missclassified images. It is an Absent image with unspecific patterns that was diagnosed to be excised, but due to the linear co-radial stuctures in the boundary area of the lesion, it is missclassified as Irregular.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) (k) (l) (m) (n) (o)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Evaluation-Quantitative Results</head><p>To evaluate the generalizability of the method, a ten-fold cross-validation was conducted in the first experiment on Set1 with 5 scales (four scales of hsize k = 3, 5, 7, 9 and union of these scales) in 4 color channels, in total 20 settings.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, by combining the new features and the common color and texture features, an accuracy of 76.1% and AUC of 85% was achieved for classifying streaks into Absent, Regular, and Irregular, on N=945 images (Set1) without any exclusion criteria. The method was also validated on a "clean" sub-set of Set1 with N=300 images with high contrast and no artifacts. The classification accuracy for the 3-class problem on the second set is 80.3% with AUC of 91.8%. The method also works well on discriminating Regular streaks from Irregular ones with AUC of 88.9% on Set1 with N=945 images.</p><p>As mentioned before, Table II reports the weighted average of the performance measures. To show the class specific results on Set1, Figures 9 and 10 illustrate a detailed evaluation on the 3-class (Absent/Regular/Irregular) and the 2-class (Absent/Present and Regular/Irregular) problems. Figures <ref type="figure">9-a</ref> It is not possible to compare these results directly with previous work by others, because it is not known which images were used in their experiments. However, a difficult dataset of 945 images was deliberately created, by not excluding oily, hairy, low-contrast, and partial images to demonstrate the strength of the method. Images used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> are from the same source used in these experiments. Assuming the difficulty level of the images in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is similar to those of Set2 with 300 images, this approach achieves an AUC of 93.2% compared with 83% reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> for the 2-class Absent/Present classification on 99 images. Finally, the result for the 2-class Absent/Present classification using Set2, is compared with our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Both experiments analyzed the same 300 images, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> uses only 3 STR, 6 chromatic features and 3 texture characteristics. Results show Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Accuracy, and AUC of 0.85, 0.87, 0.86, 0.85 and 0.905 for <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> compared with (0.893, 0.893, 0.893, 0.893 and 0.932 for the current work respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>This paper has presented an automatic approach for detection of Absent, Regular, and Irregular streak patterns on 945 dermoscopic images, by extending our previous techniques of detecting streak line candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Orientation estimation and correction is applied to detect low contrast and fuzzy streak lines and the detected line segments are used to extract clinically inspired feature sets for orientation analysis of the structure. A graph representation is used to analyze the geometric pattern of the structure over the lesion with new features designed to model the distribution and coverage of the structure. WThese results demonstrate that the proposed approach can locate, visualize, and classify streaks as Absent, Regular, and Irregular in dermoscopy images. Therefore, it can be used in computer-aided melanoma diagnosis using scoring methods. Furthermore, since the proposed method locates streaks and provides a qualitative analysis, it can be used to highlight suspicious areas for experts' diagnosis and for visualization and training purposes.</p><p>The method has been successfully applied in the specific case of automatic detection and classification of streaks, which are represented by linear radial patterns. These oriented patterns, produced by propagation, accretion, and deformation in radial phase, are common in nature and also in different fields of computer vision, and they are an important class for visual analysis. Our approach may help to understand such patterns, by analysis of co-radial linear structures in low contrast and low resolution images, in other applications such as video capsule endoscopy, mammography, iris detection in retina images, sunspot modeling, industry and manufacturing.</p><p>The current algorithm generalizes the lesion shape to an ellipse (Section 3.1). Despite the fact that many skin lesions are circular, this generalization may reduce the detection accuracy due to the fact that a skin lesion can be any shape. Also to make sure that irregular streaks are not removed (as much as possible) in the false positive removal by orientation analysis, a threshold of 30 degrees has been used for the difference from the desired orientation.</p><p>In future work, the segmented line segments will be investigated more locally to deal with this problem more accurately, by carefully analyzing the lesion shape and fitting multiple ellipses. In such cases, as many streaks as possible would be captured.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
