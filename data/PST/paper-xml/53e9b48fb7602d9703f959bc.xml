<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When we pause to reflect on Ramanujan's life, we see that there were certain events that seemingly were necessary in order that Ramanujan and his mathematics be brought to posterity. One of these was V. Ramaswamy Aiyer's founding of the Indian Mathematical Society on 4 April 1907, for had he not launched the Indian Mathematical Society, then the next necessary episode, namely, Ramanujan's meeting with Ramaswamy Aiyer at his office in Tirtukkoilur in 1910, would also have not taken place. Ramanujan had carried with him one of his notebooks, and Ramaswamy Aiyer not only recognized the creative spirit that produced its contents, but he also had the wisdom to contact others, such as R. Ramachandra Rao, in order to bring Ramanujan's mathematics to others for appreciation and support. The large mathematical community that has thrived on Ramanujan's discoveries for nearly a century owes a huge debt to V. Ramaswamy Aiyer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. THE BEGINNING. Toward the end of the first paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[58, p. 36</ref>] that Ramanujan published in England, at the beginning of Section 13, he writes, "I shall conclude this paper by giving a few series for 1/π." (In fact, Ramanujan concluded his paper a couple of pages later with another topic: formulas and approximations for the perimeter of an ellipse.) After sketching his ideas, which we examine in detail in Sections 3 and 9, Ramanujan records three series representations for 1/π. As is customary, set (1.4)</p><p>The first two formulas, (1.2) and <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref>, appeared in the Walt Disney film High School Musical, starring Vanessa Anne Hudgens, who plays an exceptionally bright high school student named Gabriella Montez. Gabriella points out to her teacher that she had incorrectly written the left-hand side of (1.3) as 8/π instead of 16/π on the blackboard. After first claiming that Gabriella is wrong, her teacher checks (possibly Ramanujan's Collected Papers?) and admits that Gabriella is correct. Formula (1.2) was correctly recorded on the blackboard.</p><p>After offering the three formulas for 1/π given above, at the beginning of Section 14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[58, p. 37]</ref>, Ramanujan claims, "There are corresponding theories in which q is replaced by one or other of the functions" q r := q r (x) := exp -π csc(π/r</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) 2 F 1 1 r , r -1 r ; 1; 1 -x 2 F 1 1 r , r -1 r ; 1; x , (<label>1.5)</label></formula><p>where r = 3, 4, or 6, and where 2 F 1 denotes one of the hypergeometric functions p F p-1 , p ≥ 1, which are defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p F p-1 a 1 , . . . , a p ; b 1 , . . . , b p-1 ; x := ∞ n=0 (a 1 ) n • • • (a p ) n (b 1 ) n • • • (b p-1 ) n x n n! , |x|<label>&lt; 1.</label></formula><p>(The meaning of q is explained in Section 3.) Ramanujan then offers 14 further series representations for 1/π. Of these, 10 belong to the quartic theory, i.e., for r = 4; 2 belong to the cubic theory, i.e., for r = 3; and 2 belong to the sextic theory, i.e., for r = 6. Ramanujan never returned to the "corresponding theories" in his published papers, but six pages in his second notebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> are devoted to developing these theories, with all of the results on these six pages being proved in a paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> by Berndt, S. Bhargava, and F. G. Garvan. That the classical hypergeometric function 2 F 1 ( 1 2 , 1 2 ; 1; x) in the classical theory of elliptic functions could be replaced by one of the three hypergeometric functions above and concomitant theories developed is one of the many incredibly ingenious and useful ideas bequeathed to us by Ramanujan. The development of these theories is far from easy and is an active area of contemporary research.</p><p>All 17 series for 1/π were discovered by Ramanujan in India before he arrived in England, for they can be found in his notebooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, which were written prior to Ramanujan's departure for England. In particular, (1.2), <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref>, and (1.4) can be found on page 355 in his second notebook and the remaining 14 series are found in his third notebook <ref type="bibr">[59, p. 378]</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr">[14, pp. 352-354]</ref>. It is interesting that (1.2), <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">(1.4)</ref> are also located on a page published with Ramanujan's lost notebook <ref type="bibr">[60, p. 370</ref>]; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE MAIN ACTORS FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF RAMANU-JAN.</head><p>Fourteen years after the publication of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, the first mathematician to address Ramanujan's formulas was Sarvadaman Chowla <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[39, pp. 87-91, 116-119]</ref>, who gave the first published proof of a general series representation for 1/π and used it to derive (1.2) of Ramanujan's series for 1/π [57, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>)]. We briefly discuss Chowla's ideas in Section 4.</p><p>Ramanujan's series were then forgotten by the mathematical community until November, 1985, when R. William Gosper, Jr. used one of Ramanujan's series, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">9801 π √ 8 = ∞ n=0 (4n)! (1103 + 26390n) (n!) 4 396 4n , (<label>2.1)</label></formula><p>to calculate 17,526,100 digits of π, which at that time was a world record. There was only one problem with his calculation- <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref> had not yet been proved. However, a comparison of Gosper's calculation of the digits of π with the previous world record held by Y. Kanada made it extremely unlikely that (2.1) was incorrect.</p><p>In 1987, Jonathan and Peter Borwein <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> succeeded in proving all 17 of Ramanujan's series for 1/π. In a subsequent series of papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, they established several further series for 1/π, with one of their series <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> yielding roughly fifty digits of π per term. The Borweins were also keen on calculating the digits of π, and accounts of their work can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>At about the same time as the Borweins were devising their proofs, David and Gregory Chudnovsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> also derived series representations for 1/π and, in particular, used their series</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 π = 12 ∞ n=0 (-1) n (6n)! (n!) 3 (3n)! 13591409 + 545140134n (640320) 3n+3/2 (2.2)</formula><p>to calculate a world record 2,260,331,336 digits of π. The series (2.2) yields 14 digits of π per term. A popular account of the Chudnovskys' calculations can be found in a paper written for The New Yorker <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>The third author of the present paper and his coauthors (Berndt, S. H. Chan, A. Gee, W.-C. Liaw, Z.-G. Liu, V. Tan, and H. Verrill) in a series of papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> extended the ideas of the Borweins, in particular, without using Clausen's formula in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and derived general hypergeometric-like formulas for 1/π. We devote Section 8 of our survey to discussing some of their results.</p><p>Stimulated by the work and suggestions of the third author, the first two authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> systematically returned to Ramanujan's development in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> and employed his ideas in order not only to prove most of Ramanujan's original representations for 1/π but also to establish a plethora of new such identities as well. In another paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, motivated by the work of Jesús Guillera <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, who both experimentally and rigorously discovered many new series for both 1/π and 1/π 2 , the first two authors continued to follow Ramanujan's ideas and devised series representations for 1/π 2 .</p><p>In the survey which follows, we delineate the main ideas in Sections 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9, where the ideas of Ramanujan, the Borwein brothers, the Chudnovsky brothers, Chan and his coauthors, and the present authors, respectively, are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RAMANUJAN'S IDEAS.</head><p>To describe Ramanujan's ideas, we need several definitions from the classical theory of elliptic functions, which, in fact, we use throughout the paper. The complete elliptic integral of the first kind is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">K := K (k) := π/2 0 dϕ 1 -k 2 sin 2 ϕ , (<label>3.1)</label></formula><p>where k, 0 &lt; k &lt; 1, denotes the modulus. Furthermore, K := K (k ), where k := √ 1k 2 is the complementary modulus. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E := E(k) := π/2 0 1 -k 2 sin 2 ϕ dϕ. (<label>3.2)</label></formula><p>If q = exp(-π K /K ), then one of the central theorems in the theory of elliptic functions asserts that [13, p. 101, Entry 6]</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ϕ 2 (q) = 2 π K (k) = 2 F 1 ( 1 2 , 1 2 ; 1; k 2 ),<label>(3.3)</label></formula><p>where ϕ(q) in Ramanujan's notation (or ϑ 3 (q) in the classical notation) denotes the classical theta function defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ϕ(q) = ∞ j =-∞ q j 2 . (3.4)</formula><p>Note that, in the notation (1.5), q = q 2 and x = k 2 . The second equality in (3.3) follows from expanding the integrand in a binomial series and integrating termwise. Conversely, it is also valuable to regard k as a function of q, and so we write k = k(q). Let K , K , L, and L denote complete elliptic integrals of the first kind associated with the moduli k, k , , and , respectively. Suppose that, for some positive integer n,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">n K K = L L . (<label>3.5)</label></formula><p>A modular equation of degree n is an equation involving k and that is induced by <ref type="bibr">(3.5)</ref>. Modular equations are always algebraic equations. An example of a modular equation of degree 7 may be found later in <ref type="bibr">(9.18)</ref>. Alternatively, by (3.3), (3.5) can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. We often say that has degree n over k. Derivations of modular equations ultimately rest on (3.3). If we set K /K = √ n, so that q = e -π √ n , then the corresponding value of k, which is denoted by k n := k(e -π √ n ), is called the singular modulus. The multiplier m = m(q) is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">m := m(q) := 2 F 1 1 2 , 1 2 ; 1; k 2 (q) 2 F 1 1 2 , 1 2 ; 1; 2 (q) . (<label>3.6)</label></formula><p>We note here that, by (3.3), <ref type="bibr">(3.6)</ref>, and [13, Entry 3, p. 98; Entry 25(vii), p. 40], m(q) and k 2 (q) can be represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">m(q) = ϕ 2 (q) ϕ 2 (q n ) and k 2 (q) = 16q ψ 4 (q 2 ) ϕ 4 (q) ,</formula><p>respectively, where ϕ(q) is defined by (3.4) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ψ(q) = ∞ j =0 q j ( j +1)/2 .</formula><p>Thus, modular equations can also be written as theta function identities. Ramanujan begins Section 13 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> with a special case of Clausen's formula [23, p. 178, Proposition 5.6(b)], </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">4K 2 π 2 = ∞ j =0 ( 1 2 ) 3 j ( j!) 3 (2kk ) 2 j = 3 F 2 1 2 , 1 2 , 1 2 ; 1, 1; (2kk )</formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">q 1/3 (q 2 ; q 2 ) 4 ∞ = 1 4 kk 2/3 ∞ j =0 ( 1 2 ) 3 j ( j!) 3 (2kk ) 2 j , (<label>3.8)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(a; q) ∞ := (1 -a)(1 -aq)(1 -aq 2 ) • • • . (3.9)</formula><p>Logarithmically differentiating both sides in (3.8) with respect to k, we can easily shew that 1 -24</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">∞ j =1 jq 2 j 1 -q 2 j = (1 -2k 2 ) ∞ j =0 (3 j + 1) ( 1 2 ) 3 j ( j!) 3 (2kk ) 2 j . (3.10) But it follows from 1 - 3 π √ n -24 ∞ j =1 j e 2π j √ n -1 = K π 2 A(k) (3.11)</formula><p>where A(k) is a certain type of algebraic number, that, when q = e -π √ n , n being a rational number, the left-hand side of (3.10) can be expressed in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">A 2K π 2 + B π ,</formula><p>where A and B are algebraic numbers expressible by surds. Combining (3.7) and (3.10) in such a way as to eliminate the term (2K /π) 2 , we are left with a series for 1/π." He then gives the three examples (1.2)-(1.4).</p><p>Ramanujan's ideas will be described in more detail in Section 9. However, in closing this section, we note that the series on the left-hand sides of (3.10) and (3.11) is Ramanujan's Eisenstein series P(q 2 ), with q = e -π √ n in the latter instance, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">P(q) := 1 -24 ∞ j =1 jq j 1 -q j , |q| &lt; 1. (3.12)</formula><p>Ramanujan's derivation of (3.11) arises firstly from the transformation formula for P(q), which in turn is an easy consequence of the transformation formula for the Dedekind eta-function, given in (9.11) below. The second ingredient in deriving (3.11) is an identity for n P(q 2n ) -P(q 2 ) in terms of the moduli k and , where has degree n over k. Formula (3.8) follows from a standard theorem in elliptic functions that Ramanujan also recorded in his notebooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, [13, p. 124, Entry 12(iii)].</p><p>4. SARVADAMAN CHOWLA. Chowla's ideas reside in the classical theory of elliptic functions and are not unlike those that the Borweins employed several years later. We now briefly describe Chowla's approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[39, pp. 87-91, 116-119]</ref>. Using classical formulas of Cayley and Legendre relating the complete elliptic integrals K and E, defined by (3.1) and (3.2), respectively, he specializes them by setting K /K = √ n. He then defines</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">S r := ∞ j =0 j r ( 1 2 ) 3 j ( j!) 3 (2kk ) 2 j (4.1)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">T r := ∞ j =0 j r ( 1 4 ) 2 j ( j!) 2 (2kk ) 2 j . (4.2)</formula><p>Chowla then writes "Then it is known that, when k</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">≤ 1/ √ 2," 2K π = 1 + T 0 and 4K 2 π 2 = 1 + S 0 . (4.3)</formula><p>Chowla does not give his source for either formula, but the second formula in (4.3), as noted above, is a special case of Clausen's formula (3.7). The first formula is a special case of Kummer's quadratic transformation <ref type="bibr">[23, pp. 179-180]</ref>, which was also known to Ramanujan. Each of the formulas of (4.3) is differentiated twice with respect to k, and, without giving details, Chowla concludes that if</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">K /K = √ n, then 1 K = a 1 + b 1 T 0 + c 1 T 1 , K π = d 1 T 1 + e 1 T 2 , 1 π = a 2 S 0 + b 2 S 1 , 1 K 2 = a 3 + b 3 S 0 + c 3 S 1 + d 3 S 2 ,</formula><p>"where a 1 , b 1 , . . . are algebraic numbers." He then sets n = 3 and k = sin(π/12) in each of the four formulas above to deduce, in particular, identity (1.2) from the second formula above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">R. WILLIAM GOSPER, JR.</head><p>As we indicated in the Introduction, in November, 1985, Gosper employed a lisp machine at Symbolics and Ramanujan's series (2.1) to calculate 17,526,100 digits of π, which at that time was a world record. (During the 1980s and 1990s, Symbolics made a lisp-based workstation running an object-oriented programming environment. Unfortunately, the machines were too expensive for the needs of most customers, and the company went bankrupt before it could squeeze the architecture onto a chip.) Of the 17 series found by Ramanujan, this one converges the fastest, giving about 8 digits of π per term. At the time of Gosper's calculation, the world record for digits of π was about 16 million digits calculated by Y. Kanada. Before the Borwein brothers had later found a "conventional" proof of Ramanujan's series (2.1), they had shown that either (2.1) yields an exact formula for π or that it differs from π by more than 10 -3000000 . Thus, by demonstrating that his calculation of π agreed with that of Kanada, Gosper effectively had completed the Borweins' first proof of (2.1). However, Gosper's primary goal was not to eclipse Kanada's record but to study the (simple) continued fraction expansion of π for which he calculated 17,001,303 terms. In email letters from February, 1992 and May, 1993, Gosper offered the following remarks on his calculations:</p><p>Of course, what the scribblers always censor is that the digits were a by-product. I wanted to change the object of the game away from meaningless decimal digits.</p><p>I used what I call a resumable matrix tower to exactly compute an enormous rational equal to the sum of a couple of million terms of Ramanujan's 99 -4n series. I then divided to form the binary integer = floor(π2 58,000,000 ). I converted this to decimal and sent a summary to Kanada for comparison, and converted the binary fraction to a cf using an fft based scheme.</p><p>Gosper's world record was short lived, as in January, 1986, D. H. Bailey used an algorithm of the Borweins arising from a fourth-order modular equation to compute 29,360,000 digits of π. Gosper's calculation of the continued fraction expansion of π was motivated by the fact that many important mathematical constants do not have interesting decimal expansions but do have interesting continued fraction expansions. That continued fraction expansions are considerably more interesting than decimal expansions is a view shared by the Chudnovsky brothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Continued fraction expansions can often be used to distinguish a constant from others, while decimal expansions likely will be unable to do so. For example, the simple continued fraction of e, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">e = 2 + 1 1 + 1 2 + 1 1 + 1 1 + 1 4 + 1 1 + 1 1 + 1 6 + 1 1 + • • •</formula><p>has a pattern. On the contrary, taking a large random string of digits of e would not help one identify e.</p><p>It is an open problem if the simple continued fraction of π, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">π = 3 + 1 7 + 1 15 + 1 1 + 1 292 + 1 1 + 1 1 + 1 1 + 1 2 + 1 1 + 1 3 + 1 1 + 1 14 + 1 2 + 1 1 + 1 1 + 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 1 + 1 84 + 1 2 + 1 1 + 1 1 + 1 15 + 1 3 + 1 13 + 1 1 + 1 4 + 1 2 + 1 6 + • • • has a pattern.</formula><p>Gosper also derived a hypergeometric-like series representation for π, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">π = ∞ j =0 50 j -6 3 j j 2 j , (<label>5.1)</label></formula><p>which can be used to calculate any particular binary digit of π. See a paper by G. Almkvist, C. Krattenthaler, and J. Petersson <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for a proof of (5.1) as well as generalizations, which include the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 5.1. For each integer k ≥ 1, there exists a polynomial S k ( j) in j of degree 4k with rational coefficients such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">π = ∞ j =0 S k ( j)</formula><p>8k j 4k j (-4) k j .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">JONATHAN AND PETER BORWEIN.</head><p>One key to the work of both Ramanujan and Chowla in their derivations of formulas for 1/π is Clausen's formula for the square of a complete elliptic integral of the first kind or, by <ref type="bibr">(3.3)</ref>, for the square of the hypergeometric function 2 F 1 ( 1 2 , 1 2 ; 1; k 2 ). The aforementioned rendition (3.7) of Clausen's formula is not the most general version of Clausen's formula, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">2 F 2 1 a, b; a + b + 1 2 ; z = 3 F 2 2a, 2b, a + b; a + b + 1 2 , 2a + 2b; z . (6.1)</formula><p>Indeed, the work of many authors who have proved Ramanujan-like series for 1/π ultimately rests on special cases of (6.1). In particular, squares of certain other hypergeometric functions lead one to Ramanujan's alternative theories of elliptic functions.</p><p>A second key step is to find another formula for (K /π) 2 , which also contains another term involving 1/π. Combining the two formulas to eliminate the term (K /π) 2 then produces a hypergeometric-type series representation for 1/π. Evidently, unaware of Chowla's earlier work, the Borweins proceeded in a similar fashion and used Legendre's relation <ref type="bibr">[23, p. 24</ref>]</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">E(k)K (k) + E (k)K (k) -K (k)K (k) = π 2</formula><p>and other relations between elliptic integrals to produce such formulas.</p><p>Having derived a series representation for 1/π, one now faces the problem of evaluating the moduli and elliptic integrals that appear in the formulas. If q = e -π √ n , then for certain positive integers n one can evaluate the requisite quantities. This leads us to the definition of the Ramanujan-Weber class invariants. After Ramanujan, set</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">χ(q) := (-q; q 2 ) ∞ , |q| &lt; 1,<label>(6.2)</label></formula><p>where (a; q) ∞ is defined by (3.9).

Accordingly, we set α n := k 2 n .

In general, as n increases, the corresponding series for 1/π converges more rapidly. The series (2.2) is associated with the imaginary quadratic field Q( √ -163). The Borweins' proofs of all 17 of Ramanujan's series for 1/π can be found in their book <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Their derivations arise from several general hypergeometric-like series representations for 1/π given in terms of singular moduli, class invariants, and complete elliptic integrals <ref type="bibr">[23, pp. 181-184]</ref>. Another account of their work, but with fewer details, can be found in their paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> commemorating the centenary of Ramanujan's birth. Further celebrating the 100th anniversary of Ramanujan's birth, the Borweins derived further series for 1/π in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The series in this paper correspond to imaginary quadratic fields with class number 2, with one of their series corresponding to n = 427 and yielding about 25 digits of π per term. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the authors derived series for 1/π arising from fields with class number 3, with a series corresponding to n = 907 yielding about 37 or 38 digits of π per term. Their record is a series associated with a field of class number 4 giving about 50 digits of π per term; here, n = 1555 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">DAVID AND GREGORY CHUDNOVSKY.</head><p>In our Introduction we mentioned that the Chudnovsky brothers, Gregory and David, used (2.2) to calculate over 2 billion digits of π. They had first used (2.2) to calculate 1,130,160,664 digits of π in the fall of 1989 on a "borrowed" computer. They then built their own computer, "m zero," described colorfully in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, and set a world record of 2,260,321,336 digits of π. The world record for digits of π has been broken several times since then, and since it is not the purpose of this paper to delineate this computational history, we refrain from mentioning further records.</p><p>The Chudnovskys, among others, have extensively examined their calculations for patterns. It is a long outstanding conjecture that π is normal. In particular, for each k,</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">0 ≤ k ≤ 9, lim N →∞ # of appearances of k in the first N digits of π N = 1 10 .</formula><p>The Chudnovskys' calculations, and all subsequent calculations of Kanada, lend credence to this conjecture. As a consequence, the average of the digits over a long interval should be approximately 4.5. The Chudnovskys found that for the first billion digits the average stays a bit on the high side, while for the next billion digits, the average hovers a bit on the low side. Their paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> gives an interesting statistical analysis of the digits up to one billion. For example, the maximal length of a string of identical digits, for each of the ten digits, is either 8, 9, or 10. The Chudnovskys deduced (2.2) from a general series representation for 1/π, which we will describe after making several definitions. For τ ∈ H = {τ : Im τ &gt; 0} and each positive integer k, the Eisenstein series E 2k (τ ) is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">E 2k (τ ) := 1 - 4k B 2k ∞ j =1</formula><p>σ 2k-1 ( j)q j , q = e πiτ , (</p><p>where B k , k ≥ 0, denotes the kth Bernoulli number and σ k (n) = d|n d k .

The Chudnovsky brothers developed and extended Ramanujan's ideas in directions different from those of other authors. They obtained hypergeometric-like representations for other transcendental constants and proved, for example, that are transcendental <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Their advances involve the "second" solution of the hypergeometric differential equation. Recall from the theory of linear differential equations that 2 F 1 (a, b; c; x) is a solution of a certain second-order linear differential equation with a regular singular point at the origin <ref type="bibr">[5, p. 1]</ref>. A second linearly independent solution is generally not analytic at the origin, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[44, pp. 124-126]</ref>, the Chudnovsky brothers establish new hypergeometric series identities involving the latter function. Their identities lead to hypergeometric-like series representations for π, including Gosper's formula <ref type="bibr">(5.1)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, the authors provide a lengthy list of such examples, including</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">45π + 644 = ∞ j =0 8 j (430 j 2 -6240 j -520) 4 j j .</formula><p>The Chudnovsky brothers have also employed series for 1/π to derive theorems on irrationality measures μ(α), which are defined by μ(α) := inf μ &gt; 0 : 0 &lt; α -p q &lt; 1 q μ has only finitely many solutions p q ∈ Q .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">RAMANUJAN'S CUBIC CLASS INVARIANT AND HIS ALTERNATIVE THEORIES.</head><p>In Sections 3, 4, 6, and 7, we emphasized how Ramanujan-Weber class invariants and singular moduli were of central importance for Ramanujan and others who followed in deriving series for 1/π. We also stressed in Section 1, in particular, in the discourse after <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref>, that Ramanujan's remarkable idea of replacing the classical hypergeometric function 2 F 1 ( 1 2 , 1 2 ; 1; x) by 2 F 1 ( 1 r , r -1 r ; 1; x), r = 3, 4, 6, leads to new and beautiful alternative theories. On the top of page 212 in his lost notebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, Ramanujan defines a cubic class invariant λ n (i.e., r = 3 in (1.5)), which is an analogue of the Ramanujan-Weber classical invariants G n and g n defined in <ref type="bibr">(6.3)</ref>.

Lastly, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, motivated by the work of J. Guillera, described briefly in Section 10 below, the first two authors extended Ramanujan's ideas to derive hypergeometric-like series representations for 1/π 2 .

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. We have emphasized in this paper that Clausen's formula (6.1) is an essential ingredient in most proofs of Ramanujan-type series representations for 1/π. However, there are other kinds of series for 1/π that do not depend upon Clausen's formula. One such series discovered by Takeshi Sato <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> is given by We cite three further new series arising from this new method. The first is another companion of (11.2), which arises from recent work of Chan and H. Verrill <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> (after the work of Almkvist and Zudilin <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>), and is given by The second is from a paper by Chan and K. P. Loo <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and takes the form This series was also independently discovered by Chan and Verrill <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>According to W. Zudilin <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>, G. Gourevich empirically discovered a hypergeometric-like series for 1/π 3 , namely, 32 π 3 = ∞ μ=0 1 2 7 μ (μ!) 7 2 6μ (168μ 3 + 76μ 2 + 14μ + 1). This series and the search for further series representations for 1/π m , m ≥ 2, are described in a paper by D. H. Bailey and J. M. Borwein <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. 12. CONCLUSION. One test of "good" mathematics is that it should generate more "good" mathematics. Readers have undoubtedly concluded that Ramanujan's original series for 1/π have sown the seeds for an abundant crop of "good" mathematics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Theorem 1 . 1 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>(a) 0 := 1, (a) n := a(a + 1) • • • (a + n -If A n is defined by (1.1),</figDesc></figure>

It is known that if n is square-free and n ≡ 1 (mod 4) then G4  n is a real unit that generates the Hilbert class field of the quadratic field Q( √ -n) [32, Cor. 5.2], and this fact is very useful in evaluating G n . When we say that a series for 1/π is associated with the imaginary quadratic field Q( √ -n), we mean that the constants involved in the series are related to the generators of the Hilbert class field of Q( √ -n). c THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 116</figDesc></figure>
