<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>INTRODUCTION 1   HE battery service life of mobile battery-powered electronic systems is a major concern of designers of such systems. Attempts for extending the battery lifetime have traditionally focused on minimizing the power consumption of the electronic circuits powered by these batteries. These circuit-oriented techniques tend to be inadequate because they ignore important characteristics of the battery source itself e.g., the dependency of the remaining capacity of a secondary (rechargeable) battery on its current discharge rate and internal temperature, the charge recovery phenomenon, and the cycle aging effect. In the recent years, a number of researchers have begun to investigate the characteristics of battery sources and their impact on low-power circuit optimization techniques and power management strategies. A survey of battery-aware design techniques can be found in reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>A number of researchers have reported models for predicting the battery remaining capacity or battery service life. A low-level detailed electrochemical model based on concentrated-solution theory was reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This model is accurate and general enough to handle a wide range of lithiumion cells, which also explains the wide-spread use of its companion simulator software. A multi-dimensional coupled thermal-electrochemical model was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Electrochemical models are accurate but inherently suffer from the long simulation time required in practice.</p><p>Consequently, more efficient battery models have been proposed in recent years. A macro-model for lithium-ion batteries was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where the battery is modeled by a PSPICE circuit comprising of voltage sources and linear passive elements. Since simulation of the electrical circuit model is still time consuming, the authors of reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed a discrete-time battery simulation model, which approximates a continuous-time circuit model by using VHDL language. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> studied the battery discharge efficiency under different loading conditions and approximated this dependency as a linear or quadratic function. In this paper, the authors also presented a discharge rate-based method to estimate the battery lifetime under a variable load. The battery discharge efficiency was used as the weighting coefficient in the lifetime estimation equation.</p><p>Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> presented a stochastic battery model based on discrete Markovian process which captures battery recovery and rate capacity effects. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed a high-level diffusion based analytical model. This model aims to predict the battery lifetime given the discharge profile. The authors consider the concentration evolution of the active materials in the battery during a discharge process and model it as a onedimensional diffusion process in a finite region. In this model, a battery is considered exhausted when the active material concentration at the electrode surface drops below a preset threshold. This model is quite successful in terms of prediction accuracy, efficiency and generality. However, a prerequisite to use this model is that the load of a battery should be known exactly from the beginning of a discharge process. And this model does not take temperature dependence and cycle aging effects in account. So each time when a battery works in a different situation the model parameters needs to be reset, which may cause inconvenience in practice due to the overhead. An extensive review of battery models and battery aware low power techniques can be found in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The battery temperature and the cycle life of a secondary battery have a large impact on the battery lifetime after a full charging step. As temperature increases, the full discharge capacity of a secondary battery tends to increase. Unfortunately, higher temperature also results in much lower cycle-life for the battery (the cycle-life denotes the number of full charge/discharge cycles that a secondary battery can go thru before its output voltage drops below an acceptable threshold even after a full charging cycle.) The battery cycle aging effect denotes the phenomenon by which the full deliverable capacity of a rechargeable battery decreases as the number of battery charge/discharge cycles (which is referred to as the cycle-age of the battery) increases. As shown in work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the full deliverable capacities of commercial lithium-ion batteries shrink by 10-40% during the first 450 T charge/discharge cycles. Without knowledge about temperature and cycle life of a battery, it is therefore impossible to obtain an accurate prediction of the battery remaining capacity.</p><p>Commercially deployed battery estimation techniques can be generally classified into three categories according to their expected accuracy: load voltage technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, coulomb counting technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and internal resistance method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The load voltage technique is suitable for applications with constant load. The coulomb counting technique accumulates the dissipated coulombs from the beginning of the discharge cycle and estimates the remaining capacity based on the difference between the accumulated value and a pre-recorded full-charge capacity. This method can lose some of its accuracy under variable load condition because it ignores the non-linear discharge effect during the coulomb counting process. The internal resistance method needs to measure the frequency response of the battery to determine its battery state. Because this method normally requires extra function generators and separate testing period, this method is expensive and difficult to implement as part of the battery pack itself.</p><p>This paper presents an analytical model to predict the remaining capacity of a lithium-ion battery. The model takes the cycle-aging and temperature effects into account. This model requires small storage space, which is important since the amount of memory in the battery pack is usually limited. In addition, the proposed model relies on simple measurements of the battery output voltage and temperature, which can be easily achieved through the "smart battery" technology and corresponding interface. Starting from this analytical model, we present a method for predicting the remaining capacity of the battery under variable load conditions. This method makes use of information about the battery's discharge history in the current charge/discharge cycle through a coulomb counting mechanism.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, a motivating application is provided to demonstrate the importance of correctly predicting battery remaining capacity. In Section 3, the basic electrochemical background of cells is introduced. The model which is first promoted in this paper and is used to estimate the remaining battery capacity is described in Section 4. Model validation results are presented in Section 5. Techniques for online prediction of the remaining battery capacity are presented in Section 6. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MOTIVATING APPLICATION</head><p>Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a highly effective method to reduce energy consumption in real-time applications. Reducing the supply voltage can significantly reduce the energy dissipation of a VLSI circuit but can also slow down the circuit. The energy dissipation of a running CMOS VLSI circuit is given by the well-known equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2 switched clk E C V f T = (2-1)</formula><p>where V is the supply voltage level, switched C</p><p>is the switched capacitance per clock cycle, clk f is the frequency of the processor, T is the total execution time.</p><p>Utility, which was initially motivated by Shenker <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to use in modeling of a user's relative satisfaction for a real-time stream which is encoded at varying levels of fidelity, has been applied to the design of a wide range of systems running various types of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>[16] <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A utility function maps the service delivered by a system into a real value which measures the performance of the application in terms of user perception. In the following, we will consider a scenario of utility-based DVFS for battery-power embedded systems. Martin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> analyzed the power-performance trade-off for CPU speed-setting for mobile computing, where the number of computations performed per complete battery discharge is used as the optimization objective. This work takes the battery rate-capacity effect into consideration.</p><p>Consider a partially-discharged secondary battery as the power source of an embedded system. Let's assume the system has to complete a series of real-time tasks during the remaining battery lifetime. The utility rate is assumed to be a function of f clk , i.e., u=u(f clk ). Total utility, U, is calculated as ( , )</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">rem clk T V f clk clk U V f u f dt = ∫ (2-2)<label>0 ( , ) ( )</label></formula><p>where T rem (V, f clk ) refers to the remaining battery lifetime given that the circuit is running at frequency f clk with supply voltage V (notice that V is the output of the DC-DC-converter.) Thus the problem of utility-based DVFS is formulated as , max ( ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">) clk V f c l k U V f ,<label>(2-3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">clk f mV q = + ,<label>(2-4)</label></formula><p>where m and q are the regression coefficients of the best linear fit between the clock frequency and the supply voltage in the performance range of interest. To make this optimization problem analytically solvable, let's assume that f clk remains constant for the remaining time. Now we have ( , ) ( ) ( , )</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">clk clk rem clk U V f u f T V f = .</formula><p>(2-5)</p><p>Consider that at the beginning of this operation, the remaining ideal battery charge is E init . Let i B denote the current drawn from the battery while V B denotes the battery output voltage (notice that V B is the input to the DC-DC converter.)</p><p>We thus have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 switched clk B B C V f i V η =</formula><p>, where 0&lt;η≤1 is a constant, capturing the DC-DC converter efficiency factor. If we ignore the battery characteristics, as has been done in the past, the utility function may be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">2 ( ) ( , ) ( ) init init clk clk clk B B switched clk E E u f U V f u f i V C V f η = = . (2-6)</formula><p>This formulation does not, for example, take the battery rate-capacity effect into account. To overcome this drawback, we incorporate a function β'(i B ) into the formulation (2-6), which captures the effect that the deliverable battery capacity decreases as the discharge rate increases. As discussed by Wu and Pedram <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, β'(i B ) can be modeled by a linear up to a quadratic function of i B . Now, the above equation can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">2 ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( ) init init clk clk clk B B B switched clk B E E uf U V f u f i V i C V f i η β β = = ′ ′ (2-7)</formula><p>However, this equation still makes the assumption that the battery discharge characteristics are unchanged throughout the whole discharge period, which rarely holds during discharge of a real battery employed in a real system.</p><p>To make the dependence of U on variable V, we replace β'(i B ) with β(V) and f clk with mV+q, resulting in</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">2 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) init switched E u mV q U V C V mV q V η β + = + (2-8)</formula><p>The simulation results of a Bellcore PLION cell by using DUALFOIL program <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In this figure, each point is obtained in the following way. First, we discharge a fresh battery at a very low rate, i.e. 0.1C, to a certain state of the battery remaining charge, which is the xaxis value of this point. Next, this battery is discharged from the current state to exhaustion at X.C rate. The points on any continuous curve in the figure have the same X value, which is reported beside the corresponding curve. All discharges took place at 25°C. Notice that the "1C" rate denotes a rate at which a fresh battery will be discharged to exhaustion in an hour at room temperature.</p><p>From this figure, we can draw the following conclusions: (a) The Bellcore PLION cell exhibits the standard rate-capacity phenomenon. This can be seen, for example, by noting the degradation of the deliverable capacity of a fully-charged battery from a normalized value of 1 at a discharge rate of X=0.1C to about 0.68 at a discharge rate of X=1.33. (b) The Bellcore PLION cell also exhibits an accelerated ratecapacity behavior in the sense that if, for example, the battery is already half discharged, then the capacity loss for the remaining discharge process will go from a normalized value of 1 at a discharge rate of X=0.1C to about 0.52 at a discharge rate of X=1.33. In other words, the rate-capacity effect becomes more prominent at lower states of battery charge. )</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">clk dU m V du d dV u mV df dV V mV q β β = ⇒ - = - + (2-9)</formula><p>For the conventional approach which ignores the battery characteristics (cf. equation (2-6)), the optimal V value can be obtained from (2-9) by letting ( ) 1 u mV ≡ and 0 d dV β ≡ . These solutions are static, and therefore, unrelated to the dynamic state of charge of the battery. However, if we attempt to account for the accelerated rate-capacity behavior of lithium ion batteries, then β cannot be taken as constant any more. That is, we ought to make β a function of V and battery charge state s, i.e., we must use ( , )</p><p>V s β . Thus, the total utility is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">2 ( ) ( , , ) ( ) ( , ) clk u mV U V f s V mV q V s β ≈ + . (2-10)</formula><p>The optimal value of V is a solution of ( , )</p><p>) <ref type="bibr">-11)</ref> To solve this optimization problem, it is important to calculate the correct value of ( , ) V s β , which in turn, as demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, requires an accurate method to estimate the battery's remaining capacity at different discharge rates.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">clk m V s du V s u mV df V V mV q β β ∂ - = - ∂ + . (<label>2</label></formula><p>To quantitatively evaluate the impact of accelerated ratecapacity behavior on the performance of the utility-based DVFS technique, let's consider a real case: a voltagefrequency adjustable Xscale processor running a rate-adaptive real-time application, powered by a Bellcore battery whose rate-capacity behavior is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We assume this battery has a C-rate of 250mA, which is equivalent to six Bellcore's PLION cells connected in parallel. As reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the clock frequency of the Xscale processor in GHz is related to the supply voltage in the form of equation: 0.9629 0.5466</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">clk f V = -</formula><p>, which is a best fit of the measuring points when f clk is in the range of 0.333 to 0.667 GHz. The power consumption of the Xscale processor at clock frequency 667MHz is 1.16W, which discharges the battery at a rate of 335mA.</p><p>By assuming that the frequency-voltage level is continuously adjustable, we attempt to find out the optimal voltage level which maximizes the total utility during the remainder of the battery lifetime. In this example problem setup, we consider the following utility rate function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">( ) (3 1) , 0 clk clk u f f θ θ = - &gt; , which</formula><p>evaluates to 1 at 666MHz and to 0 at 333MHz. Clearly, such a function means that the performance is completely satisfying at 666MHz while it is completely unacceptable at 333MHz. The particular functional form is chosen because utility-rate curves with different shapes, i.e., concave, convex and linear, may be obtained by simply adjusting the value of parameter θ. The simulation results, when θ=0.5, 1 and 1.5, are reported in the following table.</p><p>For a comparison, we consider different methods to determine the optimal voltages. The first method determines the optimal voltage based on the rate-capacity characteristic of a fully-charged battery. For these two methods, the CPU voltage is determined by solving equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The second method determines the optimal voltage setting based on a coulomb counting mechanism, which estimates the remaining battery capacity by subtracting the delivered capacity from the nominal capacity.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> these two methods are referred as MRC and MCC, respectively. In the third and final method, denoted by Mopt, the operating voltage is set to a value that maximizes the total utility based on the actual accelerated rate-capacity curves as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. With this method, the CPU voltage is determined by solving equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. In this table, the "Vopt" column under each method contains the "optimal" voltage value determined by this method whereas the corresponding simulated utility values appear in column "Util". The utility values shown in this table are relative values as compared to the utility obtained with the MRC method, which is in turn normalized to 1 (not shown in the table.)</p><p>From this table, it is observed that an accurate estimation of battery remaining capacity is important to maximizing the utility especially when battery is in a low state of charge. For example, when the battery state of charge (SOC) at 0.1C is 0.2 and θ=1, the optimal CPU supply voltage determined by the MRC and MCC methods are 1.13V and 1.23V, respectively. However, by using the Mopt method, the actual optimal CPU voltage is found to be 1.05V. In this case, the Mopt method achieved 15% improvement over the MRC method in terms of the total utility. For the same setup, the MCC method yielded 31% lower total utility even compared to the MRC method. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. BATTERY BACKGROUND</head><p>This paper focuses on lithium-ion batteries because they are the fastest growing battery systems. Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in the notebook computers and cellular phones due to the high energy density and light weight. The schematic of the lithium-ion battery under consideration (Bellcore's PLION battery) in this paper is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It consists of the positive electrode (Li y Mn 2 O 4 ), negative electrode (Li x C 6 ) and a plasticized electrolyte composed of a 1M LiPF6 in EC/DMC in a silica-tilled p(VdF-HFP) copolymer matrix. The current collectors are made of aluminum (positive) and copper (negative) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.  During the discharge process lithium ion de-inserts from solid particles of the negative electrode and inserts into solid particles of the positive electrode. The process is reversed during the charge process.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L ixC 6 L iyM n O 2 d is c h a rg</formula><p>Cell discharge is limited mainly by two mechanisms: lithium ion diffusion in the solid phase and electrolyte depletion in the positive electrode. Usually, an end of discharge is considered to have been reached when the cell potential drops below a threshold, called the cut-off voltage.</p><p>A rechargeable battery may regain its capacity through the charge process. A discharge and the following charge are called a cycle. The deliverable capacity of a lithium-ion battery tends to decrease as the cycle count increases. This phenomenon is called cycle aging phenomena.</p><p>In the following sub-sections, we will introduce the basic equations related to the battery inner electrochemical processes.</p></div>

Cell Potential</head><p>Cell potential does not represent a source of energy, rather it denotes a voltage drop inside the battery during its discharge process due to the physical and chemical changes in the properties of the material that make up the battery electrodes and electrolyte. The overall cell potential may be divided into three parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>[22]: the ohmic overpotential ohm η , the surface overpotential s η , and the concentration overpotential c η</p><p>Based on Ohm's law, Ohmic overpotential ohm η can be expressed as an integral from the cathode to the anode:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">∫ = = L so ohm x A dx iA IR 0 ln ) ( ) 0 ( κ η (3-1)</formula><p>where ln so R is the resistance between the two electrodes, ) (x A is the area of the cross-section at distance x from the negative electrode, and L is the distance between the two electrodes. s η is the potential that makes the electrode reactions proceed at appreciable rates. It is related to the current density, which is governed by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ - - ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = s c s a RT F RT F i i η α η α exp exp 0 (3-2)</formula><p>where T is temperature in Kelvin and 0 i is the exchange current density.

Cycle Aging</head><p>The cycle aging phenomenon of lithium-ion batteries involves several different side reactions, such as cell oxidation processes, electrolyte decomposition (reduction) processes and self-discharge processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the loss of charge acceptance of the Lithium-ion batteries is mainly due to cell oxidation, which occurs naturally during use and as a part of aging. The cell oxidation leads to a film grown on the electrode, which non-reversibly increases the internal resistance of lithium-ion batteries and finally causes a failure. Usually, it is adequate to describe the film growth using a linear approximation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the growth of the film is related to the rate of the side reaction by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">F L M i t k αρ δ = ∂ ∂ (3-6)</formula><p>where δ is the film thickness composed of lithium products, k i is the rate (current) of the side reaction, other parameters F a L M , , , , ρ are all constant for a given reaction and a given battery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MODEL DESCRIPTION</head><p>The objective of this paper is to construct a high-level model to predict the remaining capacity of a rechargeable lithium-ion battery in terms of the battery output voltage, discharge-rate (current), battery temperature, and the cycle age of the battery. Here the term current always means that the average current at which the battery is supposed to be discharged to its end of life starting from this point time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Modeling the Cell Terminal Voltage</head><p>During the discharge process, the output terminal voltage v is equal to the initial open-circuit voltage init VOC minus the voltage drop inside the battery, which is in turn caused by the drained current. This voltage drop is also known as the cell potential. It is denoted by η and is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">) ( ) ( , , , , c c a c c s a s ohm η η η η η η - + - + = (4-1)</formula><p>From (3-2) and (3-3), one can see that if the discharged current is constant, the first two overpotential terms in (4-1) are also constant and do not vary with time. So one can use a resistance to represent the effect of these two overpotentials:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">i T a i i T a T a T i r ) ( ln ) ( ) ( ) , ( 3 2 1 + + = (4-2)</formula><p>where, .

It operates at a rate of up to 100 KHz. The SMBus circuit is integrated inside the battery, which consists of voltage/current and temperature sensors with corresponding AD converters.

This method is quite accurate when a battery is discharged at a constant current rate.
