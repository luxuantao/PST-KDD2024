<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Self-driving vehicles need to continuously analyse the driving scene, understand the behavior of other road users and predict their future trajectories in order to plan a safe motion and reduce their reaction time. Motivated by this idea, this paper addresses the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction over an extended horizon. On highways, human drivers continuously adapt their speed and paths according to the behavior of their neighboring vehicles. Therefore, vehicles' trajectories are very correlated and considering vehicle interactions makes motion prediction possible even before the start of a clear maneuver pattern. To this end, we introduce and analyze trajectory prediction methods based on how they model the vehicles interactions. Inspired by human reasoning, we use an attention mechanism that explicitly highlights the importance of neighboring vehicles with respect to their future states. We go beyond pairwise vehicle interactions and model higher order interactions. Moreover, the existence of different goals and driving behaviors induces multiple potential futures. We exploit a combination of global and partial attention paid to surrounding vehicles to generate different possible trajectory. Experiments on highway datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art performances.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N order to navigate, self-driving vehicles need to under- stand the behavior of other traffic participants. As communications are not always possible, self-driving vehicles must perceive and anticipate the intentions of surrounding vehicles in order to plan comfortable proactive motions and avoid urgent reactive decisions and conflicts with others. In fact, motion prediction helps self-driving vehicles understand possible future situations and decide about a future behavior that minimizes the possible risks accordingly. Motion behavior may be inferred by considering the features that characterises it. Vehicles' past states give relevant information about the dynamics, the direction and the speed of the performed maneuver. However, the trajectory taken by each vehicle in the future is not only dependent on its own state history: even the vehicle class impacts the motion pattern. In addition, the presence and actions of the neighboring vehicles have a great influence on a vehicle's behavior as well. Therefore, in this work, we propose to model the interactions between all the neighboring vehicles to represent the most relevant information about the social context with a focus on learning to capture long-range relations. In our approach, we attempt to mimic human reasoning, which pays a selective attention to a subset of surrounding vehicles in order to extract 1 Inria Paris, 2 rue Simone Iff 75012 Paris FRANCE {kaouther.messaoud,anne.verroust,fawzi.nashashibi}@inria.fr 2 CReSTIC, Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, FRANCE itheri.yahiaoui@univ-reims.fr the elements that most influence the target vehicle's future trajectories while paying less attention to other vehicles. For example, a vehicle performing a lane change maneuver will pay more attention to the vehicles in the target lane than those in the other lanes. Consequently, its future behavior could be more dependent on distant vehicles in the target lane than the close ones in the other lanes. This study is an extension of our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which focuses on deploying multi-head attention in the task of trajectory prediction. We adopt the attention mechanism to derive the relative importance of surrounding vehicles with respect to their future motion: it selectively aggregates the features that model the interaction between the vehicles by a weighted sum of the features representing all the surrounding vehicles' trajectories and thus directly relates vehicles based on their correlation without regard to their distance. We also use multihead attention in order to extract different types of interactions and combine them to capture higher order relationships. This provides a better understanding of the scene. Drivers' behaviors are not deterministic. In similar driving situations, they can perform different maneuvers or even when doing the same maneuver, the execution can be different in terms of speed and pattern. Therefore, we propose a method that is able to predict a multi-modal finite set of trajectories that correspond to predicted trajectories conditioned on the degree of attention paid to the surrounding vehicles. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted to show the contribution of the model, and quantitative comparisons with recent approaches show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in highway driving trajectory prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED RESEARCH</head><p>The task of vehicle motion forecasting has been addressed in the literature from different perspectives. Therefore, numerous vehicle motion prediction methods have recently been proposed. Here, we give an overview of the deployed methods, focusing on deep learning pattern based methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Overall Motion Prediction Module</head><p>We follow Rudenko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> who divide the motion prediction problem into three main components.</p><p>1) Stimuli: The features that influence and determine the future intention of the target vehicle are mainly composed of target vehicle cues and environment information. Target vehicle features. They enclose target vehicle past state observations (positions, velocities, etc.). Lenz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> use as input to their model only the current state of a set of neighboring vehicles in order to achieve the Markov Property. Other existing studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> use a sequence of past features to benefit from extra temporal information in the prediction task. Environment features. These are composed of: -Static elements including static obstacles and environment geometry.</p><p>-Dynamic elements representing the other traffic participants.</p><p>2) Modeling approach: Different representations of the motion model are used, which can be classified into: Physics-based methods, where the future trajectory is predicted by applying explicit, hand-crafted, physics-based dynamical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. These approaches basically build upon the motion's low level properties. Consequently, they are restricted to short-term motion prediction. Pattern-based methods that learn the motion and behaviors of vehicles from data of observed trajectories. Aoude et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> combine a physics-based approach with Gaussian Processes based motion patterns to generate probabilistically weighted feasible motions of the surrounding vehicles. Other methods divide the vehicle trajectory into a finite set of typical patterns named maneuvers. Tran and Firl <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> identify the vehicle maneuvers by comparing the likelihoods of the observed track for the constructed non-parametric regression models. Hermes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> cluster the motion patterns with a rotationallyinvariant distance metric into maneuvers and predict vehicles trajectories by matching the observation data to the maneuvers. <ref type="bibr">Schlechtriemen et al. [15]</ref> deploy a Naive Bayes Classifier followed by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where each state of the HMM corresponds to one of the maneuvers extracted from the naturalistic driving data. Houenou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> conceive a maneuvers recognition module, then, generate different continuous realizations of the predicted maneuver. The main limitation of these approaches is that they do not model the interactions between the neighboring vehicles on the future trajectory. Kafer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> tackle the task of joint pairwise vehicle trajectory prediction at intersections. They compare the observed motion pattern to the database and extract, for each vehicle, possible predicted trajectories independently. Then, they jointly compute, for each pair, the probability of possible trajectories. Most recent studies deploy deep learning based methods. They will be detailed in the Section II-B. Planning-based methods reason on the motion intent of rational agents. Sierra González et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> deploy Markov Decision Process (MDPs) to represent the driver decisionmaking strategy. They model a vehicle's trajectory by a sequence of states. Then, they build a cost function using a linear combination of static and dynamic features parameterizing each state. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), accounting for risk-aversive vehicles' interactions, operates to learn the cost function parameters from demonstrations. They use Dynamic Bayesian Networks, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, to model vehicles' interactions. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> extend Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> and deploy it to predict the driver's future actions given an image and past states. The proposed method is able to imitate different types of human driving behavior in a simulated highway scenario. Rhinehart et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref> use a deep imitative model to learn and predict desirable future autonomous behavior. They train their model with an expert human behaviors dataset, and use it to generate expert-like paths to each of the precomputed goals.</p><p>3) Prediction: Vehicle intent prediction is divided into two main aspects: maneuver <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> and trajectory prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The former generates a high-level representation of the motion such as lane changing and lane keeping. The latter outputs the predicted state over time. Different forms of outputs are used in the motion prediction task. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the exact future positions are predicted. Others <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> deploy a multimodal solution using Gaussian mixture models over predicted states. Ridel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref> generate the probability distributions over grids with multiple trajectory samples. Sampling generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Deep Learning Pattern-based Motion Prediction</head><p>Motion prediction can be treated as a time series regression or classification problem. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the main reason behind the significant advances in sequence modeling and generation. They have shown promising results in diverse domains such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Therefore, RNN-based approaches have been deployed as well in the tasks of maneuver and trajectory prediction. Long Short Term Memories (LSTMs) are a particular implementation of RNNs. They are characterised by their ability to extract long-term relations between features. In other word, unlike other neural networks, they consider sequential information and model the dependency in inputs. They act by performing the same operations for every input item of a sequence while taking into consideration the computation of the previous input item. LSTMs have been deployed, recently, for predicting driver future behaviors. Indeed, different LSTM-based models have been conceived going from simple LSTM with one or more layers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref> to different types of combinations and extensions: A dual LSTM architecture was adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>: the first LSTM extracts high-level driver behavior succeeded by a second for continuous trajectory generation. LSTM encoder decoder based architectures were deployed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. One of the most important parts in a driver intention prediction model is the surrounding vehicles' interaction extractor. It is also conceived differently in the state of the art. Some existing studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> implicitly infer the dependencies between vehicles. They feed a sequence of surrounding vehicles features as inputs to their model. Then, they accord to the LSTM the task of learning the influence of surrounding vehicles on the target vehicle's motion. Other approaches explicitly model the vehicles' interactions using several combinations of networks. Alahi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> introduced the social LSTM concept for pedestrian trajectory prediction task. They encode the motion of each agent using an LSTM block. Then, they extract the interactions between agents by sharing the hidden states between all the LSTMs corresponding to a set of neighboring pedestrians. Hou et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> use a structural-LSTM network to learn high-level dependencies between vehicles. Similar to social LSTM, they attribute one LSTM for each vehicle. Then, they use convolutional layers applying successive local operations followed by a maxpool layer. the spatial-neighboring LSTMs share their cell and hidden states by a radial connection. The output states of the LSTMs are treated recurrently in a deeper layer. The decoder generates all the predicted trajectories. Deo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> extend the social pooling and deploy it for vehicle trajectory prediction task. They use an LSTM encoder to generate a representation of each vehicle trajectory. Then, they use convolutional layers applying successive local operations on the outputs from the encoders followed by a maxpool layer. Therefore, they generate a context vector that consists on a compact representation of the vehicles interactions. But successive local operations are not always sufficient. Furthermore, the generated context vector is independent of the target vehicle's state. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref> extend the convolutional social pooling to simultaneous multi-agents trajectory prediction. Multi-head attention mechanism was introduced by Vaswani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> for natural language processing purposes. A relational recurrent network based on attention mechanism was deployed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for trajectory prediction. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, an attention-based nonlocal vehicle dependencies model that represents vehicles' interactions based on their importance to the target vehicle is introduced. The attention mechanism reduces the number of local operations by directly relating distant elements. The motion prediction results computed by this method on the NGSIM dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> improve those reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In this article, we extend our previous approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to tackle the target vehicle trajectory prediction problem (cf. Section III) as follows:</p><p>• We focus on studying non-local social pooling using a multi-head attention mechanism. Therefore, we remove the convolution layer used to extract local interactions in our previous method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. • We expand our previous approach by exploiting additional information to boost our prediction. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> and, in order to take into account the social effect of the surrounding vehicles on the prediction target based on relative dynamics, we include additional information (velocity, acceleration) in the vehicle state vectors. We also integrate the vehicle class information since the type of the vehicle characterises its motion pattern. • We investigate the interest of using multiple attention heads and we analyse the interactions extracted using each head. We also compare several ways of attention computation.</p><p>• We augment our architecture to generate a multi-modal solution based on a combination of partial and global attentions paid to the surrounding vehicles.</p><p>Experimental evaluations presented in Section IV show the benefits of using attention mechanisms to solve this problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Definition</head><p>The goal of this part is to predict the future trajectory of a target vehicle T , knowing its past tracks and the past tracks of its neighboring vehicles at observation time t obs . We have as input the past tracks of the target and its n neighboring vehicles. The input tracks of a vehicle i are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X i = [x 1 i , . . . , x t obs i</formula><p>] where x t i = (x t i , y t i , v t i , a t i , class) is the state vector. We note X T the state of the target vehicle T . The coordinates of all the considered vehicles, are expressed in a stationary frame of reference where the origin is the position of the target vehicle at time t obs . The y -axis and x -axis point respectively to one direction of motion on the highway and to the direction perpendicular to it. Our model outputs the parameters characterizing a probability distribution over the predicted positions of the target vehicle.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y pred = [y t obs +1</formula><p>pred , . . . , y</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">t obs +t f pred ]</formula><p>Where y t = (x t , y t ) is the predicted coordinates of the target vehicle.</p><p>Our model infers the conditional probability distribution P(Y|X). The distribution over the possible positions at time t ∈ {t obs + 1, . . . , t obs + t f } can be presented as a bivariate Gaussian distribution with the parameters Θ t = (µ t , Σ t ) of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y t ∼ N (µ t , Σ t )</formula><p>Where µ t is the mean vector and Σ t is the covariance matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">µ t = µ t x µ t y , Σ t = (σ t x ) 2 σ t x σ t y ρ t σ t x σ t y ρ t (σ t y ) 2</formula><p>We evaluate our model by considering the mean µ t values as the predicted positions y t .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Overall Model</head><p>It is crucial to understand the relationships and interactions that occur on the road to make realistic predictions about vehicle motions. Therefore, our model architecture is made up of three main components (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>):</p><p>• Encoding layer, where the temporal evolution of the vehicle's trajectories and their motion properties are encoded by an LSTM encoder. The LSTM encoders, with shared weights, generate a vector encoding of each vehicle motion. The multi-head attention module models the interactions between the target (green car) and the neighboring vehicles based on their importance. The decoder receives the interaction vector and the target vehicle encoding and generates a distribution for the predicted trajectory. The blocks added in green are the extension of the multi-head attention method to Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Trajectory Encoder</head><p>This encoding layer encodes the trajectories of the vehicles belonging to a neighborhood of the target vehicle at time t = t obs . Unlike most of the previous studies that consider a restricted number of vehicles immediately around the target vehicle, we compute a grid over the surrounding area. This representation of the context has the following advantages:</p><p>• It represents the drivable areas.</p><p>• It enables us to consider all the vehicles present in the neighboring area without restriction.</p><p>Each state vector x t i of each vehicle i of the neighboring area is embedded using a fully connected layer to form an embedding vector e t i .</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">e t i = Ψ(x t i ; W emb )</formula><p>where Ψ() is a fully connected function with LeakyReLU non linearity, W emb is the learnt the embedding weights. T he LSTM encoder is fed by the embedding vectors of each vehicle i for time steps t = 1, . . . , t obs :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h t i = LST M (h t-1 i , e t i ; W encoder )</formula><p>h t i is the hidden state vector of the i th neighboring vehicle at time t. We note h t T the hidden state vector of the target vehicle at time t. W encoder are the LSTM encoders weights. Each LSTM encoder share the same weights W encoder . We built a 3D spatial grid H composed of the neighboring vehicles' hidden states at time t obs based on their positions at time t obs .</p><p>H(n, m, :) = δ nm (x t obs i , y t obs i )h t obs i ∀i ∈ A T δ nm (x, y) is an indicator function that equals 1 if (x, y) is in the cell (n, m) and 0 otherwise. A T consists of the set of surrounding vehicles present in the considered area. The columns correspond to the three lanes (M = 3). The considered spacial area corresponding to the grid is centered on the target vehicle position and sized of (N, M ). It covers a longitudinal distance of 90 m with a grid cell size of 4.5 m. We note C the dimension of the trajectory encoding vectors h t obs i and we reshape the grid H to (N M, C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Vehicle Interaction Modules</head><p>As the behavior of vehicles on a highway could be highly correlated, it is important to consider the interactions between the vehicles when predicting their future motion. Attention is used to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. The attention module explicitly models the interactions between the target vehicle and the other vehicles in the grid H and selects the surrounding vehicles to pay attention to when computing the future trajectory of the target vehicle. Instead of computing vehicle relationships at each time step, which is computationally expensive, we use the hidden states of the encoder LSTM computed at the observation time as inputs to the attention module. These hidden states are projected into a high-dimensional space, if we consider all the attention heads. The vehicles interactions can be exploited as follows:</p><p>• The hidden state of the target vehicle is mapped to a query</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Q l = θ l (h t obs T , W θ l ) • The grid is mapped to form the keys K l = φ l (H, W φ l )</formula><p>and the values V l = ρ l (H, W ρ l ). W θ l , W φ l and W ρ l are the weight matrices that will be learned in each attention head l. An attention feature head l is then calculated as a weighted sum of values v lj , where the attention weights, α lj , weight the effect of surrounding vehicles on the target vehicle future motions, based on their relative dynamics.</p><p>We investigate three possible ways to compute the attention weights α l :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">head l = N M j=1 α lj v lj</formula><p>1) α-Attention: Attention weights are computed from the encoding vectors of the surrounding vehicles independently of the target vehicle state. They are computed using a tanh function and a fully-connected layer.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">α l = sof tmax(w T l tanh(K l ))</formula><p>w l is a learned weight, and α l ∈ R 1×N M is the l th attention.</p><p>2) Dot-Product Attention: The weights represent the effect of an interaction between a pair of vehicles based on their relative dynamics. They are the product of the query Q with keys K.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">α l = sof tmax( Q l K T l √ d ) Q l K T l</formula><p>is matrix multiplication used to calculate dot product similarities. d is a scaling factor that equals to the dimensionality of the projection space.</p><p>3) Concatenation Attention: The pairwise relation can be also represented by concatenation operation, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">α l = sof tmax(w T l concat(repeat(Q l ), K l ))</formula><p>One can notice that dot-product and concatenation attentions consider pairwise inter-relationships, whereas α-attention does not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. High Order Interaction</head><p>We deploy a higher order interaction extractor based on multi-head attention to retain different types of spatio-temporal relationships. The use of multi-head is inspired by the Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> architecture. In fact, a single learned attention feature mainly focuses on one inter-related subgroup of vehicles that may represent a single aspect of the possible spatiotemporal relationships occurring in the neighborhood of the target vehicle. In order to extend the attention to higher order interactions, different queries, keys and values are generated n h times in parallel, in n h attention heads, with different learned linear projections</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Q l , K l and V l , l ∈ [1, n h ].</formula><p>The n h generated attention features represent n h subgroups of vehicles inter-related with the target vehicle. These representations are concatenated and dynamically weighted to extract complex interactions between the different subgroups.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">z = Concat(head 1 , head nh )W O</formula><p>z is the compact context vector that combines interaction information of all the vehicles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Trajectory Prediction</head><p>LSTM Decoder is fed by the context vector z, which contains the selected information about the vehicles interactions, and the motion encoding of the target vehicle: h dec = Concat(h t obs T , z). It generates the predicted parameters of the distributions over the target vehicle's estimated future positions for time steps t = t obs + 1,. . . , t obs + t f . Θ t = Λ(LST M (h t-1 dec ; W dec )) where Θ t is the predicted parameters of the positions distribution at time t, Λ() is a fully connected function followed by a LeakyReLU non linearity, W dec are the learnt weights of the LSTM decoder and h t-1 dec is the hidden state vector of the decoder at time t -1.</p><p>model is trained by minimizing the following negative log-likelihood loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L nll (Y pred ) = - t obs+1 ≤t≤t obs +t f log(P Θ t (y t |X))</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction</head><p>Given the history of a vehicle's motion, there are many plausible future trajectories. Generating one trajectory for motion forecasting tends to be the average of the possible motions. When a driver decides to perform a specific motion, he directs his attention to a set of neighboring vehicles. For example, a driver exerting a lane change maneuver will mainly pay attention to the vehicles in the target lane. Therefore, from considered set of neighboring vehicles, we may derive a plausible future trajectory. To do so, we deploy a muti-head attention as described before and, we proceed as following (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>): The decoder receives n h encodings of the scene based on different attention heads.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">h l dec = Concat(h t obs T , head l , z) l ∈ [1,</formula><p>n h ] using each encoding, the decoder generates a plausible trajectory Y l pred . During the training, we compute only the loss L nll (Y l * pred ) corresponding to closest predicted trajectory to the groundtruth Y l * pred . Therefore, the position outputs are updated only for the minimum error.</p><p>augment the proposed architecture by a network composed of two fully connected layers separated by a non-linear function. It receives the outputs of all the attention heads and decides about the probability (p l , l ∈ [1, n h ]) of each produced trajectory being the closest to the real one. This network outputs the likelihood of the n h predicted trajectories. For this purpose, we add to the loss function a second term, which is the classification cross-entropy loss with n h classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L Class = - n h l=1 δ l * (l)log(p l )</formula><p>where δ is function equal to 1 if l = l * and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the probability of the best matching trajectory p l * is trained to become closer to 1, and the probabilities of the others to 0. This makes the probability outputs updated for all the attention heads. During the evaluation, we compute the loss function by taking the selected trajectory Y s pred having the maximum probability p s (Note that Y s pred may be different from Y l * pred ). The proposed network causes each attention head to specialize in extracting interaction features characterizing a distinct class of driver behavior without requiring explicit labels.</p></div>

We use this dataset to compare our model with the state-of-the-art. We split each of the datasets into train (75%) and test (25%) sets. We split the trajectories into segments of 8s of the trajectories composed of a track history of 3s and a prediction horizon of 5s. We downsample each segment to get only 5 fps to reduce the complexity of the model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Models Compared</head><p>Evaluations have been performed on the following models that all consider the interactions between surrounding vehicles. They are fed with the track history of the target and the surrounding vehicles and output distributions over the future trajectory of the target vehicle.</p><p>• Maneuver-LSTM (M-LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>: an encoder-decoder based model where the encoder encodes the trajectories of the target and surrounding vehicles. The encoding vector and maneuver encodings are fed to the decoder which generates multi-modal trajectory predictions. • Social LSTM (S-LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>: social encoder-decoder using fully connected pooling. • Convolutional Social Pooling (CS-LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>: social encoder-decoder using convolutional pooling.</p><p>(CS-LSTM(M)) generates multi-modal trajectory predictions based on six maneuvers (2 longitudinal and 3 lateral). • Multi-Agent Tensor Fusion (MATF GAN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>: the model encodes the scene context and vehicles' past trajectories, then, deploys convolutional layers to capture interactions. Finally, the decoder generates the predicted trajectories, using adversarial loss. • Non-local Social Pooling (NLS-LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: combines local and non local operations to generate an adapted context vector for social pooling. Five attention heads are used in this approach. • Multi-head Attention Social Pooling (MHA-LSTM): This is the model described in this paper using multihead dot product attention with x t i = (x t i , y t i ), i.e. without using velocity, acceleration and class information for each vehicle and with four attention heads.</p><p>• Multi-head Attention Social Pooling (MHA-LSTM(+f)):</p><p>MHA-LSTM with additional input features (velocity, acceleration and class) and with three attention heads. E. Target vehicle trajectory prediction: Quantitative evaluation 1) Overall evaluation: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref> shows the RMSE values for the models being compared on the NGSIM and highD datasets. Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> compare their results with independent prediction models to put emphasis on the importance of considering surrounding agents. In this work, we not only show that considering surrounding vehicles is a key factor to perform trajectory prediction but we also model their interactions in a more efficient way. To compare our model, we consider the results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> on the NGSIM dataset and we train S-LSTM and CS-LSTM on highD dataset as well. We train and test the approaches on the NGSIM and highD datasets separately and we notice that the RMSE values obtained on the NGSIM dataset are higher than the ones computed on the highD This may be due to the difference in size of the two datasets: highD contains about 12 times more vehicles than NGSIM. It can be also caused by annotation inaccuracies resulting in physically unrealistic vehicle behaviors in the NGSIM dataset, as observed by Coifman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>. Anyway, examining the RMSE values for either NGSIM or highD datasets leads to the same order for the proposed methods. Our attention-based approaches (NLS-LSTM, MHA-LSTM and MHA-LSTM(+f)) perform better than the others. MHA-LSTM reduces the prediction error by about 10% compared to the CS-LSTM while having comparable execution time. With MHA-LSTM(+f), we investigate the use of additional features like the speed and acceleration. We notice that this leads to significant improvements in the motion prediction accuracy, as MHA-LSTM(+f) outperforms all the methods. This consolidates our assumption that the relation between is not only related to their positions but also to their dynamics. The class of transportation (truck or car) also characterizes the speed and pattern of the motion. Therefore, these results indicate that multi-head attention better models the interdependencies of vehicle motion than convolutional social pooling. Moreover, this suggests that considering the relative importance of surrounding vehicles using both positions and dynamics when encoding the context is better than focusing on local dependencies.</p><p>2) Effects of using multiple attention heads: In order to evaluate the influence of the number of attention heads on the prediction accuracy, let us examine the RMSE values obtained by MHA-LSTM on the highD dataset with 2, 3 4, 5 and 6 attention heads on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. We notice that using several attention heads improves the prediction accuracy since each attention head represents a set of weights capturing one aspect of the effect of surrounding vehicles on the target vehicle. In addition, combining the attention vectors helps extract higher order relations. The best performance is reached with four We have conducted further experiments to evaluate the benefits of adding extra features, including explicit vehicle dynamics and class (MHA-LSTM(+f)). We observe that we outperform previous results when using different numbers of attention heads.</p><p>Considering the trade-off between the complexity of calculation and the MHA-LSTM(+f) RMSE corresponding to different numbers of attention heads, we choose to deploy three attention heads in the experiments that follow.</p><p>3) Comparison of attention methods: In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref>, we show the performances of the three possible ways to compute the attention weights in MHA-LSTM(+f), named α-attention, dot product attention, and concatenation attention presented in Section III-D. One can note that dot product and concatenation attentions outperform the α-attention. Therefore, we conclude that both the dynamics of the surrounding vehicles and their relationships with the target vehicle are of great importance for trajectory prediction. 4) Error evaluation per lane change: In order to complete the evaluation of our approach, we use the trained model MHA-LSTM(+f) to estimate the lateral and longitudinal errors obtained while carrying out right (RLC), left (LLC) lane change maneuvers or lane Following (LF) in the test set of the highD dataset (cf. Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). One can notice that the observed lateral error is low even during lane changes maneuvers (5% of the test data). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in predicting lane changes. It may also be observed that the longitudinal and lateral errors are greater during the LLC maneuvers. This may be due to the fact that the vehicle often speeds up when it performs LLC, which is not the case for the other maneuvers (LF or RLC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Qualitative Analysis of Predictions</head><p>To understand which vehicles are taken into account by each attention head in our method, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> we present the attention maps corresponding to lane change maneuvers carried out by the target vehicle. More precisely, a left lane change and a right lane change are shown and the attention maps are computed at times t obs = t lc -2s, t obs = t lc -1s and t obs = t lc where t lc is the time of crossing the lane mark during the lane change maneuver. Each attention map corresponds to an attention head. The target vehicle is shown in green in the center of the attention map, the grey rectangular region corresponds to the 2D drivable area described by the grid H and the colors of the other vehicles indicate the attention weight associated to them in the attention head (they are darker when their attention weight increases). We can remark that each attention head focuses on a subset of vehicles in the grid that are crucial to determining the future trajectory of the target vehicle. Moreover, like a human driver, most of the attention is directed to vehicles in front of the target vehicle, the vehicles behind it being less considered. We also notice that, in each example, one attention head considers all the vehicles in the grid equally (attention head 2 for the left lane change and attention head 1 for the right lane change). Moreover, at time t lc -2s, attention map 3 is such that the most important vehicles belong to the target lane even though other vehicles are closer to the target vehicle in another lane. This consolidates our assumption that the closest neighbors do not always have the strongest influence on the target vehicle. Some other factors like the speed and the vehicle's lane are also essential for correctly estimating the importance of a neighbor. To emphasise that aspect, we consider the relative speeds of the vehicles surrounding the target vehicle and belonging either to the same lane as the target vehicle or to the target lane in examples 1 and 2. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">V</ref> summarizes the states of the considered interacting vehicles. • Preceding, following: a vehicle belonging to the same lane as the target vehicle and preceding or following it. • Lead, rear: a vehicle belonging to the target lane and positioned ahead or behind the target vehicle. • S, Sl, F: same speed, slower, faster than the target vehicle respectively. • -, +: decelerating, accelerating respectively. In example 1, the preceding vehicle is slower than the target vehicle. The latter has two possible maneuvers: either to continue in the same lane and decelerate, or to accelerate and make a left lane change. In the left lane, the lead vehicle is distant to the target vehicle and has comparable velocity. This makes the lane change maneuver more likely. In example 2, the preceding vehicle is accelerating and the following one is faster than the target vehicle. Therefore, the target vehicle has two options, either to accelerate or to make a right lane change. In these two examples, we notice that even 2 seconds before performing a lane change, the target vehicle focuses mainly on the vehicles that belong to the target lane and which may have an influence on its future speed. Indeed, in both cases, the target vehicle performs the lane change while accelerating or decelerating according to the situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction</head><p>Using multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction, we model the uncertainties of the future and acknowledge the existence of multiple possible paths. Generating one solution trajectory tends to average all the possible trajectories which may lead to unrealistic predicted behaviors. To address this problem, we use each attention head to specialize for a distinct class of driver behavior. In the following experiment, we use a combination of each of the three attention head and the global attention to generate three different possible trajectories. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">VI</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> show the RMSE in meters over a 5- second prediction horizon for the generated trajectories using three attention heads for the RMSE values obtained as follows:</p><p>• Min and Max RMSE were computed by selecting at each instant the trajectory having respectively the minimum and maximum RMSE.   heads and having the maximum probability at t obs . We notice that one of the generated possible trajectories presents lower prediction error than the one solution trajectory by comparing the Min RMSE to the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">VI</ref>. Moreover, choosing the trajectory that has the best probability of predicting the target trajectory gives better results than systematically selecting the trajectory computed by one attention head (either H 1 , H 2 or H 3 ). However, the network for trajectory selection does not always guide us to the trajectory with minimum loss, which justifies the difference between the min and probability based losses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>This work proposed an adapted attention-based method for modeling vehicle interactions during the tasks of vehicle trajectory prediction on highways. We extended our first method to acknowledge the future uncertainties and generate a multimodal solution presenting different possible future trajectories. The proposed method caused each attention head to specialize in extracting interaction features characterizing a distinct class of driver behavior without requiring explicit labels. Experiments showed that our approach MHA-LSTM(+f) significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on two naturalistic large-scale driving datasets based on the RMSE metric. Furthermore, the presented visualisation of the attention maps enabled us to recognize the importance and the dependencies between vehicles. It confirmed that the attention is directed based on the future maneuver. This justified our choice to use each attention head to generate a possible future trajectory. Our evaluation results confirmed our intuitions: the importance of the relative dynamics and the efficiency of multi-head attention mechanism in modeling interactions between vehicles to predict vehicle trajectories in a highway scenario. Our proposed approach can be extended to consider heteroand mixed traffic scenarios with different road users, such as buses, trucks, cars, scooters, bicycles, or pedestrians. However, further information about the road structure should be integrated in our model for better representation of different driving scenes.
