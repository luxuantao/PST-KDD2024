<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research investigates the effects of knowledge construction and group collaboration in outcomes of MBA courses entirely delivered on the web. The data comes from a sample of courses conducted from summer 2000 through summer 2002. The results indicate that students achieve higher perceptions of learning in courses where knowledge is transmitted through the system, as opposed to constructed by the students, and when students are engaged in collaborative assignments. In terms of final grades, our findings show that the absence of both factors (knowledge construction and group collaboration) has a detrimental effect on student performance. Students earn on average better grades in courses where either one of these factors is present. Contrary to our expectations, the presence of both factors does not have positive synergistic effects on student performance. These findings suggest that the success of web-based courses entirely delivered online depends upon providing collaborative learning activities, and/or challenging environments where the students are responsible for the creation of their own knowledge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The growing popularity of web-based courses at all levels has prompted a multitude of research efforts to test which online course design and delivery strategies are most successful. Based on evidence provided by multi-course/multi-section studies and single course studies comparing online and traditional classrooms, the consensus seems to be that collaborative approaches are better in online courses than individualistic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>. However, in order to fully understand the drivers of better outcomes, we need to make a distinction between how the knowledge is delivered in a web-based environment and whether the learning is expected to occur in terms of individual activities or as a result of group-based processes.</p><p>Research in technology-mediated learning environments has received increasing attention in the Information Systems literature in the past decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. IS scholars are uniquely qualified to study how IT influences learning, not only due to their understanding of the technology but also because of the long tradition in the field to study how the technology affects individual cognitive processes and group collaboration. In particular, several empirical studies have analyzed the learning benefits of using Group Support Systems to enhance or to replace traditional classrooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>, and how Group Support Systems enable knowledge acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>. However, it is not known whether the superior outcomes achieved by members of the GSS teams are due to the capabilities of the technology-mediated environment to support knowledge dissemination and sharing, and/or due to the effects of working in groups.</p><p>Our main research question is whether the knowledge delivery approach or the use of collaborative learning techniques, or the combination of both, improves the outcomes of web-based courses. Empirical evidence to date is somewhat mixed, in part because the knowledge construction and group collaboration constructs have not been conceptualized and operationalized as orthogonal constructs. In addition, most of the prior empirical research has been focused on comparing online versus traditional courses, rather than testing the effectiveness of different models in webbased courses. Therefore, we seek to analyze the separate and joint effects of knowledge construction and group collaboration in a sample of pure online courses.</p><p>We begin by reviewing the relevant literature in knowledge construction and group collaboration and developing the hypotheses. Then, we describe the research methodology, including the experimental design, the sample and the data collection methods. We proceed to present the results of our statistical analyses, followed by the discussion, the limitations and the implications. Finally, we present our conclusions and the contributions, and outline possible areas for future research endeavors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review and hypotheses development</head><p>Research in the Information Systems literature in the area of technology-mediated learning includes theoretical and empirical studies. Theoretical studies are those that present conceptual models fitting technology applications to various learning theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>. Empirical studies are those that compare online learning environments to traditional classrooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, or investigate the use of Group Support Systems to enable collaborative learning activities in a particular course <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>, or test the effectiveness of particular synchronous and asynchronous online learning environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref>.</p><p>Although there are some inconsistent findings, empirical research comparing online and traditional courses has provided evidence of no significant differences in learning outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Compared to the large number of online versus traditional classroom studies, research based on larger samples of courses entirely delivered online is limited. This prior multicourse research has found strong evidence for the effectiveness of collaborative learning in asynchronous learning environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, two issues often overlooked in this area are the role of the learning model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, and the interplay between knowledge delivery and group collaboration in online courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Knowledge delivery: transfer versus construction</head><p>In order for learning to occur, the student must acquire knowledge. Grover and Davenport <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> define knowledge as the most valuable form of content and describe a continuum that starts at data, encompasses information and ends in knowledge. The main distinction between knowledge and information is that ''knowledge is information possessed in the minds of individuals'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> p. 109. Therefore, from a cognitive perspective, knowledge is the result of mental processing generated by new stimuli. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> The central concern of technology-mediated learning environments is how to leverage the technology and provide the most effective stimuli to improve knowledge acquisition.</p><p>One of the key issues in the design and delivery of web-based courses is how knowledge is disseminated through the medium. Although the concern is not exclusive of technology-mediated learning environments, it is perhaps critical when instructors and students are separated from each other in terms of space and time. A parallel concern in education <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, echoed in some of the Information Systems research <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, is the debate around the appropriateness of objectivist and constructivist approaches. These two paradigms represent fundamentally different conceptions of knowledge. Objectivism is based on the dissemination of a stable body of knowledge while constructivism is based on knowledge construction. A useful analogy to understand the difference between these two approaches consists of viewing objectivism as the delivery of a complete set of concepts that needs to be learned (for example, a page of written text), and constructivism as the conveyance of these concepts in pieces from multiple sources that each learner puts together or constructs by him/herself.</p><p>The objectivist model consists of transferring knowledge from the professor to the students and allowing each student to learn independently. The main assumption in this approach is that there is a unique and objective body of knowledge representing the world that can be articulated and communicated to the students. As a result, the instructor controls material and pace of learning, and the lecture is the typical mode of instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Direct knowledge transfer may be the most appropriate model for subject matters based on factual, technical or procedural knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. However, some critics of this approach argue that the quality of learning is impoverished when students are passive recipients of content that is delivered to them.</p><p>In contrast, the constructivist model assumes that knowledge is created or constructed by every learner. Instead of an external objective reality, the mind produces its own conception <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Within constructivism, there are two different schools of thought: individual, which assumes that knowledge construction occurs in the student's head and social, based on the premise that knowledge is socially constructed in the world through interactions with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. The common element of these two views is the idea that knowledge is constructed. In addition to emphasizing knowledge construction, instead of knowledge transfer, constructivist environments provide multiple representations of reality and encourage thoughtful reflection based on personal experience.</p><p>The distinction between the instructional and selfpaced exploration approaches has also been investigated in the training literature. Instruction-based training, typically provided through lectures or discrete packets of information, is a deductive approach where learners are presented with the content that needs to be learned in its final form <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. However, exploration-based learning is inductive, as learners have to discover or construct what needs to be learned by interacting with the content, which is usually presented in the form of specific examples. Some researchers have suggested that exploration is more effective than instruction-based training in promoting the integration of new knowledge with previous knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Group collaboration</head><p>A key decision in the design and delivery of webbased courses is the extent to which students will learn in isolation or through interactions with their classmates.</p><p>Collaborative activities allow learners greater opportunities for increased social presence and a greater sense of online community, both of which have been associated with positive online course outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. When working with peers instead of alone (or just with the instructor), anxiety and uncertainty are reduced as learners communicate with their teammates and find their way together through complex or new tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to improving the socio-emotional climate, collaborative activities provide opportunities for enhanced learning. Students learn more when they participate in group endeavors because of specific mechanisms that affect cognitive processes. These mechanisms include resolution of conflicts or disagreements in group discussions, internalization of explanations provided by more knowledgeable peers and selfexplanation effects because explaining to others clarifies one's own understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>. At the same time, working in virtual teams allows students to reflect on the written contributions of others and encourages them to elaborate their thoughts before expressing them in writing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. The success of group collaboration in technology-mediated environments depends to a great extent on the effectiveness of the group of learners. Problems such as lack of commitment by individuals, insufficient knowledge about the activities or coordination problems may reduce the potential learning advantages of working in groups. Notwithstanding these potential disadvantages, the use of collaborative activities in web-based courses is particularly important, because the sense of community and the typical classroom cues are often absent in this kind of environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Instructional strategies and the role of instructors</head><p>The two learning models (objectivism and constructivism) lead to fundamentally different choices regarding methods of knowledge delivery and assessment of knowledge acquisition. For example, constructivist instructors tend to focus on projects requiring solutions to problems instead of emphasizing one-way instruction, which is the core of objectivist approaches. While objectivists focus on delivering sequences of subject-matter topics, constructivists emphasize authentic tasks in a meaningful context rather than abstract instruction out of context <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. Constructivist methods require technological platforms that provide access to content in a non-linear or non-structured way, and learning tools such as databases, conceptual models, simulations and hypermedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. As a result, the role of the instructor changes from being the main source of knowledge and answers, to being a coach or facilitator in the students' construction of their own knowledge.</p><p>Unlike constructivism, which is a learner-centered approach where students control the pace of instruction, objectivism is an instructor-centered approach, where students are primarily expected to learn from the instructor <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The role of instructors in a constructivist environment shifts from conveying concepts to raising provocative questions to motivate the students' search for answers, a kind of ''Digital Socrates'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, in objectivist web-based courses, students are exposed to frequent instructional interactions enacted by the instructor, who is in control of the material and pace of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Students in objectivist courses are more likely to generate questions when they do not understand the material and contact their instructors in their search for answers or clarification. This dependence on the instructor as the main source of knowledge and advice is likely to generate higher levels of perceived student-instructor communication for students in objectivist courses than for students in constructivist environments.</p><p>Collaborative courses are designed around constant and frequent interactions among learners, where most of the communication takes place. These exchanges can occur in public discussion forums, open to all the students enrolled in a class, or in smaller group sessions, where only students of the same team can participate <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. The role of the instructor in collaborative environments resembles that of the facilitator that raises questions to engage students in a dialog among themselves and periodically steps in to synthesize key ideas from group discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. In contrast, students in individual courses are expected to work on their own. Although contact with other students probably takes place, it is neither required nor necessary. Therefore, students in collaborative courses are likely to experience higher levels of learner-learner communication than students in individually oriented courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Learning effects</head><p>Learning involves the acquisition of knowledge, which is evidenced in changes of behavior leading to better performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Since knowledge acquisition is not directly observable, the learning effects can be manifested in terms of improved perceptions of learning or better performance in assessment and evaluation activities. Hereafter, we refer to these two constructs as learning outcomes.</p><p>The premise of constructivism is that learning is an active process of constructing rather than acquiring pre-existing knowledge. In this view, knowledge is not just a mental state; it is an experienced relation of things, and learning is the result of a process of inquiry at the individual and/or at the social level <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Leidner and Jarvenpaa <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> p. 267 propose that ''individuals are assumed to learn better when they are forced to discover things themselves rather than when they are told or instructed''. Thus, the construction of knowledge should foster a deeper understanding and better learning in students than the mere transfer from the instructor. Based on this conjectures, we hypothesize:</p><p>H1. Students engaged in knowledge-construction webbased courses will achieve better learning outcomes than students in web-based courses where knowledge is directly transferred from the instructor.</p><p>In web-based collaborative courses, students are engaged in intellectual exchanges with their peers that require verbalization of their current understanding of the material and the articulation of their cognitive processes. This articulation can be motivated by the need to explain concepts to peers, or to make explicit their problem-solving strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. In addition to these cognitive benefits, working with peers also provides socio-emotional advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>, both of which are conducive to better learning outcomes. In contrast, students in individual-based courses have limited possibilities for developing these higher-order cognitive processes associated with group interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>. Therefore, we hypothesize: H2. Students in web-based courses structured around collaborative activities will achieve better learning outcomes than students in individualized web-based courses.</p><p>Based on the theorized effectiveness of constructivism and the learning advantages of working in groups, the combination of knowledge construction with group collaboration is expected to have positive synergistic effects on learning outcomes because it requires students to construct knowledge by interacting with others. Thus, learning is the result of a process of inquiry where meaning is socially constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. The potential for achieving a deeper understanding and more learning when knowledge is constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, in conjunction with the advantages of verbalization and articulation when students are learning from others in a collaborative environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, are expected to result in the best levels of learning. Thus, we hypothesize: H3. Students in collaborative constructivist web-based courses will achieve the best learning outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Experimental design</head><p>The combination of knowledge construction with the presence of group collaboration produces a 2 Â 2 framework with four different categories: transferindividual, transfer-group, construction-individual and construction-group (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These categories describe four possible web-based learning environments.</p><p>A transfer-individual course is based on the direct knowledge transfer from the instructor to the students, typically via prepared lectures posted on the course web site weekly or by modules. Students in these courses are required to learn and master the material individually and demonstrate their assimilation of pre-ordained knowledge by working individually in the completion of assignments or exams.</p><p>A transfer-group course is also based in a one-way transmission of knowledge from the instructor to the students through the use of lecture notes. However, this type of course requires the students to work together and to co-operate in the completion of group projects and other group-based assignments. The mastery of the material is accomplished not only by individually assimilating content, but also by working in group assignments that reinforce the learning process.</p><p>A construction-individual course provides an environment where students construct their own knowledge independently, by actively interacting with the subject matter. Instead of receiving modules of pre-ordained knowledge (as in transfer courses), students gather materials and combine information from different sources. This process of investigation and discovery, usually presented in the form of a complex project or case study, allows the student to understand the subject matter and create knowledge.</p><p>A construction-group course is also based on the premise that students search for meanings instead of receiving packaged lectures. Rather than engaging in individual investigations, students in this type of course work together in small groups to discuss cases and/or to collaborate on projects. This kind of environment requires students to interact with others in the knowledge construction process.</p><p>The goal of the transfer-group approach is to allow students to work together on problems with objectively correct answers that require them to express the specific facts and concepts they have memorized or learned. Accordingly, the main difference between the transfergroup approach and the construction-group category is that in the former category students do not create new meaning, but use knowledge previously transmitted (or directly made available) by the instructor. It may be argued the transfer-group approach requires students to search for pre-ordained knowledge and therefore should be considered a form of constructivism. Strictly speaking, however, students in these kinds of courses are not required to create new meaning or build knowledge in order to solve the problem, but rather reproduce existing concepts, principles or methods. In doing so, students primarily learn with others and experience some of the cognitive benefits of group work.</p><p>The novelty of this research framework is the combination of instructor-led knowledge transfer with the use of collaborative activities. Typically, research in technology-mediated learning environments associates group collaboration with knowledge construction. This may not be always the case, however. Even when direct instruction is used as the knowledge transfer approach, students may be engaged collaborative learning activities that require them to demonstrate what they have learned <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. The addition of group collaboration to traditional knowledge transfer methods overcomes one of the major drawbacks of this approach because students are no longer passive recipients of content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Sample</head><p>The experimental framework allows us to analyze the effects of knowledge construction and group collaboration on learning outcomes. To test our hypotheses regarding the separate and joint effects of these two factors, we conducted a field experiment in an MBA program of a Midwestern U.S. university. We surveyed 40 online class sections from summer 2000 through summer 2002. The courses covered a range of topics including Strategy, Organizational Behavior, Project Management, International Business, Human Resources, Finance, Accounting, Management Information Systems, E-Commerce, and Special Topics in Management. In most cases, more than one section per course was offered during the time frame of the study and included in the sample.</p><p>These courses were delivered entirely online. Six of them were administered via its own web site using Lotus LearningSpace software and the others were delivered using the Blackboard CourseInfo platform. Fifteen different instructors taught the courses. Thirtytwo courses had an on-site meeting to begin the course while seven had an on-site meeting at the end of the course to administer the final exam. The remaining section did not have any face-to-face meetings oncampus. Class section enrollments ranged from 9 to 35 students. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides more detail about the courses, the number of sections, enrollment information and respondents by course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Data collection methods</head><p>Three data sources were used in this study: students' responses to a questionnaire, instructors' interviews to determine course characteristics, and secondary sources to identify course design indicators. Data from students was collected in a post-course survey. Students enrolled in courses that had a final on-campus meeting completed the questionnaire in the last class. Students who did not come to campus for a final meeting were sent the survey via e-mail. The non-responding students were mailed a copy of the questionnaire. The usable response rate was 66% (579 of 872). For each of the respondents, we also collected the final grades obtained in the course.</p><p>To classify the sections in the study on the basis of the knowledge construction/group collaboration frame- work, we used a two-step process. First, we identified a set of four course design indicators, namely lectures, small group discussion forums, projects and exams. By reviewing the corresponding course web sites, we determined how many courses used lecture notes (in the form of PowerPoint and in the form of audio lectures), and how many used small discussion forums. We also determined by reviewing the course syllabi the use of projects (individual and/or in groups) and the use of exams, as assessment techniques. Based on these indicators, we established an initial course classification. However, there were a number of courses whose classification was not clear because the information from secondary sources was not definitive. Therefore, as a second step, we conducted semistructured interviews with all the instructors. These interviews probed their knowledge delivery approach and assessed whether the predominant type of learning activity in their courses was individual or group-based. To learn about the instructional methods, faculty were asked whether their courses were focused primarily on fact/concept dissemination via web-based lectures, or based on knowledge construction by students. To investigate the presence of the group-learning paradigm, faculty were also asked to compare the proportion of individual and group learning activities in their courses and choose the predominant method. The interview protocol is presented in Appendix I. We adopted a final course classification according to the information provided by the instructors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Operationalization of variables</head><p>Courses in the sample were classified according to the knowledge delivery approach (transfer versus construction) and the collaboration dimension (individual versus group). These two dimensions were operationalized with two categorical variables: knowledge construction, KC (0 for transfer and 1 for constructed) and group collaboration, GC (0 for individual and 1 for groups). Based on the instructors' interview responses, 4 sections were classified as transfer-individual, 14 sections were categorized as transfer-group, 9 sections were placed in construction-individual and 13 sections were categorized as construction-group. In some cases, two sections of the same course were classified in different cells of the framework, based on the answers provided by each of the instructors. For example, two sections of Strategic Management were classified in the construction-group category, while the third was placed in the transfer-group cell. Similarly, the three sections of human resources management were assigned to different categories (transfer-group, construction-individual, and construction-group) according to the instructors' responses.</p><p>To study the nature of the interaction that took place in the web-based courses, several items were included in the post-course student questionnaire. Student perceptions of learner-instructor communication were measured using seven items and student perceptions of learner-learner communication were measured using four items. Both of these scales were adapted from instruments used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The main dependent variables used in this study are perceived student learning and actual grades. The perceived learning scale was originally developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>, and adapted for this study. Perceived learning measures the extent to which students believe they have learned in the course. Higher levels of perceived learning are likely to result in higher student satisfaction, which in turn should translate into higher ratings for the course, often used as a measure of success <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Factor loadings and reliability results for the learnerinstructor, learner-learner and perceived learning scales are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. All the items measuring each perceptual variable clearly loaded onto its corresponding factor. These loadings range from 0.64 to 0.86 indicating a strong correlation between each of the items and the variable it measured. In addition, there are no cross-loadings greater than 0.45. This analysis provides evidence of good convergent and discriminant validity.</p><p>The reliability coefficients of the scales are 0.92, 0.85 and 0.94 for the learner-instructor, learner-learner and learning perception scales, respectively. In addition, except for one item in the learner-learner scale, all the other single item coefficients are higher than 0.80. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the reliabilities of each item with the scale and the scale Cronbach's a coefficients. These reliabilities are high and well above the cutoff rate of 0.7 recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</p><p>The second dependent variable is the final grade that students earned in the courses. This is a measure of objective performance, and it is an indicator of actual learning. Earlier research indicates that self-reported learning is often inconsistent with objective performance measured by grades <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. While learning perception indicates the extent to which students feel they learned in the course, actual learning measures the degree to which they actually learned based on the performance assessment methods used by the instructors. Therefore, the use of final grades as a dependent variable incorporates a more objective measure of knowledge acquisition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Statistical analyses</head><p>The unit of data collection and the unit of analysis for testing our hypotheses was the individual student. However, since the students were enrolled in sections when they received the treatment (i.e. experienced the web-based course), it is likely that the interaction between students and their common experiences for being in the same class will influence their perceptions. This influence or class level effect implies that the error terms contain a systematic component <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. The violation of independence is one of the main reasons for not using traditional regression models. Ignoring the group effect could lead us to falsely reject the null hypothesis (no effect of treatment) because the degrees of freedom are artificially increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</p><p>To take into account that students are nested units within classes, and these sections are in turn, grouped in different treatments, we used multilevel analysis of variance, also known as hierarchical analysis of variance (HANOVA). This technique allows studying the effects of course characteristics on individual level outcomes, while controlling for the fact that students received the treatment in a group setting or web-based course <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Course classification and manipulation checks</head><p>We validated the course classification derived from the instructors' interviews, using the four course design indicators (lectures, discussion forum, projects and exams) and our own original classification for each course. First, we coded each indicator with dummy variables and analyzed these variables vis-a `-vis the course classification. According to the premises of the knowledge delivery approaches, there should be a preference for lectures in direct knowledge transfer courses, and a preference for projects in knowledge construction courses. In addition, individually oriented courses should be structured in terms of individual projects and exams, instead of group-based exercises. In contrast, collaborative courses should use group projects and small discussion forums to complement (or perhaps replace) individual assessment methods.</p><p>Consistent with the premises of each approach, we noticed that none of the transfer-individual courses in our sample used team projects, while all of the collaborative sections used small group discussion. We also tested for statistical differences between the proportions of courses with each of these indicators, using the course-section as the unit of analysis. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> presents these results along with the proportion of courses in each condition where the dummy variable for the indicator is 1.</p><p>When compared to knowledge construction sections, a larger proportion of knowledge transfer courses use lecture notes (z-value = 2.40, p &lt; 0.01), and audio lectures (z-value = 2.08; p &lt; 0.05) as vehicles for disseminating knowledge. No significant differences are found in the use of individual or group projects between construction and transfer courses. In terms of individual and collaborative assignments, there is a marginally significant difference between the proportion of individual sections using exams when compared to collaborative courses (54% versus 30%, z-value 1.48; p &lt; 0.10). Also marginally significant is the proportion of collaborative courses using group projects in comparison to individual-based courses (37% versus 15%; z-value = 1.4; p &lt; 0.1). Finally, the preference for small discussion forums is more noticeable in groupbased courses than in individualistic ones. Every collaborative section used small group discussion, while only 62% of the individual sections did. Thus, when analyzed separately, these course design indicators based on syllabi information and web site inspection, are consistent with the information provided by the instructors regarding the nature of their courses.</p><p>For a second validation, we compared our original author-derived course classification based on the course design indicators with the final one determined from the instructors' interviews. The level of agreement between the two classifications is 0.8 (out of the 40 sections, 8 were placed in different cells of the framework). The disagreements were solved in favor of the instructorprovided classification. Taken together, these analyses validate the results of the interviews and increase the reliability of our course classification. As an additional manipulation check, we analyzed the learner-instructor and learner-learner communication scales using a hierarchical ANOVA model with two main factors (knowledge construction and group collaboration), their interaction and one nested factor due to the course/section. According to the premises of knowledge delivery, higher levels of learner-instructor communication should take place in knowledge transfer courses than in knowledge construction courses, and higher levels of learner-learner communication should occur in collaborative courses when compared to individually oriented courses. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> shows the means by condition and the results of these tests.</p><p>The knowledge construction factor is significant in the learner-instructor HANOVA model (F = 34.15; p &lt; 0.001), and the marginal means indicate that students in courses where knowledge is transferred (as opposed to constructed) report higher levels of communication with their instructor (4.95 versus 4.85, respectively). Although the difference between these two means is small, this result is statistically significant due to the separation of the nested factor from the error term in our analyses. When the systematic component created by the class level effect is removed from the residual error, the magnitude of the error term is reduced. If the nested factor is treated as the error term, the significance of knowledge construction is p = 0.06, as indicated in the footnote of the table. Both analyses suggest that the perception of learner-instructor communication is higher for students in knowledge transfer courses than for students in knowledge construction courses.</p><p>The group collaboration factor in the learner-learner HANOVA model is significant (F = 112.11; p &lt; 0.001) and the marginal means of the collaborative versus individual students are in the expected direction <ref type="bibr">(5.33 versus 4.29)</ref>. The significance of this factor does not change when the nested factor is used as the error term. Thus, students in group-based courses report higher perceptions of communication with their classmates, than students in individually oriented courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Test of hypotheses</head><p>Our hypotheses predicted relationships between the main factors (knowledge construction and group collaboration) and the learning outcomes (H1 and H2, respectively) and an interaction effect (H3). We test each hypothesis using both learning perception and grades as dependent variables. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> The results of these tests are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>. We report in the table the analysis when the nested factor (course/section) is separated from the error term and include footnotes to show the results when the nested factor is used as the error term. For both dependent variables, hierarchical MANOVA model results on the nested factor (course/section) are significant at 0.1%. These results indicate the presence of group level effects due to the particular characteristics of each section. The inclusion of the nested factor controls for the variations in the particular implementations of each course/section.</p><p>According to H1, students engaged in knowledge construction were expected to achieve better learning outcomes than students in courses where knowledge is a If the nested factor (course-section) is used as the error term, instead of the residual error, the significance of knowledge construction is 6%. The other factors retain the same levels of significance.</p><p>b If the nested factor (course-section) is used as the error term in this analysis, instead of the residual error, group collaboration is significant at 1% and knowledge construction and the interaction factor are each significant at 5%. transferred. The hierarchical MANOVA model result for knowledge construction on learning perception is significant (F = 4.25; p &lt; 0.05), but the marginal means indicate that students in knowledge construction courses report on average lower learning perception than students in knowledge transfer courses (4.77 versus 5.01, respectively). Thus, H1 is not supported for learning perception. In the test of H1 using grades as a dependent variable, the results are opposite. Students in courses based on knowledge construction achieve higher grades than their counterparts in transfer courses (means 3.74 versus 3.66; F = 14.84; p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, H1 is supported for grades.</p><p>The second hypothesis predicted better learning outcomes for collaborative courses when compared to individualistic ones. For our first dependent variable, learning perception, the marginal means are higher for collaborative courses than for non-collaborative courses (5.01 versus 4.49), and the group collaboration factor is significant (F = 32.80; p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, for our second dependent variable, the marginal means of grades in collaborative courses are higher than those in the individual courses (3.73 versus 3.66) and the group collaboration factor is significant (F = 11.46; p &lt; 0.001). Thus, H2 is supported for both dependent variables.</p><p>The interaction effect hypothesis (H3) predicted that students in construction-group courses were expected to achieve the highest levels of perceived learning across conditions. With respect to learning perception, the interaction effect of knowledge construction and group collaboration is significant (F = 18.08; p &lt; 0.001), but not in the expected direction. The means by condition indicate that the highest perceptions of learning correspond to students in transfer-group courses (5.20). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> presents graphically the interaction between knowledge construction and group collaboration on learning perception. Since the line segments cross each other, there is a disordinal interaction. The rank order of the effectiveness of the different conditions on learning perception is: transfer-group, construction-group, construction-individual and transfer-individual. The combination of knowledge construction and group collaboration does not produce the highest means. Therefore, H3 is not supported for learning perception.</p><p>In terms of performance (grades), the lowest averages are found in students enrolled in transferindividual courses (means 3.38), whereas in the other conditions the averages are in the 3.7 range. The significance of the interaction factor (F = 9.87; p &lt; 0.01) indicates that the presence of either knowledge construction or group collaboration has a positive effect on student grades. However, the presence of both does not seem to have any positive synergistic effect, as hypothesized (H3). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows graphically the interaction effects of the two factors on final grades. Knowledge construction is superior to knowledge transfer but not by the same amount for the individual-oriented and group-oriented courses. In fact, the final grades for collaborative courses are very a If the nested factor is used as the error term in the learning perception model, group collaboration is significant at 1% while knowledge construction and the interaction of both factors are significant at 5%.</p><p>b If the nested factor is used as the error term in the model with grades as dependent variable, knowledge construction is marginally significant at 10%. similar, regardless of the knowledge delivery approach. Since the combination of collaboration and construction does not produce the highest scores, H3 is not supported for grades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion of results</head><p>The findings for the learner-instructor and learnerlearner communication manipulation checks suggest that the courses were delivered as intended, and as reported by the instructors in the interviews. These student level perceptions provide additional support to our course classification variables determined from the information provided by the instructors and the analysis of course design indicators. In addition to serving as manipulation checks, these measures are also evidence of the communication dynamics in each category of the experimental framework. One noteworthy finding in this regard is the low levels of perceived learnerinstructor communication in transfer-individual courses. This suggests that the delivery of knowledge in these sections is mostly achieved via a set of packaged materials such as lecture notes and audio lectures that is not complemented with live participation or explanations from the instructor.</p><p>In terms of learning perception, our results indicate that the most successful combination for the design of web-based courses is found in the transfer-group category. Courses in which knowledge is directly transmitted from the instructor to the students and collaborative approaches are used as the primary learning mode scored significantly higher in perceived learning than did courses that were conducted using other combinations of knowledge delivery and collaboration. This finding confirms previous conceptual and empirical work supporting the importance of collaborative learning in web-based learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>. It is interesting to note that transfer-group courses are where the higher perceptions of learner-instructor and learner-learner communication occur. These results suggest that students not only communicate more with each other, but also with the instructor, because of his/her dual role as knowledge expert who delivers the material and group facilitator who guides the student teams. Because of this double duty, the level of perceived learner-instructor communication is significantly higher in transfer-group than in transfer-individual sections.</p><p>In terms of knowledge acquisition measured by final grades, our results indicate that the presence of either group collaboration or knowledge construction significantly improves the students' final grades. This finding also supports the importance of collaborative approaches documented by previous research, and suggests that knowledge construction is also beneficial for student performance. The combination of both, however, does not produce positive synergistic effects on grades. A possible explanation is that better learning can be equally achieved by constructing knowledge or by articulating knowledge to others, and that these two mechanisms substantially overlap when used in combination.</p><p>One common finding for both dependent variables is that students in transfer-individual courses exhibited the lowest perceptions of learning and the lowest grades across all conditions. The number of sections classified in this category (only four) and the learning outcomes in these courses indicate that this mode is neither the most preferred by instructors nor the most successful in terms of learning in web-based environments. Given that the perceptions of instructor-learner communication are the lowest for this category, it seems that instructors in this mode used the technology as a replacement for their role as knowledge communicators. To achieve better learning outcomes, particularly for graduate management education, participants in online courses need to collaborate with their counterparts in virtual teams and/ or to be engaged in the construction of their own knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, the results on both dependent variables show an interesting paradox. Students who are in knowledge construction courses do not perceive that they have learned as much as students in knowledge transfer courses. However, their final course grades show that they learn more or better than students in knowledge transfer sections. Because ''constructive'' learning is less structured and requires students to make sense of the material, students may feel they have learned less, a perception that is at odds with their actual knowledge acquisition evidenced in their final grades. It is also possible that due to the different nature of student performance in graded activities in both types of courses (for example, term papers or essays for knowledge construction courses versus multiple choice exams for knowledge transfer courses), performance assessment is more subjective and results in higher grades when students construct their own knowledge than when students reproduce objective content. In either case, this finding underscores that learning perception and performance are not always consistent, as they are measuring different aspects of the learning experience.</p><p>In sum, by separating the effects of knowledge construction from the effects of group collaboration, our results indicate that collaborative approaches result in better learning perception, even in courses where knowledge construction is not the dominant or the most efficient approach. In terms of grades, we found that either one of these factors has a positive effect on student performance. The evidence provided by this research is stronger than previously reported results on this area because it includes multiple courses and compares different approaches at once. To our knowledge, no other empirical study has attempted this multicourse comparison before.</p><p>Unlike prior multi-disciplinary or multi-course empirical studies, our results are robust to the systematic errors introduced by the use of different sections in each mode (group level effects). Using hierarchical analysis of variance, we separate the effects of the main factors (knowledge construction and group collaboration), and their interaction from the nested factor (course-section). This technique has been previously used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref> to control for the effects of working in small groups when collecting and analyzing individual level data. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use this technique in a multi-course study of online environments where the nested factor is the course/section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Limitations</head><p>There are several limitations that must be taken into account in the interpretation of results. First, since the hypotheses were tested in a field experiment in the context of an MBA program rather than in a controlled laboratory experiment, some internal validity is lost at the expense of a greater ability to generalize the results. Although these findings may not be exactly reproduced in other contexts such as other kinds of programs or university settings, the fact that we obtain significant effects attests to the importance of the factors examined here. As Dennis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> p. 186 point out ''If the processes of interest are still observed in an uncontrolled environment with all of its extraneous influences, this bespeaks of the power of those processes.'' Second, we did not explicitly take into account the particular characteristics of the instructors or the subject matters taught in these courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We used the professors' opinions to classify the courses, without imposing our own bias with respect to which courses were more suitable for knowledge construction versus knowledge transfer, or for collaborative versus individual activities. In fact, we classified several sections of the same course in different cells of the framework based on the results of the instructors' interviews. This added flexibility to the comparative field study and allowed us to examine the effects of the two factors beyond the particular characteristics of each instructor and subject matter. However, we control for the combined effect of subject matters and instructor characteristics with the use of the nested factor in our analyses.</p><p>Another limitation is that we developed our research framework by combining two dimensions (knowledge construction and group collaboration) that were operationalized with categorical indicators. In our faculty interviews, we discovered that sometimes instructors combine both knowledge delivery models but subscribe predominantly to one approach over the other. Similarly, our analysis of course design indicators revealed that instructors sometimes use both group collaboration and individual activities. In this study, the perceptions of learner-learner and learner-instructor communication reported by the students confirmed the classification obtained from the instructors' interviews. Follow-up studies may choose to operationalize the knowledge delivery approaches (direct transfer versus constructive) as continuous variables, rather than categorical variables. This would, of course, require an intensive and extensive validation process to ensure the validity and reliability of these metrics when applied to a multi-course, multi-instructor sample such as this one.</p><p>Our dependent variables (learning perception and final grades) may also be affected by methodological limitations inherent to the mechanisms whereby these measures are collected (self-reports in the case of perceived learning) or produced (determined by the instructors in the case of final grades). Nevertheless, the use of both dependent variables offers a more complete picture of the learning experience from the students' perspective. It is possible that the discrepancy in the findings of learning perception and final grades for knowledge construction and knowledge transfer courses may have resulted from a familiarity bias. Students were probably more familiar with instructional methods than with constructivist approaches and this familiarity may have produced higher levels of perceived learning in knowledge transfer courses, despite the fact that final grades are in the opposite direction.</p><p>Another limitation is found in the types of measures used in this project. Since this is a quantitative study, it is likely that qualitative sources of data such as content analysis of web-based interactions or students interviews, may add more depth to our findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We welcome the efforts of future researchers to refine and improve on these methods and measures in future studies.</p><p>There are some advantages offsetting these limitations. The main strength of this study is the validation of the course classification decisions (determined from the instructors' interviews) with two additional methods and data sources. First, we used course design indicators extracted from syllabi and course web sites to ascertain whether the courses had different structures. Second, we also used the students' perception of learner-instructor and learner-learner communication from the post-test survey to confirm whether the courses were delivered as described in the syllabi and reported by the instructors. This validation is equivalent to manipulation checks usually performed in controlled experiments.</p><p>Another strong point of this study, which sets it apart from previous empirical research in multi-course samples, is the use of hierarchical data analysis methods to control for course-section effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Implications</head><p>These findings have important implications for the design of online courses. Some practical implications include the importance of incorporating collaborative learning techniques to create virtual teams of students and foster the growth of a learning community. Groupcommunication facilities, such as discussion boards and chat rooms should be brought to the forefront of the design and delivery of online courses, rather than being an optional or an after-thought activity. This research shows the importance of these group communication facilities to improve the level of learning outcomes achieved by students in online courses.</p><p>This study also shows the importance of developing challenging learning environments where students can discover and create knowledge on their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. These settings are particularly beneficial for knowledge acquisition (measured by final grades). In light of the increasing popularity of web-based courses in graduate and undergraduate programs and their increasing use in corporate training, these findings suggest that online communities for learning or training may obtain better learning outcomes when their work is structured around collaborative activities and/or around knowledge construction exercises.</p><p>There are also important implications for instructors of online environments, identified by prior research but presented in a new light in this study. Although their role may be different, instructors are principal actors in any environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref>. Regardless of the knowledge delivery approach, successful web-based environments require active involvement from instructors. Our study shows that in the context of web-based MBA courses, the technology cannot be used to replace instructors, but rather to complement their task. From the design of the course to its delivery, instructors must create active and engaging learning environments for their students and closely monitor the development of these environments while the course is in progress.</p><p>The research implications of this study are manifold. Future multi-disciplinary studies should expand upon the predictors of outcomes of web-based courses in two directions -individual level variables and course level variables -and use multilevel analysis techniques to assess the significance of these predictors. In addition, the knowledge construction/group collaboration framework developed here can be used to examine the effectiveness of web-based courses at the undergraduate level and/or in other institutional contexts. Finally, researchers should focus their efforts on the development of alternative measures to capture the underlying learning model implemented in each course. These are intriguing areas for future research endeavors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This research contributes to the IS literature in technology-mediated learning by analyzing the effects of knowledge construction and group collaboration in a multi-course sample, and showing how each dimension contributes to learning perception and learning performance. With the use of a multi-course sampling frame, we assess the effects of each factor separately and in combination across a range of subject matters and validate the commonly held assumption that collaborative approaches are better than individual approaches for online courses. Our findings also provide new evidence of the importance of knowledge construction approaches in web-based MBA courses, particularly in terms of final grades.</p><p>Our results suggest that the one-way transmission of knowledge, where students work individually with a set of packaged materials is not the most successful approach for web-based courses. Such courses scored lowest on both the dependent variables included in our study (perceived learning and objective learning). Learners in this kind of environments do not receive the stimulation, the reinforcement and the social support usually found in group activities. The social dimension of learning appears to be essential for the success of these courses, where the sense of the classroom may be lost in the technology-mediated environment. Likewise, the construction of knowledge seems to be essential to engage and challenge learners that are dispersed in time and distributed in place, particularly when they are expected to work individually.</p><p>This study opens new possibilities for future research, specifically in the area of multi-disciplinary studies. Given the amount of research already conducted in the field, the comparison between traditional classrooms and online environments in the context of single courses appears to be no longer productive. The new research challenge is to understand how and why some online environments are more successful than others and derive meaningful lessons, which are applicable across several disciplines and for a wide range of courses. This challenge echoes the call for more breadth and depth in technology-mediated learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and further suggests that by examining a broader sample of courses with a deep understanding of the different implementations of virtual environments, these two objectives can be achieved. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2" xml:id="foot_1"><p>Alavi and Leidner<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> argue that when knowledge is articulated becomes information and when information is cognitively processed becomes knowledge. However, as we will discuss below, in a technology-mediated learning environment, information for instructional purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions about the nature of knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we will refer to instructional content as knowledge.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_2"><p>The correlation between the two dependent variables (grades and perception of learning) is 0.13, and this correlation is significant at 1%. Its low level confirms that objective and perceived learning are two different aspects of learning. However, since both dependent variables are significantly correlated, we use a hierarchical MANOVA models. The results of separate HANOVA analyses are similar to those reported here.</p></note>
