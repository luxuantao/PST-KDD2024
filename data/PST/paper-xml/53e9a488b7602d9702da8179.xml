<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The electrical activity of the cardiac muscle and its relationship with the body surface potentials, namely the electrocardiogram (ECG), has been studied with different approaches ranging from single dipole models to activation maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The goal of these models is to represent the cardiac activity in the simplest and most informative way for specific applications. However, depending on the application of interest, any of the proposed models have some level of abstraction, which makes them a compromise between simplicity, accuracy, and interpretability for cardiologists. Specifically, it is known that the single dipole model and its variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> are equivalent source descriptions of the true cardiac potentials. This means that they can only be used as far-field approximations of the cardiac activity, and do not have evident interpretations in terms of the underlying electrophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, despite these intrinsic limitations, the single dipole model still remains a popular model, since it accounts for 80% to 90% of the power of the body surface potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>Statistical decomposition techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and more recently indepen-dent component analysis (ICA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> have been widely used as promising methods of multichannel ECG analysis, and noninvasive fetal ECG extraction. However, there are many issues such as the interpretation, stability, robustness, and noise sensitivity of the extracted components. These issues are left as open problems and require further studies by using realistic models of these signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Note that most of these algorithms have been applied blindly, meaning that the a priori information about the underlying signal sources and the propagation media have not been considered. This suggests that by using additional information such as the temporal dynamics of the cardiac signal (even through approximate models such as the single dipole model), we can improve the performance of existing signal processing methods. Examples of such improvements have been previously reported in other contexts (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapters 11 and 12]</ref>).</p><p>In recent years, research has been conducted towards the generation of synthetic ECG signals to facilitate the testing of signal processing algorithms. Specifically, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> a dynamic model has been developed, which reproduces the morphology of the PQRST complex and its relationship to the beat-to-beat (RR interval) timing in a single nonlinear dynamic model. Considering the simplicity and flexibility of this model, it is reasonable to assume that it can be easily adapted to a broad class of normal and abnormal ECGs. However, previous works are restricted to single-channel ECG modeling, meaning that the parameters of the model should be recalculated for each of the recording channels. Moreover, for the maternal and fetal mixtures recorded from the abdomen of pregnant women, there are very few works which have considered both the cardiac source and the propagation media <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Real ECG recordings are always contaminated with noise and artifacts; hence besides the modeling of the cardiac sources and the propagation media, it is very important to have realistic models for the noise sources. Since common ECG contaminants are nonstationary and temporally correlated, time-varying dynamic models are required for the generation of realistic noises.</p><p>In the following, a three-dimensional canonical model of the single dipole vector of the heart is proposed. This model, which is inspired by the single-channel ECG dynamic model presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, is later related to the body surface potentials through a linear model that accounts for the temporal movements and rotations of the cardiac dipole, together with a model for the generation of realistic ECG noise. The ECG model is then generalized to fetal ECG signals recorded from the maternal abdomen. The model described in this paper is believed to be an effective means of providing realistic simulations of maternal/fetal ECG mixtures in single and multiple pregnancies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE CARDIAC DIPOLE VERSUS THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM</head><p>According to the single dipole model of the heart, the myocardium's electrical activity may be represented by a timevarying rotating vector, the origin of which is assumed to be at the center of the heart as its end sweeps out a quasiperiodic path through the torso. This vector may be mathematically represented in the Cartesian coordinates, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d(t) = x(t) a x + y(t) a y + z(t) a z ,<label>( 1 )</label></formula><p>where a x , a y , and a z are the unit vectors of the three body axes shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. With this definition, and by assuming the body volume conductor as a passive resistive medium which only attenuates the source field <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, any ECG signal recorded from the body surface would be a linear projection of the dipole vector d(t) onto the direction of the record-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ing electrode axes v = a a x + b a y + c a z ECG(t) = d(t), v = a • x(t) + b • y(t) + c • z(t). (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>As a simplified example, consider the dipole source of d(t) inside a homogeneous infinite-volume conductor. The potential generated by this dipole at a distance of |r| is where φ 0 is the reference potential, r = r x a x +r y a y +r z a z is the vector which connects the center of the dipole to the observation point, and σ is the conductivity of the volume conductor <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Now consider the fact that the ECG signals recorded from the body surface are the potential differences between two different points. Equation (3) therefore indicates how the coefficients a, b, and c in (2) can be related to the radial distance of the electrodes and the volume conductor material. Of course, in reality the volume conductor is neither homogeneous nor infinite, leading to a much more complex relationship between the dipole source and the body surface potentials. However even with a complete volume conductor model, the body surface potentials are linear instantaneous mixtures of the cardiac potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A 3D vector representation of the ECG, namely the vectorcardiogram (VCG), is also possible by using three of such ECG signals. Basically, any set of three linearly independent ECG electrode leads can be used to construct the VCG. However, in order to achieve an orthonormal representation that best resembles the dipole vector d(t), a set of three orthogonal leads that corresponds with the three body axes is selected. The normality of the representation is further achieved by attenuating the different leads with a priori knowledge of the body volume conductor, to compensate for the nonhomogeneity of the body thorax <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The Frank lead system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and the corrected Frank lead system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> which has better orthogonality and normalization, are conventional methods for recording the VCG.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ(t) -φ 0 = d(t) • r 4πσ|r| 3 = 1 4πσ x(t) r x |r| 3 + y(t) r y |r| 3 + z(t) r z |r| 3 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Based on the single dipole model of the heart, Dower et al. have developed a transformation for finding the standard 12-lead ECGs from the Frank electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The Dower transform is simply a 12 × 3 linear transformation between the standard 12-lead ECGs and the Frank leads, which can be found from the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimate of a transformation matrix between the two electrode sets. Apparently, the transformation is influenced by the standard locations of the recording leads and the attenuations of the body volume conductor, with respect to each electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The Dower transform and its inverse <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> are evident results of the single dipole model of the heart with a linear propagation model of the body volume conductor.</p><p>Reza Sameni et al.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>However, since the single dipole model of the heart is not a perfect representation of the cardiac activity, cardiologists usually use more than three ECG electrodes (between six to twelve) to study the cardiac activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">HEART DIPOLE VECTOR AND ECG MODELING</head><p>From the single dipole model of the heart, it is now evident that the different ECG leads can be assumed to be projections of the heart's dipole vector onto the recording electrode axes. All leads are therefore time-synchronized with each other and have a quasiperiodic shape. Based on the single-channel ECG model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (and later updated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>), the following dynamic model is suggested for the d(t) dipole vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ = ω, ẋ = - i α x i ω (b x i ) 2 Δθ x i exp - Δθ x i 2 2 b x i 2 , ẏ = - i α y i ω b y i 2 Δθ y i exp - Δθ y i 2 2 b y i 2 , ż = - i α z i ω b z i 2 Δθ z i exp - Δθ z i 2 2 b z i 2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Δθ x i = (θ -θ x i ) mod(2π), Δθ y i = (θ -θ y i ) mod(2π), Δθ z i = (θ -θ z i ) mod(2π)</formula><p>, and ω = 2π f , where f is the beatto-beat heart rate. Accordingly, the first equation in (4) generates a circular trajectory rotating with the frequency of the heart rate. Each of the three coordinates of the dipole vector d(t) is modeled by a summation of Gaussian functions with the amplitudes of α x i , α y i , and α z i ; widths of b x i , b y i , and b z i ; and is located at the rotational angles of θ x i , θ y i , and θ z i . The intuition behind this set of equations is that the baseline of each of the dipole coordinates is pushed up and down, as the trajectory approaches the centers of the Gaussian functions, generating a moving and variable-length vector in the (x, y, z) space. Moreover, by adding some deviations to the parameters of (4) (i.e., considering them as random variables rather than deterministic constants), it is possible to generate more realistic cardiac dipoles with interbeat variations.</p><p>This model of the rotating dipole vector is rather general, since due to the universal approximation property of Gaussian mixtures, any continuous function (as the dipole vector is assumed to be so) can be modeled with a sufficient number of Gaussian functions up to an arbitrarily close approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Equation (4) can also be thought as a model for the orthogonal lead VCG coordinates, with an appropriate scaling factor for the attenuations of the volume conductor. This analogy between the orthogonal VCG and the dipole vector can be used to estimate the parameters of (4) from the three Frank lead VCG recordings. As an illustration, typical signals recorded from the Frank leads and the dipole vector modeled by (4) are plotted in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>. The parameters of (4) used for the generation of these figures are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. These parameters have been estimated from the best MMSE fitting between N Gaussian functions and the Frank lead signals. As it can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the number of the Gaussian functions is not necessarily the same for the different channels, and can be selected according to the shape of the desired channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Multichannel ECG modeling</head><p>The dynamic model in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) is a representation of the dipole vector of the heart (or equivalently the orthogonal VCG recordings). In order to relate this model to realistic multichannel ECG signals recorded from the body surface, we need an additional model to project the dipole vector onto the body surface by considering the propagation of the signals in the body volume conductor, the possible rotations and scalings of the dipole, and the ECG measurement noises. Following the discussions of Section 2, a rather simplified linear model which accounts for these measures and is in accordance with (2) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) is suggested as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ECG(t) = H • R • Λ • s(t) + W(t), (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where ECG(t) N×1 is a vector of the ECG channels recorded from N leads, s(t) 3×1 = [x(t), y(t), z(t)] T contains the three components of the dipole vector d(t), H N×3 corresponds to the body volume conductor model (as for the Dower transformation matrix), Λ 3×3 = diag(λ x , λ y , λ z ) is a diagonal matrix corresponding to the scaling of the dipole in each of the x, y, and z directions, R 3×3 is the rotation matrix for the dipole vector, and W(t) N×1 is the noise in each of the N ECG channels at the time instance of t. Note that H, R, and Λ matrices are generally functions of time.</p><p>Although the product of H • R • Λ may be assumed to be a single matrix, the representation in (5) has the benefit that the rather stationary features of the body volume conductor that depend on the location of the ECG electrodes and the conductivity of the body tissues can be considered in H, while the temporal interbeat movements of the heart can be considered in Λ and R, meaning that their average values are identity matrices in a long-term study: E t {R} = I, E t {Λ} = I. In the appendix by using the Givens rotation, a means of coupling these matrices with external sources such as the respiration and achieving nonstationary mixtures of the dipole source is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Modeling maternal abdominal recordings</head><p>By utilizing a dynamic model like (4) for the dipole vector of the heart, the signals recorded from the abdomen of a pregnant woman, containing the fetal and maternal heart components can be modeled as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">X(t)=H m • R m • Λ m • s m (t)+H f • R f • Λ f • s f (t)+W(t),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the matrices H m , H f , R m , R f , Λ m , and, Λ f have similar definitions as the ones in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, with the subscripts m and f referring to the mother and the fetus, respectively. Moreover, R f has the additional interpretation that its mean value   </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(E t {R f } = R 0 )</formula><p>is not an identity matrix and can be assumed as the relative position of the fetus with respect to the axes of the maternal body. This is an interesting feature for modeling the fetus in the different typical positions such as vertex (fetal head-down) or breech (fetal head-up) positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">s f (t) = [x f (t), y f (t), z f (t)]</formula><p>T can be assumed as a canonical representation of the fetal dipole vector which is defined with respect to the fetal body axes, and in order to calculate this vector with respect to the maternal body axes, s f (t) should be rotated by the 3D rotation matrix of R 0 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R 0 = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 1 0 0 0 cosθ x sin θ x 0 -sin θ x cos θ x ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ cos θ y 0 sinθ y 0 1 0 -sin θ y 0 cosθ y ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ × ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ cos θ z sin θ z 0 -sin θ z cos θ z 0 0 0 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where θ x , θ y , and θ z are the angles of the fetal body planes with respect to the maternal body planes. The model presented in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) may be simply extended to multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, quadruplets, etc.) by considering additional dynamic models for the other fetuses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Fitting the model parameter to real recordings</head><p>As previously stated, due to the analogy between the dipole vector and the orthogonal lead VCG recordings, the number and shape of the Gaussian functions used in (4) can be estimated from typical VCG recordings. This estimation requires a set of orthogonal leads, such as the Frank leads, in order to calibrate the parameters. There are different possible approaches for the estimation of the Gaussian function parameters of each lead. Nonlinear least-square error (NLSE) methods, as previously suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, have been proved as an effective approach. Otherwise, one can use the A * optimization approach adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, or benefit from the algorithms developed for radial basis functions (RBFs) in the neural network context <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. For the results of this paper, the NLSE approach has been used.</p><p>It should be noted that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) is some kind of canonical representation of the heart's dipole vector; meaning that the amplitudes of the Gaussian terms in (4) are not the same as the ones recorded from the body surface. In fact, using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) to generate synthetic ECG signals, there is an intrinsic indeterminacy between the scales of the entries of s(t) and the mixing matrix H, since there is no way to record the true dipole vectors noninvasively. To solve this ambiguity, and without the loss of generality, it is suggested that we simply assume the dipole vector to have specific amplitudes, based on a priori knowledge of the VCG shape in each of its three coordinates, using realistic body torso models <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned before, the H mixing matrix in (5) depends on the location of the recording electrodes. So in order to estimate this matrix, we first calculate the optimal parameters of (4) from the Frank leads of a given database. Next the H matrix is estimated by using an MMSE estimate between the synthetic dipole vector and the recorded ECG channels of the database. In fact by using the previously mentioned assumption that E t {R} = I and E t {Λ} = I, the MMSE solution of the problem is</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">H = E ECG(t) • s(t) T E s(t) • s(t) T -1 . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>For the case of abdominal recordings, the estimation of the H m and H f matrices in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) is more difficult and requires a priori information about the location of the electrodes and a model for the propagation of the maternal and fetal signals within the maternal thorax and abdomen <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, a coarse estimation of H m can be achieved for a given configuration of abdominal electrodes by using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>) between the abdominal ECG recordings and three orthogonal leads placed close to the mother's heart for recording her VCG. Yet the accurate estimation of H f requires more information about the maternal body, and more accurate nonhomogeneous models of the volume conductor <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The ω term introduced in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) is in general a time-variant parameter which depends on physiological factors such as the speed of electrical wave propagation in the cardiac muscle or the heart rate variability (HRV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Furthermore, since the phase of the respiratory cycle can be derived from the ECG (or through other means such as amplifying the differential change in impedance in the thorax; impedance pneumography) and Λ is likely to vary with respiration, it is logical that an estimation of Λ over time can be made from such measurements.</p><p>The relative average (static) orientation of the fetal heart with respect to the maternal cardiac source is represented by R 0 which could be initially determined through a sonogram, and later inferred by referencing the signal to a large database of similar-term fetuses. Of course, both Λ and R 0 are functions of the respiration and heart rates, and therefore tracking procedures such as expectation maximization (EM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, or Kalman filter (KF) may be required for online adaptation of these parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ECG NOISE MODELING</head><p>An important issue that should be considered in the modeling of realistic ECG signals is to model realistic noise sources. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, the most common high-amplitude ECG noises that cannot be removed by simple inband filtering are (i) baseline wander (BW); (ii) muscle artifact (MA); (iii) electrode movement (EM).</p><p>For the fetal ECG signals recorded from the maternal abdomen, the following may also be added to this list: (i) maternal ECG; (ii) fetal movements; (iii) maternal uterus contractions; (iv) changes in the conductivity of the maternal volume conductor due to the development of the vernix caseosa layer around the fetus <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>These noises are typically very nonstationary in time and colored in spectrum (having long-term correlations). This means that white noise or stationary colored noise is generally insufficient to model ECG noise. In practice, researchers have preferred to use real ECG noises such as those found in the MIT-BIH non-stress test database (NSTDB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, as explained in the following, parametric models such as timevarying autoregressive (AR) models can be used to generate realistic ECG noises which follow the nonstationarity and the spectral shape of real noise. The parameters of this model can be trained by using real noises such as the NSTDB. Having trained the model, it can be driven by white noise to generate different instances of such noises, with almost identical temporal and spectral characteristics.</p><p>There are different approaches for the estimation of timevarying AR parameters. An efficient approach that was employed in this work is to reformulate the AR model estimation problem in the form of a standard KF <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In a recent work, a similar approach has been effectively used for the time-varying analysis of the HRV <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>For the time series of y n , a time-varying AR model of order p can be described as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">y n = -a n1 y n-1 -a n2 y n-2 -• • • -a np y n-p + v n = -y n-1 , y n-2 , . . . , y n-p ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ a n1 a n2</formula><p>. . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">a np ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ + v n ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where v n is the input white noise and the a ni (i = 1, . . . , p) coefficients are the p time varying AR parameters at the time instance of n. So by defining x n = [a n1 , a n2 , . . . , a np ] T as a state vector, and h n = -[y n-1 , y n-2 , . . . , y n-p ] T , we can reformulate the problem of AR parameter estimation in the KF form as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">x n+1 = x n + w n , y n = h T n x n + v n ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where we have assumed that the temporal evolution of the time-varying AR parameters follows a random walk model with a white Gaussian input noise vector w n . This approach is a conventional and practical assumption in the KF context when there is no a priori information about the dynamics of a state vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>To solve the standard KF equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we also require the expected initial state vector x 0 = E{x 0 }, its covariance matrix P 0 = E{x 0 x T 0 }, the covariance matrices of the process noise Q n = E{w n w T n }, and the measurement noise variance r n = E{v n v T n }.</p><p>x 0 can be estimated from a global (time-invariant) AR model fitting over the whole samples of y n , and its covariance matrix (P 0 ) can be selected large enough to indicate the imprecision of the initial estimate. The effects of these initial states are of less importance and usually vanish in time, under some general convergence properties of KFs.</p><p>By considering the AR parameters to be uncorrelated, the covariance matrix of Q n can be selected as a diagonal matrix.  The selection of the entries of this matrix depends on the extent of y n 's nonstationarity. For quasistationary noises, the diagonal entries of Q n are rather small, while for highly nonstationary noises, they are large. Generally, the selection of this matrix is a compromise between convergence rate and stability. Finally, r n is selected according to the desired variance of the output noise.</p><p>To complete the discussion, the AR model order should also be selected. It is known that for stationary AR models, there are information-based criteria such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for the selection of the optimal model order. However, for time-varying models, the selection is not as straightforward since the model is dynamically evolving in time. In general, the model order should be less than the optimal order of a global time-invariant model. For example, in this study, an AR order of twelve to sixteen was found to be sufficient for a time-invariant AR model of BW noise, using the AIC. Based on this, the order of the time-variant AR model was selected to be twelve, which led to the generation of realistic noise samples. Now having the time-varying AR model, it is possible to generate noises with different variances. As an illustration, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, a one-minute long segment of BW with a sampling rate of 360 Hz, taken from the NSTDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, and the synthetic BW noise generated by the proposed method are depicted. The frequency response magnitude of the timevarying AR filter designed for this BW noise is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. As it can be seen, the time-varying AR model is acting as an adaptive filter which is adapting its frequency response to the contents of the nonstationary noise.</p><p>It should be noted that since the vector h n varies with time, it is very important to monitor the covariance matrix of the KF's error and the innovation signal, to be sure about the stability and fidelity of the filter. By using the KF framework, it is also possible to monitor the stationarity of the y n signals, and to update the AR parameters as they tend to become nonstationary. For this, the variance of the innovation signal should be monitored, and the KF state vectors (or the AR parameters) should be updated only whenever the variance of the innovation increases beyond a predefined value. There have also been some ad hoc methods developed for updating the covariance matrices of the observation and process noises and to prevent the divergence of the KF <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>For the studies in which a continuous measure of the noise color effect is required, the spectral shape of the output noise can also be altered by manipulating the poles of the time-varying AR model over the unit circle, which is identical to warping the frequency axis of the AR filter response <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">RESULTS</head><p>The approach presented in this work for generating synthetic ECG signals is believed to have interesting applications from both the theoretical and practical points of view. Here we will study the accuracy of the synthetic model and a special case study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">The model accuracy</head><p>In this example, the model accuracy will be studied for a typical ECG signal of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Diagnostic ECG Database (PTBDB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The database consists of the standard twelve-channel ECG recordings and the three Frank lead VCGs. In order to have a clean template for extracting the model parameters, the signals are pre-processed by a bandpass filter to remove the baseline wander and high-frequency noises. The ensemble average of the ECG is then extracted from each channel. Next, the parameters of the Gaussian functions of the synthetic model are extracted from the ensemble average of the Frank lead VCGs by using the nonlinear least-squares procedure explained in Section 3.3. The Original VCGs and the synthetic ones generated by using five and nine Gaussian functions are depicted in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7(a</ref>    <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The H matrix defined in (5) may also be calculated by solving the MMSE transformation between the ECG and the three VCG channels (similar to ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>)). As with the Dower transform, H can be used to find approximative ECGs from the three original VCGs or the synthetic VCGs. In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7(d)-7</ref>(f), the original ECGs of channels V 1 , V 2 , and V 6 , and the approximative ones calculated from the VCG are compared with the ECGs calculated from the synthetic VCG using five and nine Gaussian functions for one ECG cycle. As it can be seen in these results, the ECGs which are reconstructed from the synthetic VCG model have significantly improved as the number of Gaussian functions has been increased from five to nine, and the resultant signals very well resemble the ECGs which have been reconstructed from the original VCG by using the Dower transform. The model improvement is especially notable, around the asymmetric segments of the ECG such as the T-wave.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the ECG signals which are reconstructed by using the Dower transform (either from the original VCG or the synthetic ones) do not perfectly match the true recorded ECGs, especially in the lowamplitude segments such as the P-wave. This in fact shows the intrinsic limitation of the single dipole model in representing the low-amplitude components of the ECG which require more than three dimensions for their accurate representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The MSE of the calculated ECGs of Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7(d)-7</ref>(f) with respect to the true ECGs is listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Fetal ECG extraction</head><p>We will now present an application of the proposed model for evaluating the results of source separation algorithms.</p><p>To generate synthetic maternal abdominal recordings, consider two dipole vectors for the mother and the fetus as defined in (4). The dipole vector of the mother is assumed to have the parameters listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> with a heart rate of f m = 0.9 Hz, and the fetal dipole is assumed to have the parameters listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, with a heart beat of f f = 2.2 Hz.  As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the amplitudes of the Gaussian terms used for modeling the fetal dipole have been chosen to be an order of magnitude smaller than their maternal counterparts.</p><p>Further consider the fetus to be in the normal vertex position shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>, with its head down and its face towards the right arm of the mother. To simulate this position, the angles of R 0 defined in (7) can be selected as follows: θ x = -3π/4 to rotate the fetus around the x-axis of the maternal body to place it in the head-down position, θ y = 0 to indicate no fetal rotation around the y-axis, and θ z = -π/2 to rotate the fetus towards the right arm of the mother. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>Now according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, to model maternal abdominal signals, the transformation matrices of H m and H f are required,  which depend on the maternal and fetal body volume conductors as the propagation medium. As a simplified case, consider this volume conductor to be a homogeneous infinite medium which only contains the two dipole sources of the mother and the fetus. Also consider five abdominal electrodes with a reference electrode of the maternal navel, and three thoracic electrode pairs for recording the maternal ECGs, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>. This electrode configuration is in accordance with real measurement systems presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, in which several electrodes are placed over the maternal abdomen and thorax to record the fECG in any fetal position without changing the electrode configuration. From the source separation point of view, the maximal spatial diversity of the electrodes with respect to the signal sources such as the maternal and fetal hearts is expected to improve the separation performance. The location of the maternal and fetal hearts and the recording electrodes are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> for a typical shape of a pregnant woman's abdomen. In this table, the maternal navel is considered as the origin of the coordinate system.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that low conductivity layers which are formed around the fetus (like the vernix caseosa) have great influence on the attenuation of the fetal signals. The conductivity of these layers has been measured to be about 10 6 times smaller than their surrounding tissues; meaning that even a very thin layer of these tissues has considerable effect on the fetal components <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The complete solution of this problem which encounters the conductivities of different layers of the body tissues requires a much more sophisticated model of the volume conductor, which is beyond the scope of this example. For simplicity, we define the constant terms in (3) as κ . = 1/4πσ, and assume κ = 1 for the maternal dipole and κ = 0.1 for the fetal dipole. These values of κ lead to simulated signals having maternal to fetal peakamplitude ratios, that are in accordance with real abdominal measurements such as the DaISy database <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>), the electrode locations, and the volume conductor conductivities, we can now calculate the coefficients of the transformation between the dipole vector and each of the recording electrodes for both the mother and the fetus (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</p><p>The next step is to generate realistic ECG noise. For this example, a one-minute mixture of noises has been produced by summing normalized portions of real baseline wander, muscle artifacts, and electrode movement noises of the NSTDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The time-varying AR coefficient described in Section 4 may be calculated for this mixture. We can now generate different instances of synthetic ECG noise by using different instances of white noise as the input of the timevarying AR model. Normalized portions of these noises can be added to the synthetic ECG to achieve synthetic ECGs with desired SNRs.</p><p>A five-second segment of eight maternal channels generated with this method can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>. In this example, the SNR of each channel is 10 dB. Also as an illustration, the 3D VCG loop constructed from a combination of three pairs of the electrodes is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the multichannel synthetic recordings described in this paper can be used to study the performance of the signal processing tools previously developed for ECG analysis. As a typical example, the JADE ICA algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> was applied to the eight synthetic channels to extract eight independent components. The resultant independent components (ICs) can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>.</p><p>According to these results, three of the extracted ICs correspond to the maternal ECG, and two with the fetal ECG. The other channels are mainly the noise components, but still contain some elements of the fetal R-peaks. Moreover The maternal navel is assumed as the center of the coordinate system and the reference electrode for the abdominal leads. some peaks of the fetal components are still valid in the maternal components, meaning that ICA has failed to completely separate the maternal and fetal components.</p><p>To explain these results, we should note that the dipole model presented in (4) has three linearly independent dimensions. This means that if the synthetic signals were noiseless, we could only have six linearly independent channels (three due to the maternal dipole and three due to the fetal), and any additional channel would be a linear combination of the others. However, for noisy signals, additional dimensions are introduced which correspond to noise. In the ICA context, it is known that the ICs extracted from noisy recordings can be very sensitive to noise. In this example in particular, the coplanar components of the maternal and fetal subspaces are more sensitive and may be dominated by noise. This explains why the traces of the fetal component are seen among the maternal components, instead of being extracted as an independent component <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The quality of the extracted fetal components may be improved by denoising the signals with, for example, wavelet denoising techniques, before applying ICA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>This example demonstrates that by using the proposed model for body surface recordings with different source separation algorithms, it is possible to find interesting interpretations and theoretical bases for previously reported empirical results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, a three-dimensional model of the dipole vector of the heart was presented. The model was then used for the generation of synthetic multichannel signals recorded from the body surface of normal adults and pregnant women. A practical means of generating realistic ECG noises, which are recorded in real conditions, was also developed. The effectiveness of the model, particularly for fetal ECG studies, was illustrated through a simulated example. Considering the simplicity and generality of the proposed model, there are many other issues which may be addressed in future works, some of which will now be described.</p><p>In the presented results, an intrinsic limitation of the single dipole model of the heart was shown. To overcome this limitation, more than three dimensions may be used to represent the cardiac dipole model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. In recent works, it has been shown that up to five or six dimensions may be necessary for the better representation of the cardiac dipole <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In future works, the idea of extending the single dipole model to moving dipoles which have higher accuracies can also be studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For such an approach, the dynamic representation in (4) can be very useful. In fact, the moving dipole would be simply achieved by adding oscillatory terms to the x, y, and z coordinates in (4) to represent the speed of the heart's dipole movement. In this case, besides the modeling aspect of the proposed approach, it can also be used as a model-based method of verifying the performance of different heart models.</p><p>Looking back to the synthetic dipole model in (4), it is seen that this dynamic model could have also been presented in the direct form (by simply integrating these equations with respect to time). However the state-space representation has the benefit of allowing the study of the evolution of the signal dynamics using state-space approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Moreover, the combination of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) can be effectively used as the basis for Kalman filtering of noisy ECG observations, where (4) represents the underlying dynamics of the noisy recorded channels. In some related works, the authors have developed a nonlinear model-based Bayesian filtering approach (such as the extended Kalman filter) for denoising single-channel ECG signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, which led to superior results compared with conventional denoising techniques. However, the extension of such proposed approaches for multichannel recordings requires the multidimensional modeling of the heart dipole vector which is presented in this paper. In fact, multiple ECG recordings can be used as multiple observations for the Kalman filtering procedure, which is believed to further improve the denoising results. The Kalman filtering framework is also believed to be extensible to the filtering and extraction of fetal ECG components.    <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</p><p>In this case, the dynamic evolutions of the fetal and maternal dipoles are modeled with (4), and (6) can be assumed as the observation equation. Following the discussions in Section 3, it is known that Gaussian mixtures are capable of modeling any ECG signal, even with asymmetric shapes such as the T-wave (which is rather common in real recordings). However in these cases, two or more Gaussian terms or a log-normal function may be required to model the asymmetric shape. For such applications, it could be simpler to substitute the Gaussian functions with naturally asymmetric functions, such as the Gumbel function which has a Gaussian shape that is skewed towards the right-or left-side of its peak <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. A log-normal distribution may give the same results as the Gumbel, but the Gumbel function allows a more intuitive parameterization in terms of the width, and hence onsets and offsets in the ECG. This may be useful for determining the end of the T-wave, for example, with a high degree of accuracy.</p></div>

Now in order to achieve a time-varying rotation matrix which is coupled with an external source, such as the respiration rate or heart beat (either of the adult or the fetus), any of the θ i j rotation angles can oscillate with the external source frequency, as follows:</p><p>where θ max i j</p><p>is the maximum deviation of the θ i j rotation angle, and f is the frequency of the external source. The axes which are coupled with the oscillatory source depend on the nature of the sources of interest and the geometry of the problem (i.e., the relative location and distance of the sources), and apparently depending on this geometry, other means of coupling are also possible.</p><p>The presented time-varying rotation matrices can be used to model the rotation matrices of the synthetic ECG models defined in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), or as multiplicative factors for the H matrices in these equations.
