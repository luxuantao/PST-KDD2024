A hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set has recently been developed to manage this situation. In line with this development, in this paper, we present a new framework model to address multiple attribute GDM with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. First, the concept of a possibility distribution is defined. Based on the possibility distributions, some aggregation operators such as the hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted average operator and the hesitant fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted average operator are proposed. A consensus measure is then defined and a consensus reaching process is given which uses different identification and direction rules compared with the existing methods. A selection process is also described to rank the alternatives. Both processes are necessary to support stakeholders when making rational decisions. Finally, two simulated examples are given to verify the practicability of the proposed approach.</p><p>Index Terms-Aggregation operator, consensus process, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), possibility distribution, selection process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N REAL decision situations, the experts, characterized by their background and knowledge, express their ideas using linguistic descriptors. In order to deal with the uncertainty concerns regarding the expert subjective assessments, many decision-making models based on linguistic approaches have been developed such as the linguistic twotuple model <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the proportional two-tuple model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, the numerical scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the linguistic computational model based on discrete fuzzy numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, granular computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, and the type-2 fuzzy sets based model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Each of these models has been successful in addressing one particular kind of problem. For example, the two-tuple linguistic model has been widely used because of its accuracy and usefulness in improving the solution process and understanding the results of such processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In the above models, experts provide a single term or interval value to express their preferences. However, in some cases, experts may have a set of possible values about the attributes or alternatives. Hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), whose membership functions are represented by a set of possible values, are, therefore, better at handling these new cases.</p><p>Torra <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> initiated the notable concept of the HFS, which represented a new generalization for fuzzy sets, as this method permits an element to have not just one but a set of several possible membership values. As a result of this innovation, the HFS has attracted increasing attention from the academic world since its introduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Rodríguez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> provided a good review on HFS. However, it has been observed that both fuzzy linguistic and HFS-based approaches are limited when dealing with situations, in which the experts have several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term for an indicator, alternative, or variable. By combining the merits of the HFS and linguistic terms, Rodríguez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> further proposed the concept of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS). This new approach, based on the fuzzy linguistic approach and the use of context-free grammars, increased the flexibility and richness of linguistic elicitation.</p><p>Following the pioneering work of Rodríguez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, HFLTSs have drawn a lot of interest from different points of view. Beg and Rashid <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> extended the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method for HFLTS. Liu and Rodríguez <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> presented a new representation of the HFLTSs by means of a fuzzy envelope to carry out the computing with word processes. Zhu and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> developed a hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation (HFLPR) concept and studied its consistency measures. Zhang and Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> defined the multiplicative consistency property of HFLPRs and gave a characterization of multiplicative consistency for HFLPRs. Liao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> discussed distance and similarity measures for the HFLTS. Wei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> noted the unreasonable case of the comparison method for HFLTS presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and gave possibility degree formulas for comparing HFLTSs.</p><p>The key task of the decision-making approaches of HFLTSs is how to make the best use of the information represented by HFLTSs. The method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> requires that the HFLTSs concerned must have the same length to carry out the computations correctly. However, in many cases, the number of values of different HFLTSs are different. Therefore, in such a method, some normalization method is necessary and the information may be distorted. The envelope method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> aggregated linguistic terms in an HFLTS into a trapezoidal fuzzy set. The envelop method needs an approximate process to realize the transformation from HFLTS to fuzzy set. As there is currently no easy way to deal with the HFLTS, the search for new ways that maintain the simplicity of the current models is still ongoing. In addition, to solve the multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems with HFLTSs, both consensus and selection processes are worth of being generalized as they are the two essential parts of any group decision making (GDM) problem. Since the consensus and selection processes of MAGDM problems with HFLTSs have not been discussed, we also explore these two processes under HFLTSs. Considering the above motivations, we first present the idea of a possibility distribution for an HFLTS. Importantly, the proposed approach provides a natural explanation for the linguistic terms in an HFLTS since HFLTS is originally presented to manage the possible linguistic values. We then develop corresponding operation laws and aggregation operators and build a framework to deal with both consensus and selection processes for MAGDM problems with HFLTSs.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we briefly introduce the HFLTS concepts. In Section III, we define the concept of possibility distribution and present some aggregation operators to manage the HFLTS fusion. In Section IV, we present a consensus reaching process. In Section V, we deal with the selection process. In Section VI, we illustrate the proposed decision-making framework model and make a comparative study by examples. In Section VII, we discuss the characteristics and the potential extensions of the proposed approach. Finally, in Section VIII, we conclude this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In this section, the basic concepts of HFLTS are briefly reviewed and highlighted.</p><p>The fuzzy linguistic approach and other different linguistic extensions are based on the elicitation of simple terms that encompass and express the information provided by the experts using a linguistic variable. However, similar to the situations that are described and managed by the HFS in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, where an expert may consider several values to define a membership function, in the qualitative setting experts may hesitate between several values when assessing a linguistic variable. At present, the fuzzy linguistic approach is very limited when dealing with these situations. To overcome such limitations, Rodríguez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> proposed the concept of HFLTS to increase the richness and flexibility of linguistic information elicitation using linguistic expressions.</p><p>Definition 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>: Let S = {s 0 , . . . , s g } be a linguistic term set, then an HFLTS, H S , is an ordered finite subset of the consecutive linguistic terms of S.</p><p>Based on the above definition, the empty HFLTS and the full HFLTS for a linguistic variable ϑ are defined by H S (ϑ) = ∅ and H S (ϑ) = S, respectively. Some HFLTSs based on S might be H S (ϑ 1 ) = {s 1 , s 2 , s 3 }, H S (ϑ 2 ) = {s 5 }, and H S (ϑ 3 ) = {s 5 , s 6 }.</p><p>Similar to the HFS, we can define the basic computations and operations using an HFLTS as per the following.</p><p>Definition 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>: Let S = {s 0 , . . . , s g } be a linguistic term set. Given three HFLTSs: H S , H 1 S , and H 2 S , the lower and upper bounds, complement, union, and intersection of the HFLTSs are computed as follows.</p><p>1) H - S = min{s i } = s j , s i ∈ H S , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s i ≥ s j , ∀i. 2) H + S = max{s i } = s j , s i ∈ H S ,<label>and</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">s i ≤ s j , ∀i. 3) H c S = S -H S = {s i |s i ∈ S and s i ∈ H S }. 4) H 1 S ∪ H 2 S = {s i |s i ∈ H 1 S or s i ∈ H 2 S }. 5) H 1 S ∩ H 2 S = {s i |s i ∈ H 1 S and s i ∈ H 2 S }.</formula><p>For the sake of convenience, the family of all the HFLTSs defined on S are denoted by HFLTS(S). A simple contextfree grammar G H and a corresponding transformation function were presented by Rodríguez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> to support the elicitation of linguistic information by experts in hesitant situations. In the sequel, it is supposed that all the initial linguistic expressions are transformed into HFLTS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. POSSIBILITY DISTRIBUTION-BASED APPROACH</head><p>In this section, we first introduce the concept of the possibility distribution for HFLTS. Next, we present some aggregation operators to manage the fusion over HFLTS.</p><p>Suppose there are n(n ≥ 2) potential alternatives denoted by A = {A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A n }. Each alternative is evaluated with respect to a predefined attribute set C = {C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C m } (m ≥ 2). There are t experts, = {e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e t }(t ≥ 2). Assume λ = (λ 1 , λ 2 , . . . , λ t ) is the weight vector of the experts, where λ k ∈ (0, 1), k = 1, 2, . . . , t, t k=1 λ k = 1. Suppose that each expert utilizes linguistic variable to express their preferences for the alternatives from a predefined linguistic term set S. However, the experts may be hesitant about the several possible values to evaluate an alternative and therefore each of the attribute values are formulated as an HFLTS. Let R k = (r k ij ) n×m be a hesitant fuzzy linguistic decision matrix given by an expert e k ∈ , where r k ij ∈ HFLTS(S) represents the performance of the alternative A i over the attribute C j ∈ C. The problem in this paper is concerned with the ranking of the alternatives or the selection of the most desirable alternative(s) using the linguistic decision matrices R k , k = 1, 2, . . . , t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Possibility Distribution for HFLTS</head><p>Let S = {s 0 , . . . , s g } be a predefined linguistic term set. Let L and U be two integers where L, U ∈ {0, 1, . . . , g} and L ≤ U. An HFLTS is denoted by ϑ = {s L , s L+1 , . . . , s U } where s L and s U are the lower and upper bounds of ϑ, respectively. Note that ϑ is a discrete set on S. With the linguistic terms given in this way, the bigger L or U is, the better the corresponding alternative. Without additional information, each linguistic term s k in the HFLTS ϑ is supposed to have an equal possibility to be the expert's assessment value. That is, the expert at this time has no further preference for the linguistic variables that they have shown hesitation toward. Since there are U -L + 1 linguistic terms in ϑ, ϑ is thought to be uniformly distributed on {s L , s L+1 , . . . , s U }. Furthermore, ϑ can be considered to have a possibility distribution across the entire linguistic term set S.</p><p>Definition 3: Let S = {s 0 , . . . , s g }. Let ϑ = {s L , s L+1 , . . . , s U } be an HFLTS given by an expert. The possibility distribution for ϑ on S is represented by P = ( p 0 , p 1 , . . . , p l , . . . , p g ), where p l is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p l = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 0 l = 0, 1, . . . , L -1 1/(U -L + 1) l = L, L + 1, . . . , U 0 l = U + 1, . . . , g<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and p l denotes the possibility that the alternative has an assessment value s l provided by the expert such that g l=0 p l = 1 and 0 ≤ p l ≤ 1, l = 0, 1, . . . , g.</p><p>A special case is that the expert has a certain preference and gives only one linguistic term as the assessment value. In this case, (1) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p l = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 0 l = 0, 1, . . . , L -1 1 l = L = U 0 l = U + 1, . . . , g. (2)</formula><p>Different HFLTSs defined on the same S differ at their respective possibility distributions. In probability theory, ϑ is viewed as a discrete random variable and the corresponding possibility distribution P is viewed as a probability mass function. At the beginning, the expert has an equal possibility to employ the linguistic terms in ϑ to evaluate the alternatives. However, after interaction with other experts in the decisionmaking process, both elements in ϑ and possibility distribution may change.</p><p>Example 2: Let S = {s 0 , . . . , s 8 }. ϑ 1 = {s 1 , s 2 } represents that the expert gives a probability 0.5 for s 1 and a probability 0.5 for s 2 , respectively. ϑ 2 = {s 4 , s 5 , s 6 } then indicates that the expert gives a probability of 1/3 for s 4 , s 5 , and s 6 , respectively. The possibility distributions corresponding to ϑ 1 and ϑ 2 are p 1 = (0, 1/2, 1/2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and p 2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 0, 0), respectively.</p><p>Remark 1: Fan and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed probability-based approach to deal with the ordinal interval numbers. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> proposed a concept of distribution assessment in a linguistic term set. The background in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> are quite different from that in this paper. Let S = {s -2 = very poor, s -1 = poor, s 0 = average, s 1 = good, s 2 = very good}. Consider a football coach evaluating the performance of a player in the past ten games. If the coach gave s 2 five times, s 1 two times, and s -1 three times, then the distribution assessment {(s -2 , 0), (s -1 , 0.3), (s 0 , 0), (s 1 , 0.2), (s 2 , 0.5)} can be used to describe this situation. Inspired by the pioneer researches as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, we develop this new way to deal with HFLTS.</p><p>To present the computational technique needed to operate the possibility distributions, the expectation and variance of possibility distributions are defined.</p><p>Definition 4: Let S = {s 0 , . . . , s g } and ϑ ∈ HFLTS(S). The possibility distribution corresponding to ϑ is P = ( p 0 , p 1 , . . . , p l , . . . , p g ). Then, the mean (or expected value) for ϑ indicated by P can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E(ϑ) = g l=0 NS(s l )p l (3)</formula><p>where NS(s l ) is the numerical scale of s l . The numerical scale establishes a one-to-one mapping between the linguistic information and the numerical values <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, to date, there is no easy way to derive a suitable numerical scale NS for a given linguistic term set S. If S is a uniformly and symmetrically distributed linguistic term set, we have NS(s l ) = l.</p><p>Definition 5: Let S, ϑ, and P be as before. Then, the variance for ϑ indicated by P can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Var(ϑ) = g l=0 (NS(s l ) -E(ϑ)) 2 p l (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where NS(s l ) is the numerical scale for s l .</p><p>The comparison of the HFLTSs represented by possibility distributions is conducted according to an ordinary lexicographic order.</p><p>Definition 6: Suppose two HFLTSs ϑ 1 , ϑ 2 ∈ HFLTS(S), so the comparison operation over ϑ 1 and ϑ 2 can be defined as follows.</p><p>1</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">) If E(ϑ 1 ) &lt; E(ϑ 2 ), then ϑ 1 &lt; ϑ 2 , max{ϑ 1 , ϑ 2 } = ϑ 2 and min{ϑ 1 , ϑ 2 } = ϑ 1 . 2) If E(ϑ 1 ) = E(ϑ 2 ), then: a) if Var(ϑ 1 ) &lt; Var(ϑ 2 ), then ϑ 1 &gt; ϑ 2 ; b) if Var(ϑ 1 ) = Var(ϑ 2 ), then ϑ 1 = ϑ 2 .</formula><p>If two possibility distributions have the same mean and variance, then they are also the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Aggregation Operators</head><p>This section is devoted to the development of some aggregation operators for the integration of the HFLTSs based on their possibility distributions. The desirable properties for the developed aggregation operators are then given.</p><p>Definition 7: Let H θ = {ϑ 1 , . . . , ϑ n } be a set of HFLTSs, where ϑ k ∈ HFLTS(S) and W = {w 1 , . . . , w n } are their associated weights such that 0 ≤ w i ≤ 1 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">n k=1 w k = 1. Each ϑ k is transformed to a possibility distribution P k = ( p k 0 , . . . , p k l , . . . , p k g ).</formula><p>The hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted average (HFLWA) operator is also defined as a possibility distribution P = ( p 0 , . . . , p l , . . . , p g ) HFLWA(ϑ 1 , . . . , ϑ n ) = HFLWA P 1 , . . . , P n = p 0 , . . . , p l , . . . , p g <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where p l is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p l = n k=1 w k p k l . (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>Definition 8: Let H θ , W, and P k be as before. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted average (HFLOWA) operator is also defined as a possibility distribution P = ( p 0 , . . . , p l , . . . , p g ) HFLOWA(ϑ 1 , . . . , ϑ n ) = HFLOWA P 1 , . . . , P n = p 0 , . . . , p l , . . . , p g <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where p l is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p l = n k=1 w k p σ (k) l (8)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">{σ (1), . . . , σ (n)} is a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n} such that ϑ σ (i) ≥ ϑ σ (j) if i ≥ j.</formula><p>Note that the aggregated possibility distribution does not in general have a uniform distribution over S but a special discrete distribution over S. However, this is an overall preference value derived from set H θ .</p><p>The properties of the HFLWA and HFLOWA operators are verified in the following. The HFLWA operator satisfies monotonicity, idempotency, and boundedness. The HFLOWA operator satisfies monotonicity, idempotency, boundedness, and commutativity. Please see Appendix A of the supplementary material for the proofs of these properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONSENSUS PROCESS</head><p>A fundamental aspect of GDM is the importance of looking for approaches to reach consensus, a focus which has attracted a great deal of attention and has become a major research topic in the GDM field. Consensus can be understood in various ways and in various contexts in GDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For example, it may refer to the multiple criteria approach, the model, the tools, the procedures or the way that the collective judgments are used to derive the final group preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this paper, consensus refers to the manner in which the group members achieve a minimum level of agreement on the group decision matrix. A large number of approaches have been developed to support the modeling for consensus reaching processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Cabrerizo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Herrera-Viedma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> presented an excellent overview of consensus models based on soft consensus measures in a fuzzy environment.</p><p>From the literature, there have been a few papers which have focused on consensus models in an MAGDM setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. However, these models are not suitable for dealing with the consensus process under a hesitant fuzzy linguistic setting. In the following, we define the consensus measures between two hesitant fuzzy linguistic decision matrices and develop a procedure to reach a consensus in an MAGDM with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Consensus Measure</head><p>There are two categories for computing consensus measures based on the: 1) distance to the collective preference and 2) distance between the experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. This paper follows the latter definition for the consensus measure.</p><p>First, by measuring the distance between two HFLTSs, we have the following definition.</p><p>Definition 9: Suppose two HFLTSs ϑ, η ∈ HFLTS(S), and their corresponding possibility distributions are denoted as P = ( p 0 , . . . , p l , . . . , p g ) and Q = (q 0 , . . . , q l , . . . , q g ), respectively. The similarity degree between these two preference values can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">sd(ϑ, η) = sd(P, Q) = 1 - 1 g g l=0 NS(s l )p l - g l=0 NS(s l )q l (9)</formula><p>where NS(s l ) is the numerical scale for s l . Obviously, 0 ≤ sd(ϑ, η) ≤ 1. The closer sd(ϑ, η) is to 1, the more similar ϑ and η, while the closer sd(ϑ, η) is to 0, the more distant ϑ and η. The level of agreement between experts can be computed in the following steps.</p><p>1) For each pair of experts e l and e k , a similarity matrix SM lk = (sm lk ij ) n×m can be defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">SM lk = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ - . . . sm lk 1m . . . . . . . . . sm lk n1 . . . - ⎞ ⎟ ⎠<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where sm lk ij is the similarity degree between experts e l and e k in their assessments for the alterative A i over the attribute C j , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, . . . , m. That is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">sm lk ij = sd r l ij , r k ij = 1 - 1 g g h=0 NS(s l )p l ij,h - g h=0 NS(s l )p k ij,h<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where P l ij = ( p l ij,0 , . . . , p l ij,g ) and P k ij = ( p k ij,0 , . . . , p k ij,g ) are the possibility distributions for r l ij and r k ij , respectively.</p><p>2) A consensus matrix CM = (cm ij ) n×m is computed by aggregating all the similarity matrices associated with each pair of experts (e l , e k ). There are (t(t -1)/2) similarity matrices. The aggregation is carried out by an aggregation operator, Agg</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">cm ij = Agg(sm lk ij ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, . . . , m. (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>If the arithmetic average operator is implemented</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">cm ij = t-1 l=1 t k=l+1 sm lk ij t(t -1)/2 . (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>3) Once the consensus matrix CM is computed, we can then determine the consensus degrees. As mentioned, inspired by Herrera-Viedma et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> approach, the consensus degrees are explored on the following three levels. a) Attribute Level: The consensus degree for an alternative A i over an attribute C j , denoted as cc ij , is defined to measure the consensus level amongst all the experts on that alternative over the given attribute. In this case, it can be expressed using the element from the collective similarity matrix CM</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">cc ij = cm ij , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, . . . , m. (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>The closer cc ij is to 1, the greater the agreement amongst all experts on the alternative A i over the attribute C j . This measure is used to identify those positions in the decision matrix which have a poor consensus level. b) Alternatives Level: The consensus degree on an alternative A i , called ca i , is defined to measure the consensus level amongst all experts for that alternative</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ca i = m j=1 cc ij m . (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>This measure allows for the identification of those alternatives lower than the threshold. c) Decision Matrix Level: The consensus degree on the decision matrix, called cd, is defined to measure the global consensus level amongst the experts' preferences and is used to control the progress of the consensus reaching process. It is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">cd = min i {ca i }.<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Although the overall consensus degree cd can be calculated using the arithmetic mean of all the consensus degrees on the alternatives, we chose the min operator to allow for a more rigorous criterion. In this way, the compromise between some alternatives with very high consensus levels and those with very low consensus levels is avoided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Consensus Reaching Process</head><p>Once the consensus degrees for the different levels are obtained, a comparison between the actual consensus level and the consensus threshold γ ∈ [0, 1] defined a priori is conducted. If cd ≥ γ , then the consensus reaching process ends; otherwise a new interaction should be conducted. The value of γ depends on the particular problem to be solved and provides a flexible choice for the group to control the progress of the decision process. However, this value has to be carefully chosen to avoid the need for too many alterations. A survey of the literature showed that these parameters are often subjectively determined by the experts in the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>In Herrera-Viedma et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> method, the feedback mechanism used proximity measures to identify those experts furthest away from the collective opinion. This kind of method has two steps: 1) a computation of the proximity measures and 2) a production of the advice. The proximity measures evaluate the agreement between the individual preferences and the group preferences. Note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, the proximity measures in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> are just the consensus measures which are directly used to guide the feedback system. The second step is to generate recommendations or advices for the experts to achieve a solution which has the highest degree of consensus possible. This second step consists of two types of advice rules: 1) identification rules (IRs) and 2) direction rules (DRs). Different to the method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, in our proposed feedback mechanism, we do not use proximity measures but build the advice production directly on the consensus measures developed in Section IV-A. The proposed consensus reaching process for an MAGDM problem with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information is depicted as a flowchart in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>1) IR: These rules are utilized to identify the alternatives, the alternative over the attributes and the experts that contribute less to reach a high consensus level. Bearing this in mind, we define a three-step procedure. a) IR for Alternatives (IR.1): Let ALT be the set of alternatives with the associated consensus degree ca i lower than the specified consensus threshold γ . The IR for the alternatives is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">ALT = {A i |ca i &lt; γ, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}. (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">)</formula><p>This rule identifies which row of the decision matrix should be modified. The alternatives in ALT have different priorities according to the values for ca i . The smaller the ca i is, the bigger the chance that the preferences for A i should change. In particular, if we want to change only one row each time, the set ALT could be replaced by</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">ALT = A i | min i {ca i } . (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b) IR for Attributes of the Identified Alternatives (IR.2):</head><p>For any alternative A i ∈ ALT, this rule identifies the attributes that the associated assessments for these attributes should change. To do this, the set of attributes for A i , called ATT i , is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">ATT i = C j |A i ∈ ALT ∧ cc ij &lt; γ . (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>This rule identifies which column of the decision matrix should be modified for the given rows indented in IR.1. Based on IR.1 and IR.2, the positions that should change are determined. Let the ordered binary pair (i, j) denote a position for the alternative A i over the attribute C j . Then, all the positions in which the assessments should change is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">Pos = {(i, j)|A i ∈ ALT ∧ C j ∈ ATT i }.<label>(20)</label></formula><p>c) IR for Experts (IR.3): This identifies the set of experts that need to receive advice on how to modify their preference values for each element of Pos. The set of experts, called EXPS ij , that should change their preferences are those whose preferences are the most distant from all the other expert preferences at position (i, j). In this case, the distance between expert e l and all other experts e k , k = l is calculated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">d l ij = t k=1,k =l 1 -sd r l ij , r k ij = t -1 - t k=1,k =l sm lk ij . (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_33">)</formula><p>Therefore, EXPS ij can be computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">EXPS ij = e l (i, j) ∈ Pos ∧ d l ij = max k d k ij .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>By combining rules IR.1-IR.3, we know which experts need to change their preferences and where the right place to change is. For example, if e l ∈ EXPS ij , then expert e l should change their preference r l ij . All these elements are further denoted as the set of triples</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">IDF = (l, (i, j)) | e l ∈ EXPS ij ∧ (i, j) ∈ Pos . (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_36">)</formula><p>2) DR: This rule is applied to suggest the direction of the changes to the experts to increase the consensus level in the next round. To do this, a group preference for the position (i, j) has to be computed. The group preferences are considered reference target for the experts. The group preference r c ij is obtained using the HFLWA operator. Let the possibility distribution of r c ij be</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">P c ij = ( p c ij,0 , . . . , p c ij,l , . . . , p c ij,g ) HFLWA r 1 ij , . . . , r t ij = p c ij,0 , . . . , p c ij,l , . . . , p c ij,g<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where p c ij,l is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">p c ij,l = t k=1 λ k p k ij,l . (<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_39">)</formula><p>Based on r c ij , for (l, (i, j)) ∈ IDF, the following DRs are designed. a) DR.1: If r k ij &lt; r c ij , then expert e k should increase their assessment on the alternative A i over the attribute C j . b) DR.2: If r k ij &gt; r c ij , then expert e k should decrease their assessment on the alternative A i over the attribute C j . c) DR.3: If r k ij = r c ij , then expert e k does not need to modify their assessment on the alternative A i over the attribute C j . Note that the comparison between r k ij and r c ij is implemented using Definition 6. If an iterative and a discrete case are taken into account, the experts need to change their preferences by proving the HFLTSs which belong to the original linguistic term set. If an expert wants to continuously adjust their preferences, then the change occurs only on the possibility distribution but not on the original HFLTS. In the latter case, we can build a consensus process that is automatically executed.</p></div>

Application to Personnel Selection</head><p>Due to the increasing competition in the world market, more and more modern organizations have realized the important role of choosing the right personnel for their sustainable development.

In the following, a personnel evaluation and selection problem for a manufacturing company is considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The manufacturing company wishes to recruit a sales manager for a vacant position. After preelimination, a set of four candidates A = {A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 } have been designated for further evaluation. To perform the evaluation, a decision group made up of four experts related to human resources management = {e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , e 4 } was established. After discussion, six attributes were identified to further measure the performance of each candidate. The attributes considered were oral communication skills (C 1 ), past experience (C 2 ), general aptitude (C 3 ), willingness (C 4 ), self-confidence (C 5 ), and first impression (C 6 ). Each expert provided their opinion using HFLTSs based on the following linguistic term set: S = {s 0 = very poor, s 1 = poor, s 2 = slightly poor s 3 = fair, s 4 = slightly good, s 5 = good s 6 = very good}.</p><p>The four hesitant fuzzy linguistic decision matrices are given in Tables I-IV.</p><p>According to the methodology described in the previous section, the following stages are applied.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. DISCUSSION</head><p>In this section, based on the results of the examples, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach and the possible extensions of the proposed model.</p><p>The concept of possibility distribution provides a fundamental vehicle to deal with HFLTSs. In a more general manner, a possibility distribution can be seen as a fuzzy restriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The normalized distribution facilitates the understanding and computation and is therefore adopted. It presents a new way to deal with HFLTSs. As for any fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (MADM) method, one fundamental process is how to deal with the given fuzzy information. The possibility distribution-based approach provides a different perspective to explain the hesitate fuzzy linguistic information. The mean and variance of possibility distributions are defined to compare two HFLTSs. This comparison method has the advantage of high distinguishability as shown in the examples. It provides an alternative way to comparison methods for HFLTSs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. As mentioned in Section I, some existing approaches require the number of values of two HFLTSs has to be extended to the same or need to calculate the envelope with several fuzzy membership functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. These approaches may cause information loss or distortion.</p><p>The presented aggregation operators HFLWA and HFLOWA generalize the crisp WA-like and OWA-like aggregation operators. In Section VI, both aggregation operators have been used in the exploitation process. In the WA-like HFLWA operator, weighting vectors are chosen in such a way that each weight reflects the reliability of the information sources. If we know the weights of criteria, it is recommended to use the HFLWA operators. Otherwise, the HFLOWA operator can be used. In the way of this paper, some other aggregation operators such as the Bonferroni mean and the generalized OWA can be generalized to deal with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Some operators have already been extended to hesitant situations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, amongst others). It was found that the extended aggregation operators possess the same properties as the original crisp aggregation operators. Theoretically, for any preference structure, crisp operators such as WA and OWA can be applied to the new structure.</p><p>The use of consensus reaching process plays a key role in GDM. Because there is no similar study that develops the consensus reaching process for HFLTSs, a direct comparative study is not possible. In our proposed feedback mechanism, we do not use proximity measures but build the advice production directly on the consensus measures developed in Section IV-A. It is worth noting that proximity measures are used only to generate the advice rules. If we can obtain the advice rules directly, we can simplify the consensus process. We first find the position at which the experts need to modify their preferences, and then we find which expert needs to change their preferences. This strategy is more acceptable in the sense that each expert may be asked to make some changes in the consensus process and no one is considered an authority.</p><p>Though the presented consensus process has served its purpose. It can be further improved in some aspects. In real-world applications, both number or percent of experts and positions can be adaptively determined in each round. An adaptive consensus process is a process which adapts its behavior to the agreement achieved in each round <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Let ne be the number or percent of experts in each EXPS ij that need to change their preferences and np be the number or percent of positions in Pos. Then a simple strategy can be designed. The global consensus level cd is first classified into several grades such as very low, low, and medium. Then ne and np are decided according to the current grade. For example, if the grade is very low, then we may take ne = np = 75% and if the grade is low, then we may take ne = np = 50%. Using the adaptive strategy increases the convergence toward the consensus and reduces the number of rounds needed to reach it.</p><p>The framework model described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> has some practical implications. The decision making takes three basic stages into account: the consensus process, the aggregation process, and the exploitation process. It provides a complete procedure handling the case where a group of experts want to achieve concordance among the alternatives. The selection process can be utilized either separately or by combining with the consensus process. Based on the consensus process, other known classical MADM methods such as TOPSIS can be integrated into the framework model.</p><p>A drawback of the proposed approach is that the mean computation for possible distribution depends on the numerical scale of the linguistic terms. If the linguistic term set S is uniformly and symmetrically distributed, it is easy to get the numerical scale. Otherwise it has proved difficult. Fortunately, this problem may be solved according to the nature of the problem itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>Multiple attribute decision making has been found to be a useful tool in solving management problems in organizations. To deal with an MAGDM with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information, we proposed a decision model which incorporated a consensus process and a selection process. We have also given simulated examples to illustrate the use of the proposed approach. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) The concept of possibility distributions for HFLTS has been defined. It is a natural explanation for the linguistic terms in an HFLTS since HFLTS is originally presented to manage the possible linguistic values. 2) By considering the possibility distributions corresponding to the hesitant fuzzy linguistic information, we have presented an HFLWA operator and an HFLOWA operator. We have also discussed the desirable properties for these operators. 3) We have presented a consensus process to assist experts in achieving a predefined consensus level. This consensus process is based on Herrera-Viedma et al.'s method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The proposed consensus process simplifies the existing methods by reducing the proximity measures and adapting different feedback strategies. 4) We have provided a selection process to rank the alternatives which utilizes the HFLWA operator and the HFLOWA operator and can be implemented and understood by choosing the aggregation operator weights. In future work, the developed theoretical structure could be extended to unbalanced linguistic scales and multigranular linguistic settings. Another interesting direction is to analyze the hesitant fuzzy linguistic information in preference relations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Example 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Let S be a linguistic term set S = {s 0 = none, s 1 = very low, s 2 = low s 3 = medium, s 4 = high, s 5 = very high s 6 = perfect}.</figDesc></figure>

The consensus degrees are derived on three levels. a) Attribute Level: The element cm ij of the consensus matrix CM represents the consensus degree cc ij of all experts for alternative A i over the attribute C j . b) Alternatives Level: ca 1 = 0.7894, ca 2 = 0.8981 ca 3 = 0.7708, ca 4 = 0.8056. c) Decision Matrix Level: cd = min i {ca i } = 0.7708.</figDesc></figure>

Taking the (1,1) position as an example, from (21), we have d 1 11 = 1.25, d 2 11 = 0.58, d 3 11 = 0.58, d 4 11 = 0.75. It follows that: EXPS 11 = e l |d l 11 = {e 1 }.</figDesc></figure>

In the second round, the consensus degrees are given in the following. a) Level of Attributes: The similarity matrices are omitted here. The consensus matrix is CM = The element cm ij for the CM shows the consensus level for alternative A i over attribute C j . b) Level of Alternatives: ca 1 = 0.8380, ca 2 = 0.8981 ca 3 = 0.8125, ca 4 = 0.8056. It can be observed that because the experts only modify their preferences on A 1 and A 3 , only the consensus degree changes for these two alternatives. c) Decision Matrix Level: cd = min i {ca i } = 0.8056.Since cd &gt; 0.8 and a predefined consensus level is achieved, we continue to the next stage.</figDesc></figure>
