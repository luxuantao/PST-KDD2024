<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cybersecurity continues to be a serious issue for any sector in the cyberspace as the number of security breaches is increasing from time to time. It is known that thousands of zeroday attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyberattacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As an emerging technology breakthroughs, IoT has enabled the collection, processing and communication of data in smart applications <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. These novel features have attracted city designers and health professionals as IoT is gaining a massive application in the edge of networks for real time applications such as eHealth and smart cities <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. However, the growth in the number, and sophistication of unknown cyber-attacks have cast a shadow on the adoption of these smart services. This emanates from the fact that the distribution and heterogeneity of IoT applications/services make the security of IoT complex and challenging <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. In addition, attack detections in IoT is radically different from the existing mechanisms because of the special service requirements of IoT which cannot be satisfied by the centralized cloud: low latency, resource limitations, distribution, scalability and mobility, to mention a few <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. This means that neither cloud nor standalone attack detection solutions solve the security problems of IoT. Because of this, a currently emerged novel distributed intelligence, known as fog computing, should be investigated for bridging the gap. Fog computing is the extension of cloud computing towards the network edge to enable cloud-things service continuum. It is based on the principle that data processing and communication should be served closer to the data sources <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The principle helps in alleviating the problem of resource scarcity in IoT as costly storage, computation and control, and networking might be offloaded to nearby fog nodes. This in turn increases the effectiveness and efficiency of smart applications. Like any services, security mechanisms in IoT could be implemented and deployed at fog layer level, having fog nodes as a proxy, to offload expensive storage and computations from IoT devices. Thus, fog nodes provide a unique opportunity for IoT in deploying distributed and collaborative security mechanisms.</p><p>Though fog computing architecture can offer the necessary service requirements and distributed resources, robust security mechanisms are also needed resources to protect IoT devices. As preventive security schemes are always with the shortcomings design and implementation flaws, detective mechanisms such as attack detection are inevitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Attack detections can be either signature based or anomaly based schemes. The signature based solution matches the incoming traffic against the already known attack types in the database while anomaly based scheme caters for attack detection as a behavioral deviation from normal traffic. The former approach has been used widely because of its high accuracy of detection and low false alarm rate, but criticized for its incapability to capture novel attacks. Anomaly detection, on the other hand, detects new attacks though it lacks high accuracy. In both approaches, classical machine learning has been used extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. With the ever increasing in the attacker's power and resources, traditional machine learning algorithms are incapable of detecting complex cyber breaches. Most of these attacks are the small variants of previously known cyberattacks (around 99% mutations). It is evident that even the so called novel attacks (1%) depend on the previous logics and concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This means that traditional machine learning systems fail to recognize this small mutation as it cannot extract abstract features to distinguish novel attacks or mutants from benign. The success of deep learning in big data areas can be adopted to combat cyber threats because mutations of attacks are like small changes in, for instance, image pixels. It means that deep learning in security learns the true face (attack or legitimate) of cyber data on even small variations or changes, indicating the resiliency of deep learning to small changes in network data by creating high level invariant representations of the training data. Though the application of DL has been mainly confined to big data areas, the recent results obtained on traffic classification, and intrusion detection systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>,[10], <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> indicate that it could have a novel application in identification of cyber security attacks.</p><p>Deep learning (DL) has been the breakthroughs of artificial intelligence tasks in the fields of image processing, pattern recognition and computer vision. Deep networks have obtained a momentum of unprecedented improvement in accuracy of classification and predictions in these complex tasks. Deep learning is inspired by the human brain's ability to learn from experience instinctively. Like our brain's capability of processing raw data derived from our neuron inputs and learning the high-level features on its own, deep learning enables raw data to be fed into deep neural network, which learns to classify the instances on which it has been trained [12], <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. DL has been improved over classical machine learning usually due to the current development in both hardware resources such as GPU, and powerful algorithms like deep neural networks. The massive generation of training data has also a tremendous contribution for the current success of deep learning as it has been witnessed in giant companies such as Google and Facebook [14], <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. The main benefit of deep learning is the absence of manual feature engineering, unsupervised pre-training and compression capabilities which enable the application of deep learning feasible even in resource constraint networks <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. It means that the capability of DL to self-learning results in higher accuracy and faster processing. This research is aimed at adopting a novel distributed attack detection using deep learning to enable the detection of existing or novel attacks in IoT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The contributions of our research area:</head><p> To design and implement deep learning based distributed attack detection mechanism, which reflects the underlying distribution features of IoT  To demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in attack detection systems in comparison to traditional machine learning in distributed IoT applications  To compare the performance of parallel and distributed network attack detection scheme using parameters sharing with a centralized approach without parameters sharing in IoT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Though research works in the application of deep learning have currently flourished in domains like pattern recognition, image processing and text processing, there are a few promising researches works around cybersecurity using deep learning approach.</p><p>One of the applications of deep learning in cybersecurity is the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> on NSL-KDD dataset. Although the work is novel in its approach, the artificial data used, and its centralized approach might limit its practicality in fog networks. Another research of this category has been conducted by <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. The authors have proposed IDS which adaptively detect anomalies using AutoEncoders on artificial data. Both anomaly detection papers considered artificial data cases which do not reflect the malicious and normal behaviors of real time networks. Apart from that, they adopted a centralized approach which is impractical for distributed applications such as social internet of things in smart city networks.</p><p>Deep learning approach has also been applied by <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>    (1) , x (2) ,x (3)     </p><formula xml:id="formula_0"> S k  Ip th  P s  N L  W u  g  w (w p  im u  ft F  M b  p c m  s to R  b c s  r  lo I  p s S  s  N  B b  T u  P r  L</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>In the evaluation process, classification accuracy and other metrics were used to show the effectiveness of our scheme compared to shallow models in distributed IoT at fog level. The comparison of distributed training to centralized approach in accuracy is also one of our evaluation criteria. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> compares the accuracy of the deep and shallow models, while fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the accuracy difference between centralization and distribution.     The experiment result has demonstrated double standards. The first one is that the distributed model has a better performance than the centralized model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We proposed a distributed deep learning based IoT/Fog network attack detection system. The experiment has shown the successful adoption of artificial intelligence to cybersecurity, and designed and implemented the system for attack detection in distributed architecture of IoT applications such as smart cities. The evaluation process has employed accuracy, the detection rate, false alarm rate, etc as performance metrics to show the effectiveness of deep models over shallow models. The experiment has demonstrated that distributed attack detection can better detect cyber-attacks than centralized algorithms because of the sharing of parameters which can avoid local minima in training. It has also been demonstrated that our deep model has excelled the traditional machine learning systems such as softmax for the network data classification into normal/attack when evaluated on already unseen test data. In the future, we will compare distributed deep learning IDS for on another dataset and different traditional machine learning algorithms such as SVM, decision trees and other neural networks. Additionally, network payload data, will be investigated to detect intrusion as it might provide a crucial pattern for differentiation.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, with the number of increased nodes in the distributed network of Fog systems, the overall accuracy of detection increased from around 96% to over 99%. The detection rate in table 6 also exhibits that deep learning is better than classic machine learning for both binary and multi-classes. This shows that distributing attack detection functions across worker fog nodes is a key mechanism for attack detection in social IoT systems such as a smart city which needs real time detection. The increase in accuracy on distributed scheme could be because of collaborative sharing of learning parameters which avoids overfitting of local parameters, and hence, contributes to the accuracies of each other. On the other hand, the accuracy of the deep model is greater than that of shallow model, as shown in the table 6. In addition, table6shows the false alarm rate of the deep model, 0.85% is much less than that of machine learning model (6.57%). As shown in table 7 (a) and (b), the performance of deep learning is better than the normal machine learning model for each class of attack. For instance, the recall of deep model is 99.27%, while the traditional model has a recall of 97.50% for a binary classification. Similarly, the average recall of DM is 96.5% whereas SM has scored average recall of 93.66% in multi-classification.</figDesc><table><row><cell>However, fig.4 shows that deep learning takes longer learning</cell></row><row><cell>time than traditional machine learning algorithms while the</cell></row><row><cell>detection rates (fig.5) of the both algorithms are significantly</cell></row><row><cell>the same.
