<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is an emerging research topic in the future fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks, which is expected to support massive connectivity for massive machine type communications (mMTC). Due to the sporadic communication nature of mMTC, the grantfree transmission methodology is highly expected in uplink NOMA systems, to drastically reduce the transmission latency and signaling overhead. Exploiting the inherent sparsity nature of user activity, compressive sensing (CS) techniques have been applied for efficient multi-user detection in the uplink grantfree NOMA. In this paper, we propose a prior-information aided adaptive subspace pursuit (PIA-ASP) algorithm to improve the multi-user detection performance. In this algorithm, a parameter evaluating the quality of the prior-information support set is introduced, in order to exploit the intrinsically temporal correlation of active user support sets in several continuous time slots adaptively. Then, to mitigate the incorrect estimation effect of the prior support quality information, a robust prior-information aided adaptive subspace pursuit (R-PIA-ASP) algorithm is further proposed, which adaptively exploits the prior support based on the corresponding support quality information in a conservative way. It is noted that both of the two proposed algorithms do not require the knowledge of the user sparsity level, while most of state-of-the-art CS-based multi-user detection algorithms usually need. Moreover, for the two proposed algorithms, the upper bound of the signal detection error and the computational complexity are derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms are capable of achieving much better performance than that of the existing CS-based multi-user detection algorithms with similar computational complexity.</p></div>

Different from eMBB, mMTC and URLLC mainly target services of Internet of Thing (IoT) and vertical industries where performance requirements cannot be well met by legacy mobile communication systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. As a consequence, mMTC and URLLC are the extended scenarios for 5G.</p><p>From a technical perspective, mMTC focuses on the uplink communication of a massive number of low-rate devices with very short packets (of few bytes), requires a completely different set of technologies than those designed to support humantype communications in previous communication systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To meet the challenging demand of massive connectivity, mMTC demands efficient multiple access techniques, which are undergoing paradigm shift from orthogonal to nonorthogonal based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have been extensively investigated, which can support massive connectivity by the non-orthogonal resource allocation among devices using limited resources. On the other hand, mMTC has the characteristic of random access that users transmit small data packets occasionally, namely sporadic communication. Clearly, the conventional grant-based access control methodology ("asking-for-grant" procedure) in 4G is already not suitable for mMTC, since this way results in excessive control signaling cost and large latency. Moreover, the signaling overheads for coordination are proportional to the number of users in the network. Against this background, a grant-free transmission methodology is highly expected in uplink NOMA systems, in which users can randomly transmit data at any time slot without any handshaking process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>For current wireless communication systems, extensive experimental reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> have shown that the number of active users does not exceed 10% of the total number of potential users even in a busy-hour. This implies that, in this sporadic communication scenario, even if there are a lot of potential users, only a small portion of users transmit data simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This characteristic still exists in mMTC due to massive connectivity. Thus, the sparsity of user activity naturally exists in the uplink grant-free NOMA, which inspires us to formulate multi-user detection problem under the compressive sensing (CS) framework. CS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> itself is a promising field to reconstruct a sparse physical signal exactly 0733-8716 (c) 2017 IEEE.

In recent years, CS has also been considered in context of communications, such as channel estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The problem of detecting both user activity and data in code division multiple access (CDMA) systems has been studied under the CS framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. However, most of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> only consider the one-time static CS-based multiuser detection and ignore some important ubiquitous information (e.g., temporal correlation). Thus these solutions refer to algorithms that recover each sparse signal independently without using any information from the past time. In practice, we often encounter a problem of detecting a sequence of sparse signals which is usually correlated across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The question to answer would be how to use previously reconstructed signal to improve compressive detection at the current time. Given this, the grant-free problem can be solved based on continuous-time slots model to further improve the multi-user detection performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. For mMTC context, the sparsity structure may remain fixed over an entire data frame, which can be termed as frame-wise sparsity (structured sparsity). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, an iterative order recursive least square (IORLS) algorithm was proposed to achieve a good performance, based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. On the basis of the iterative support detection (ISD) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed a structured iterative support detection (SISD) algorithm to recover multiple sparse signal vectors in a joint manner. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a joint multi-user detection algorithm based on approximate message passing (AMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and expectation maximization (EM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> algorithms was investigated, termed joint-EM-AMP algorithm. By jointly exploiting the structured sparsity of user activity and the prior information of the transmitted discrete symbols, the joint-EM-AMP algorithm can obtain a good symbol error rate (SER) performance. These strategies use the assumption that the active user support set (i.e., the set of indices of the active users) does not change with time. However, users tend to randomly enter or leave the system in the mMTC scenario, and the active user support sets may change over time, i.e., the active user support sets in different time slots are allowed to be different. Consequently, the structured sparsity is not the most suitable model for uplink grant-free NOMA systems.</p><p>In the real-world scenario, although the sporadic communication of mMTC, some users generally transmit their data in adjacent time slots with a high probability. In other words, the active user support set changes with time, but the changes are slow. As such, there is huge potential to exploit this temporal correlation of active user support sets in several continuoustime slots to enhance the multi-user detection performance. By exploiting the temporal correlation between two signals supports, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proposed a dynamic compressive sensing based (DCS-based) algorithm for the more practical scenario that the active user support sets can change in several continuous time slots. The main idea is that, instead of starting with an initial empty support set, the DCS-based algorithm starts with the previously estimated user support set as being the initial support set for each time slot. In this way, the DCS-based algorithm can acquire some SER performance gain, but the assumption of the known user sparsity level at BS is unrealistic. Additionally, the previous works only focus on exploiting the support correlation structure (i.e., the temporal correlation relationship among different time slots) and completely ignore the quality of the previously estimated active user support Γ [t-1] . Actually, in grant-free NOMA, the practical active user support is temporarily correlated but is also dynamic across time, and the previously estimated active user support Γ [t-1] contains only part of correct indices for Γ [t]  of the present time. Therefore, the DCS-based algorithm only blindly exploits the previously estimated active user support Γ [t-1] , which may be a room for further multi-user detection performance improvement.</p><p>Against this background, we introduce the parameter s p , which is a metric to indicate the quality of Γ [t-1] for Γ [t] . Then, we develop two novel CS-based algorithms to exploit the previously estimated active user support Γ [t-1] adaptively based on the corresponding support quality information s p . Furthermore, we present the recovery distortion analysis of the two proposed algorithms, and we discover that a better quality prior support can lead to a better multi-user detection performance. Additionally, the computational complexity analysis is also provided. Compared with the existing CS-based algorithms, the two proposed algorithms have the same order of computational complexity. Simulation results verify that the two proposed algorithms are superior to its counterparts (the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and subspace pursuit (SP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>) in uplink grant-free NOMA systems. We now summarize our major contributions as follows:</p><p>• Prior-information aided adaptive CS-based algorithm design: In order to enhance the multi-user detection performance in uplink grant-free NOMA, an adaptive CSbased detection algorithm based on the classical SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> algorithm, namely prior-information aided adaptive SP (PIA-ASP), is designed. Specifically, the prior support 1] is exploited adaptively based on the quality information s p . Simulation results verify that the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm is superior to its counterparts.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Γ [t-</formula><p>• Robust prior-information aided adaptive CS-based algorithm design: The support quality information s p of the previously estimated active user support Γ [t-1] may be over-estimated. This is to say, for Γ [t] , only less than s p indices come from Γ [t-1] in fact, while we wrongly consider that s p indices are from Γ [t-1] . To mitigate the incorrect estimation effect of s p in the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm, we redesign a robust priori-information aided adaptive SP (R-PIA-ASP) algorithm, which adaptively exploits Γ [t-1] based on s p in a conservative way.</p><p>• Adaptively acquire the sparsity level: Most of the state-of-the-art CS-based multi-user detection algorithms usually require the user sparsity level as the priori information for reliable detection. Fortunately, the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms take advantages of bottom-up approaches to estimate the actual user sparsity level step by step. Accordingly, the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms can remove this unrealistic assumption, and adaptively acquire the sparsity level of user activity. In this paper, the terms "the previously estimated user support set" and "the prior user support set" are used interchangeably. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.</p><p>In Section II, we present the system model for the uplink grant-free NOMA scheme. Then, we introduce the metric to quantify the quality of the previously estimated active user support. Section III describes the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms, and Section IV presents the performance analysis of the recovery distortion and the computational complexity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>Throughout the paper, we assume that devices in mMTC generate sporadic traffics. In this case, although the number of potential users can be very large, only a fraction of them have data to transmit at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For this reason, grant-free NOMA might be suitable for communications from devices of short packets to the BS, without a complex requestgrant procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Thus, the BS has to not only identify the users who transmitted but also decode the received data simultaneously. Since the sporadic traffics from devices naturally exists in mMTC scenario, the sparsity of user activity can be exploited to derive computationally efficient multi-user detection algorithms for a receiver at the BS under the CS framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. One-Time Slot Static Model</head><p>In this paper, we consider a typical uplink grant-free NOMA system where K users transmit data to a central BS, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. For simplicity but without loss of generality, we assume that all users and BS are equipped with singleantenna.</p><p>In a given time interval, some users are active while others are inactive, which makes the communications sporadic. After channel coding and modulation, the transmitted symbol x k for active user k is taken from a complex-constellation set χ 0 , e.g., M-QAM, whose cardinality is M . For inactive users, their transmission is equivalent to transmitting zero. Thus, the augmented complex-constellation set χ ∆ = {χ 0 0} denotes the modulated symbol of both active and inactive users. Then the transmitted symbol x k is spread onto a unique spreading sequence s k with length N . In order to accommodate the demand of massive connectivity in mMTC, we consider Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Illustration of a typical uplink grant-free NOMA system. The active user and inactive user, refer to the users that are transmitting signal and keeping silent, respectively, in the considered time slot.</p><p>the overload system, i.e., N &lt; K. After that, the signals transmitted by active users simultaneously propagate through different channels, and then are superimposed at the BS. Thus, for synchronous reception and perfectly known channels for all K users, the received signal at the BS for the current slot can be given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y = K k=1 diag (h k )s k x k + z = Gx + z ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">h k = (h 1,k , • • •, h N,k )</formula><p>T is the fading channel gain between user k and BS, whose elements obey the independent complex Gaussian distributions CN (0, 1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">s k = (s 1,k , • • •, s N,k )</formula><p>T is the spreading sequence vector of user k. z is the noise vector, and follows the complex Gaussian distribution CN (0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">σ 2 I). x = [x 1 , x 2 , • • •, x K ]</formula><p>T is the transmitted signal vector for all K users. G is the equivalent channel matrix, whose element g n,k in the n-th row and the k-th column equals to h n,k s n,k , i.e., g n,k = h n,k s n,k . As mentioned before, the transmitted symbol vector x is sparse due to the naturally existing sparsity of user activity. Consequently, the main goal is to use the powerful tool of CS to realize joint user activity and data detection x from the received signal y, given the equivalent channel matrix G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Continuous-Time Slots Dynamic Model</head><p>Generally, the underlying time-varying sparse signal exhibits substantial temporal correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In real-world communication scenarios, although users can randomly access or leave the system, some users generally transmit their information in adjacent time slots with a high probability, which leads to the temporal correlation of active user sets in several continuous time slots.</p><p>Motivated by the analysis mentioned above, we can extend the basic one-time slot static model to the continuoustime slots dynamic model. The objective is to recover the transmitted signals X = x [1] , x [2] , • • •, x [T ] , where x [t]  is the signal at t-th time slot, from the received signals Y = y [1] , y [2] , • • •, y [T ] , in T successive time slots. The formulating can not only detect the transmit signals X in the continuous-time slots, but also achieve better reconstruction. The received signal y [t] at the t-th time slot can be represented as the following one-time slot static model, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y [t] = G [t] x [t] + z [t] , ∀t,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where G [t] is the equivalent complex channel matrix at the t-th time slot, which contains the channel gains and spreading sequences of all K users, and z [t] is the Gaussian noise vector at the t-th time slot. Furthermore, as mentioned before, the active user support sets have a substantial correlation in time, which means that the user support set of the previous time slot can be good predictor for the user support set of the current time slot. Hence, the existing CS-based algorithms can incorporate the temporal correlation to improve the multi-user detection performance for the continuous-time slots dynamic model.</p><p>It should be noted that, for the reconstruction of x [t] neither the locations nor the values of the non-zero elements are known, and both have to be jointly detected. Before we elaborate the CS recovery algorithms, we first elaborate the considered signal sparsity model and the prior support information in the following sections.</p><p>We use Γ [t] to denote the active user support set of x [t] , i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Γ [t] = k : x [t] (k) = 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ K , ∀t,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where x [t] (k) denotes the transmitted data of the k-th user in the transmitted signal vector x [t] . The sparsity level in terms of the support cardinality Γ [t] is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">s [t] = Γ [t] 0 , ∀t,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where s [t] ≤ s max K, s max denotes the maximum number of nonzero elements in x [t] .</p><p>Actually, the receiver at BS does not know the locations and the amount of non-zero elements in sparse vector x [t] . Furthermore, the active user sets may change in different time slots, where users randomly access or leave uplink grant-free NOMA systems. Hence, in the practical mMTC scenarios, both of the support Γ [t] and the sparsity level s [t] may change in different time slots. Unfortunately, the most existing works (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>) only deal with the fixed sparsity level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Prior Support Information</head><p>As mentioned above, some users generally transmit their data in adjacent time slots with a high probability, which leads to the temporal correlation of active user support sets in consecutive time slots. Thus the active user support sets of consecutive time slots are similar to each other, i.e., Γ [t-1]  and Γ [t] share many common entries. In this way, there is huge potential to exploit the previously estimated user support of x [t-1] to enhance the recovery performance of x [t] at the present time, where 1 ≤ t ≤ T . Different from the previous work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which exploits the previously estimated user support Γ [t-1] blindly, we further take the quality of Γ [t-1] into consideration. Since the practical user support is temporarily Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Illustration of the previously estimated user support Γ [t-1] and quality information sp for Γ [t] of the present time slot, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">&gt; @ 1 t x &gt; @ t x (t-</formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">Γ [t-1] 0 = 5, Γ [t] 0 = 7, sp ≤ Γ [t-1] Γ [t] 0 = 4.</formula><p>(Note that the colored and white elements of vectors denote the active and inactive users of the vectors, respectively.) correlated but is also dynamic across time, the previously estimated user support Γ [t-1] contains only part of correct indices for Γ [t] of the present time, which can be illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Hence, it is desirable to exploit adaptively based on the quality of Γ [t-1] for the t-th time slot. Obviously, the quality of the estimated user support Γ [t-1] refers to how many indices in Γ [t-1] are correct for Γ [t] at the t-th time slot. Now, we can define the parameter s p as the metric to indicate the quality of the estimated user support Γ [t-1] . Based on the metric s p and Γ [t-1] , the prior information of the present user support Γ [t] can be characterized by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">     s p ≤ Γ [t-1] 0 ≤ s max 0 ≤ s p ≤ Γ [t-1] Γ [t] 0 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Particularly, s p characterizes the size of common active users between Γ [t-1] and Γ [t] . The larger s p is, the larger number of correct indices in Γ [t-1] is, and the better quality of Γ [t-1] is. In other words, a larger s p indicates a stronger temporal correlation between active user supports of consecutive time slots. Hence, s p can be further used to enhance the multi-user detection performance, which will be detailed in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED PRIOR-INFORMATION AIDED COMPRESSIVE SENSING FRAMEWORK</head><p>Iterative greedy algorithms have received significant attention due to their low complexity and simple geometric interpretation. They include OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit (StOMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, iterative hard thresholding (IHT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, regularized OMP (ROMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Among them, only the CoSaMP and SP algorithms have comparable theoretical reconstruction quality comparable to that of linear programming (LP) methods, and exhibit the low reconstruction complexity. In each iteration, the SP algorithm only add s max new candidates, while the CoSaMP algorithm adds 2s max vectors. This makes the SP algorithm computationally more efficient. Moreover, the restricted isometry constant for which the SP algorithm is guaranteed to converge is larger than the CoSaMP algorithm. As a consequence, it can obtain the similar good properties based on the classical SP methodology, in designing the two proposed algorithms. Meanwhile, we have found it convenient to incorporate temporal correlation into the SP methodology. Particularly, the correlation value in magnitude for the support estimation in the SP methodology provides an easy interface to incorporate the previously estimated active user support Γ [t-1] and quality information s p .</p></div>

Prior-Information Aided Adaptive SP Algorithm</head><p>With the aid of the previously estimated user support set Γ [t-1] and the corresponding quality information s p , we propose the prior-information aided adaptive SP (PIA-ASP) algorithm as described in Algorithm 1 to realize both user activity detection and data detection for uplink grant-free NOMA systems. It is worth noting that, in Algorithm 1, the previously estimated user support set Γ [t-1] can act as the prior support set Γ p for the present time support set Γ [t] . Developed from the classical SP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm exploits the quality information s p to further improve multi-user detection performance.</p><p>As can be seen in Algorithm 1, for lines 2-9, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm aims to acquire the solution x [t] to (2) with the fixed sparsity level s in a greedy manner, which is similar to the classical SP algorithm. When R</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">[t](i) 2 ≥ R [t](i-1)</formula><p>2 is triggered in line 8, it indicates that the s-sparse solution x [t] to (2) has been obtained, and begins to find the (s + 1)sparse solution x [t] . Algorithm 1 has two stopping criteria, and meeting either of them will trigger the termination of the iterative procedure. To ensure the desired robust sparse signal recovery performance, the stopping criterion design is of critical importance. Next, we give the design details for the stopping criteria in the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm.</p><p>The first stopping criterion is developed from the perspective of the average residual energy.

The first stopping criterion is related to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, but the sparsity level s [t]  is unknown at the receiver. Furthermore, N s [t] in the typical uplink grant-free NOMA system. Thus we can neglect the effect of s [t] for (6), and set s [t] = 0 here. Actually, α is empirically given. Since only noise n [t] is the source of distortion in the case of perfect sparse signal recovery, the chosen scaling factor (after several experiments) is α = 1. The first stopping criterion controls the temporal energy of the residual.</p><p>When the user sparsity level is over-estimated, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm begins to reconstruct AWGN noise. Specifically, after coordinates accounting for the exact sparsity level is achieved, the procedure of the next sparsity level will include a virtual coordinate that is dominated by the AWGN noise. The energy of such a new coordinate is usually lower than the noise floor. Motivated by the analysis, we can construct the second stopping criterion as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">min x [t](i) (m) 2 2 ≤ P th ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where m ∈ Γ [t](i) , P th is the AWGN noise floor, which can be selected experimentally.</p><p>As shown in Algorithm 1, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm differs from the classical SP algorithm mainly in the following three aspects:</p><p>1) Adaptively exploit the temporal correlation: Unlike the classical SP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm jointly reconstructs the high-dimensional sparse vectors from the low-dimensional measurement vectors by exploiting the inherently temporal correlation feature of active user sets in consecutive time slots. Furthermore, the prior support is exploited adaptively based on the quality information s p , in the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm. To be specific, the operations of support estimate (line 3) and the support pruning (line 5) both contain two parts for the newly added support, in the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm. Taking the process of the support estimate (line 3) for instance, the newly added support contains two parts, i.e., Λ a and Λ b . When selecting Λ a , the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm selects it associated with the prior support Γ p with size s p . Λ b with size s -s p is selected from {1, 2, • • •, K} \Λ a . Similarly, for two parts of the support pruning (line 5), Γ a with size s p is selected from the prior support Γ p , Γ b with size s -s p is selected from others. This way, at least s p indices from Γ p can be exploited for the improved signal detection performance.</p><p>2) Adaptively acquire the sparsity level: In practical uplink grant-free NOMA systems, the actual user sparsity level s [t]  is often time-varying and unknown. Both the classical SP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> assume that the sparsity level s [t] is known, whereas s [t] is not available at the receiver. Fortunately, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm removes the unrealistic assumption, since the real user sparsity level is replaced by a variable to eliminate the dependence on sparsity. Consequently, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm can adaptively acquire the sparsity level of user activity and yield the reliable sparse signal reconstruction without the priori knowledge of user sparsity level.</p><p>3) Sophisticated stopping criterion: Instead of directly designing the stopping criterion, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm firstly focuses on the average value of the residual for the first stopping criterion, which is set more analytically. Regarding the second halting criterion, it is more suitable for the practical receiver, which is designed based on the AWGN noise. As such, the two stopping criteria ensure the reliable user sparsity level and the robust signal recovery performance.</p><p>Finally, it is noted that the classical SP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> can be regarded as a special case of the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm when the sparsity level is set to the fixed value s max and the quality information parameter s p is 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Robust Prior-Information Aided Adaptive SP Algorithm</head><p>As we have demonstrated in subsection A, the PIA-ASP algorithm has been proposed to effectively exploit the prior support adaptively based on the corresponding support quality information s p . Nevertheless, in practical, the support quality information may be over-estimated, i.e., s p &gt; Γ [t-1] Γ [t]  0 . That is to say, for Γ [t] , only less than s p indices come from Γ [t-1] in fact, while we wrongly consider s p indices are from Γ [t-1] . More specifically, for support pruning (line 5) of Algorithm 1, less than s -s p indices are selected from {1, 2, • • •, K} \Γ [t-1] , due to the fact that there always be s p selected from Γ [t-1] . In such situation, the identification of support Γ [t] is always incorrect. Thus, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm may not work well in this scenario.</p><p>To mitigate the inaccurate estimation effect of s p for Algorithm 1, we shall further propose the robust prior-information aided adaptive SP (R-PIA-ASP) algorithm as presented in Algorithm 2, which can adaptively adjust s p to the over-estimated scenario efficiently. The proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm is developed from the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm (Algorithm 1). Specifically, we should make a redesign for two substeps about the support estimate (line 3) and the support pruning (line 5) of Algorithm 1.</p><p>The proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm exploits the previously estimated user support Γ [t-1] and quality information s p in a conservative way. Specifically, in the support estimate (line 3) of the proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm, the newly added support is consists of two parts, termed Λ a and Λ b . Λ a with size s p -Γ p Γ</p><p>[t](i) 0 is selected from the prior support Γ p , and Λ b with size s is selected from the entire index space {1, 2, • • •, K}. As a matter of fact, Λ b can be regarded as an independent selection from Λ a that can bring in more candidates which may be correct. These designs are all different from the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm, which can allow opportunities to further search for support outside Γ p when the quality information s p is incorrect. Moreover, Γ [t](i) with size s is also selected from the entire index space {1, 2, • • •, K}, for support pruning (line 5). In this way, the proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm can still have a chance to recognize the support, even if s p wrongly indicates the quality of Γ [t-1] .</p><p>To sum up, due to the fact that the processes of support estimate (line 3) and the support pruning (line 5) both select s indices from the entire index space {1, 2, • • •, K}, the proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm gives opportunity to identify more than s -s p indices from {1, 2, • • •, K} \Γ [t-1] , for the initial consideration of this subsection.</p><p>After the two proposed algorithms are given, there are two practical considerations for the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms. To realize accurate signal recovery by exploiting the temporal correlation of the adjacent active user support sets, an accurate estimation of the active user support set in the initial time slot is required, which can be simply realized by increasing the transmit power in the first time slot or using a more reliable recovery algorithm such as basis pursuit denoising <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>The statistical information s p approximately represents the size of Γ [t-1] Γ [t] , which is vital for the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm. The user support set Γ [t] tends to change over time, although, in the mMTC scenario, the changes are gradual. As such, the reliable statistical information s p can be learned by using the tools of stochastic learning and estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, for the second practical consideration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Recovery Distortion Analysis</head><p>In this subsection, we mainly focus on providing theoretical guarantees for the performance of the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms in accurately recovering sparse solutions. In the existing literatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, the restricted isometry property (RIP) is commonly used for recovery distortion analysis of CS recovery algorithms. Nevertheless, the RIP does not serve to handle the time sequence of sparse signals with temporal correlation, where the quality information is also considered. In the following analysis, we attempt to solve this problem. For notational simplicity we omit the time slot superscript t.</p><p>Since the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms are both developed from the classical SP algorithm, we will closely follow the derivation idea taken by Dai and Milenkovic in their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, with some essential modifications for better matching for the two proposed algorithms.</p><p>In CS theory, RIP is used to evaluate the quality of the measurement matrix, in terms of the reliable compression and reconstruction of sparse signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.

To show the advantage of the proposed algorithms, we compare our results with the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP </p><formula xml:id="formula_47">OMP KN + 2K + N i + 2N i 2 + i 3 SP KN + 4K + N smax + 6N s 2 max + 3s 3 max DCS-based KN + 2K + N i + 2N i 2 + i 3 PIA-ASP KN + 6K -2sp + N (sp + j) + 6N (sp + j) 2 + 3(sp + j) 3 R-PIA-ASP KN + 5K</formula><p>+ N (sp + j) + 6N (sp + j) 2 + 3(sp + j) 3</p><p>Note: i and j indicate the iteration index and the update index of sparsity level, respectively.</p><p>[19], <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Moreover, the performance of the oracle LS algorithm, which assumes that the true active user support set are exactly known at the BS, is included as the benchmark performance. The main simulation system parameters are set as follows. The number of potential users is K = 200, and the length of spreading sequence is N = 100, and thus the overloading factor is 200%.</p><p>The spreading matrix is designed as a Toeplitz matrix based on pseudo-random noise. QPSK modulation is considered. The number of the continuous time slots is set to T = 7 according to the LTE-Advanced standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Finally, we set P th to 0.50, 0.48, 0.40, 0.28, 0.26, and 0.21, respectively, at the SNR of 0 dB, 2 dB, 4 dB, 6 dB, 8 dB, 10 dB, which are selected experimentally. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> depicts the SER performance comparison of the considered algorithms on the practical uplink grant-free NOMA scenario. In the simulation, we consider this scenario that the number of the actual active sparsity level can change in T = 7 time slots, i.e., Γ [t]  0 ∼ U (18, 20)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , the consecutive time slots share some common active user set with varying size Γ [t-1] Γ [t]  0 ∼ U (14, 16), and the prior active user support quality parameter s p = 14. From Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, it can be observed that the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm significantly outperforms the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> in terms of SER over the whole range of SNRs, which is achieved by adaptively acquiring the user sparsity level and exploiting the prior active user support set based on its quality parameter s p . Moreover, the proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm has a smaller SER performance gain compared to the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm. The reason behind this is that, the proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm adaptively exploits the prior active user support set and quality parameter s p in a conservative way. Although the oracle LS algorithm outperforms the two proposed algorithms, the performance gap diminishes as SNR increases, because a higher SNR will lead to more accurate estimation of the active user support set, and therefore achieve a better SER performance.</p><p>Next, the computational complexity ratio comparison of the considered algorithms with the aforementioned simulation conditions is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. In order to acquire a fair condition, OMP is treated as a comparative benchmark. The computational complexity ratio is the ratio of the complexity for the considered algorithms to that of the conventional OMP algorithm. We see that the DCS-based algorithm is the most computationally efficient algorithm, whereas the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms have a slightly higher computational complexity than the other three methods. The reason is that, in our proposed algorithms, the user sparsity level is adaptively obtained, which incurs extra overhead that requires additional complexity. This adaptive operation leads to having the ability that adaptively acquires the user sparsity level, but meanwhile resulting in an increased computational complexity.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref> provides the SER performance comparison of the considered algorithms on the ideal uplink grant-free NOMA scenario. In the simulation, we consider this scenario that the actual user sparsity level and the size of the common active user support set within the consecutive time slots are given by Γ [t]  0 ∼ U (18, 20) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">Γ [t-1] Γ [t] 0 ∼ U (14, 16</formula><p>), respectively. In addition, the sparsity level of user activity is  assumed to be exactly known in the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and the prior active user support quality can be perfectly known for the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>, the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> with the perfectly known priori information (actual user sparsity level) can obtain some SER performance gain compared to that without considering such priori information. Despite all these advantages, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm still outperforms its counterparts dramatically. Specifically, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm can achieve about 2 dB SNR gains over the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> when SER is 1 × 10 -4 . This is because the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm adaptively exploits the temporal correlation of the active users support set within several continuous time slots based on its correct quality parameter s p . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref> illustrates the effect of the user sparsity level (the number of active users) on the SER performance of the considered algorithms under SNR = 8 dB, where we consider  the actual user sparsity level for each time slot and the actual size of the common active user support set within the consecutive time slots are fixed to be s and 0.8s, respectively, i.e., Γ [t]  0 = s and Γ [t-1] Γ [t] 0 = 0.8s. In addition, the user sparsity level is assumed to be exactly known in the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and the prior active user support quality can be perfectly known for the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms. We can find that with the increase of the user sparsity level, the SER performance for different detection algorithms will be degraded. However, in all region, the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms show lower SER than their counterparts. There is a known four-to-one practical rule which says that for exact recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This implies that a number of measurements just about 4× the sparsity level suffices. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>, it can be observed that the SER of the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm will not exceed 1 × 10 -3 even though the user sparsity level reaches 25, which approaches s = N 4 = 25 when N = 100, the maximum sparsity level for a sparse signal to reliably recover. addition, it is also shown that the SER of the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms will not exceed 1×10 -3 even though the user sparsity level reaches 20, i.e., the activity factor is 10%. Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> reveal that the number of active users does not exceed 10% of the total number of potential users even in a busy hour. Therefore, the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms can be used in practical scenarios of massive connectivity for 5G with high detection reliability. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> depicts the effect of the user sparsity level mismatch on the SER performance for the considered algorithms under SNR = 8 dB, where we consider the actual user sparsity level for each time slot and the actual size of the common active user support set within the consecutive time slots are fixed to be 19 and 15, respectively, i.e., Γ [t]  0 = 19 and Γ [t-1] Γ [t]  0 = 15. In addition, s p = 14. Clearly, the SER performance of the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCS-based algorithm SER performance comparison versus the prior support quality parameter sp.</p><p>[29] degrade severely due to the believed user sparsity level s mismatch. Moreover, a larger SER performance degradation is observed with a larger deviation from the actual user sparsity level. The reason behind these is that, the conventional CSbased algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCSbased algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> urgently require the user sparsity level as the priori information for reliable multi-user detection. In contrast, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm removes this unrealistic requirement, which can adaptively acquire the user sparsity level. Hence, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm can work better than its counterparts.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> investigates the SER performance comparison against the prior active user support quality parameter s p . In the simulation, SNR is set as 8 dB, and the user sparsity level for each time slot varies from 18 to 20. Noted that the consecutive time slots share the common active user set with varying size Γ [t-1] Γ [t]  0 ∼ U (s p , s p + 2) for the uplink grant-free NOMA systems. For Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, we observe that the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) perform poorly in terms of the SER performance, which do not take the inherent temporal correlation of user sets within several continuous time slots into consideration at all. Additionally, the SER performance of the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> (in this case, the sparsity level of user activity is assumed to be exactly known) is also relatively poor. This is because the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> only blindly exploits the previously estimated active user support set, which does not take the quality of the previously estimated user support set into consideration. Finally, from Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, it can be observed that, the larger prior active user support quality parameter s p , the better SER performance, for the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms. This is due to that the two proposed algorithms both can adaptively exploit more part of the prior user support set to improve the SER performance.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> provides the SER performance comparison versus the incorrect prior user support quality parameter s p , i.e., s p &gt; Γ [t-1] Γ [t]  0 . In the simulation, SNR is set as 8 dB, and the user sparsity level for each time slot ranges from 0733-8716 (c) 2017 IEEE.

Moreover, for the consecutive time slots, the actual size of the common user support set is fixed to be 10, i.e., Γ [t-1] Γ [t] 0 = 10. Assuming that the user sparsity level is known for the conventional CS-based algorithms (OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) and the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. As expected, the detection algorithms that exploit the previous estimated user support set show SER performance degradation when parameter mismatch occurs. The proposed PIA-ASP algorithm is highly vulnerable to the mismatch. In other words, the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm does not work well when the prior user support quality parameter s p is over-estimated, especially at high s p . Specifically, for s p &gt; 10, the SER performance of the proposed PIA-ASP algorithm gets worse when s p increases. Nevertheless, the proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm still have some SER performance gains, whose degradation is marginal. This is due to our robust design of the proposed R-PIA-ASP algorithm for the over-estimated scenario.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> shows the SER performance effect comparison against the number of estimation errors in the initial time slot. In the simulation, the user sparsity level for each time slot, the actual size of the common user support set within the consecutive time slots, and SNR are fixed to be 20, 15, and 10 dB, respectively, i. e., Γ [t] 0 = 20, Γ [t-1] Γ [t] 0 = 15, and SNR = 10 dB. In addition, the user sparsity level is assumed to be exactly known in the DCS-based algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and the prior active user support quality can be perfectly known for the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms. In this simulation, the active user support in the initial time slot is actually given in advance. Specifically, for given E estimation errors in the initial time slot, E indices are randomly selected from the actual inactive user support in the initial time slot, and 20 -E indices randomly come from the actual active user support in the initial time slot. From this figure, we observe that the detection algorithms that exploit the previous estimated user support set show SER performance degradation when estimation error in the initial time slot occurs. To be specific, the DCS-based algorithm is highly sensitive to estimation error, while the SER performance impact for the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms is limited. Furthermore, for the proposed PIA-ASP and R-PIA-ASP algorithms, an accurate estimation of the active user set in the initial time slot can simply be realized by increasing the transmit power in the first time slot or using more reliable recovery algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The corresponding simulation results have been verified in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, by adaptively exploiting the prior user support based on the corresponding quality information, we have proposed the PIA-ASP algorithm for uplink grant-free NOMA systems in several continuous time slots. Moreover, to withstand possible incorrect prior user support quality information, the R-PIA-ASP algorithm has been further proposed, which adaptively exploits Γ [t-1] based on s p in a conservative way. It is noteworthy that the two proposed algorithms do not require the sparsity level of user activity. Additionally, the recovery distortion analysis as well as the computational complexity analysis of the two proposed algorithms are also provided. Simulation results have shown that the two proposed algorithms can achieve better SER performance over the conventional CS-based multi-user detection algorithms in grantfree NOMA systems. In future, our research will be devoted to developing some efficient algorithms for grant-free NOMA systems with multiple antennas. APPENDIX A.
