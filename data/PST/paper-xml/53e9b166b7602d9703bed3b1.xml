<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A recently developed nonlocal vector calculus is exploited to provide a variational analysis for a general class of nonlocal diffusion problems described by a linear integral equation on bounded domains in R n . The nonlocal vector calculus also enables striking analogies to be drawn between the nonlocal model and classical models for diffusion, including a notion of nonlocal flux. The ubiquity of the nonlocal operator in applications is illustrated by a number of examples ranging from continuum mechanics to graph theory. In particular, it is shown that fractional Laplacian and fractional derivative models for anomalous diffusion are special cases of the nonlocal model for diffusion that we consider. The numerous applications elucidate different interpretations of the operator and the associated governing equations. For example, a probabilistic perspective explains that the nonlocal spatial operator appearing in our model corresponds to the infinitesimal generator for a symmetric jump process. Sufficient conditions on the kernel of the nonlocal operator and the notion of volume constraints are shown to lead to a well-posed problem. Volume constraints are a proxy for boundary conditions that may not be defined for a given kernel. In particular, we demonstrate for a general class of kernels that the nonlocal operator is a mapping between a volume constrained subspace of a fractional Sobolev subspace and its dual. We also demonstrate for other particular kernels that the inverse of the operator does not smooth but does correspond to diffusion. The impact of our results is that both a continuum analysis and a numerical method for the modeling of anomalous diffusion on bounded domains in R n are provided. The analytical framework allows us to consider finite-dimensional approximations using discontinuous and continuous Galerkin methods, both of which are conforming for the nonlocal diffusion equation we consider; error and condition number estimates are derived.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction.</head><p>It is well understood that Fick's first law, which is a constitutive relation for diffusive fluxes, is a questionable model for numerous phenomena; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45]</ref> for discussions and numerous citations to the literature. Equivalently, whenever the associated underlying stochastic process is not given by Brownian motion, the diffusion is deemed anomalous. In particular, anomalous superdiffusion refers to situations that can be, at times, modeled using fractional spatial derivatives or fractional spatial differential operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. In this paper, we consider an integrodifferential equation model for anomalous superdiffusion that, among other desirable features, has the fractional Laplacian and fractional derivative models as special cases. To distinguish our model from existing models for superdiffusion and to highlight that it applies to a wider range of phenomena, we refer to our model as a nonlocal model for diffusion.</p><p>Let Ω ⊂ R n denote a bounded, open domain. For u(x): Ω → R, define the action of the linear operator L on the function u(x) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1.1) Lu(x) := 2 Ω u(y) -u(x) γ(x, y) dy ∀ x ∈ Ω ⊆ R n ,</formula><p>where the volume of Ω is nonzero and the kernel γ(x, y): Ω × Ω → R denotes a nonnegative symmetric mapping, i.e., γ(x, y) = γ(y, x) ≥ 0. The operator L is deemed nonlocal because the value of Lu at a point x requires information about u at points y = x; this should be contrasted with local operators, e.g., the value of Δu at a point x requires information about u only at x. We have that Lu is the spatial contribution in nonlocal diffusion equations (see <ref type="bibr">(1.2a</ref>), section 3.3, and also, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) and nonlocal wave equations (see section B.2). Section 5.3 briefly discusses nonlocal advection-diffusion problems.</p><p>For specific choices of the kernel γ and under an appropriate rescaling, the operator L is a generalization of the classical Laplacian operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51]</ref> or, more generally, the operator ∇•(C•∇), where C denotes a second-order tensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. In section 3.2, using a recently developed nonlocal vector calculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, the operator L is recast as the composition of nonlocal divergence and gradient operators in analogy to the composition ∇ • (C • ∇) for second-order elliptic operators.</p><p>The operator L and its generalizations arise in many applications such as image analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40]</ref>, machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>, nonlocal Dirichlet forms <ref type="bibr">[5, sec. 3.6]</ref>, kinetic equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39]</ref>, phase transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, nonlocal heat conduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and the peridynamic model for mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> and its one-dimensional variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50]</ref> for which L arises directly. We briefly discuss some of the above applications and related mathematical work in Appendix B. Moreover, in Appendix A, we discuss the close connections between our model and existing models for anomalous superdiffusion; in particular, we show that the fractional Laplacian operator and a fractional derivative operator are special cases of the operator L.</p><p>Our interest in the operator L is due to its participation in the time-dependent nonlocal volume-constrained diffusion problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(1.2a) ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ u t -Lu = b on Ω, t &gt; 0, u(x, 0) = u 0 on Ω ∪ Ω I , Vu = g on Ω I , t &gt; 0,</formula><p>for the function u(x, t) and its steady-state counterpart <ref type="bibr">(1.2b</ref>) -Lu = b on Ω, Vu = g on Ω I , Downloaded 05/17/13 to 130.194. <ref type="bibr">20.173</ref>. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php where V denotes a linear operator of constraints acting on a volume Ω I that is disjoint from Ω. Volume constraints are natural extensions, to the nonlocal case, of boundary conditions for differential equation problems. For example, if V is the identity operator, the last equation in <ref type="bibr">(1.2a)</ref> or <ref type="bibr">(1.2b</ref>) is a nonlocal "Dirichlet" volume constraint. Nonlocal versions of Neumann and Robin boundary conditions are also naturally defined; see section 4.1.</p><p>The nonlocal vector calculus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> makes transparent the analogies we draw between the nonlocal problems (1.2a) and <ref type="bibr">(1.2b</ref>) and parabolic and elliptic boundaryvalue problems, respectively, involving second-order scalar elliptic operators. For example, we will draw several analogies between (1.2a) and the classical diffusion problem (1.3a)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ u t -∇ • (C • ∇u) = b on Ω, u(x, 0) = u 0 on Ω, Bu = g on ∂Ω,</formula><p>as well as between (1.2b) and the (generalized) Poisson problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(1.3b) -∇ • (C • ∇u) = b on Ω, Bu = g on ∂Ω,</formula><p>where C : R n → R n×n denotes a second-order tensor and B denotes a linear operator acting on the boundary ∂Ω of the volume Ω. At first glance, the differences between the volume-constrained problems (1.2a) and <ref type="bibr">(1.2b</ref>) and the boundary-value problems <ref type="bibr">(1.3a</ref>) and (1.3b), respectively, are obvious. First, the former pair involves the integral operator L, whereas the latter pair involves a second-order spatial differential operator. Second, in <ref type="bibr">(1.2a</ref>) and (1.2b), constraints are imposed on the solution over a nonzero volume Ω I that is not necessarily located near or at the boundary of Ω; on the other hand, in <ref type="bibr">(1.3a</ref>) and (1.3b), constraints are imposed precisely at the bounding surface ∂Ω. These distinctions are essential in characterizing the differences in the properties of, e.g., problems <ref type="bibr">(1.2b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(1.3b</ref>) and their solutions. In section 1.1, we discuss why volume constraints are not only useful, but also necessary to treat certain classes of nonlocal problems having the form (1.2a) or <ref type="bibr">(1.2b)</ref>.</p><p>Section 2 reviews classical diffusion problems and, in particular, the notions of a local flux, local balance laws, local diffusion problems, and the well-posedness of steady-state local diffusion problems. This discussion serves to set up sections 3 and 4, in which analogous notions for nonlocal volume-constrained problems are considered. In section 3.1, the notion of a nonlocal flux is discussed. That discussion is crucial to section 3.3, in which nonlocal balance laws are posed from which nonlocal diffusion problems of the type (1.2a) are derived; the latter derivation depends on results from the nonlocal vector calculus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> that is briefly reviewed in section 3.2. The material in sections 2 and 3 renders transparent the correspondences between local and nonlocal diffusion problems, with a central correspondence between the boundary-constraint operator B in the local case and the volume-constraint operator V in the nonlocal case.</p><p>Section 4 contains the primary contribution of our paper; there, the well-posedness of steady-state volume-constrained diffusion problems of the type (1.2b) is demonstrated by exploiting the nonlocal vector calculus reviewed in section 3.2. The notion of volume-constrained problems enables us to formulate and solve diffusion problems in situations where boundary conditions are not well defined, e.g., diffusive regimes Downloaded 05/17/13 to 130.194.20.173. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php where the Fourier symbol of the self-adjoint diffusive operator is of nonnegative order less than or equal to 1/2. Such diffusion problems, e.g., the volume-constrained problem (1.2b), allow discontinuous functions as solutions, given appropriate conditions on the kernel γ. Also, because the fractional Laplacian operator and fractional derivative operators are special cases of the operator L (see section A), the well-posedness of volume-constrained problems on bounded domains in R n posed in terms of these operators also readily follows, a previously unavailable result.</p><p>In section 5, the well-posedness of nonlocal evolution problems such as (1.2a) and a nonlocal wave equation are briefly discussed and a nonlocal model for advectiondiffusion problems involving the operator L is presented. Also, a brief discussion of vanishing nonlocality is given that demonstrates that, in the limit when the support of the kernel γ decreases, the classical local diffusive operator is recovered. Another contribution of our paper is the analyses of the convergence and of error and condition number estimates for finite-dimensional discretizations of nonlocal volume-constrained problems; these analyses are given in section 6, where the focus is on finite element methods. The finite element methods considered are conforming and, for appropriate kernels γ, allow for the use of piecewise polynomials that are not required to be continuous across element faces, e.g., discontinuous Galerkin methods are conforming in those cases. This is in stark contrast to discontinuous Galerkin methods for the discretization of, e.g., <ref type="bibr">(1.3b)</ref>, for which they are nonconforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>An inspiration for this paper is to extend results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51]</ref> and [4, Chaps. 1-3] to the volume-constrained problem (1.2b) on bounded domains. The well-posedness results derived in this paper extend the result established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> on a bounded domain for a class of kernels γ and volume-constraint operators that lead to an operator L whose inversion does not regularize the data. This latter result was extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to another class of volume constraints. In [4, Chap. 1] the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the nonlocal diffusion equation (1.2a) is considered, whereas [4, Chaps. 2-3] consider a special choice of volume constraints for the case of γ a radial function, i.e., γ(x, y) = γ(y -x), with γ(0) &gt; 0 and R n γ(z) dz = 1. Such conditions on γ imply that L is a mapping from L 2 (R n ) to L 2 (R n ); conditions such that inversions of L smooth the data are not considered.</p><p>1.1. The Need for Volume Constraints. Consideration of the need for imposing volume constraints for problems involving the nonlocal operator L requires us to discuss in more detail and with greater precision the differences between problems involving L and those involving second-order elliptic partial differential operators. First, we recall that if u = 0 on ∂Ω, i.e., if in (1.3b) g = 0 and B is the identity operator, and if appropriate conditions on Ω and C are assumed, then, given data b ∈ H -1 (Ω), a weak formulation of the boundary-value problem (1.3b) is well posed in H 1 0 (Ω), i.e., there exists a unique solution u ∈ H 1 0 (Ω) and, moreover, that solution depends continuously on the data b. Alternatively, we have that ∇</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">• (C • ∇) is a bounded operator from H 1 0 (Ω) → H -1</formula><p>(Ω) having a bounded inverse. In contrast, if g = 0 and V is the identity operator in (1.2b), i.e., if u = 0 on Ω I , then, for appropriate choices for the kernel γ, we demonstrate, in section 4, that a variational formulation of the volume-constrained problem (1.2b) is well posed in the space H s c (Ω ∪ Ω I ) for 0 &lt; s &lt; 1, provided the given data b belongs to the dual space of H s c (Ω ∪ Ω I ), where H s c (Ω ∪ Ω I ) is the subspace of the fractional Sobolev space H s (Ω ∪ Ω I ) constrained to satisfy the volume constraint u = 0 on Ω I . We even demonstrate, for a particular class of kernels γ, that the variational formulation is well posed in L </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 c (Ω ∪ Ω I ) → L 2 c (Ω ∪ Ω I )</formula><p>, as the kernel warrants, and that L has a bounded inverse. In particular, the solution operator for (1.2b) regularizes, i.e., smooths, the data b to a lesser extent compared to the solution operator for (1.3b) and, under appropriate conditions on γ, the solution is no smoother than the data. The latter occurs, for example, when L is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.</p><p>The fact that weak formulations of the volume-constrained problem (1.2b) are well posed in subspaces of H s (Ω ∪ Ω I ) for s ∈ [0, 1/2] deserves further comment. First, why is treating such a case important? The answer is that it is precisely these spaces that contain functions with jump discontinuities. Thus, if one wants to admit solutions that have jump discontinuities, one has to work with spaces such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">H s (Ω ∪ Ω I ) for s ∈ [0, 1/2].</formula><p>We next ask whether we could instead impose a surface constraint, e.g., consider the problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">-Lu = b on Ω, u = 0 on ∂Ω.</formula><p>We have that, for appropriate kernels, Lu is well defined for u ∈ H s (Ω ∪ Ω I ) for s ∈ [0, 1). However, the restriction of a function u ∈ H s (Ω ∪ Ω I ) onto ∂(Ω ∪ Ω I ) is not defined for s ∈ [0, 1/2], i.e., the trace of such a u is not defined. This means that if s ∈ [0, 1/2], we cannot impose constraints on u restricted to ∂(Ω ∪ Ω I ). However, a volume constraint for which the operator V is the restriction operator onto Ω I is well defined for all s ∈ [0, 1) and beyond. Thus, we conclude that for nonlocal operator equations posed on bounded domains, the application of volume constraints is necessary for operators that are bounded acting on H s (Ω ∪ Ω I ) functions with s ∈ [0, 1/2].</p><p>For example, the well-posedness of (1.3b) when ∇ • ∇ is replaced by Δ 2s (the fractional Laplacian) is not discussed whenever s ∈ [0, 1/2] because of the lack of welldefined traces of functions belonging to H s (Ω). More generally, the well-posedness of and tractable numerical methods for pseudodifferential or fractional self-adjoint differential operators on bounded domains when the degree of the (Fourier) symbol lies in s ∈ (0, 1/2] are not available. In contrast, the volume-constrained, nonlocal problem (1.2b) is, for appropriate kernels γ, well posed for s ∈ [0, 1), and finite element discretizations are easily defined from the variational characterizations possible for such problems. Thus, we see that in such cases, volume constraints are expedient. As further examples, we note that the use of volume constraints for equations involving the operator L immediately removes the limitation encountered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> to only consider a fractional dispersion equation and kernels γ, respectively, where the solutions are in H s 0 (Ω) for s ∈ (1/2, 1), and to present a numerical method for the solution of the fractional Laplacian operator equations on bounded domains in lieu of the random walk approximation used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>.</p></div>

The flux, then, conveys a notion of direction out of and into a region and is a proxy for the interaction between Ω 1 and Ω 2 . It is important to note that the flux from Ω 1 into Ω 2 occurs across their common boundary and that if the two disjoint regions have no common boundary, then the flux from one to the other is zero. The classical flux (2.1) is then deemed to be local because there is no interaction between Ω 1 and Ω 2 when separated by a finite distance.

Recall that, in sections 2.2 and 2.3, elements of classical vector calculus for differential operators were invoked; analogously, in sections 3.3 and 4, elements of a vector calculus for nonlocal operators are invoked. Thus, the nonlocal vector calculus, which is a generalization of classical vector calculus to nonlocal operators, enables us to study nonlocal diffusion problems in a manner analogous to how classical diffusion is studied. Because the nonlocal calculus may not be familiar to the reader, we provide in section 3.2 a brief review of the nonlocal vector calculus developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>The clarity achieved through the use of the nonlocal vector calculus to enable a development of nonlocal diffusion that mimics in every way that of local diffusion benefits both mathematical analyses and physical interpretations, as is demonstrated in the remainder of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Nonlocal Fluxes.</head><p>The key to understanding (1.2a) as a model for nonlocal diffusion is the identification of a nonlocal flux. This enables us to state a nonlocal balance law that postulates that the rate of change of an extensive quantity over some region is equal to the production of that quantity in that region minus the flux of the same quantity out of that region. Here, we review the discussion about nonlocal fluxes given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, where a detailed discussion is provided. In the discussion, ψ(x, y) may be a scalar or vector or tensor function.

In other words, (3.2c) states that the flux (or interaction) from Ω 1 into Ω 2 is equal and opposite to the flux (or interaction) from Ω 2 into Ω 1 . The flux is nonlocal because, by (3.2c), the interaction may be nonzero even when the closures of Ω 1 and Ω 2 have an empty intersection. This is in stark contrast to local interactions for which we have seen that the interaction between Ω 1 and Ω 2 vanishes if their closures have empty intersection, i.e., if they have no common boundary.</p></div>

This is an important point, particularly for s ≤ 1/2.

Relations between the Operator L and Fractional Laplacian and Fractional Derivative Operators. In this section, we discuss two approaches for the modeling of anomalous superdiffusion that replace ∇ • ∇u with the fractional Laplacian or a fractional derivative operator. In section 3.1, we explained how, compared to problems involving fractional Laplacian or fractional derivative operators, a nonlocal volume-constrained problem leads to the expedient modeling of a broader range of anomalous diffusions over general domains in R n . In particular, here we demonstrate that both the fractional Laplacian and fractional derivative operators are special cases of the integral operator L. Moreover, the notion of volume constraints and the nonlocal vector calculus has enabled us to discuss well-posedness over bounded domains in R n for a more general class of diffusion problems.</p><p>A.1.

The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref> describe M as a mixing measure, because the integral involves directional derivatives over all radial directions on the unit sphere; the authors also explain that the solutions to (A.3) yield every possible multivariable Levy motion of index 2s, s = 1. The operator ∇ 2s M is a generalization of the fractional Laplacian; the latter operator is recovered when the measure M (dθ) is the uniform measure over the unit sphere.

This limitation is apparent when developing numerical methods for fractional partial differential equations; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref> for recent work including many citations to the literature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, an impressive attempt is made to improve numerical methods for fractional partial differential equations; an equivalent reformulation of the fractional dispersion equation (A.3) on bounded domains in R n , including a systematic numerical method, is considered. A fractional derivative function space is defined and demonstrated to be equivalent to the fractional Sobolev space H s (Ω) for s &gt; 0, excluding integer multiples of 1/2. However, instead of applying the volumeconstraint operator V of (1.2b), homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are used and thus the well-posedness over H s 0 (Ω) for only 1/2 &lt; s &lt; 1 can be considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Hence, a restricted notion of steady-state diffusion is addressed; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">Thm. 6.1]</ref>. In contrast, the volume-constrained problem (1.2b) is a well-posed reformulation of fractional derivative operator equations on bounded domains for 0 &lt; s &lt; 1. Furthermore, the development of finite element methods follows naturally from the weak formulation (4.4) of such volume-constrained problems. </p><formula xml:id="formula_99">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ u tt + D Θ • D * u = 0 ∀ x ∈ Ω , t &gt; 0, Vu = 0 ∀ x ∈ Ω I , t &gt; 0, u(x, 0) = u 0 (x) ∀ x ∈ Ω, u t (x, 0) = u 1 (x) ∀ x ∈ Ω,</formula><p>which can be viewed as a special case of the time-dependent peridynamic model. The one-dimensional free-space problem for the nonlocal wave equation was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. Define the energy  <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>, a precise notion of the limit of a sequence of dense finite graphs<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> is introduced. The limit is a symmetric measurable function W : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → [0, 1] and represents the continuum analogue of an adjacency matrix for a simple unweighted graph. When γ = W and Ω = (0, 1), the operator L represents the continuum analogue of the graph Laplacian for a simple unweighted graph. This allows consideration of many properties of a graph associated with its Laplacian matrix to be independent of the size of the graph or its connectivity. This includes a continuum analogue of diffusion on a graph, where Ω then corresponds to diffusion occurring on the limit of a sequence of dense finite graphs. See, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap. 8]</ref> for an introduction to "Dirichlet" and "Neumann" boundary conditions for a graph Laplacian.</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">E(t</formula><p>We note that a discrete calculus has precedence in the graph theory and machine learning literature; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[26, sec. 3</ref>] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37]</ref> for some recent work and citations to the literature.

Symmetric Jump Processes.</head><p>The operator L is the infinitesimal generator for a symmetric jump process <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">9</ref> and has been the subject of much recent interest. For instance, Harnack inequalities, heat kernel estimates, and Hölder continuity for L are the subjects of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>; the Dirichlet fractional Laplacian and Cauchy martingale problems for L are studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, respectively. The stochastic interpretation associated with volume constraints is that the sample path for a symmetric jump process exhibits discontinuous behavior and so "jumps" to a point in the exterior of a bounded domain; this exterior region, or volume, constrains the sample path. For example, a statistic of interest is the time for a process to exit a domain; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> for further discussion.
