This representation tells us in particular that the solutions of (which turn out to be polynomials) depend on three arbitrary constants and permits us to compute Taylor expansions of these solutions. If we expand them in the neighborhood of the origin then the arbitrary constants are u(0, 0), v(0, 0) and v x (0, 0). For u(0, 0) = 5, v(0, 0) = 421 and v x (0, 0) = π our algorithm gives us (computations are detailed in Sect. 8)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u(x, y) = 5 + x √ 10 √ 2 + y √ 10 + x 2 + x y √ 2 + 1 2 y 2 , v(x, y) = 421 + x π + 2 y √ 2 + 1 2 x 2 √ 10 √ 2 + x y √<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">+ 1 4 y 2 √ 10 √ 2 + 1 3 x 3 + 1 2 x 2 y √ 2 + 1 2 x y 2 + 1 12 y 3 √ 2.</formula><p>The applied mathematical theory is called differential algebra. It was initiated mostly by French and American researchers at the early twentieth century <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> and really developed by the American teams of Ritt <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and Kolchin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Differential algebra aims at studying differential equations from a purely algebraic point of view. It is much closer to ordinary commutative algebra than to analysis. The Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm represents the radical of the differential ideal generated by any finite system of polynomial differential equations as a finite intersection of differential ideals r's (that we call regular).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p = [ ] = r 1 ∩ • • • ∩ r n .</formula><p>Each regular differential ideal r i is presented by a set of differential polynomial equations C i which satisfies:</p><p>1. C i is a canonical representative of r i , 2. C i reduces to zero a differential polynomial p if and only if p ∈ r i .</p><p>Therefore, the set of the C's constitutes a normal simplifier for the equivalence relation modulo p (i.e. an algorithm which decides membership in p). The simplifier is not canonical for the representation may contain redundant components: every differential prime ideal which is minimal over p is minimal over at least one of the regular differential ideals produced but the converse is not true. Assume the solutions of p depend on finitely many arbitrary constants. The algorithm separates the solutions which do not depend on the same number of arbitrary constants. In our introductory example, only one regular differential ideal was produced. This proves that all the solutions of p depend on three arbitrary constants. An implementation of this algorithm was realized for the MAPLE computer algebra software. It is embedded in a package named diffalg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.1">Used theorems</head><p>The Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm relies mainly on three theorems:</p><p>1. a theorem of zeros (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz), which states that a polynomial p belongs to the radical of an ideal presented by a basis if and only if every solution of is a solution of p; we apply this theorem in the algebraic and in the differential case, 2. a lemma of Rosenfeld, which gives a sufficient condition so that a system of polynomial differential equations admits a solution if and only if this same system, considered as a purely algebraic system admits a solution, 3. a lemma of Lazard, which establishes that each regular ideal r is radical and that all its prime components have a same parametric set (this property is stronger than "defining an unmixed algebraic variety").</p><p>It utilizes only the operations and the equality test with zero in the base field of the equations: we refer to Ritt's reduction algorithms, computations of Gröbner bases and splittings similar to those in the elimination methods of Seidenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In particular, it does not need any factorization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.2">New results</head><p>The Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm was first described by Boulier <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and improved by Boulier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This paper contains new results. We give in Sect. 2 a proof of Lazard's Lemma which is more precise than the one we gave in Boulier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 2,</ref><ref type="bibr">page 161</ref>]. We give an original presentation of the fundamental Rosenfeld's Lemma. We present it as a property of some class of systems of polynomial differential equations and inequations instead of a property of some class of sets of differential polynomials. We give a version of Rosenfeld's Lemma more general than the one of Rosenfeld (this was already proved by Boulier <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) and not contained in Kolchin's version. Briefly, our version only imposes to the ideals to be saturated by the separants of the differential polynomials (and no more by the initials). It also only imposes to the set of equations to be triangular instead of autoreduced (but this is anecdotic). Since Lazard's Lemma also holds in such a situation, we formulate our theorems without considering the initials of differential polynomials (though we do it in our implementation for efficiency reasons). This is an improvement w.r.t. Kolchin's theory. We prove new results for regular ideals: Theorems 4 and 6. The former permits to compute the minimal differential prime components of regular ideals and provides also informations about these prime ideals without having to compute them; the latter gives us an original presentation of a well known proof about formal power series. The algorithm presented is much more efficient than the one of 1995. It applies for polynomial differential equations an analog of the second criterion proved by Buchberger <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for Gröbner bases. Our implementation of this criterion was designed after the method of Gebauer and Möller <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.3">Comparison with other methods</head><p>There is a strong relationship between our algorithm and Seidenberg's work.</p><p>Seidenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> designed elimination algorithms for systems of ODE and PDE in characteristic zero and non-zero. His PDE elimination algorithm in characteristic zero actually solves the same problem we are solving: deciding membership in the radical of a finitely generated differential ideal. He proved (Theorem 6, page 51) an analog of Rosenfeld's Lemma which is a bit weaker (restriction to orderly rankings on the derivatives of a single differential indeterminate) and more technical (note Rosenfeld <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> presents his Lemma as a new version of Seidenberg's Theorem). In his Theorem 11, page 59 he shows that, if is a system which satisfies the hypotheses of his Theorem 6 then every algebraic solution of furnishes a unique differential solution. He showed later <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> how differential solutions can be converted as formal power series. There are differences between Seidenberg's algorithm and ours. The most important is the following: the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm computes a representation of radical differential ideals which can be used afterwards for testing membership in the ideal many times afterwards while Seidenberg's decides if a differential polynomial p belongs to the radical of the differential ideal generated by a finite family by eliminating successively all the differential indeterminates which occur in the system = 0, p = 0 in order to test if this system admits solutions (Hilbert's theorem of zeros). The answer of his algorithm is a boolean. Another important difference: Seidenberg's elimination algorithms are restricted to elimination rankings between differential indeterminates which induce very explosive computations, while orderly rankings are handled by the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm (this is the case for instance in our introductory example). Ritt <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> gave a method to decompose the radical of an ordinary differential ideal as an intersection of prime differential ideals, providing a characteristic set for each of these ideals. This decomposition is not the minimal one because of the redundancy problem (still open). That algorithm is inconvenient because it is only partially effective: it proceeds by factorization over a tower of algebraic field extensions of the field of coefficients. To our knowledge, it has not been implemented. It only applies for ODE. Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> designed a variant of Ritt's algorithm for ordinary differential equations, with a notion of characteristic set weaker than Ritt's (e.g. a characteristic set in the sense of Wu may have no solution). Other authors (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>) developed later Wu's and Seidenberg's ideas. These algorithms only apply for ODE. Ollivier <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Carra-Ferro <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have independently tried to generalize Gröbner bases to systems of ordinary polynomial differential equations. These differential Gröbner bases are in general infinite, even for ODE systems. Another definition of differential Gröbner bases was attempted by Mansfield <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The algorithm DIFFGBASIS, implemented in MAPLE, utilizes Ritt's algorithm of reduction and then always terminates. It handles PDE systems. In general however, it cannot guarantee its output to be a differential Gröbner basis. Note that the membership problem in an arbitrary differential ideal is undecidable <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and the membership problem of a finitely generated differential ideal is still open. Boulier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Maârouf <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> designed recently a variant of the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm. They started from the algorithm of Kalkbrener <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> which compute decompositions of radicals of ideals in non-differential polynomial algebras. They describe a method for computing characteristic sets of prime differential ideals different from our methods given in Ollivier <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Boulier <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Boulier et al. [4, section 5, page 164]. Reid et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> developed algorithms for studying systems of PDE and computing Taylor expansions of their solutions. These methods are based more on differential geometry than on algebra. They do not claim to be as general as the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.4">Organization of the paper</head><p>Sections 1 and 2 deal with commutative algebra. The former contains preliminaries; in the latter, we prove Lazard's Lemma and show how some computations can be performed in dimension zero. Section 3 contains differential algebra preliminaries. In Sect. 4 we prove our version of Rosenfeld's Lemma and some technical results which will be used for efficiently testing the coherence hypothesis of this lemma (in particular, we show there our analog of Buchberger's second criterion). Section 5 shows how to represents radical differential ideals as intersections of regular differential ideals. This is the core of the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm. In the next section, we show how to compute canonical representatives for regular differential ideals and we state the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm as a theorem (Theorem 9) with an effective proof. The algorithm is obtained by translating the proof in any programming language. In Sect. 7 we explain how algebraic solutions of regular differential ideals can be expanded as formal power series. A few examples are developed in the last section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Lazard's Lemma</head><p>Lazard's Lemma (Theorem 1) is a result of commutative algebra, interesting in itself. It was first published in Boulier et al. [4, Lemma 2, page 161] with a proof relying on basic arguments. During the Special Year in Differential Algebra and Algebraic Geometry organized in 1995 at the City College of New York by Prof. Hoobler and Sit, a weakness in the proof was pointed out:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> there was a claim which was true but not proved. Morrison <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> proved then a generalized version of the lemma which is presented in Morrison <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Another proof was written later by Schicho and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The one we give here only relies on elementary commutative algebra <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap. IV]</ref>. In this sense, it is simpler than the other ones. The knowledge of Morrison's proof helped us to fix ours.

If R 0 ⊂ R 1 are two differential rings and S ⊂ R 1 then R 0 {S} denotes the smallest differential ring containing R 0 and S, i.e. R 0 [ S]. We deal with a differential polynomial ring R = K {u 1 , . . . , u n } where K is a differential field of characteristic zero.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.1">Avoiding splittings</head><p>As stated in Sect. 5.3, if a differential polynomial h does not divide zero modulo p = [P 0 ] : S ∞ 0 then there is nod need of splitting on h. Here is a way to apply this idea: before computing a decomposition of p w.r.t. to some desired ranking R first compute a decomposition of p w.r.t. another ranking R chosen heuristically so that the representation involves only few components. Afterwards, use it while computing the decomposition of p w.r.t. R: each time the algorithm is about to split computations between (say) h = 0 and h = 0, test whether h is a divisor of zero modulo p. If h is proved not to be a divisor of zero, the splitting can be avoided and the branch h = 0 discarded. The differential polynomial h ∈ p if and only if the branch h = 0 only leads to inconsistent regular differential systems. Such branches can therefore always be detected and discarded. If h is proved to be a divisor of zero or if nothing can be proved then the splitting must be generated. The method above is particularly interesting when p can be represented by a unique regular differential system C = 0 which is orthonomic (i.e. all the initials and separants of C belong to the base field of R). In that case (which turns out to happen quite often) p = [C] is prime. No differential polynomial can divide zero modulo a prime ideal.

The property of being a normal simplifier is a consequence of condition C1 of Definition 8.</p><p>By applying a primary decomposition algorithm over the regular decomposition of p, one would get a (redundant) differential prime decomposition of p (see a remark below Theorem 4). This algorithm would probably be much more efficient than the characteristic sets algorithm of Ritt <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and would provide the same result. Remark that decomposition of radical differential ideals in regular differential ideals does not depend on the base field whereas the decomposition in prime differential ideals does. The computed representation of a radical differential ideal p is not canonical because of the regular components which may be redundant w.r.t. p. Moreover, even if r is a regular differential ideal which is not redundant w.r.t. p, there may exist among the minimal differential prime components of r some differential ideals redundant w.r.t. p. Deciding whether a regular differential ideal is redundant or not w.r.t. a decomposition of type ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_99">14</ref>) is related to a famous open problem in differential algebra <ref type="bibr">[17, page 166</ref>]. The computed representation of p is therefore not a canonical simplifier for the equivalence relation modulo p. However, being a normal simplifier is enough for deciding whether two given differential polynomials p and q are equivalent modulo p for p ≡ q if and only if pq ≡ 0 modulo p. In the case of differential ideals generated by only one differential polynomial, the problem of the computation of the minimal prime decomposition is solved by the Low Power Theorem [17, Chap. IV, section 15], much studied by Ritt <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and Levi <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We have described an algorithm which computes a representation of the radical p of any finitely generated differential ideal as an intersection of radical differential ideals. The representation separates the minimal differential prime components of p which do not have the same dimension. It permits to compute Taylor expansions of solutions of p and the Hilbert's polynomials associated to its minimal differential prime components. The algorithm is implemented in MAPLE within a package. Its implementation is quite tricky: it applies an analog of Buchberger's second criterion, it manages to perform Gröbner bases computations in dimension zero and is able to reuse a representation of p for a ranking to simplify the computation of a representation of p for another ranking. Quite surprisingly, the algebraic computations turn out to be much easier to handle than one might fear. In order to prove and present our algorithm, we had to improve some of Kolchin's theorems. Our results (e.g. Lazard's Lemma) do not only apply in differential algebra but also for the non-differential commutative algebra. Remark this phenomenon is not new: Ritt's characteristic sets theory, first developed for differential equations, has become later very popular for systems of usual polynomials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Ritt's reduction algorithms are pseudo-division [16, vol. 2, page 407] algorithms, extended to differential algebra.

Moreover, by applying a primary decomposition algorithm over (A) : S ∞ we get the differential prime decomposition of the differential ideal [A] : S ∞ .

Proof By the hypothesis and Point 3 of Corollary 4, no element of H C is a divisor of zero modulo [A] : S ∞ . Since C ⊂ [A] : S ∞ , the set C only reduces to zero elements of this differential ideal. By the corollary of Lazard's Lemma, a derivative v is the leader of some element of C if and only if it is the leader of some element of B. Thus if p is a non-zero differential polynomial reduced in the sense of Ritt w.r.t. C then p is partially reduced w.r.t. A on one hand; on the other hand, the terms of p are not divisible by the leading terms of the elements of B thus p is irreducible by the Gröbner basis B and p / ∈ (B) = (A) : S ∞ . By Rosenfeld's Lemma, p / ∈ [A] : S ∞ . Thus every element of [A] : S ∞ is reduced to zero by C.</figDesc><table /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 14 G satisfies invariant I2.</head><p>Proof Invariant I2 is satisfied for all reduction critical pairs in D which are not in D since those critical pairs have the form { p, q} with rank p &gt; rank q and q ∈ A . Invariant I2 is satisfied for all reduction critical pairs in D which belong also to D by Lemma 12.</p><p>Lemma 13 If v is any derivative then every { p, p } ∈ critical-pairs(A ∪ {q}) which is such that lcd(ld p, ld p ) &lt; v is nearly solved by G .</p><p>Proof By induction on v. Basis of the induction: if v is less than or equal to the minimum v 0 of lcd(ld p, ld p ) for all { p, p } ∈ critical-pairs(A ∪ {q}) then the lemma is trivially satisfied. In the general case, let us assume that v &gt; v 0 and (induction hypothesis) that every { p, p } ∈ critical-pairs(A ∪ {q}) such that lcd(ld p, ld p ) &lt; v is nearly solved by G . First case: p = q and p = q. First subcase: if { p, p } is solved by G then, by Lemma 12, the critical pair { p, p } is solved by G . It is thus nearly solved by G according to A1. Second subcase: if { p, p } ∈ D * then either it belongs to D or it does not. In the former case, it is nearly solved by G according to A2. In the latter, the triple p, q, p satisfies the hypotheses H1 to H3 of Proposition 5 and lcd(ld p, ld p ) is a proper derivative of both lcd(ld p, ld q) and lcd(ld p , ld q). By the induction hypothesis and A3, the critical pair { p, p } is nearly solved by G . Third subcase: if { p, p } = {p 0 , p 0 } ∈ D and q = ( p 0 , p 0 ) full-rem A then { p, p } is solved by the differential system A ∪ {q} = 0, S = 0 (specifications of Ritt's reduction algorithms). By Lemma 10 and the fact that q ∈ A , the critical pair { p, p } is solved by G . It is thus nearly solved by G according to A1. Second case: the critical pair is formed by q and some p ∈ A. First subcase: if { p, q} ∈ D 1 ⊂ D then { p, q} is nearly solved by G according to A2. Second subcase: if { p, q} / ∈ D then either it is solved by G according to Proposition 4 or there exists a critical pair { p , q} ∈ D 1 ⊂ D such that the triple q, p , p satisfies the hypotheses H1 to H3 of Proposition 5. In this latter case, lcd(ld p, ld q) is a derivative of lcd(ld p, ld p ) and, according to the first case considered above, the critical pair { p, p } ∈ critical-pairs(A) is solved by G . By A3 the critical pair { p, q} is nearly solved by G .</p></div>

In particular, if the given system is a set of non-differential polynomials, coded as differential polynomials linear, homogeneous, in one differential indeterminate with constant coefficients then this implementation behaves exactly (up to the implementation overhead) as a good implementation of the Buchberger's algorithm (the one of Gebauer and Möller <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Computing canonical representatives</head><p>According to the results of the previous sections any regular differential ideal may be presented by a regular differential system and by its associated Gröbner basis. This was the choice in Boulier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This representation is not only heavy but also non-canonical for different regular differential systems may define the same regular differential ideal. In this section, we define better representatives of regular differential ideals that we call characteristic presentations. Theorem 8 then shows how to compute characteristic presentations from regular differential systems. The Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm (Theorem 9) can then be stated.</p></div>

H the structure of the Lie algebra (in particular, its dimension as a vector space). For this reason, we consider H as a system of polynomial differential equations in four differential indeterminates V 1 , V 2 , V 3 and H and we call the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm with a ranking which eliminates the V 's. By splitting cases, the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm discusses the structure of the Lie algebra w.r.t. H . Four regular systems are generated. In the paragraphs below, computations of regular differential systems and Taylor expansions of solutions are performed using the diffalg package. Outputs are pretty printed. Taylors expansions are computed in the neighborhood of x = 0, y = 0, u = 0. The symbols starting with a C denote the constants appearing in these developments (e.g. CH = H (0, 0, 0), CH u = H u (0, 0, 0), . . .).</p></div>
