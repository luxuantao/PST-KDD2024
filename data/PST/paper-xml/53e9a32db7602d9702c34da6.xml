<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction 1.Overview</head><p>Transmit powers represent a key degree of freedom in the design of wireless networks. In both cellular and ad hoc networks, power control helps with several functionalities:</p><p>• Interference management: Due to the broadcast nature of wireless communication, signals interfere with each other. This problem is particularly acute in interference-limited systems, such as CDMA systems where perfect orthogonality among users is difficult to maintain. Power control helps ensure efficient spectral reuse and desirable user experience. • Energy management: Due to the limited battery power in mobile stations, handheld devices, or any "nodes" operating on small energy budget, energy conservation is important for the lifetime of the nodes and even the network. Power control helps minimize a key component of the overall energy expenditure. • Connectivity management: Due to uncertainty and timevariation of wireless channels, even when there is neither signal interference nor energy limitation, the receiver needs to be able to maintain a minimum level of received signal so that it can stay connected with the transmitter and estimate the channel state. Power control helps maintain logical connectivity for a given signal processing scheme.</p><p>To define a scope that allows an in-depth treatment within 150 pages, we will focus on power control in cellular networks in this survey, emphasizing primarily its use in interference management while occasionally touching upon energy and connectivity management. Most of the treatment is devoted to uplink transmission from mobile station (MS) to base station (BS), although extensions to downlink transmission from a BS to MSs are sometimes discussed as well. In many formulations uplink problems are more difficult to solve, although there are exceptions like joint power control and beamforming, and in other formulations uplink and downlink problems present interesting duality relationships. Uplink power control is also often more important in systems engineering of cellular networks. 1  Within the functionality of interference management, there are several types of problem statements, including optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as utility functions based on throughput and delay, achieving network capacity in the information-theoretic sense with technology-agnostic converse theorems, or maintaining network stability in queueing-theoretic sense when there are dynamic arrival and departure of users. This survey focuses on the first type of problems, which is already rich enough that a detailed taxonomy of problem formulations is warranted and will be provided later in this section.</p><p>Given the specialization stated above and the range of power control problems in wireline systems like DSL, it is clear that this survey only covers part of the broad set of problems in interference management. Within this scope, there is already a wide and growing range 1 First, BS power consumption is of less importance in comparison to MS power consumption. Second, the downlink intra-cell interference is much smaller in comparison to uplink intra-cell interference, because maintaining orthogonality of resource allocation (e.g., code allocation in CDMA, tone allocation in OFDM, or frequency and time slot allocation in GSM) to MSs within a cell on the downlink is easily accomplished by the BS. Third, BS locations are fixed and inter-cell interference is less bursty.</p><p>of results that are mathematically interesting and practically important. After surveying the key formulations, their relationships with each other, and the key properties of convexity and decomposability in this opening section, we organize the core materials in eight sections. Sections 2-4 present the basic formulations, starting with the simplest case of power control with fixed equilibrium SIR targets in Section 2, and progressing to the case of controlling transient behaviors and admission in Section 3, and that of jointly controlling power and SIR assignment in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 then present extensions to opportunistic and non-cooperative power control, respectively. Power control is often conducted jointly with other resource allocation when spatial, spectral, and temporal degrees of freedom are offered. In Sections 7-9, we discuss joint power control and beamforming, base station assignment, frequency allocation, and scheduling, for both fixed SIR and variable SIR cases. Each of Sections 2-9 starts with an overall introduction and concludes with a discussion of open problems. The mathematical techniques of optimization theory, control theory, game theory, and linear algebra will also be highlighted across these eight sections. Practical impacts of the theory of power control in the wireless industry have been substantial over the years, and some of these engineering implications in operational networks are summarized in Section 10.</p><p>Power control in wireless networks has been systematically studied since the 1970s. Over the last 15 years, thanks to the tremendous growth of cellular networks and its transformative impacts on society, extensive research on cellular network power control has produced a wide and deep set of results in terms of modeling, analysis, and design. We have tried to include as many contributions in the bibliography as possible, to survey the key results and methodologies in a balanced manner, and to strike a tradeoff between a detailed treatment of each problem and a comprehensive coverage of all major issues. While these lofty goals may not have been attained to perfection, we hope this survey will serve both as a partial summary of the state-of-the-art and a sketchy illustration of the exciting open problems in the area of power control in cellular networks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">Basic System Model</head><p>Consider a general multi-cell network where N MSs establish links to K BSs, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">1</ref>.1. We assume that each MS is served by one of the K BSs, thereby establishing N logical links. Let σ i denote the serving BS for link i.</p><p>Let C i denote the set of links whose transmit power appear as interference to link i for a given receiver design. This definition allows us to consider both orthogonal and non-orthogonal uplinks. In a nonorthogonal uplink, such as CDMA, transmitted power from all links appear as interference, so we set C i = {j|j = i}. For an orthogonal uplink, such as OFDM, links terminating on the same BS are orthogonal and do not contribute interference to one another. In this case, we set C i = {j|σ j = σ i }.</p><p>Let h kj denote the amplitude gain from MS j to BS k. Define the N × N power-gain matrix G by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G ij = h σ i j 2 , (<label>1.1)</label></formula><p>which represents the power gain from MS on link j to the receiving BS on link i.

With the above notation, γ i = G ii p i /q i , or equivalently, D h p = D(γ)q, <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref> where D(γ) = diag(γ 1 , . . . , γ M ). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> Combining (1.4) and (1.5), we get the following basic equations relating the key quantities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">q = FD(γ)q + n,<label>(1.6)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D h p = D(γ)FD h p + D(γ)n.<label>(1.7)</label></formula><p>An important factor that determines the total uplink capacity in commercial networks today is the interference limit q m , often stated in the form q m = κn for some constant κ ≥ 1. With this definition, the interference, q i , at each BS i, is not allowed to be larger than a factor κ greater than the thermal noise n i . The factor, κ, is called the Interference over Thermal (IOT), and typically quoted in dB, IOT = 10 log 10 (κ).</p><p>A related measure is the Raise over Thermal (ROT), the ratio of the interference and the signal power to the thermal noise. The IOT limits bound the interference to the cell and the power required for new MSs to access the network. Typical IOT values in commercial networks range from 3 to 10 dB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">Optimization Variables</head><p>Whether a power control problem is formulated as cooperative or noncooperative, over a period of time or for a target equilibrium, it often involves an optimization formulation. An optimization can be described by four tuples: optimization variables, objective function, constraint set, and constant parameters.</p><p>Obviously transmit power vector p is an optimization variable in all formulations in this survey. In Sections 7-9, beamforming pattern, BS assignment, bandwidth allocation, and time schedules also become variables. In addition to these primary variables, there are also secondary variables that are functions of them. An important example is that, in Section 4, SIR vector γ also becomes a variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3">Objectives</head><p>There are two types of terms in the objective function: QoS-based utility and resource cost. Cost function for resource usage is relatively simple. It is often an increasing, convex function V of the underlying resource, e.g., linear function of transmit power.</p><p>Utility functions require more discussion. The most general utility function assumes the form of U (β), where β is a vector of metrics. Often it is assumed to be additive across MSs indexed by i: U (β) = i U i (β), and locally dependent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">U (β) = i U i (β i ).</formula><p>Metric β i may be the achieved throughput or goodput (and U would be an increasing function), or delay, jittering, or distortion (and U would be a decreasing function). These metrics are in turn functions of transmit power and other optimization variables in a given power control problem formulation.</p><p>For example, one QoS metric of interest is throughput, which is a function of SIR, which is in turn a function of transmit powers. There are several expressions of this metric. One is in terms of the capacity formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">β i (γ i ) = d log(1 + cγ i ),<label>(1.8)</label></formula><p>where c and d are constants that depend on modulation scheme, symbol period, and target Bit Error Rate (BER). In high-SIR regime, the above expression can be approximated by log function: β i (γ i ) = d log cγ i . In low-SIR regime, it can be approximated by linear function: β i (γ i ) = dcγ i . It turns out both approximations help with formulating a convex optimization problem as discussed later. When other degrees of freedom such as schedules and beamforming patterns are involved, the expression becomes more complicated. Another expression for throughput is through the packet success rate function f that maps SIR to the probability of successfully decoding a packet:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">β i (γ i ) = R i f (γ i ),<label>(1.9)</label></formula><p>where R i is the transmission rate. There are also other QoS metrics such as delay that depend on SIR, and they will be introduced as the sections progress.</p><p>Back to the utility function U i itself, it is often modeled as a monotonic, smooth, and concave function, but in more general form as required by some applications, it may not be smooth or concave. It can capture any of the following: happiness of users, elasticity of traffic, efficiency of resource allocation, and even the notion of fairness. Consider a family of utility functions parameterized by α ≥ 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">U i (β i ) = log(β i ) i fα = 1, (1 -α) -1 β 1-α i if α = 1.</formula><p>(1.10)</p><p>Maximizing such an "α-fair utility function" leads to an optimizer that satisfies the definition of α-fairness in economics literature. For exam-ple, proportional fairness is attained for α = 1 and maxmin fairness for α → ∞. It is also often believed that larger α means more fairness.</p><p>A utility function that will help provide convexity of problem formulation while approximating linear utility function is the following pseudo-linear utility function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">U i (β i ) = log(exp(β i /c) -1),<label>(1.11)</label></formula><p>where c &gt; 0 is a constant. This utility function is fairer than the linear utility function but approximates the linear utility at high QoS values.</p><p>In particular, we have log(exp(β i /c) -1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">→ β i /c as β i → ∞, log(exp(β i /c) -1) → -∞ as β i → 0.</formula><p>Sometimes, QoS-based utility and resource cost are combined into a single objective function for each user, either additively as in utility minus power, or multiplicatively as in throughput over power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.4">Constraints</head><p>There are three major types of constraints in power control problems. First is the set of constraints reflecting technological and regulatory limitations, e.g., total transmit power, maximum transmit power for each user, and IOT or ROT. These are usually simple constraints mathematically.</p><p>Second are constraints based on inelastic, individual users' requirements, e.g., two MSs' received SIR at a BS need to be the same, or one MS's rate cannot be smaller than a threshold. It is not always possible to meet these constraints simultaneously. In these cases, the power control problem is infeasible.</p><p>The third type of constraints, called feasibility constraints, is most complicated. In the information-theoretic sense, it would be the capacity region of an interference channel, which remains unknown. In the queueing-theoretic sense, it would be the stochastic stability region. In this survey, we focus instead on constraints that are defined with respect to QoS feasibility region, which is closely related to SIR feasibility region.</p><p>An SIR vector γ 0 is called feasible if there exists an interference vector, q 0, and power vector p 0, satisfying (1.6) and (1.7), respectively. It is reasonable to assume that the network of BSs and MSs represented by the channel matrix F in Section 1.3.1 is connected, implying that F is a primitive matrix. Let ρ(•) denote the spectral radius function<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> of such a positive, primitive matrix. The following lemma from <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[198]</ref> is one of the fundamental results that characterizes SIR feasibility based on spectral radius of system matrices F and D(γ): Lemma 1.1. An SIR vector γ 0 is feasible if and only if ρ(FD(γ)) &lt; 1, when n = 0, and ρ(FD(γ)) = 1, when n = 0.</p><p>Further discussions on SIR and QoS feasibility regions will be provided in Sections 2 and 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.5">Problem Formulations</head><p>We are ready to provide a quick preview of some representative problem formulations in the rest of the survey. Given the vast landscape of power control problems covered, a "problem tree" in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">1</ref>.2 serves as a high-level guide to the relationships among these problems. Meanings of each level of branching off are as follows:</p><p>• Level 1: Optimization vs. game theory approach.</p><p>• Level 2: Deterministic optimization within each time-slot vs. opportunistic approach. • Level 3: Variable SIR vs. fixed SIR approach.</p><p>• Level 4 and below: Joint power control and a subset of the following: beamforming, BS assignment, bandwidth allocation, and scheduling.</p><p>Next, we present one or two representative problems in each of the nodes in the problem tree. Symbols are defined in the Table of Notation. The meanings, justifications, solutions, and implications of these problems are not discussed here, since they will be extensively studied in the following 8 sections.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Convexity and Decomposability Structures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.1">Convexity</head><p>Convexity has long been recognized as the watershed between easy and hard optimization problems. Convex optimization refers to minimization of a convex objective function over a convex constraint set. For convex optimization, a local optimum is also a global optimum (and unique if the objective function is strictly convex), duality gap is zero under mild conditions, and a rich understanding of its theoretical and numerical properties is available. For example, solving a convex optimization is highly efficient in theory and in practice, as long as the constraint set is represented efficiently, e.g., by a set of upper bound inequality constraints on other convex functions. Zero duality gap further enables distributed solutions through dual decomposition. </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">U i (γ i ) - i V i (p i ) E i U i (γ i ) SIR Power E[Power] Band Time r i γ i p i σ i w i w i t C 6 √ √ √ √ √ √ √ E 5 √ √ √ √ √ √ F 4,7,9 √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √√ G 2,3,7,9 √ √ √√√√ H 9 √ √ √ √ √ √ √ I 9 √ √ √ √ √ √ √ J 7 √ √ √ √ √ N 4 √ √ √ √ K 7 √ √ √ √ L 8 √ √ √√ M 3 √ √ √ √ O 2 √ √ √</formula><p>To check if a power control problem is convex optimization, we need to check both its objective and constraints. We want the objective function being maximized (e.g., utility function of rate) to be concave, and the one being minimized (e.g., cost function of power consumption) to be convex in the optimization variables. As will be discussed in many sections later, concavity of utility function may not always hold. In non-cooperative power control formulations, quasi-concavity property of selfish utility functions plays a similarly important role for proving the existence of Nash equilibrium. We also want the constraint set to be convex, and in an efficient representation. Sometimes, a log change of variables turns an apparently non-convex problem into a convex one as in the Geometric Programming approach that has been shown to solve a wide range of constrained power control problems in high-SIR regime and a smaller set of problems in general-SIR regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. More sufficient conditions for such convexity will be discussed in later sections.</p><p>Sometimes discrete optimization variables need to be introduced, thus turning the problem into a non-convex one. Three important examples include BS assignment among a finite set of BS choices, scheduling an MS to transmit or not, and a discrete set of available power levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.2">Decomposability</head><p>While convexity is the key to global optimality and efficient computation, decomposability is the key to distributed solutions of an optimization problem. Unlike convex optimization, however, there is no definition of a decomposable problem. Rather decomposability comes in different degrees. If a problem can be decomposed into subproblems whose coordination does not involve communication overhead, its solution algorithm can be distributed without any message passing. In other instances, subproblems being solved by different network elements (e.g., MS and BS) need to be coordinated by passing messages among these elements. Counting such communication overhead is not always easy either, it often depends on how far and how often are messages passed and how many bits each message contains. In general, message passing across multiple BS is difficult, whereas between a BS and the MS in its cell is more feasible. Frequency and length of these control messages will be further discussed in Section 10.</p><p>There are various decomposition techniques from optimization theory, such as dual decomposition, primal decomposition, and penalty function method. However, one of the key constraints in power control problems, the SIR feasibility constraint, turns out to be coupled in a way that is not readily decomposed by these techniques. In Section 4, we will show how a reparametrization of this set reveals decomposability structures and leads to a distributed algorithm.</p><p>In contrast to the global optimization formulations, distributed algorithms are, by definition, already provided in non-cooperative game formulations of power control, as surveyed in Section 6. The challenge then becomes showing that such distributed interactions among selfish network elements will lead to a desirable equilibrium, e.g., they also maximize the global utility function for the whole network. The following two approaches are complementary: modeling through global optimization and searching for decomposition method, or modeling through selfish local optimization and characterizing the loss of social welfare optimality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Introduction</head><p>Much of the study on cellular network power control started in 1992-1993 with a series of results that solve the basic problem formulation, where transmit power is the only variable, constrained by fixed and feasible target SIR's, and optimized to minimize the total power. In this section, we consider the system model in Section 1 and first review the Distributed Power Control (DPC) algorithm proposed by Foschini and Miljanic <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. There are several nice interpretations that motivate this simple yet powerful algorithm from different angles. Then we review an elegant generalization of DPC to the framework of standard interference function and canonical power control algorithms. These generalizations reveal the connection between the structures of the basic power control problem and the properties of its solution algorithms. They also characterize the link between power control problems and Perron Frobenius theory of non-negative matrix. Rate of convergence and robustness to stochastic dynamics are mentioned before we conclude this section that lays the foundation to the rest of the survey.</p></div>

A related issue is assignment of SIR target, a degree of freedom that has been fixed as constants in the last and present sections and will be exploited in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Introduction</head><p>The fixed SIR approach to power control problem discussed in Section 2 is suitable for lightly loaded voice networks. Setting a feasible target γ is challenging when the network is heavily loaded. In the case of a wireless data network handling a variety of traffic including voice, SIR assignment can be optimized according to traffic requirements and channel conditions. Higher SIRs imply higher data rates and possibly greater reliability, while low SIRs can satisfy requirements of traffic with low data rates. Further, a cellular operator of a wireless data network might want to treat higher tariff paying users preferentially by allocating them to higher QoS classes, and the SIR target need to be set differently for users in different QoS classes. Most of the literature that deals with this problem define either the rate or another QoS metric as a bijective mapping to SIR, and optimize their allocation according to a utility function, subject to the constraint that SIR assignment must be feasible, i.e., there is a power vector that can realize the SIR vector. Therefore, the problem becomes a joint SIR assignment and power control problem.</p><p>One approach to vary SIR targets is for each MS to selfishly attempt to maximize its utility without regard to network-wide criteria. This results in a distributed implementation that can be modeled as an N -person non-cooperative game. The resulting Nash equilibrium can then be analyzed for properties such as existence, uniqueness, and efficiency loss. This game-theoretic approach will be discussed in Section 6.</p><p>A second approach is to consider the SIR allocation based on global maximization of the utilities as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128]</ref> and depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.1. The utility maximization problems considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref> assume an approximation to the rate function and propose centralized algorithms. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> proposes utilities of data rates approximated as linear functions of SIRs, and proposes a distributed algorithm on a subset of the SIR feasibility set that is easier to decouple and leads to a heuristic solution.</p><p>In summary, the range of results in 1992-2005 can provide (1) a distributed and optimal solution in the special case of fixed SIR,  The feasible SIR region has a Pareto-optimal boundary. Points outside the boundary cannot be realized by any power allocation. Utility function's curves intersect at the boundary and define an optimal SIR assignment. The central question in this section is how to distributedly move toward this optimal SIR point and the associated power allocation.</p><p>(2) an optimal but centralized solution that requires global coordination across the cells, or (3) a distributed but suboptimal solution based on selfish local power update at MSs. Two primary difficulties in this problem of jointly optimizing SIR and transmit powers across multiple cells is that the constraint set of SIR feasibility is coupled in a complicated way beyond standard decoupling techniques and the convexity or non-convexity of the SIR feasibility region is not completely characetrized.</p><p>However, certain transformations of the SIR feasibility region have been shown to be convex as discussed in Section 4.2. This makes it possible for the optimal SIR allocation problem to be defined as a convex optimization problem with certain restrictions on the utility functions that define the network-wide criteria. With this approach the works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> formulate an SIR allocation problem for which they present distributed algorithms that does not require coordination across cells and converges to the jointly optimal SIR and power.</p><p>The main idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> comes from a re-parametrization of the constraint set from power-interference representation to the so-called load-spillage representation. The load spillage power control (LSPC) algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> is a locally computable gradient based ascent update that involves a step size that is required to be close to zero for convergence.</p><p>The main idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> is the notion of interference price that reflects the price charged by each link to the network due to interference from other links in the network. It is shown that this price can be distributively calculated resulting in a joint power-price update, referred to as the Asynchronous Distributed Pricing (ADP) algorithm, that converges to an optimal solution maximizing the network-wide criterion. The convergence analysis is based on interpreting the power-price updates as myopic best response updates of a super-modular game for which convergence is known.</p><p>The notion of load can be shown to be equivalent to the interference price introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> with spillage denoting the cost to each link of transmitting power into the network. The convergence may be slower than the price-power updates in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> but is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> to solve problems involving a larger set of utility functions defining the network-wide criteria. The LSPC algorithm has also been recently adopted in the industry, as will be explained in Section 10.</p><p>This section starts with characterizations of the SIR feasibility regions in terms of their convexity property, then presents the LSPC and the ADP algorithm, the main theoretical properties, and a largescale example using the 3GPP2 simulator.</p></div>

It is preferable to obtain this assignment in a distributed manner with minimal message passing without the need for a centralized mechanism. There is an infinite number of Pareto-optimal points on the boundary of feasibility region, and an objective function, like one from a range of concave utility functions discussed in Section 1, define a particular point as the optimum. Given a set of feasible SIR vectors, γ ∈ Γ ⊆ B, the optimal SIR over this set is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">γ opt = arg max γ∈Γ i U i (γ i ).

Non-convex formulations will be briefly discussed in Section 9. One way to impose the convexity restriction on the above problems is by requiring the utility functions U i (γ i ) to be concave in log(γ i ). Since the SIR feasibility region is convex in log(γ), the optimization problems are convex under this assumtpion.</p><p>Concavity of utility function in log(γ i ) can be expressed in an alternative form: U i (γ i ) is concave in log γ i if and only if the negative of the curvature is sufficiently large or equivalently:</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">- γ i U i (γ i ) U i (γ i ) ≥ 1.</formula><p>In particular, the above condition is satisfied for α-fair utilities when α ≥ 1. Note that the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_82">U i (γ i ) = log(γ i ) satisfies this condi- tion but U i (γ i ) = log(1 + γ i ) does not. In fact, U i (γ i ) = log(γ i ) is the psuedo-linear utility discussed in Section 1 for a QoS β i = log(1 + γ i ).</formula><p>We also assume that U i (γ i ) → -∞ as γ i → 0, thus prohibiting zero power and SIR allocation. This implies that every link gets a nonzero SIR at equilibrium. Such problem formulations represent a system design where the links are not scheduled in time but can compete with each other for higher SIR in every time-slot as is the case in 1xEVD0, a commercial wireless broadband system discussed further in Section 10. However, sometimes it is better to allocate zero SIR to some links, i.e., deactivate them, so as to maximize the network's total utility and reactivate the link at a future time. This situation will be discussed in Section 9 for joint power control and scheduling.</p><p>Even when problems (4.1) and (4.2) are convex, the structure of the coupled constraint set, where the transmit power of any one MS affects the SIR of every other MS in the network, renders the problem difficult to solve distributively. It turns out that an alternative representation of the Pareto-optimal boundary in terms of the left, rather than right, Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, and an interference price controlled utility maximzation, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, both enable a distributed solution.</p></div>

The QoS metric β i used is β i = d log(1 + cγ i ), with equal allocation of time-frequency resources across users within a sector. The algorithm is initialized with a random positive load vector , and the step size is taken as δ 1 = 0.1. The interference limit in terms of the ROT factor, the ratio of the total interference to noise, is set to 5, 10, and 15 dB, in different experiments. Shown as a horizontal line is the global optimum numerically attained by centralized computation. Each iteration consists of one power control update and is typically of the order of milliseconds as discussed in Section 10. It can be seen that the QoS from the distributed algorithm is almost identical to the optimal QoS within about 25, 35, and 50 iterations for ROT = 5, 10, and 15 dB, respectively. To compare timescale of convergence, the DPC algorithm with SIRs fixed at the optimal values (which is almost impossible to do in practice) is also plotted for each ROT and with random initialization The logarithmic utility is plotted as the geometric mean user capacity. For comparison of rate of convergence, also shown is DPC algorithm's convergence if its fixed SIR targets so happens to be set at the optimum. of the powers. Convergence time of the DPC algorithm is about 15, 25, and 50 iterations for ROT = 5, 10, and 15 dB, respectively, similar to the convergence time for the distributed optimal SIR algorithm. This shows that the speed of convergence of the LSPC algorithm is almost as fast as the standard power control for fixed SIR. As expected, the convergence time increases with the ROT limit. However, the convergence times remain reasonable with the practical ROT limits of 6 to 10 dB typically used in commercial networks.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.4 shows the cumulative distribution of the user capacities at the final iteration of Algorithm 4.1. As discussed in Section 1, one of the desirable features of utility maximization is that this QoS distribution, and the efficiency-fairness tradeoff, can be varied by appropriately adjusting the utility. with either very high or very low achievable capacities. In general, larger α enhances the fairness of SIR assignment while reducing the spectral efficiency measured in terms of the sum throughput per sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Open Problems</head><p>Two major open problems have already been discussed in the last section. One is problem (4.1) when the feasibility set is non-convex or the utility function non-concave. Two is the problem of joint power control and scheduling, where the equilibrium is not a fixed SIR assignment but a limit cycle of link activation schedule. These will be discussed further in Section 9.</p><p>Unlike the DPC algorithm where transient behaviors have been studied, SIR evolution before equilibrium in the LSPC algorithm has not been explored. In all of the remaining sections of this survey, there is a dichotomy of problem formulations: those with fixed SIR and total power minimization as the objective function, and those where SIR is part of the optimization variables and total utility function is the objective function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Open Problems</head><p>In opportunistic power control, feedback of both channel state and resource allocation is crucial in selecting a set of users to transmit. For example, the opportunistic power control algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> requires the prior knowledge of a Lagrange multiplier λ that is associated with the average power constraint. Obtaining λ requires some form of longterm estimation for the channel state information. An open problem is to characterize the impact of limited, delayed feedback, or inaccurate, out-of-date estimation, on opportunistic power control, such as the suboptimality gap thus caused. Suboptimality gap can also arise due to nonconvex utility functions of users, e.g., in opportunistic power control in <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. The problem formulation then becomes non-convex, which is in general difficult to solve as we will see throughout the survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Introduction</head><p>The interests of MSs are not aligned: they compete for limited radio resources. We have assumed that they will update their powers for social welfare maximization thus far in the survey, but they may not always. The interests of the wireless network operator could also be in conflict with those of end users. In both cases, non-cooperative power control problems need to be formulated, solved, and analyzed as games.</p><p>In these formulations, summarized in this section, each game consists of three tuples: a set of players indexed by i, a selfish utility function U i for each player, and a set of feasible strategy space A i for each player. When a problem is formulated and solved as a non-cooperative game <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, game theory provides standard procedures to study its equilibriums, such as existence, uniqueness, stability under various strategies, and optimality gap. The most frequently used concept of equilibrium in game theory is Nash equilibrium, which is defined as a set of individual policies at which no player may gain by unilaterally deviating <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. A Nash equilibrium power allocation p * is one where no MS has incentive to unilaterally change its power:</p><formula xml:id="formula_135">U i (p * i , p * -i ) ≥ U i (p i , p * -i ), ∀p i ∈ A i , (<label>6.1)</label></formula><p>where p -i denote the vector of powers of all MSs other than MS i.</p><p>The power control problems discussed in Sections 2 and 4 can also be reformulated and analyzed in the game-theoretic framework. With fixed SIR targets, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">170]</ref> show that the classical power control problems studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">197]</ref> can be modeled as noncooperative games with submodularity structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">165,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">170]</ref>. Let A i (p -i ) be the set of feasible power policies for MS i that depends on power allocations of all other MSs. A game is submodular if all sets A i (•) are compact and descending in all values of their argument</p><formula xml:id="formula_136">p -i ≺ p-i =⇒ A i (p -i ) ⊃ A i (p -i ).

On the other hand, when variable SIRs are considered, individual utility functions can be assigned to MSs based on transmission power and the SIR.</p><p>Each MS is then assumed to decide on its own transmission power level so as to maximize its utility. Possible utility functions and their properties for both voice and data sources have been investigated in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118]</ref>.</p><p>Continuing our discussion on utility function in Section 1, we note that a variety of selfish utility functions have been used in noncooperative power control formulations. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref>, utility is defined for single carrier systems such that each MS seeks to minimize the distance between its achieved SIR and its specified target. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, linear and exponential utility functions based on carrier SIR are proposed for multi-carrier systems. In both work, the existence of a Nash equilibrium is proven under certain assumptions on the utility functions, and an algorithm to solve the resulting non-cooperative power control game suggested. To take transmit power efficiency also into account, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>, the authors introduce a utility function defined as the ratio of throughput to transmit power. This result has since been generalized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> to multi-carrier CDMA networks, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">121]</ref> to study the cross-layer problem of joint power control and modulationreceiver design, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120]</ref> to allow for QoS constraints (e.g. delay and average rate constraints) and to quantify the tradeoffs between energy efficiency and QoS metrics. These utility functions have also been applied to wireless ad hoc networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref> and ultrawideband networks in frequency-selective multi-path environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Nash equilibrium are often suboptimal in total utility attained <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This optimality gap due to non-cooperation among MSs motivates pricing mechanisms to align selfish interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref> to social welfare maximization. This approach is complementary to the one where a global optimization is first formulated and decomposition techniques are then used to derive a distributed algorithm. Both approaches eventually hope to arrive at an optimal and distributed solution.</p><p>A pricing scheme is first studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref> using submodular games. It quantifies the intuition that a non-cooperative power control game with a pricing scheme is superior to one without pricing, in terms of fairness and algorithm convergence. Other works studying pricing include <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">182,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">181,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">187]</ref> for different utility functions and network models. In particular, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, a cost function is introduced as the difference between the pricing of transmission power and usercentric utility functions, and the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium is established. Later, these results are extended to a more general scenario, where a network-centric pricing scheme is considered and each MS has the freedom to choose its own BS <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98]</ref>. This joint power control, network pricing, and BS assignment problem has also been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> as a hybrid non-cooperative game.</p><p>This section provides an overview of the above results. In each section, when a design problem is formulated as a game, the following common set of questions will be considered: Does the game have a steady state (existence of Nash equilibrium)? What are those steady states (characterization of Nash equilibrium)? Is the steady state(s) desirable (optimality of Nash equilibrium)? When will the game dynamics reach the steady state (convergence of Nash equilibrium), especially under the best response strategy where each MS adjusts its variable by maximizing selfish utility under the assumption that no other MSs would change?</p></div>

When variable SIR and maximum transmission power constraints are considered, other power control games could be formulated by assigning more complicated utility functions to individual MSs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7">Open Problems</head><p>Non-cooperative behaviors in cellular networks have not been exhaustively formulated yet. Indeed, for almost all of the formulations in other sections of this survey, game-theory and mechanism-design questions can be raised. For example, when the network is considered as an active player which interacts with individual MSs and tries to maximize its total revenue, a general class of joint user-network games can be formulated. In the last section, the special case of joint power control, BS assignment, and networking pricing is formulated. Now let T i be a resource allocation for MS i, including power and other spatialtemporal-spectral resources, and function φ(T i ) be a pricing policy adopted by the network. The general user-network game can be formulated over any set of feasible resource allocations and network pricing policies, MSs : max</p><formula xml:id="formula_178">T i U i (T i ) -φ(T i ), Network : max φ(•) i φ(T i ) .</formula><p>This general set of games, taking financial incentives of operator and multiple degrees of freedom of MSs into account, is yet to be studied. Even for existing formulations, the issues related to mixed strategy, rather than pure strategy, and to mechanism design often remain open (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> for a reference). decentralized MSs. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">7</ref>.1 illustrates a typical wireless cellular environment. Discussions in this section focus on joint power control and beamforming within a single cell, although some of the results can be extended to multiple cells.</p><p>In the uplink, spatial diversity of multiple antennas is exploited by independently adjusting beamforming vectors at the receiver. In the downlink, the beamforming vectors act as linear pre-equalizers, spreading the signals over the antenna array prior to transmission. Depending on the availability of full channel information, beamforming problems can be formulated in several different ways: In case the transmitter has no knowledge of the channel information, <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">178]</ref> show that, by constructing random beam vectors and transmitting to the MSs with the highest SIR, the achievable sum rate has the same scaling law as the sum capacity for downlink broadcast channels when the number of MSs is large. This approach is referred to as random (or opportunistic) beamforming. (A similar approach for power control was discussed in Section 5 in details.) It has since been generalized to beamforming with partial channel information <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">160,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">191,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">192,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">203]</ref>. On the other hand, when full channel information is available at the transmitter, the beamforming vectors can be adjusted adaptively to minimize interference and enhance SIR. One of the approaches is to invert the channel through the beamforming vector to eliminate interference completely, and it is referred to as the zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">159,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">179,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">180,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">190]</ref>. The main drawback of the ZF beamforming is its degraded performance in low SIR regime, since inverting the channel increases the need for more transmit power <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This motivates the design of optimal beamforming vectors for a known MIMO channel, which is the main subject of this section.</p><p>In uplink transmission, for a fixed power allocation, the SIR of all MSs can be independently maximized by minimizing the respective Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between the received and the transmitted signal. Thus uplink beamforming can be decoupled, such that each MS performs an independent optimization of its own beamforming vector and the optimal solution is referred to as an MMSE filter. However, the usage of beamforming impacts SIR, and therefore on the optimal power allocation.</p><p>On the other hand, for fixed beamforming vectors, an overview of power control techniques is given in Sections 2 and 4. It was assumed that the beamforming vectors are given by a separate algorithm that either fixes the beamforming vectors for each MS, or alters the beamforming vectors according to a fixed pattern, or even adaptively changes the beamforming vectors in response to some suitable feedback. For example, the opportunistic beamforming mechanism in <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref> changes the beamforming vector in a fixed pattern so as to let every MS achieve the optimal beamforming configuration at which its SIR is maximized.</p><p>This section considers the interaction between power control and beamforming, and addresses their joint optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138]</ref>. For joint power control and beamforming, a distributed algorithm is first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>. The algorithm computes the transmission powers and the beamforming vectors iteratively, such that a target SIR is achieved for each link (if it is achievable) with minimal transmission power. This work has been extended in several directions, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, the nonconvex and globally coupled problem of joint beamforming and power control is considered to maximize the network-wide utility as a function of attained SIR. Downlink joint power control and beamforming, on the other hand, is more complicated than uplink because transmit beamforming vectors are coupled and must be optimized jointly. When nonorthogonal transmission is allowed, the choice of one MS's beamforming vector may affect the crosstalk experienced by other MSs. For fixed SIR targets, a downlink joint power control and beamforming problem has been solved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">176,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">183]</ref>. Another result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref> deals with optimal joint power control and beamforming for max-min SIR fairness. A key technique in the solutions of both the minimum-power beamforming problem and the maximum-utility beamforming problem is the idea of an uplink-downlink duality, which leverages the better-understood structures in uplink beamforming for the downlink problem. This duality result states that, under the same power constraint, the best achievable SIR region with joint transmitter beamforming and power control is the same as that of an uplink channel with joint receiver beamforming and power control <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">175,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">176,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">177,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">183,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">193]</ref>. The optimal beamforming vectors in the downlink is also the optimal beamforming vectors in the uplink.</p><p>This section will first focus on joint power control and beamforming in the uplink case, starting with fixed SIR then moving to variable SIR. We will then present the uplink-downlink duality and discuss the downlink case.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Uplink-Downlink Duality</head><p>For downlink joint power control and beamforming, the BS constructs one data stream to each MS and spreads the data stream over M antenna elements, with beamforming vectors to exploit spatial diversity. Consider a cellular network with one BS equipped with M transmit antennas and N MSs each equipped with one receive antenna. The transmitted signal is of the form X = N i=1 ŵi u i , where ŵi is a M × 1 beamforming vector for information signal u i of MS i. Let E|u i | 2 = 1. The received signal for MS i is</p><formula xml:id="formula_210">y i = h H σ i i ŵi u i + j =i h H σ i i ŵj u j + z i ,<label>(7.24)</label></formula><p>where h σ i j denotes the M × 1 equivalent channel vector for MS j and z i is an addictive white Gaussian noise with variance n. Consider a fixed-SIR approach for the downlink joint power control and beamforming problem, whose objective is to find optimal beamforming vectors that minimize the total transmit power and satisfy the given SIR targets for each MS. Since E[X H X] = N i=1 ŵH i ŵi , the downlink joint power control and beamforming problem can be formulated as follows. Note that downlink transmit power is absorbed into the beamforming vectors, i.e. pi = ŵH i ŵi , ∀i.</p><formula xml:id="formula_211">minimize N i=1 ŵH i ŵi subject to |h H σ i i ŵi | 2 j =i |h H σ i i ŵj | 2 + n ≥ γ i , ∀i<label>(7.25) variables Ŵ.</label></formula><p>Problem <ref type="bibr">(7.25)</ref> is complicated in that the beamforming vectors must be optimized jointly since the interference suffered by MS i depends on the beamforming vectors of all other MSs. To overcome this difficulty, a duality between uplink and downlink has been developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">175,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">176,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">177,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">183,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">193]</ref>. The duality property states that the achievable SIR region for a downlink channel with joint transmitter beamforming and power control is the same as that of an uplink channel with joint receiver beamforming and power control, under the same sum power constraint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_212">i p i = i || ŵi || 2</formula><p>2 . Further, the optimal beamforming vectors for the uplink is also the optimal beamforming vectors for the downlink. Since uplink joint power control and beamforming discussed in previous sections are easier to solve, the downlink problems can be transformed and more efficiently solved in its dual uplink domain.</p><p>This uplink-downlink duality is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">7</ref>.2, and has been proven in many different ways. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>, the authors first show that the same SIR targets can be achieved in both the uplink and the downlink channels with the same beamforming and sum transmit power. Therefore, downlink joint power control and beamforming problems with fixed SINR targets can be solved efficiently by an iterative uplink joint beamforming and power update algorithm. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref> offered an optimality proof for uplink-downlink duality based on an examination of the KKT conditions for the optimization problems. It is shown that the uplink problem and downlink problem have the same KKT conditions and the same set of stationary points. Later, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[183]</ref>, a convex optimization framework for downlink joint power Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">7</ref>.2 Beamforming uplink-downlink duality with sum power constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref>.</p><p>control and beamforming was introduced to show that problem can be formulated as a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. Therefore, one can numerically verify the feasibility of the SDP problem and find its globally optimal solution. Based on this observation, the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref> propose a unified interpretation to the uplink-downlink duality, which is shown to be equivalent to Lagrangian duality in optimization theory. This viewpoint illustrates the previously known duality result in a new perspective, and allows the downlink joint power control and beamforming problem with per-antenna power constraint to be solved.</p><p>Here the proof for the convexity of problem (7.25), which leads to strong Lagrange duality for the problem, is summarized <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref>. Since the objective function in (7.25) is convex in beamforming vectors ŵi , it remains to show that the SIR constraints are convex. The key observation is that the SIR constraints in (7.8) can be cast into a standard convex form<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">3</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_213">|h H σ i i ŵi | 2 j =i |h H σ i i ŵj | 2 + n ≥ γ i ⇔ 1 γ i | ŵH i h σ i i | 2 ≥ j =i | ŵH j h σ i i | 2 + n ⇔ 1 + 1 γ i | ŵH i h σ i i | 2 ≥ j | ŵH j h σ i i | 2 + n ⇔ 1 + 1 γ i ŵH i h σ i i ≥ ŴH h σ i i √ n . (<label>7.26)</label></formula><p>It is easy to see that the new SIR constraint (7.26) is convex in beamforming vectors ŵi . Thus downlink joint power control and beamforming problem (7.25) can be transformed into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved by any standard convex optimization program. As a convex optimization satisfying constraint qualifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref>, problem (7.25) has strong Lagrange duality. This allows us to derive a dual uplink joint power control and beamforming problem for (7.25).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 7.4 ([193]</head><p>). The SIR region achieved by joint power control and beamform for a downlink channel is identical to that of a dual uplink channel in which the transmitter and the receivers are reversed and the channel matrices are transposed. The downlink joint power control and beamforming problem (7.25) has the following dual uplink problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_214">minimize N i=1 (nλ i ) subject to |w H i h σ i i | 2 • (nλ i ) j =i |w H i h σ i j | 2 • (nλ j ) + n||w i || 2 2 ≥ γ i , ∀i (7.27) variables W, λ,</formula><p>where λ is Lagrangian multiplier for the downlink SIR constraints. Optimization problem (7.27) is equivalent to the Lagrange dual problem of (7.25).</p><p>In the optimization problem above, n is the thermal noise power for the downlink and thus variable nλ i has the unit of power. It is easy to verify that the dual uplink problem (7.27) is exactly the uplink joint power control and beamforming problem with fixed-SIR, by changing the optimization variables p i = nλ i . The dual uplink channel is constructed from the downlink channel by interchanging the input and the output vectors and by transposing the channel matrices. The optimal beamforming vectors for uplink and downlink are also the same.

Second, beamforming problems joint with network resource allocation, such as bandwidth, time, or BS-assignment have not been fully explored. Third, beamforming problems with mobility, fading, and inaccurate channel information are yet to be fully studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Introduction</head><p>The assumption of static connections between MSs and BSs, adopted in most of the results surveyed thus far, is not realistic due to two reasons. First, channels and BSs can be reassigned to MSs at any time, even in the middle of a call. As MSs move around the network and change positions, SIR changes and reassignment of both BS and transmit power may be required. When a new call request arises, a reassignment of the existing calls might be required to accommodate it. Second, connectivity can also be viewed as an extra system resource in addition to power, time, bandwidth, and multiple antennas. When such a joint resource allocation is considered, performance of a cellular network, and experience of the end-users could be further improved (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.1). As a simple numerical example, Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.2 considers a network with 2 BSs and 10 MSs and compares the minimum required transmit power of the DPC algorithm and a joint BS assignment and power control algorithm, for achieving an equal SIR target γ at all MSs. It is shown that the minimum required transmit power can be reduced by as much as 20 dB under a joint optimization.  This section studies the joint problem of BS assignment and power control. As in Section 7, we consider two types of problem formulations: minimize the total transmit power for fixed SIR, or maximize total utility for variable SIR. The discussion will focus on the uplink channel of cellular networks, and then extended to downlink using the uplinkdownlink duality in Section 7.</p><p>The joint power allocation and BS assignment problem in uplink has been studied, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">114,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">189]</ref>. The main objective is to determine the BS assignment that minimizes the required transmit power for fixed SIRs on each link. Let SIR i (p, σ) be the SIR function for MS i that now depends on both power allocation p and BS assignment σ. The joint optimization problem for uplink is formulated:</p><formula xml:id="formula_216">minimize N i=1 p i subject to SIR i (p, σ) ≥ γ i , ∀i σ i ∈ S i , ∀i variables σ, p,<label>(8.1)</label></formula><p>where S i is a set of feasible BS assignment for MS i. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> characterizes the optimal solution of problem (8.1), and showed that at the optimum, all SIR constraints are met with equality, and there exists an optimal BS assignment for which the transmit power is minimized for each MS. Then an algorithm based on selecting the BS to achieve the minimum transmit power is proposed. Similar algorithms are also presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">189]</ref>, where the joint power and BS update is shown to be a contraction mapping that is guaranteed to converge to a unique fixed-point. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref> proposes an algorithm for the joint power control, beamforming, and BS assignment problem. All these results are based on previous power control and beamforming algorithms discussed in Sections 2 and 7, together with choosing a BS that requires the minimum transmit power.</p><p>Later, these results are generalized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">135,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">136]</ref> to downlink channels, using the uplink-downlink duality in Section 7.4. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>, for a network with two BSs, an algorithm that achieves the optimal power and BS assignment for both the uplink and the downlink simultaneously is provided. It turns out that the SIR simultaneously achieved by the uplink and downlink channels are equal.</p><p>Utility optimization for joint power control and BS assignment has also been studied in several special cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">130,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">144]</ref>. By extending the basic power control problem in Section 4, the problem can be formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_217">maximize N i=1 U i (γ i ) subject to γ i ≤ SIR i (p, σ), ∀i p ≤ p m σ i ∈ S i , ∀i variables γ, σ, p. (8.2)</formula><p>Problem (8.2) has a difficult-to-handle structure due to the interaction between the integer connectivity constraints on individual MSs and the joint utility maximization over all SIRs. This problem remains underexplored. In Section 6, a game-theoretic approach for problem (8.2) has been discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">144]</ref> for certain utility functions. It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> that the joint power control and BS assignment problem for maximal throughput is NP-complete. A simple algorithm has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> under the assumption that all MSs use orthogonal codes and the resulting inter-cell interference is zero.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1">Introduction</head><p>In addition to power, the achieved QoS of an MS obviously depends on the allocated frequency bandwidth and time slots. The discussion in Section 4 implicitly assumed equal and static allocation of spectraltemporal resources among MSs. The discussion in Section 5 focused on optimizing the power allocation to the MSs over time as the channel varies. The interference was either assumed fixed or the variation in interference was not explicitly considered. Instead, this section will discuss joint optimization of allocation of power along with the timefrequency resources for time-invariant channels. The joint optimizer will be referred to as the scheduler in the rest of this section. It turns out that joint power control and frequency allocation is not easy to formulate in the general case, and joint power control and scheduling of time slots is difficult to solve optimally and distributedly. Many problems in this area remain open.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2.1">General Formulation</head><p>Consider a bandwidth B m available for scheduling among the N MSs, divided into L orthogonal resources of width b l each. The division of bandwidth into orthogonal resources is modulation dependent, an OFDM modulation scheme provides tone-level granularity, and a CDMA modulation scheme provides code-level granularity. Each MS divides it's power p i among the L orthogonal resources so as to maximize a network wide utility. For each parameter, let super-script l denote the parameter pertaining to the lth orthogonal resource. With this, the following equations can be written for the lth resource similar to (1.3):</p><formula xml:id="formula_231">q l i = j∈C i G l ij p l j + η l i .

The L resources are coupled by a sum power constraint l p l i ≤ p m i . The total rate achieved is then the sum of the rates achieved in each of the L resources:</p><formula xml:id="formula_233">r i = L l=1 b l log(1 + cγ l i ).<label>(9.3)</label></formula><p>The bandwidth allocation problem for variable SIR can then be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_234">maximize i U i (r i ) subject to r i = L l=1 b l log(1 + cγ l i ), ∀i γ l ∈ Γ l , ∀l l p l i ≤ p m i , ∀i</formula><p>variables γ l , p l , ∀l. <ref type="bibr">(9.4)</ref> This problem is non-convex and has no known distributed optimal solution. The representation (9.4) is in-fact very similar to the spectrum balancing problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> in DSL systems. There are several distributed solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">194,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">196]</ref> with different complexities and optimality gap. For example, a key idea in Autonomous Spectrum Balancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, is to decouple the joint power constraint across the L resources by dual decomposition and to decouple the competing users by reference line, which does not directly apply to wireless networks. Even in DSL case, optimality of practical algorithms can only be proved in special cases since the general problem is non-convex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2.2">Interference Spread Formulation</head><p>The problem definition in (9.4) assumes frequency dependent channels, G l ij , thus frequency specific SIR feasible regions Γ l . In some cases, wireless channels tend to be frequency independent since the bandwidth of interest, even for some wideband wireless system, is small compared to the carrier frequency. Channel variation across the band may be small. Furthermore, some systems incorporate interference averaging mechanism along the frequency domain. The frequency hopping mechanism in an OFDM system and the cover sequences in a CDMA system are interference averaging mechanisms motivated by the intention to spread the interference due to an MS across all of the L resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>. In these systems, inter-cell interference is averaged across the entire available bandwidth, while intra-cell interference is negligible since MSs within a cell are allocated orthogonal resources.</p><p>Therefore, a special case of joint power control and bandwidth allocation problem can be formulated as follows. Each MS j transmits with power p j on resource b j of the total available bandwidth of B m . The interference averaging mechanism ensures that a neighboring MS i sees an interference of G ij p j spread equally across the available bandwidth B m . The average interference seen by MS i becomes q i = j∈C i G ij p j + n i and the rate r i achieved by MS i can be specified by a function similar to the capacity function (1.8) discussed earlier with c being an implementation dependent constant and is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_235">r i = b i log(1 + cB m γ i /b i ),<label>(9.5)</label></formula><p>where γ i = p i /q i is the SIR across the total bandwidth B m , and B m γ i /b i is the boosted SIR for MS i on resource b i . Orthogonalization of MSs within the same cell requires an additional constraint that σ i =k b i ≤ B m . The following optimization problem is thus formulated:</p><formula xml:id="formula_236">maximize i U i (r i ) subject to r i = b i log(1 + cB m γ i (p)/b i ), ∀i σ i =k b i ≤ B m , ∀k variables r, γ, p, b.<label>(9.6)</label></formula><p>It can be verified that r i is a concave function of b i . Under assumptions that U i (r i ) is concave in r i , and, in addition, concave in log(γ i ), problem (9.6) is a convex optimization problem whose Lagrangian is</p><formula xml:id="formula_237">L({γ i }, {b i }, {ν i }, {λ k }) = i U i (r i ) + i ν i (p m i -p i (γ)) + k λ k   B m - i∈S k b i   .

The optimality of Equation (9.9) is established by the following lemma. Lemma 9.1. For U i (r i ) = log(r i ), problem (9.6) is a convex optimization problem and satisfies Equation (9.9) at optimality. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">9</ref>.1 plots the trend of power and bandwidth allocation against spillage and interference at optimality. The points are obtained by solving the KKT equations above. Note that both power and bandwidth allocation decreases with increasing spillage in the optimal allocation. This confirms the intuition that spillage acts as a measure of potential interference to the network, as discussed in Section 4. Distributed algorithm for this problem has not appeared yet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3">Joint PC and Time Scheduling</head><p>One of the key functionalities of power control, and indeed the one that most of this survey has been focusing on, is interference management.</p><p>Since both schedules and powers are degrees of freedom that help manage interference, we need to investigate their joint control.</p><p>A simple view is to extend the basic power control models, both power minimization (for fixed SIR) and utility maximization (for variable SIR), by incorporating a new boolean variable ξ i ∈ {0, 1}, indicating whether MS i is scheduled to transmit or not. This would be similar to the model of joint power control and BS assignment, leading to a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem.</p><p>Assuming that the timescale of scheduling is shorter than the coherent time, another possible formulation would be similar to joint power control and bandwidth allocation with interference spread, as discussed in the last section, except now bandwidth chunk would be replaced by the fraction of time allocated to each MS.</p><p>However, neither of the above formulations completely captures the essence of joint power control and scheduling. All power control formulations surveyed so far assume that the objective is defined for the equilibrium state, therefore must activate all users in its power control solutions, for otherwise those users allocated with zero transmit power will be disconnected from the network. To properly study joint power control and scheduling, a generalization of such formulations to allow limit cycles, rather than a single point, at the equilibrium, is necessary.</p><p>On the other hand, on the topic of scheduling, existing research literature often assumes the M -hop collision model, which does not take into account the fact that received SIR determines the amount of interference, nor the opportunity of varying transmit powers jointly with scheduling to increase stability region and the attained utility.</p><p>Both scheduling problem formulations (without power control) and power control problem formulations (without scheduling) are incomplete. They represent two sides of one common issue, one by deciding when a subset of MSs can transmit and the other by changing the power with which MSs can transmit. Their unification remains an open problem. Starting with the scheduling part of the problem, SIR based interference model often leads to NP-hard problems. Starting with the power control part of the problem, neither convexity of power-controlled rate region nor distributed convexification are well-understood. This overdue union between power control and scheduling presents fundamental research challenges, and is briefly discussed in this section from the point of view of power control.</p><p>Intuitively, power control should be carried out among users who do not interfere too much (due to weak interference channel or small values of maximum power), and time scheduling enforced among heavilyinterferred users. Separation of scheduling and power control is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108]</ref>. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> proposes a centralized link scheduling algorithm that minimizes the power required to achieve a set of data rates that can potentially lie outside the instantaneous rate region but within the convex hull of the rate region. The authors make a low SIR approximation and assume that the data rate is linearly related to the SIR. In the resulting schedule, links either switch off or transmit with maximum power. An extension in <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> removes the low SIR approximation, resulting in additional complexity in the centralized solution. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> proposes a heuristic for link scheduling in each time-slot, followed by the DPC algorithm for explicit rate requirements.</p><p>There are two major challenges in fully understanding the joint control of power and scheduling:</p><p>(1) When is power control adequate without time-sharing? (2) If power control alone is inadequate, how should MSs be scheduled?</p><p>To answer these questions, an analysis of the convexity property of the rate regions attained by power control algorithms is needed, and a scheduling algorithm activating or silencing MSs in the right pattern is required when the power-controlled rate region is non-convex.</p><p>Here, the word "adequate" may be quantified by the optimality gap with respect to an objective function, e.g., cost function of power or utility function of rate. It is also often quantified by the size of stability region attained by an algorithm. Roughly speaking, when there are stochastic arrivals and departures of users, each carrying a finite workload, stability region is the set of arrivals that can be served by the system while keeping the queues finite. As mentioned in Section 1.1, stochastic arrivals will not be discussed in this survey due to space limitation, except below.</p><p>Consider some functional dependence of rate on SIR, e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_240">r i (γ i ) = d log(1 + cγ i ). (<label>9.10)</label></formula><p>The instantaneous rate region R(Γ) is defined as the set of feasible rates in any time-frequency resource:</p><formula xml:id="formula_241">R(Γ) = {r i : r i = r i (γ i ), γ ∈ Γ},<label>(9.11)</label></formula><p>where Γ is the feasible SIR region introduced in Sections 1 and 4. In particular, it is possible that Γ = B(p m ) or Γ = B(q m ), depending upon the constraints. Let x i denote the traffic arrival rate for MS i, assumed time independent for simplicity of exposition. If MS i is served rate r i [t] in slot t, then the queue for traffic intended for MS i, denoted by y i [t], evolves as</p><formula xml:id="formula_242">y i [t + 1] = [y i [t] -r i [t]] + + x i , (<label>9.12)</label></formula><p>where the time-slot is assumed to be of unit length for simplicity. Let X be the stability region. It is well known that X = Conv(R) where Conv(R) is the convex-hull of the instantaneous rate region R. One of the possible formulations of this is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_243">maximize i U i (x i ) subject to x ∈ X = Conv(R(Γ))</formula><p>variables x, γ. <ref type="bibr">(9.13)</ref> This problem is considered in a number of papers both in the cellular setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110]</ref> as well as the ad hoc network setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">161,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. The problem can be split for each time instant t into a rate control problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_244">x i [t] = arg max{U i (x i ) -y i [t]x i } (9.14)</formula><p>a queue update as given in (9.12), and a resource scheduling problem given by maximize</p><formula xml:id="formula_245">i y i [t]r i (γ i ) subject to γ ∈ Γ variables γ. (9.15)</formula><p>The queues {y i [t]} evolve over time and problem (9.15) is to be solved in every time-slot t with the resulting x i [t] converging to the optimal of problem (9.13). The queues have the interpretation of prices for the rate control problem, and the terms prices and queues are used interchangeably in the rest of the section. Most of the work on power-control based interference model either make the "high-SIR" approximation where log(1 + cγ i ) ≈ log(cγ i ), which immediately renders R = Conv(R), or explicitly assume that R is convex, in which case again R = Conv(R). If the underlying instantaneous rate region R given by a power control algorithm is convex, then all MSs are allowed to participate in data transmission in every time-frequency resource and the power control algorithm can find the appropriate power levels to maximize the weighted rates. Distributed solutions with this simplification is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">185]</ref>. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> develops the geometric programming framework of high SIR and successive GP approximation for general SIR regime. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185]</ref> tackles problem (9.15) under the high-SIR approximation. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> can be applied to solve <ref type="bibr">(9.15)</ref> if R is assumed to be convex.</p><p>However, if R is non-convex, there has been no distributed mechanism that determines the set of MSs allowed to participate in data transmission in each time-slot and then determine the power levels of transmission among the activated MSs. Intuitively, an appropriate time sharing mechanism silences links whose queues are relatively small and whose activation would contribute adversely to the achievable rates of other links with relatively larger queues.</p><p>In the rest of this section, we will discuss an initial attempt to answer question (2) posed above, through a heuristic based on Algorithm LSPC in Section 4.

The factors β i are the silencing threshold. Low values of β i will prevent appropriate silencing and result in a set of data rates closer to the non-convex instantaneous rate region, and high values of β i will result in too many links being unnecessarily turned off, lowering the overall network utility. Determining the appropriate values of β i remains an open problem.</p></div>

It is apparent that optimizing over all resources jointly results in more efficient utilization of the resources but leads to increased complexity of implementation. Considering joint optimization of several resources together may also give the system designer insight into the tradeoff involved among the resources to achieve a target value for the objective function. One such joint optimization is formulated in this section.</p><p>Consider the case where each BS is equipped with M transmit antennas as in Section 7 and the total available bandwidth B m is split up into L orthogonal resources {b l }. The N users build up queues {y i [t]} according to (9.12).

A solution to this problem will be highly instructive to a system designer trading off resources in time, frequency, space, and power. Now consider a simplification of problem (9.16), where queue evolution and time-domain scheduling are removed from consideration, and interference spreading mentioned in Section 9.2.2 is used in frequency-domain. The utility maximization problem becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_253">maximize i U i (r i ) subject to r i = b i log(1 + B m γ i /b i ), ∀i j:σ j =k b j = B m , ∀k γ i ≤ SIR i (W, p), ∀i p ≤ p m variables γ, r, W, b, p.<label>(9.17)</label></formula><p>MSs within a cell are allocated orthogonal bandwidth resources so that each MS suffers only inter-cell interference, and beamforming in space is used to reduce the inter-cell interference. This joint optimization is still a globally coupled, non-convex problem, difficult to solve optimally or distributedly. However, the following approach to the solution is intuitively appealing. First, fixing the bandwidth allocation, the problem of jointly optimizing over receiver beamforming and transmit power can be solved by a distributed algorithm as in Section 7.3, which is proved to be convergent. Next, as shown in Section 9.2.2, the joint power-bandwidth optimization with fixed beamforming vectors is a convex optimization problem. Finally, an alternating maximization method is used to combine these two algorithms and shown to be convergent.</p></div>

For example, since bandwidth is a scarce resource in a wireless cellular network, a large cost function should be associated with the total bandwidth usage, whereas smaller costs are assigned to power and number of antennas. This choice of costs would result in a resource bundle of {B m = 1 MHz, p m = 5, M = 4}, in which the total bandwidth usage has been minimized. This is in contrast to a different resource bundle of {W = 4.37 MHz, p m = 1, M = 1} lying on the same tradeoff surface, where number of antennas and transmit power has been minimized.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1">Introduction</head><p>Power control mechanisms have played an important role in the success of most digital cellular systems. Power control offers substantial benefits for the efficient and fair operation of the cellular system, supports QoS adaptations like rate control, and yet the basic power control algorithms involve feedback with as few as 1-bit and are simple to implement. These motivate most cellular systems to incorporate power control in the physical layer specification of the standard. In this concluding section of the survey, we present selection of the implementations of this algorithms in previous sections in operational networks, including those listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">10</ref>.1. Power control implementations in cellular systems often consist of open-loop power control (OLPC) and closed-loop power control (CLPC). OLPC is a simple scheme that allows the transmitter to optimally select the transmit power by exploiting the similarity of the uplink and downlink channel in properties including distancedependent attenuation and frequency-independent slow fading. For asymmetric channel properties like fast fading, a CLPC scheme, as discussed in Section 2, will have to be implemented. CLPC schemes are more expensive to implement and are most beneficial in the uplink communication or for a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) system where uplink and downlink are on different frequencies and the channel on the two links are uncorrelated with respect to fast fading. Time Division Duplex (TDD) systems, on the other hand, see correlated channel on the uplink and downlink even for fast fading and can adjust the transmit power on either link by directly measuring the receiver power and channel quality on the other link. As such, CLPC tends to be prevalent in the uplinks of FDD systems and less so in the downlink or the TDD systems. Typically, tolerance levels for OLPC is in the range 9-12 dB and tolerance levels for CLPC in the range 1-2 dB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2">Power Control in 2G Networks</head><p>Early digital cellular systems are typically referred to as 2G systems to set them apart from 1G analog cellular systems. The 2G systems were primarily designed for voice traffic which is generated at a fixed bit rate, and the power control mechanisms were geared toward targeting a fixed SIR, determined by the quality of voice that needs to be supported.</p><p>Qualcomm proposed an OLPC scheme for a CDMA based cellular system where the transmit power is set inversely proportional to the received power <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>. The OLPC scheme was augmented by a CLPC scheme where the receive powers were equalized through a 1-bit feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. This power control solution to the near-far problem was instrumental in enabling the success of CDMA networks.</p><p>More recent CLPC algorithms implement a discretized version of the DPC algorithm where the feedback from the BS is limited to a finite number of bits, and the transmit power at the MS is altered by a fixed step-size update based on the feedback. The feedback is typically 1-bit or 2-bits, and represents either an increment or decrement of the power level rather than the absolute power level. For example, a 1-bit power control feedback with a step-size of δ dB increases the transmit power by δ dB if the feedback is "0" and decreases the transmit power if the feedback is "1." It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> that this CLPC implementation converges to within 2δ dB of the SIR target. A 2-bit feedback (more precisely, a 3-level or a 1.5-bit feedback) either increases or decreases the transmit power level by δ dB or maintains the transmit power at the same level based on the feedback. The result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> shows that the 3-level feedback converges to within δ dB of the SIR target.</p><p>The feedback frequency presents a tradeoff between power-control overhead and the doppler tolerance. For example, it is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> that the number of users in an IS-95 sector that can be supported drops by 25% when the doppler changes from 25 Hz to 50 Hz at a power control update rate of 800 per second. The step-size choice presents a tradeoff between doppler tolerance, robustness, and spectral efficiency. Typically, higher doppler requires larger step-size to be able to track the fast fades. An approximate but useful calculation of doppler tolerance levels based on CLPC feedback rate and step-size parameters is as follows.</p><p>If feedback is at the rate of F updates every second and the step-size is δ dB, then a Rayleigh fade of upto 30 dB requires 30/(F δ) seconds to bring the power level back to the nominal. This implies that the channel coherence time can be no less than 30/(F δ) seconds or equivalently doppler level no more than F δ/30 Hz. However, larger step-sizes result in more SIR variation in steady state and larger variations when dopplers exceed what can be supported. Therefore, step-sizes needs to be chosen with care.</p><p>CLPC is an important component of the CDMA based IS-95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref> system where neighboring sectors use the same frequency. It helps in minimizing inter-sector interference and enabling frequency reuse of one. In addition, MSs in the same sector of an IS-95 system are not orthogonal on the uplink since it is prohibitively expensive to maintain CDMA chip-level synchronization among MSs. CLPC ensures that the MSs closer to the BS do not swamp out the MSs further away from the BS. The CLPC scheme on the uplink in IS-95 uses 1-bit feedback at the rate of 800 every second. The power control update is in steps of 1 dB with choices of smaller steps allowed in later revisions of the standard. On the downlink, CLPC is less important since the downlink signals emanating from the same BS are orthogonal, and as such the feedback rate is once every 20 ms reporting a frame error in 1-bit.</p><p>The GSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> based 2G standard is an orthogonal scheme where the MSs within a sector are allocated a separate time and frequency slot for both uplink and downlink. Maintaining orthogonality between MSs of the same sector implies that the time-frequency resource for each MS is limited and the SIR requirement for voice communication is higher in comparison to IS-95. This rules out frequency reuse of one in GSM systems. The reduction of inter-sector interference due to higher than one frequency re-use factor and the reduction of intra-cell interference due to orthogonality of MSs within a sector imply that the need for CLPC in GSM standard is less in comparison to IS-95. As such, GSM implements a CLPC scheme both on the uplink and on downlink with updates every 480 ms based on two parameters referred to as "RxLev" and "RxQual." The "RxLev" is the receive power level and the "RxQual" is the receive signal quality in terms of SIR or BER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.3">Power Control and Scheduling in 3G/4G Networks</head><p>In addition to voice, the 3G and 4G cellular systems support data of varying rates and QoS needs. Rather than formulating power control as a fixed SIR feasibility problem, SIR assignment and power control need to be jointly designed as in Section 4. The time and frequency allocation for each MS, unlike the case in a 2G system, is not static but depends on the traffic arrivals, channel conditions, and QoS classes. Scheduling refers to allocation of time and frequency slots to the MSs, as discussed in detail in Section 9. Power control determines the transmit power allocated to the links. Power control and scheduling are therefore done in conjunction in 3G systems to maximize the efficiency of the system.</p><p>The time and frequency resources are split into chunks that form the time-frequency slabs. For each time-frequency slab, the scheduling algorithm decides the set of MSs that are allowed to participate in data transmission in that slab, and the power control part determines the data rate of transmission by allocating appropriate power levels to the participating MSs through a power-control algorithm. The ultimate objective, whether stabilizing queues resulting from a set of arrivals or maximizing network-wide criteria, is realized through both scheduling and rate selection through power control.</p><p>The scheduling mechanism requires a control channel over which the allocation of the MSs for a given time-frequency slot is indicated to the MSs. This overhead is an important factor to consider in the design of the scheduler. If the traffic pattern over the links is predictable, then it might be beneficial to pre-allocate the time-frequency resources and reduce the overhead associated with an explicit scheduler implementation. Such a system is then an unscheduled system supporting more uniform data rates in comparison to a scheduled system. For example, the 1xEVDO system is a scheduled system on the downlink but an unscheduled system on the uplink. An unscheduled system is still designed to support different data rates according to the traffic requirements but would be efficient only in supporting uniform data rates.</p><p>An important factor that determines the total uplink capacity in commercial networks is the interference limit q m , often stated in terms of IOT and ROT factors that were discussed in Section 1. The IOT limits bound the interference to the cell ensuring stability of rate allocation on the uplink, as well as the power required for new mobiles to access the network. Typical IOT values in commercial networks range from 3 to 10 dB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.3.1">1xEVD0 Rel0 and RevA</head><p>The 1xEVDO Rel0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and RevA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> are CDMA based 3G systems that implement a scheduled downlink and an unscheduled uplink. On the downlink, the transmit power is fixed and the rate of transmission is adapted according to the interference experienced by the MS. No power control is employed. The long-term data rates depend upon the fraction of time-frequency slabs scheduled to each MS.</p><p>The uplink, however, is unscheduled and relies on power control to achieve a required data rate. Two independent control mechanisms together determine the uplink data rate as explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>First is the basic power control that measures the received SIR on pilot signals transmitted by the MS and feeds back 1-bit power up-downs. Rel0 uses a feedback rate of 600 Hz with step-size of 1 dB. The pilot channel transmit power is determined entirely by this powercontrol loop. The traffic channel transmit power is expressed in relation to the pilot channel transmit power and is referred to as the Traffic-to-Pilot Power (T2P). The data rate on the traffic channel has a one-to-one relationship, with T2P with higher rates requiring higher T2P.</p><p>The second control mechanism determines the data rate of transmission. Each BS measures the interference level and sets a control bit referred to as the "Reverse Activity Bit" (RAB) if the level is beyond a certain threshold. The MS maintains an "active set" of BSs that it can detect with some strength including the serving BS. The RAB-bit from any one of the BSs causes the MS to backoff its current data rate with a certain probability. If no RAB-bit is detected to be set, then the MS increases the data rate with a certain probability. The RAB-bits are fed back at the rate of 37.5 Hz. The probabilities are set to values dependent on the desired interference level and can be set on each MS to satisfy QoS requirements. Since the supported data rates are not a continuum of values but take some discrete values based on the chosen code rate and modulation, the T2P is discrete and the interference tends to be bursty.</p><p>The uplink in RevA is an improvement over that of Rel0. Higher data rates are defined, supporting a larger range of data rates, and hybrid ARQ is introduced, making effective use of any T2P and providing a contiguous set of data rates. The MS decreases and increases the T2P by deterministic amounts based on whether the RAB bit is set or not. The T2P and the hybrid ARQ-induced latency requirement for the traffic determine the rate of transmission. The RAB bit is transmitted more frequently in RevA, at the rate of 600 Hz, and hybrid ARQ allows a continuum of T2P, making the interference less bursty with RevA in comparison to Rel0. Indeed, the RevA uplink is two to three fold more efficient in comparison to Rel0 uplink as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.3.2">Flash-OFDM</head><p>The Flash-OFDM system <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref> is based on OFDM modulation with orthogonality among MSs within the same cell maintained by allocating different tones to different MSs. The orthogonality among MSs removes intra-cellular interference, improving the range of attainable SIRs. Maintaining orthogonality among MSs is easier in OFDM than in CDMA since the MSs have to match their timing alignment with the BS only upto the cyclic prefix inserted in the OFDM symbol. However, this gain in SIR due to removal of intra-cellular interference comes at the expense of the extra resource occupied by the cyclic prefix.</p><p>Another advantage of the timing alignment of the MSs within a cell in an OFDM system is that it opens up the possibility of having a scheduled uplink. The true advantages of a scheduler should be evaluated in terms of the overhead carrying information of the assignment of the MSs to the time-slots and the benefits offered by a scheduler in managing various traffic arrival patterns. The Flash-OFDM system is a scheduled downlink and uplink system. Similar to the 1xEVDO systems, the Flash-OFDM system has the MS transmitting pilots that are power-controlled to a given SIR target. The traffic channel transmit power is not determined by the MS directly. Instead, the MSs report to the BS a quantity similar to the "spillage" as explained in Section 4. The uplink scheduling algorithm at the BS picks MSs that can transmit in any given time-frequency slab and indicates the maximum T2P that each scheduled MS can use in the time-frequency slab. The MS then picks a data rate that can be supported within the maximum T2P that it gets from the BS.</p><p>The Flash-OFDM network is the first network with a scheduled uplink with the power control and rate selection, based partly on the optimization framework presented in Section 4.3.2. Time is slotted into units of 1.4 ms with a power-control feedback expected every slot. Scheduling decision is made every time-slot about the set of MSs that will participate in data transmission in that slot and the rate at which the MSs transmit. This gives the scheduler flexibility in catering to various traffic patterns and QoS requirements. However, power control feedback at the same rate as the scheduling decision and the possible fluctuation in transmit power of MSs due to scheduling decisions can potentially destabilize the system. The Flash-OFDM system implements a simple rule derived from the results in Section 4.3.2 to maintain stability. If L k is the load-budget allocated to BS k, then every timeslot the BS schedules a set of users such that i s i γ i &lt; L k , where s i is the spillage reported by MS i and γ i is the SIR corresponding to the intended rate allocation. With this rule and with a suitable averaging of the interference used in rate allocation, it can be shown that the Flash-OFDM system maintains a stable uplink with rate allocation close to optimality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.3.3">WiMax</head><p>Power control in the WiMax broadband wireless system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is based on the uplink ranging signal, which is a fixed waveform transmitted by the terminals for the BS to make power and timing corrections. The downlink power corrections, however, are not defined as part of the standard and left to the implementation to be sent down as control data packets. The power control mechanism is expected to support fluctuations of 30 dB per second with depths of at least 10 dB. WiMax defines a scheduled uplink and the BS picks the MSs that can transmit in any given time-frequency slab. The MS maintains the same transmit power level per tone and the total power transmitted depends upon the number of traffic tones transmitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.4">Power Control in WiFi Networks</head><p>The IEEE 802.11 standard defines a wireless local area network (WLAN) that is typically not considered "cellular." However, the most prevalent model of deployment for the WiFi standard is in a mode where the WiFi access terminals (ATs) communicate with an access point (AP), similar to the MSs communicating with a BS in cellular topologies. The 802.11 standard defines a MAC algorithm that involves sensing ongoing transmissions (carrier sense) and exponential backoff to achieve interference free transmission suitable for bursty data with small packets. The increasing spread of such networks requiring support of large packet streaming video kind of traffic demands improvements in the MAC protocol. Power control can result in significant improvement to the performance of the network both by reducing the overall power consumption of the ATs and reducing the interference level and thereby increasing the data rates.</p><p>Researchers have attempted to improve WLAN performance with such traffic by proposing various MAC layer schemes that can be implemented on top of the PHY layer. One such mechanism is for the receiver to send back the power level of data transmission in a control channel at the maximum power, in response to intention of data transmission indicated by the transmitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>. However, transmitting data and control channel at different power levels results in inefficient operation in an unplanned spread of APs. Improvements to this scheme were suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> to get around the problem by occasionally transmitting data at the maximum power to prevent neighboring APs from taking over the channel. Further improvements to the 802.11 standard are currently under discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.5">Open Issues</head><p>The 3G cellular data systems mostly designed power control based on principles developed for the 2G networks, often retaining the assumption of a fixed date rate demand, and sometimes leveraging joint SIR assignment and power control. As cellular data and multimedia transmission become more prevalent in mobile applications, the expectation is that the data rate demands will have a higher dynamic range both among users and in time domain. It becomes important for the industry to adopt techniques for admission control as discussed in Section 3, for better power allocation under channel variation as discussed in Section 5, for joint power control and beamforming design in cells equipped with multiple antennas as discussed in Section 7, for joint power control and BS allocation as discussed in Section 8, and for joint power control and time-frequency allocation as discussed in Section 9.</p><p>For example, the Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) scheme proposed in the design of Universal Mobile Broadband <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the next generation mobile broadband system from the 3GPP group, is an effort to revisit the joint power control and frequency allocation design. The available bandwidth is sub-divided into multiple sub-bands, with frequency-hopping restricted to within the sub-band. This allows the power allocation to be varied in different sub-bands. The envisioned use of the sub-bands is static allocation of powers to result in frequency reuse of 1 in some sub-bands and higher frequency reuse in other sub-bands. Dynamic power allocation across sub-bands in response to varying QoS demands remains an open issue that demands an answer to problems in Section 9.4. As the general industry trend continues toward scheduled allocation of time and frequency resources, an efficient way to implement a solution to Problem 9.13 in Section 9 is required. Since it is desirable to have network architectures that preclude centralized Base Station Controllers, a distributed solution to Problem 9.13 that only requires BS MS message passing would be even better.</p><p>Indeed, most of the open problems in power control discussed in Sections 2-9 are clearly motivated by the needs of operational wireless cellular networks. Their solutions would require new modeling techniques, theoretical advances, and mathematical machinery, which will in turn help push the cellular technology as in the last 15 years of this research area.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1. 3 Fig. 1 . 1</head><label>311</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.1 An example of a multi-cellular network and uplink transmission.</figDesc><graphic coords="9,175.57,141.13,261.90,259.97" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Joint PC and Beamforming</head><p>Starting with this section, we will incorporate additional degrees of freedom that work together with power control (PC) in cellular networks. These include multi-antenna beamforming in this section, BS assignment in the next section, and bandwidth allocation and scheduling in Section 9. With non-convexity and more coupling in their formulations, these joint optimization problems present new challenges to the design of optimal and distributed algorithms.</p></div>
