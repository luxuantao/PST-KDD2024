Due to the high UAV altitude, the channels between UAVs and the ground base stations (GBSs) are dominated by the strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, which brings both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, a UAV can communicate with a large number of GBSs at the same time, leading to a higher macro-diversity gain as compared to terrestrial users. However, on the other hand, severe interference may be generated to/from the GBSs in the uplink/downlink, which renders the interference management with coexisting terrestrial and aerial users a more challenging problem to solve. To deal with the above new trade-off, this paper studies the uplink communication from a multi-antenna UAV to a set of GBSs in its signal coverage region. Among these GBSs, we denote available GBSs as the ones that do not serve any terrestrial users at the assigned resource block (RB) of the UAV, and occupied GBSs as the rest that are serving their respectively associated terrestrial users in the same RB. We propose a new cooperative interference cancellation strategy for the multibeam UAV uplink communication, which aims to eliminate the co-channel interference at each of the occupied GBSs and in the meanwhile maximize the sum-rate to the available GBSs. Specifically, the multi-antenna UAV sends multiple data streams to selected available GBSs, which in turn forward their decoded data streams to their backhaul-connected occupied GBSs for interference cancellation. To draw useful insights and facilitate our proposed design, the maximum degrees-of-freedom (DoF) achievable by the multi-beam UAV communication for sum-rate maximization in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is first characterized, subject to the stringent constraint that all the occupied GBSs do not suffer from any interference in the UAV's uplink transmission. Then, based on the DoF-optimal design, the achievable sum-rate at finite SNR is maximized, subject to given maximum allowable interference power constraints at each of the occupied GBSs. Numerical examples validate the DoF and sum-rate performance of our proposed designs, as compared to benchmark schemes with fully cooperative, local or no interference cancellation at the GBSs.</p><p>Index Terms-Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), multi-beam</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones have found a wide range of applications in package delivery, video surveillance, remote sensing, aerial communication platform, and many others, thanks to their flexible deployment and high mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. To embrace the upcoming era of "internet-ofdrones", it is imperative to enable high-performance communications between UAVs and their ground users/pilots. Specifically, UAVs need to receive real-time control and command signals from the ground with high reliability to guarantee their operation safety, as well as to deliver missionrelated payload data (e.g., high-resolution images/videos) to the ground with high rate. However, most UAVs in the current market communicate with the ground via simple point-to-point links over the unlicensed spectrum, which can only operate in the visual line-of-sight (VLoS) range and result in limited performance and security. To overcome this issue, a promising solution is cellular-enabled UAV communication, which leverages the ground base stations (GBSs) in cellular networks for realizing high-performance UAV-ground communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Compared to the existing approach, cellular-enabled UAV communication enables beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLoS) UAV communications with the ground users, and is envisioned to yield tremendous performance enhancement with today's mature cellular technology.</p><p>Compared to traditional terrestrial users, UAVs possess dramatically distinct wireless channel characteristics with the GBSs. Different from the terrestrial channels that typically experience more significant attenuation over distance, shadowing and multi-path fading, the UAV-GBS channel is generally dominated by the strong line-of-sight (LoS) link due to the high altitude of UAVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Hence, UAVs in general have better channel conditions with much more GBSs as compared to terrestrial users, which brings both opportunities and challenges to cellular communications. On one hand, the more available macro-diversity in association with GBSs can be exploited to enhance the UAV communication performance in terms of reliability and throughput by connecting to the GBS with the best channel at each time instant <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> or multiple GBSs at the same time, especially when the UAVs have multiple antennas. On the other hand, for the aerial and terrestrial users that simultaneously use the same time-frequency resource 1536-1276 (c) 2019 IEEE.

See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.  block (RB), which is defined as the smallest unit of resources that can be allocated to a user by 3GPP, severe co-channel interference also occurs which may degrade significantly the communication performance of UAVs in the downlink as well as terrestrial users in the uplink <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>To resolve the above fundamental trade-off in cellularenabled UAV communication, we consider in this paper a new multi-beam UAV communication scenario in the cellular uplink, where each of the flying multi-antenna UAVs sends multiple data streams to its associated GBSs over a given RB assigned. We assume that different UAVs are assigned with different RBs to avoid mutual interference. As a result, this paper only focuses on the performance of one particular UAV at its assigned RB, while the results can be applied to the other UAVs in the same manner. Moreover, we consider the UAV communication performance at one time slot and at a given location, while the results are applicable to all the time slots and UAV locations over its entire flight duration. To summarize, without loss of generality, this paper mainly studies the multi-beam transmission scheme with one UAV in the network, which is assumed to be static in the considered time slot, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. By exploiting the macrodiversity, the multi-beam communication can help significantly improve the spectral efficiency for the UAVs to meet their high-rate payload data transmission requirement in the uplink. We divide the GBSs in the UAV's signal coverage region into two groups: occupied GBSs each already having an associated terrestrial user to communicate in the same RB as the UAV, and available GBSs which do not serve any terrestrial users in the uplink over this RB. Then, we aim to design the transmit beamforming at the UAV to deliver its messages to a selected set of available GBSs to maximize its uplink sum-rate, while in the meanwhile suppressing the interference caused to the occupied GBSs for protecting their terrestrial user communications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Prior Work</head><p>Recently, the UAV uplink communication has appealed a lot of attention in the literature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technique is employed at the GBS side to mitigate the interference between multiple UAVs in the uplink communications. However, interference control to the terrestrial communications is not considered in these works. On the other hand, some initial field tests have pointed out the severe interference generated to the terrestrial communications from the aerial users in the cellular uplink <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, these works do not propose new solutions to deal with this interference issue.</p><p>Despite the lack of studies on our considered UAV communication system in the cellular uplink, effective interference control strategies have been widely studied in the literature for terrestrial communications, including cognitive beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, coordinated multipoint (CoMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, etc. An important but unaddressed question is whether these schemes can be applied to our considered system with both aerial and terrestrial users.</p><p>First, our considered system shares similarity with the cognitive radio (CR) network, in which a secondary user utilizes the transmit spectrum originally allocated to the existing primary users for communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In these works, beamforming design at the secondary user is optimized to maximize its transmit rate under the constraint that the interference seen by each primary receiver is no larger than a threshold known as "interference temperature". However, the above cognitive beamforming strategy may be ineffective in our considered multi-beam UAV communication in cellular uplink. This is because due to the large frequency reuse factor in today's cellular networks as well as the LoSdominant UAV-ground links, the number of occupied GBSs may practically far exceed the number of antennas at the UAV, which yields limited or even zero degrees-of-freedom (DoF) for the UAV's multi-beam uplink communication after projecting the beamspace to the orthogonal space of all the occupied GBSs' channels. As a result, the spatial multiplexing gain of the multi-beam transmission cannot be realized, even when the number of available GBSs is large.</p><p>On the other hand, CoMP can significantly improve the DoF of the system by leveraging the cooperations between different GBSs. For example, in cloud radio access network (C-RAN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a set of GBSs are connected to a central processor via the fronthaul links. By a joint decoding over the signals received at all the GBSs, the maximum DoF can be achieved assuming perfect fronthaul links. However, CoMP requires substantial overheads over the backhaul/fronthaul links as the received signals at all GBSs (both occupied and available in our considered system) need to be quantized and transmitted. Moreover, since multi-hop routing is in general necessary, CoMP inevitably introduces a long delay for information decoding, making it not suitable for delay-sensitive UAV applications.</p><p>To summarize, due to the unique feature of the multibeam UAV communication in cellular uplink, i.e., a large number of (available and occupied) GBSs are in the UAV's signal coverage region, the existing interference management strategies for terrestrial communications cannot be directly used in our considered system, and innovative solutions are needed to tackle this challenge. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Main Contributions</head><p>The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>First, to harvest the gain of cooperative decoding but with low implementation cost and low delay, we propose a novel cooperative interference cancellation strategy, by exploiting the existing backhaul connections between adjacent GBSs, e.g., Xhaul <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, in cellular networks. Specifically, we first select a subset of the available GBSs, each for decoding one data stream sent from the UAV; then, we let these GBSs forward the decoded messages to their backhaul-connected occupied GBSs for the latter to cancel the UAV's interference. In this regard, for each data stream sent by the UAV, the number of occupied GBSs that still require interference nulling via cognitive beamforming at the UAV is significantly reduced. As a result, more data streams can be transmitted under the interference temperature constraints of the occupied GBSs as compared to the cognitive beamforming. Moreover, this scheme merely requires backhaul connections between adjacent GBSs, and is more practically appealing as compared to the CoMP strategy.</p><p>Next, due to the typical high-SNR communication links between the UAV and GBSs resulting from the strong LoSdominant channels as well as for drawing useful insights, we first provide a DoF analysis for the considered multi-beam UAV uplink communication system with GBSs' cooperative interference cancellation. Specifically, we derive the maximum achievable DoF with our proposed strategy for UAV's sum-rate maximization subject to the stringent constraint on no harmful interference to existing terrestrial uplink communications, by jointly optimizing the number of independent data streams sent by the UAV as well as their associated available GBSs. We also present a zero-forcing (ZF) based transmit beamforming design to achieve the maximum DoF. It is shown analytically that our strategy can achieve higher DoF compared to the cognitive beamforming strategy.</p><p>Furthermore, this paper also considers the UAV sum-rate maximization problem at the finite SNR regime, under the interference temperature constraints for protecting the occupied GBSs. Utilizing the DoF-optimal data stream association solution, we reveal that our considered system reduces to a multi-group multicast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and thus the existing beamforming design for sum-rate maximization in the broadcast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> cannot be applied. Nevertheless, this paper proposes an efficient beamforming design algorithm based on the successive convex approximation technique for solving the formulated problem locally optimally. Numerical results are provided to show the significant sum-rate gain over the cognitive beamforming strategy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>In this section, we introduce the system model. The key parameters which will be used throughout the paper are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, we consider the uplink communication in a cellular network consisting of one UAV equipped with M ≥ 1 antennas and N GBSs in the UAV's signal coverage region denoted by the set N = {1, • • • , N }. We assume that each GBS has a fixed beam pattern for the aerial user, thus can be equivalently viewed as being equipped with one single antenna for the purpose of exposition. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The general case of multi-antenna GBSs with flexible three-dimensional (3D) beamforming will be considered in future work.</p><p>Denote h n ∈ C M ×1 as the effective uplink channel vector from the UAV to GBS n, n = 1, • • • , N ; and h n,m as the channel coefficient from the mth antenna of the UAV to GBS n such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h n = [h n,1 , • • • , h n,M ] H .</formula><p>In this paper, we consider that the UAV is at a fixed location (e.g., when hovering), where d n in meters (m) denotes the distance from the UAV to GBS n. Moreover, we consider the Rician fading channel model, and the channel from the UAV to GBS n is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h n = √ τ 0 d 2 n ( √ λ λ + 1 ĥn + √ 1 λ + 1 hn ) , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where τ 0 denotes the channel power gain at the reference distance</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d 0 = 1 m; ĥn = [ ĥn,1 , • • • , ĥn,M ] T ∈ C M ×1 with | ĥn,m | = 1, m = 1, • • • , M , denotes the LoS channel component; hn ∈ C M ×1</formula><p>with hn ∼ CN (0, I) denotes the Rayleigh fading channel component; and λ ≥ 0 is the Rician factor specifying the power ratio between the LoS and Rayleigh fading components in h n . Note that under the above Rician fading channel model, the channel vectors between the multi-antenna UAV and any N ′ , N ′ ≤ min(M, N ), GBSs are linearly independent with probability one. We further assume that all h n 's are known at the UAV. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>The UAV employs the multi-beam scheme to transmit its messages to some selected (available) GBSs at an assigned RB, which is assumed given in this paper; while in practice it can be dynamically assigned in the network. The transmit signal of the UAV is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x = J ∑ j=1 w j s j ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where J denotes the number of independent data streams sent by the UAV, s j ∼ CN (0, 1) denotes the message for the jth data stream, and w j ∈ C M ×1 denotes the transmit beamforming vector for s j . The received signal at the nth GBS at this given RB is thus given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y n = h H n J ∑ j=1 w j s j + S n + z n , n ∈ N , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where S n denotes the received signal from the terrestrial user that is transmitting at the same RB as the UAV in cell n, and z n ∼ CN (0, σ 2 n ) denotes the aggregated noise due to the interference generated by the terrestrial users that are transmitting at the same RB as the UAV in the other cells as well as the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at GBS n. It is worth noting that S n ̸ = 0 if the UAV's RB is used by GBS n to serve a terrestrial user in its cell, and S n = 0 otherwise.</p><p>Suppose that among the N GBSs, N 1 &lt; N GBSs are currently serving their terrestrial users at the same RB as the UAV (denoted as occupied GBSs), while N 2 = N -N 1 GBSs are not using this RB to serve any terrestrial users (denoted as available GBSs). For convenience, we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">N 1 = {1, • • • , N 1 }</formula><p>as the set of N 1 occupied GBSs, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">N 2 = {N 1 + 1, • • • , N } as the set of N 2 available GBSs.</formula><p>In traditional cellular networks with a fixed frequency reuse factor, the occupied GBSs may correspond to those which are assigned the same frequency band for serving some terrestrial users in their associated cells, which contains the sub-band of the RB assigned to the UAV. Then the available GBSs are those assigned with other orthogonal frequency bands and thus can serve the UAV opportunistically without affecting the uplink communications of their own terrestrial users (at different frequency from that of the UAV). As a result, the cellular spectrum can be efficiently utilized to serve the UAV users by exploiting the macro-diversity, provided that the strong interference to the occupied GBSs is effectively mitigated. Notice that this leads to an interesting new cell association strategy for the UAV's uplink communication, where its associated (available) GBSs are simultaneously serving their terrestrial users in other frequency bands, which is in sharp contrast to the conventional cell association of terrestrial users. For example, under the cellular network topology shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, GBSs in the set N 1 = {1, 2, 3} are occupied GBSs assigned with frequency band B 1 , and those in the set N 2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8} are available GBSs assigned with orthogonal bands B 2 , B 3 , etc.</p><p>Since the available GBSs are not using the same RB as the UAV, only the terrestrial users served by the occupied GBSs may generate inter-cell interference to the available GBSs at this particular RB (modeled in z n for n ∈ N 2 given in (3)). In this paper, we assume that such terrestrial interference is almost negligible as compared to the UAV's uplink signal received at each available GBSs due to the longer distance between the terrestrial users and the available GBSs as compared to their associated (occupied) GBSs. As a result, the UAV can opportunistically send its data streams to any available GBSs with negligible interference from terrestrial communications. However, the interference caused by the UAV to the terrestrial uplink communications at the occupied GBSs (as given in (3) for n ∈ N 1 ) is strong and cannot be ignored.</p><p>Since each GBS equivalently has one antenna due to the fixed beam pattern, the UAV can send at most one data stream to each available GBS. Define Λ j ⊆ N 2 as the set of available GBSs that decode s j , j = 1, • • • , J, where Λ j ̸ = ∅, ∀j, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Λ j ∩ Λ i = ∅, ∀i ̸ = j.</formula><p>Then for an available GBS n 2 ∈ Λ j , the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for decoding the jth data stream of the UAV is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">γ n2,j = |h H n2 w j | 2 ∑ i̸ =j |h H n2 w i | 2 + σ 2 n2 , n 2 ∈ Λ j . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>Accordingly, the achievable rate in bits/second/Herz (bps/Hz) for multicasting data stream j to its associated available GBSs is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">R j = min n2∈Λj log 2   1 + |h H n2 w j | 2 ∑ i̸ =j |h H n2 w i | 2 + σ 2 n2    , ∀j. (5)</formula><p>On the other hand, as shown in (3), each occupied GBS n 1 needs to decode the message S n1 sent by its served terrestrial user. Due to the strong LoS channels between the UAV and G-BSs, the UAV should carefully control its interference to each occupied GBS to protect its terrestrial uplink communication. In this paper, we consider that the interference power generated at each occupied GBS n 1 should be no larger than a given interference temperature constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which is denoted by Θ n1 ≥ 0. Note that if the UAV simply leverages the transmit beamforming technique to control the interference at all the occupied GBSs, according to (3), the following conditions need to be satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">J ∑ j=1 |h H n1 w j | 2 ≤ Θ n1 , ∀n 1 ∈ N 1 . (6)</formula><p>However, in our considered system, there may not even exist a feasible beamforming solution to satisfy (6) when ∥w j ∥ &gt; 0, ∀j, and Θ n1 's are sufficiently small. For example, the number of occupied GBSs in practice can be larger than the number of antennas at the UAV due to the LoS channels, i.e., N 1 ≥ M . In the extreme case when the interference from the UAV to the occupied GBSs needs to be totally mitigated, i.e., Θ n1 = 0, ∀n 1 ∈ N 1 , we must have |h H n1 w j | 2 = 0, ∀n 1 , ∀j. With N 1 ≥ M , almost surely there does not exist a feasible nonzero beamforming solution for the UAV to satisfy the above equations. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a new strategy in the next section for more effective air-to-ground interference control such that the interference temperature constraints can be more easily satisfied at the occupied GBSs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. COOPERATIVE INTERFERENCE CANCELLATION</head><p>In this section, we propose a novel cooperative interference cancellation strategy, which can effectively mitigate the interference caused by the uplink multi-beam UAV communication to the uplink terrestrial communications at the occupied GBSs, even in the case when the number of occupied GBSs is large and the interference threshold at each occupied GBS is small. Note that the proposed strategy is motivated by the recent developments of the Xhaul structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> in cellular networks, where adjacent GBSs are connected by the backhaul links such that they can exchange information efficiently.</p><p>Specifically, since each of the available GBSs can opportunistically decode one data stream from the UAV, they can forward their decoded data streams to their connected occupied GBSs over the backhaul links such that these occupied GBSs can cancel the interference caused by the UAV's data streams. For any occupied GBS n 1 ∈ N 1 , define Φ n1 ⊆ N 2 as the set of available GBSs that have one-hop backhaul connections with the occupied GBS n 1 . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> Moreover, define</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Ω n1,j = Φ n1 ∩ Λ j , n 1 ∈ N 1 , j = 1, • • • , J,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>as the set of available GBSs that are connected to the occupied GBS n 1 and can decode the message from the jth data stream, i.e., s j . If Ω n1,j ̸ = ∅, then the available GBSs in Ω n1,j can send the decoded s j to the occupied GBS n 1 via the backhaul links, which then subtracts the interference caused by s j from its received signal (assuming that the corresponding effective channel coefficient h H n1 w j is estimated at GBS n 1 ); otherwise, if Ω n1,j = ∅, then no available GBS can help the occupied GBS n 1 to cancel the interference caused by s j . Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Γ n1 = {j : Ω n1,j = ∅, j = 1, • • • , J}, n 1 ∈ N 1 , (8)</formula><p>as the set of data streams that the occupied GBS n 1 cannot obtain from its connected available GBSs. Then for the occupied GBSs, the received signal model given in (3) reduces to the following form after cooperative interference cancellation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">y n1 = h H n1 ∑ j∈Γn 1 w j s j + S n + z n1 , n 1 ∈ N 1 . (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Therefore, the UAV merely needs to utilize the beamforming technique to control the residual interference caused by the data streams s j 's, ∀j ∈ Γ n1 , such that the following conditions hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">∑ j∈Γn 1 |h H n1 w j | 2 ≤ Θ n1 , ∀n 1 ∈ N 1 . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>The above strategy is referred to as cooperative interference cancellation, since the available GBSs are utilized to forward some decoded messages to their connected occupied GBSs for interference cancellation. Note that to fully utilize the backhaul connections for cooperative interference cancellation, the UAV usually needs to multicast each data stream j to more than one available GBSs denoted by the set Λ j as shown in (3)-( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), whereas in the case without cooperative interference cancellation for the occupied GBSs, it is sufficient to send each data stream to one available GBS only. By comparing ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, it is observed that with the above strategy, the interference temperature constraint is generally easier to be satisfied since</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">∑ j∈Γn 1 |h H n1 w j | 2 ≤ ∑ J j=1 |h H n1 w j | 2 , ∀n 1 .</formula><p>Take the extreme case with zerointerference, i.e., Θ n1 = 0, ∀n 1 , or equivalently, |h H n1 w j | 2 = 0, ∀n 1 , ∀j, as an example. Consider the network topology shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, where we have N 1 = 3, Φ 1 = {4, 5, 6}, Φ 2 = {5, 6, 7}, and Φ 3 = {6, 7, 8}. Suppose that the UAV has M = 2 antennas and its channels to occupied GBSs 1, 2, and 3 are linearly independent with each other (which is true under our considered Rician fading channel model (1)). Without the use of the proposed cooperative interference cancellation strategy, no data stream can be transmitted to the available GBSs without generating any interference to all the three occupied GBSs, since in this case the null space of the space spanned by h 1 , h 2 , and h 3 , which are linearly independent to each other, does not exist. However, with the proposed strategy, at least one data stream can be sent to GBS 6, which then forwards this data stream to occupied GBSs 1, 2, and 3 such that interference cancellation can be performed even without the need of UAV's ZF beamforming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SUM-RATE MAXIMIZATION UNDER INTERFERENCE CONSTRAINTS</head><p>Under the cooperative interference cancellation strategy proposed in Section III, in this paper we aim to maximize the UAV's sum-rate to the available GBSs in the uplink, i.e., ∑ j R j with R j given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, subject to the interference temperature constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. To achieve this goal, we need to jointly design the number of transmit data streams, i.e., J, the designated available GBSs of each data stream j, i.e., Λ j , the corresponding beamforming vector and power allocation for multicasting each data stream j to the available GBSs Λ j , i.e., w j , as well as the multicasting rate for each data stream j, i.e., R j . To summarize, the UAV's sum-rate maximization problem subject to the interference temperature constraints can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">max J,{Λj ,wj ,Rj } J ∑ j=1 R j (11a) s.t. log 2 (1 + γ n2,j ) ≥ R j , ∀n 2 ∈ Λ j , j = 1, • • • , J, (11b) ∑ j∈Γn 1 |h H n1 w j | 2 ≤ Θ n1 , ∀n 1 ∈ N 1 ,<label>(11c)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">Λ j ̸ = ∅, j = 1, • • • , J,<label>(11d)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">Λ j ∩ Λ i = ∅, i, j = 1, • • • , J with i ̸ = j, (<label>11e</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">) J ∑ j=1 ∥w j ∥ 2 ≤ P,<label>(11f)</label></formula><p>where (11b) is due to the definition of multicasting rate given in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), (11c) is the interference temperature constraint to each occupied GBS after (possible) cooperative interference cancellation, (11d) guarantees that each data stream needs to be sent to at least one available GBS, (11e) guarantees that each available GBS can decode one data stream at most, and (11f) guarantees that the total transmit power of the UAV is no larger than a power constraint denoted by P . Note that the above problem can be solved by a central unit, e.g., the closest GBS that is associated with the UAV, which then sends the solution to the UAV for transmission. To solve this problem, the central unit needs to know the backhaul topology, i.e., Γ n 's, the sets of occupied and available GBSs, i.e., N 1 and N 2 , and the channel state information (CSI), i.e., h n 's. In practice, the backhaul topology is fixed, and thus can be assumed to be known by the central unit. On the other hand, the sets of occupied and available GBSs and the CSI may change dynamically. As a result, at the beginning of each time slot, each GBS should send its status information, i.e., whether it is occupied or available, and the CSI with the UAV, to the central unit.</p><p>To find the optimal solution to the above problem, we need to first perform exhaustive search over J, with 1 ≤ J ≤ min(M, N ); and for each given J, we need to conduct an exhaustive search over all the feasible data stream association with the available GBSs Λ j 's; while given any assignment Λ j 's, we need to optimize the beamforming vectors w j 's to maximize the sum-rate of all the UAV's data streams. At last, we select the optimal value of J (and the corresponding optimal data stream association and optimal beamforming vectors) that results in the largest sum-rate. It is known that even with given J and Λ j 's, the sum-rate maximization problem via beamforming optimization is NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. As a result, if we jointly optimize Λ j 's and w j 's directly for each given J, we need to solve an NP-hard beamforming problem for a very large number of times.</p><p>To draw useful insight to our formulated problem and facilitate low-complexity algorithm design, we first study the optimal solution to the above problem in the asymptotic regime when the transmit power of the UAV goes to infinity, i.e., P → ∞. In this case, problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> reduces to the an equivalent DoF maximization problem with ZF constraints. Such an asymptotic analysis enables us to see more clearly the rate gain of the proposed cooperative interference cancellation strategy compared to the benchmark schemes with only local or no interference cancellation at the occupied GBSs, as will be shown in Section V. Moreover, as will be shown in Section VI, based on the obtained DoF-optimal solutions for Λ j 's, we propose an efficient beamforming design for problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> to maximize the sum-rate of the UAV in the finite SNR regime.</p><p>Remark 1: It is worth noting that without the use of cooperative interference cancellation, we can only design the beamforming vectors of the UAV to control its interference to the occupied GBSs as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and maximize its transmission rate to the available GBSs. Such a beamforming design problem has been considered in the CR network where a secondary user aims to maximize its transmission rate over a shared channel with a set of primary users subject to given interference temperature constraints at their receivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. For convenience, we refer to the above scheme as cognitive beamforming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DOF ANALYSIS</head><p>Note that in the high-SNR regime, the DoF is a fundamental of the achievable rate in MIMO communication systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Due to the strong LoS channels between the UAV and GBSs, the high-SNR assumption is practically valid in our considered system. As a result, in this section we study the maximum DoF of the multi-beam UAV uplink communication by our proposed strategy and compare it with that of other techniques such as CoMP/C-RAN and cognitive beamforming. The obtained design that maximizes the DoF will also be useful to our proposed solution for problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> in the finite SNR regime in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Formulation</head><p>The DoF represents the rate of growth for the network capacity with respect to the logarithm of the SNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In our considered system, a DoF of J is achievable if J data streams can be transmitted from the UAV such that each data stream j can be decoded by at least one available GBS, while its interference at the occupied GBSs as well as other available GBSs that decode the other data streams is zero. 4 Under our proposed cooperative interference cancellation strategy, zero interference of s j at any occupied GBS can be achieved by either aligning w j to the null space of this GBS's channel or selecting one of its connected available GBSs to decode s j for interference cancellation. For any data stream j, define</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Ψ j = {n 1 : Φ n1 ∩ Λ j = ∅, n 1 = 1, • • •, N 1 }, j = 1, • • •, J,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>as the set of occupied GBSs that cannot receive this data stream from its connected available GBSs. Then, as P → ∞, problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> reduces to the following DoF maximization problem.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">max J,{Λj ,wj } J (13a) s.t. h H n2 w j ̸ = 0, ∀n 2 ∈ Λ j , j = 1, • • • , J, (<label>13b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">h H n2 w j = 0, ∀n 2 ∈ ∪ i̸ =j Λ i , j = 1, • • • , J.

First, given any J, we check whether there exists a feasible solution of Λ j 's and w j 's to satisfy the conditions in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Then, the maximum achievable DoF of problem (13) can be obtained by a bisection search over the interval [1, min(M, N 2 )], since in the most favorite case without any occupied GBSs, the maximum DoF is min(M, N 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Feasibility Check</head><p>Note that the key to solve problem (13) via the bisection method lies in how to check whether a DoF of J is feasible or not given any network setup. The following theorem simplifies the feasibility check problem by characterizing the achievable DoF merely as a function of Λ j 's.</p><p>Theorem 1: Under the Rician channel model (1), a DoF of J ≤ min(M, N 2 ) is achievable if and only if we can find a solution of Λ j 's, j = 1, • • • , J, which satisfies the following conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">|Ψ j | + ∑ i̸ =j |Λ i | &lt; M, j = 1, • • • , J,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>(11d), (11e). 4 Note that the interference temperature constraint at each occupied GBS is in general Θn 1 ≥ 0 in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. However, as P goes to infinity, the interference of each data stream at each occupied GBS can be either zero or infinity. As a result, the only way to satisfy these interference temperature constraints is to ensure zero-interference at each of the occupied GBSs.</p><p>Proof: Please refer to Appendix A. The intuition of Theorem 1 is that there exists a feasible beamforming solution to satisfy (13b) and (13c) if and only if the data stream association Λ j 's satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. As a result, the achievable DoF only depends on Λ j 's. Based on the DoF characterization of the proposed strategy shown in Theorem 1, we formulate the following feasibility problem to check whether a DoF J is achievable by optimizing the association between data streams and available GBSs: <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">11d</ref>), (11e), <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">find Λ 1 , • • • , Λ J (15a) s.t. (</formula><p>(15b)</p><p>Compared to the original DoF feasibility check via problem (13), the number of variables in problem ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) is reduced since beamforming design is not involved. Moreover, the number of possible data stream association solutions of Λ j 's is finite. As a result, we can solve problem (15) via an exhaustive search as follows. First, we list all the possible solutions of Λ j 's that satisfy (11e). Since each available GBS can be assigned to decode either one of the J data streams or nothing, there are (J + 1) N2 possible solutions of Λ j 's in total. Then, we check whether there exists a solution among all that satisfies (11d) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">14</ref>). If so, we say that a DoF of J is achievable; otherwise, we claim that a DoF of J is not achievable. Note that the complexity of feasibility check is O((J + 1) N2 ). However, such a problem mainly depends on the network topology, i.e., the sets of the occupied and available GBSs and the backhaul connections between GBSs. For each possible set of occupied and available GBSs, the solution to problem (15) can be precomputed and stored for the use in real time. In other words, the exhaustive search can be done offline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. DoF-Optimal Beamforming Design</head><p>In this subsection, we present a ZF-based transmit beamforming solution to problem (13) that can achieve the maximum DoF J with the obtained data stream-GBS association Λ j 's obtained in the preceding subsection.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparison with Other Techniques</head><p>Note that this paper utilizes the one-hop backhaul connections between adjacent GBSs to achieve partial interference cancellation. Alternatively, we can achieve the full interference mitigation via CoMP by connecting each occupied GBS to all the available GBSs via the backhaul links, i.e., Φ n1 = N 2 , ∀n 1 , or connecting all the GBSs to a central decoding unit via fronthaul links as in C-RAN. Specifically, with CoMP, as long as a data stream is decoded, it can be cancelled for decoding all the other data streams. As a result, we have the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 1: With CoMP in which each occupied GBS has backhaul connections to all the available GBSs, i.e., Φ n1 = N 2 , ∀n 1 , the maximum DoF of the multi-beam UAV uplink communication is min(M, N 2 ).</p><p>Proof: With Φ n1 = N 2 , we have Ψ j = ∅ and thus |Ψ j | = 0, ∀j according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. It then follows from Theorem 1 that J = min(M, N 2 ) is achievable.</p><p>It is worth noting that the above DoF is achieved at the expense of connecting all GBSs together via a large number of backhaul links, which is not cost-effective in practice and also introduces long delay which may not be amenable to the dynamic coverage area of the UAV due to its high mobility. In this regard, uplink NOMA may be appealing as no backhaul connections are required to perform local interference cancellation. Alternatively, the simple cognitive beamforming can be applied, which does not require any interference cancellation. For the purpose of DoF analysis, in this case we should adopt ZF-based transmit beamforming such that zero-interference is achieved at all occupied GBSs. The DoF of the uplink NOMA scheme and the cognitive beamforming without cooperative interference cancellation is characterized by the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 2: If all the GBSs are isolated without the exchange of decoded messages via backhaul links, i.e., Φ n1 = ∅, ∀n 1 , the maximum DoF of the considered system is min(max(M -N 1 , 0), N 2 ).</p><p>Proof: With Φ n1 = ∅, we have Ψ j = N 1 and thus |Ψ j | = N 1 , ∀j according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. It then follows from Theorem 1 that the maximum achievable DoF is max(min(M -N 1 , N 2 ), 0) = min(max(M -N 1 , 0), N 2 ), for the case of ZF-based cognitive beamforming.</p><p>To summarize, our scheme based on cooperative interference cancellation can achieve a DoF gain over cognitive beamforming with a reasonable requirement of the backhaul connections.</p></div>

PROPOSED SOLUTION AT FINITE SNR</head><p>In this section, we focus on solving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> in the finite SNR regime. As discussed in Section IV, the main difficulty lies in the coupled design of J, Λ j 's, w j 's, and R j 's, in which J and Λ j 's are discrete. To reduce the complexity for solving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, in this section we propose to decouple the design of J and Λ j 's with that of w j 's and R j 's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data Stream Association Design</head><p>In the first step, we aim to optimize J and Λ j 's. The key issue is that what criterion should be used to design J and Λ j 's.</p><p>In Section V, we have shown in Theorem 1 that the maximum DoF of our considered system can be characterized by Λ j 's solely. This paper thus selects J and Λ j 's that maximize the DoF of our considered system as the solution to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Such a suboptimal solution of J and Λ j 's decouples from the design of w j 's and R j 's; thus, it not only reduces the algorithm complexity, but also achieves a reasonable performance since the DoF maximization problem (based on which we determine J and Λ j 's) is a good approximation to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> at high SNR, which is usually the case for our considered multi-stream UAV uplink transmission for applications with high data rate (e.g., high-definition (HD) video) over strong LoS channels.</p></div>

However, the results for sum-rate maximization in the MIMO broadcast channel cannot be used for solving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> due to the minimumrate operation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In fact, our considered system can be considered as a multi-group multicast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, where each of the J data streams is deemed to be decoded by an exclusive subset of the available GBSs. To the best knowledge of the authors, for a multi-group multicast channel, our considered sum-rate maximization problem is still open in the literature even without the interference temperature constraint (11c), although a different transmit power minimization problem subject to the individual SINR constraints of each user has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The objective function of problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">17</ref>) is a linear function over R j 's.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section, we provide numerical examples to verify the performance of the proposed cooperative interference cancellation strategy for the multi-beam UAV communication in the cellular uplink. We consider the cellular network topology shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, where there are N = 8 GBSs, among which N 1 = 3 GBSs are occupied GBSs with N 1 = {1, 2, 3}, and N 2 = 5 GBSs are available GBSs with N 2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Each GBS covers a cell with a radius of 200 meters (m). Moreover, the backhaul connections between the occupied GBSs and the available GBSs are specified by Φ 1 = {4, 5, 6}, Φ 2 = {5, 6, 7}, and Φ 3 = {6, 7, 8}. The UAV is assumed to be right on the top of the center of cell 6, and its altitude is 100 m. We assume that in the Rician fading channel model (1), the Rician factor is λ = 5, and the LoS component ĥn follows the linear antenna array model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. At last, the bandwidth of the RB used by the UAV is 10 MHz, while the power spectrum density of the AWGN at the GBSs is -169 dBm/Hz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Achievable DoF</head><p>First, we check the DoF of this setting achieved by our proposed cooperative interference cancellation strategy as characterized in Theorem 1. The maximum achievable DoF for our proposed scheme is obtained by solving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. In the following, we list the optimal solution to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> for various values of M .</p><p>1  2) M = 3: Maximum DoF J = 2 is achievable with</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">) M = 1, M = 2: Maximum DoF J = 1 is achievable with Λ 1 = {6}.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_50">Λ 1 = {4, 6}, Λ 2 = {5, 7}. 3) M = 4, M = 5: Maximum DoF J = 3 is achievable with Λ 1 = {5}, Λ 2 = {6}, and Λ 3 = {7}. 4) M = 6: Maximum DoF J = 4 is achievable with Λ 1 = {4, 8}, Λ 2 = {5}, Λ 3 = {6}, and Λ 4 = {7}. 5) M ≥ 7: Maximum DoF J = min(M, N 2 ) = 5 is achievable with Λ 1 = {4}, Λ 2 = {5}, Λ 3 = {6}, Λ 4 = {7}</formula><p>, and Λ 5 = {8}. Note that the optimal solution to problem (P1) may not be unique. For example, when M = 1, Λ 1 = {5, 7} is also an optimal solution.</p><p>For comparison, we also evaluate the maximum DoF achieved by the CoMP and ZF-based cognitive beamforming, as characterized in Propositions 1 and 2, respectively. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we show the maximum achievable DoF versus the number of antennas at the UAV, i.e., M , achieved by our proposed scheme and the benchmark schemes. It can be observed that as compared to the performance upper bound, i.e., CoMP with full cooperation, our proposed partial cooperative interference cancellation scheme achieves a reasonable DoF with various values of M . However, our scheme can be easily implemented in practice thanks to the recent development of Xhaul between adjacent GBSs for information exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, while an ideal CoMP architecture is still difficult to implement in practice. On the other hand, as compared to the cases of ZF-based cognitive beamforming without information exchange between adjacent GBSs, it is observed that our proposed scheme achieves significant DoF gain, especially when the number of antennas at the UAV is small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Sum-Rate Maximization at Finite SNR</head><p>Next, we consider the UAV's achievable sum-rate in the finite SNR regime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Convergence of Algorithm 1:</head><p>First, we verify the convergence of Algorithm 1. The transmit power constraint of UAV is 23 dBm. Moreover, assume that the UAV has M = 5 antennas. As shown in Fig. 3, the maximum DoF is J = 3 when M = 5. However, there are several data stream association solutions to achieve the maximum DoF. In this example, we merely consider the solution of Λ 1 = {4, 7}, Λ 2 = {5, 8}, Λ 3 = {6} for simplicity. With this solution, we have Γ n1 = ∅, ∀n 1 ∈ N 1 , in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the sum-rate versus the number of iterations in Algorithm 1. A monotonic convergence is observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, which verifies Theorem 2.</p><p>2) Performance Comparison: Next, we briefly introduce some benchmark schemes for UAV transmission rate maximization with interference control to the occupied GBSs, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooperative interference cancellation strategy in Section III via performance comparison.</p><p>Benchmark Scheme 1: CoMP. Under this benchmark scheme, we consider the case when all the GBSs are fully connected with each other with backhaul links. Mathematically, such a scheme results in Γ n1 = ∅, ∀n 1 ∈ N 1 , in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. In other words, the system reduces to a point-to-point MIMO channel with M transmit antennas and N 2 receive antennas, the capacity of which can be achieved by channel singular value decomposition (SVD) based linear precoding and decoding together with water-filling based power control <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Benchmark Scheme 2: Cognitive Beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Under this benchmark scheme, we consider the cognitive beamforming scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to control interference leakage via beamforming design alone, without utilization of the backhaul links for cooperative interference cancellation. Mathematically, such a scheme results in Γ n1 = {1, • • • , J}, ∀n 1 ∈ N 1 , in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Since the DoF in this setting is J = M -N 1 = 2, we assume that two data streams are sent. Then, Algorithm 1 can be used to design the beamforming vectors by solving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> with</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">Γ n1 = {1, • • • , J}, ∀n 1 ∈ N 1 .</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows the sum-rate achieved by the proposed strategy as well as the benchmark schemes, with various interference temperature constraints, where the UAV transmit power constraint is 23 dBm and the UAV is equipped with M = 5  antennas. Note that besides utilizing all the available GBSs as shown in the example of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, i.e., Λ 1 = {4, 7}, Λ 2 = {5, 8}, Λ 3 = {6}, we can also only utilize the available GBSs 5 -7, i.e., Λ 1 = {5}, Λ 2 = {6}, Λ 3 = {7}, to achieve the maximum DoF of J = 3. With this solution, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">Γ 1 = {3}, Γ 2 = ∅, Γ 3 = {1} in problem (17).</formula><p>It is observed that under the proposed strategy, utilizing all the available GBSs for cooperative interference cancellation achieves higher sum-rate when the interference temperature constraint is stringent, i.e., below -80 dBm, but achieves lower sum-rate when the interference temperature constraint is not stringent, i.e., above -70 dBm. This is because if the data stream association solution Λ 1 = {4, 7}, Λ 2 = {5, 8}, Λ 3 = {6} is adopted, the interference temperature constraint can be eliminated when we design the UAV beamforming vectors, but data streams 1 and 2 need to be multicast to two GBSs (thus, leading to less beamforming gain); while if the data stream association solution Λ 1 = {5}, Λ 2 = {6}, Λ 3 = {7} is adopted, each data stream is only sent to one close GBS, but the interference temperature constraint needs to be considered when we design the UAV beamforming vectors since the occupied GBSs 1 and 3 cannot receive all the data streams for interference cancellation via the backhaul links (thus, resulting in less interference cancellation gain). As a result, the data stream association should be carefully designed in practice to balance the beamforming gain and interference cancellation gain. Next, it is observed that CoMP achieves the maximum sum-rate thanks to the fully cooperative interference cancellation. However, this scheme requires a massive number of backhaul links to connect all th GBSs, which is difficult to realize in practice, while our strategy merely requires the backhaul connections between adjacent cells, which can be realized by the current Xhaul structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. At last, it is observed that the sum-rate achieved by our proposed strategy is much higher than that achieved by the cognitive beamforming thanks to that of the cooperative interference cancellation gain.  Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the sum-rate achieved by the proposed strategy as well as the benchmark schemes, with various transmit power constraints, where the interference temperature constraint is -60 dBm and the UAV is equipped with M = 5 antennas. It is observed that at the high SNR regime, the sum-rate performance is consistent with the DoF performance. Specifically, the DoF achieved by our proposed scheme and Benchmark Schemes 1 and 2 is 3, 5, and 2, respectively. As a result, the sum-rate achieved by CoMP and our proposed scheme increases faster with the transmit power as compared to the cognitive beamforming scheme.</p><p>Last, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the sum-rate achieved by the proposed strategy as well as the benchmark schemes, with various number of antennas at the UAV, where the the transmit power constraint of the UAV is 23 dBm and the interference temperature constraint is -60 dBm. When the UAV has M = 5, 6, 7 or 8 antennas, we consider the following DoF-maximizing 1536-1276 (c) 2019 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. It is observed that when the number of antennas at the UAV is larger, e.g., M = 8, the sum-rate achieved by both the proposed strategy and cognitive beamforming strategy approaches that achieved by the CoMP strategy. This is because with sufficient antennas at the UAV, beamforming alone is already capable of controlling the interference from the UAV to the occupied GBSs, and the gain of cooperative interference cancellation or CoMP is smaller. However, when the number of antennas at the UAV is smaller, e.g., M = 5, it is observed that the gain of our proposed scheme over the cognitive beamforming due to cooperative interference cancellation is larger. This is because in this case, beamforming alone is not sufficient to effectively reduce the interference to the occupied GBSs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper studied the uplink communication from a multiantenna UAV to multiple GBSs. To achieve high data rate while effectively controlling the severe aerial interference to the uplink terrestrial communications arising from the strong LoS channel between the UAV and GBSs, this paper proposed a multi-beam UAV communication scheme with a novel cooperative interference cancellation strategy, which exploits the use of existing backhaul links among adjacent GBSs in the cellular network. Specifically, the UAV sends multiple data streams to a subset of available GBSs that are not using the same RB for terrestrial communications, which then forward the decoded messages to the backhaul-connected occupied GBSs for canceling the UAV's interference before decoding the messages of their associated terrestrial users. The maximum achievable DoF of the proposed strategy was characterized by optimizing the association between each data stream and its decoding available GBSs. Based on this data stream association, the sum-rate of the UAV uplink communication was maximized at finite SNR by a proper beamforming design. Numerical examples showed that significant DoF and sum-rate gains can be achieved with our proposed strategy compared to benchmark schemes with no or local interference cancellation. In future work, we will extend the DoF and/or sum-rate optimization for our proposed scheme to the cases of multi-antenna GBSs with flexible 3D beamforming with both cooperative and local interference cancellation.</p></div>

According to (13c) and (13d), each beamforming vector w j should lie in the null space of [H occ,j , H ava,j ].

In other words, the null space of [H occ,j , H ava,j ] exists for each j, i.e., we can find J beamforming vectors to satisfy (13c) and (13d). Moreover, under the Rician channel model as shown in (1), h n 's are linearly independent with each other. Since the ZF beamforming vectors only depend on H occ,j 's and H ava,j 's but are not related to h n2 's, n 2 ∈ Λ j , with probability one these ZF beamforming vectors do not lie in the null space of h n2 's, n 2 ∈ Λ j , i.e., (13b) holds.
