<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper establishes a framework for robust stability analysis of linear time-invariant uncertain systems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE OBJECTIVE of robust stability analysis is to deter- mine whether or not a given uncertain system is stable for all possible uncertainties. A standard approach is to "pull out" the uncertain component of the system, identify the known component as the nominal part, and express the uncertain system as the feedback connection of and . In this way, it becomes clear how the uncertainties enter the system and what properties they have (e.g., norm-boundedness). The former information is embedded in and the latter is formalized as the set of possible uncertainties . Then, the problem is, given and , to find a verifiable condition under which the feedback system is stable for all . A useful concept for robust stability analysis is wellposedness of feedback systems; the uncertain system described by the feedback connection of and is robustly stable if and only if the feedback system is well posed<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> for all . This concept has been exploited for robustness analysis with respect to the norm-bounded structured uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; the structured singular value is defined such that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the feedback system to be well posed for all possible uncertainties. The computation of is extremely difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and hence a more tractable small-gain condition with a diagonal scaling ( -scaling) is often used as an upper bound for <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Unfortunately, the robust stability test involving the -scaling is known to be conservative in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>As an extension to the -scaling approach, the notion of the linear fractional transformation (LFT)-scaling has been introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> where the nominal plant is "scaled" by LFT. The robust stability test based on the LFT-scaling is better than the -scaling (or -scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for real parametric uncertainty) test in the sense that the scaling parameter space is larger, and hence the test is less conservative. Other interesting results in this direction include that of Fu and Barabanov <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> where an upper bound for is given using a multiplier technique and is shown to be better (less conservative) than the bound given by -scaling. However, these new tests can still fail even if the system being tested is robustly stable, i.e., they are conservative.</p><p>Another important concept behind robust stability is the notion of topological separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>; the system is robustly stable if and only if the graph of and the inverse graph of are topologically separated for all . Recent results by Goh and Safonov <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> showed that the integral quadratic constraint (IQC) condition for robust stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> can be interpreted in terms of the topological separation view point. That is, topological separation (and hence robust stability) of the feedback system can be established by searching for an appropriate symmetric matrix (which we call "quadratic separator") used for the quadratic form in the IQC condition. While the existence of a quadratic separator is sufficient to conclude robust stability, its necessity is not clear for the general class of uncertainties .</p><p>The main objective of this paper is to provide a framework for robust stability analysis of uncertain systems described by the feedback connection of and , based on the concept of well-posedness. Necessary and sufficient robust stability conditions are developed in a very general setting; the properties (structure, norm-boundedness, etc.) of are not specified concretely, allowing for to be an arbitrary subset of complex matrices. It appears to be computationally difficult to verify the exact robust stability conditions presented in this paper. In fact, we do not expect the existence of efficient algorithms to verify these conditions, for the exact analysis has been proven to be extremely difficult (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). Nevertheless, our results provide some insights into the exact analysis problem, showing the connections among , IQC, conic sector analysis, scaled small-gain conditions, and parameter-dependent Lyapunov conditions.</p><p>In particular, frequency domain and state-space conditions for well-posedness are provided in terms of Hermitian-form inequalities. These conditions give an exact characterization of for the special case where the uncertainty is the set of norm-bounded block diagonal matrices. It turned out that the frequency domain condition is exactly the IQC condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for robust stability, while the state-space condition differs from the corresponding state-space IQC condition obtained through Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). It is shown, using the topological separation property of IQC's <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, that our conditions can be interpreted as small-gain conditions with a generalized class of scalings given by LFT's. Using the LFT-scaled small-gain condition in the state-space setting, the "duality" is established between the norm condition with frequency-dependent scalings and the parameter-dependent Lyapunov condition.</p><p>Although it is nontrivial to solve our exact robust stability conditions, our results also have practical implications. Namely, our results may be used as a basis for obtaining computationally tractable upper and lower bounds on certain stability margins. We will give a general idea of how to "approximate" our exact condition to find such bounds. As applications of this idea, the notions of the -separator and the vertex-separator are introduced to give sufficient conditions for robust stability (and hence a lower bounds on the stability margin). The -separator is "equivalent" to the -scaling in terms of conservativeness but allows for more flexibility and uniformity in robustness analysis. The vertex-separator provides a bound on the real which is less conservative than the existing bounds, at the expense of more computation. For both separators, the resulting computational problems are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI's) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and can be solved numerically <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>This work is motivated by the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. WELL-POSEDNESS THEOREM</head><p>Let subsets and a matrix-valued function be given. Consider the feedback system in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where and . The feedback system is denoted by . Well-posedness of the system with respect to and is defined as follows. Definition 1: The feedback system is said to be well posed for all and , or in short we say is well posed, if the following two conditions hold.</p><p>c1) For each and , there exists a unique vector . c2) There exists such that An interpretation of this definition is the following. Consider the special case where is a transfer function with being the integration operator and is the set of complex numbers with nonnegative real parts. Then the continuous-time feedback system in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is robustly stable against if and only if is well posed. The setup in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> assumes that the uncertainty is (complex and) constant. As is well known, however, the linear time-invariant uncertainty case can be treated by exactly the same setup. Thus we use constant instead of "frequency dependent" without loss of generality. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we have We see from this equation that the existence and uniqueness condition c1) holds if and only if <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> or equivalently <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> The additional boundedness condition c2) ensures that s.t. or s.t.</p><p>(5) Thus, the feedback system is well posed if and only if (5) holds.</p><p>Recall that the well-posedness condition in theframework,</p><p>, is defined by c1), or equivalently by (4) under a certain normalization of the size of the uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The additional condition c2) does not appear explicitly in the -framework, for c1) implies c2) if is closed and bounded (and is a constant matrix), which is assumed in the -theory. However, as seen in the difference between (3) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), c1) does not imply c2) in general.</p><p>The following well-posedness theorem is the basic result to be used for robust stability analysis in the subsequent sections.</p><p>Theorem 1: Let subsets and a matrix-valued function be given. Suppose . Consider the feedback system in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where and . The following statements are equivalent.</p><p>1) The feedback system is well posed. Proof:</p><p>The key idea for the proof is the same as the one in the proof of Corollary 1 given below. Technical details are involved and are of less interest. Hence, the proof is omitted for brevity.</p><p>The result of this theorem is closely related to the stability theorem in the IQC approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In particular, the condition in statement 2) is a special case of the IQC condition where the uncertainty is a constant matrix. While the IQC result <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">Th. 2]</ref> shows sufficiency of the condition in statement 2) for robust stability, our new result indicates that the existence of the quadratic form given by is necessary as well. This result will be discussed further in terms of the concept of topological separation in Section III.</p><p>The following is a special case of Theorem 1 where the function is replaced by a constant matrix . Corollary 1: Let a subset and a matrix be given. The following statements are equivalent. 1) The feedback system is well posed. 2) There exists a Hermitian matrix such that (6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> If is a real matrix, then the above equivalence still holds when is restricted to a real matrix. Proof: The result follows by specializing Theorem 1 appropriately. Here, we give a simple, direct proof of the result, assuming that the set is compact. This assumption can be relaxed at the expense of more involved manipulations.</p><p>Suppose 1) holds. Let for a scalar . Since is compact and the minimum singular value of is bounded away from zero for all , (7) holds for sufficiently small . Condition (6) can readily be verified by substitution.</p><p>Suppose 2) holds. By Finsler's theorem (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) implies the existence of a scalar such that</p><p>Multiplying this inequality by from the left and by its conjugate transpose from the right, statement 1) follows due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and the compactness of .</p><p>Corollary 1 gives a condition for well-posedness of a feedback system consisting of constant matrices. This result generalizes the concept of the structured singular value by allowing for an arbitrary underlying uncertainty set. Specifically, if is the set of block diagonal matrices with the norm less than or equal to one, statement 2) provides an exact characterization of , that is, if and only if statement 2) holds.</p><p>The LFT-scaling approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> yielded a well-posedness condition similar to the condition in Corollary 1. The relationship will be clarified in Section III. It is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that a transfer function can be expressed as the LFT of its state-space data and the "frequency variable" ( or for continuous-time or discrete-time systems) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where the state-space data is given by ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)</p><p>The following theorem shows that, in the special case where is given by an LFT of a constant matrix and a matrix parameter , the well-posedness condition in Theorem 1 together with the "nominal plant stability" can be equivalently converted to the algebraic condition in Corollary 1.</p><p>Theorem 2: Let subsets and a matrix-valued function in (8) be given. Define a matrix by ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and a set by . Suppose . Then the following statements are equivalent. 1) The following two conditions hold.</p><p>a) The feedback system is well posed. b) The feedback system is well posed. 2) The feedback system is well posed. Proof: See Appendix I. The condition in 1)-a) can be interpreted such that the nominal plant (and its state-space realization) is stable. Condition 1)-b) adds robustness to stability of the perturbed system . Overall, Theorem 2 states that the perturbed feedback system is robustly internally stable if and only if is well posed (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In fact, Theorem 2 slightly generalizes the main loop theorem in the literature on theanalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in that condition c2) in Definition 1 is included in the statement. The theorem can also be used, for example, to convert a robust performance condition to a robust stability condition.</p><p>This result shows that the well-posedness condition can be given by the existence of either the frequency dependent matrix for the transfer function in Theorem 1 or the constant matrix for the state-space system in Corollary 1. This is in stark contrast with the upper bound results <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> where the constant -scaling (the state-space upper bound) is more conservative than the frequency-dependentscaling in general. It should be noted here that the constant -scaling test is computationally more tractable than the frequency dependent -scaling test, while it is difficult to verify the well-posedness condition exactly, even for the constant case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. INSIGHTS INTO EXACT ANALYSIS</head><p>In the context of robust control, the function in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is interpreted as the nominal transfer function, while is considered to be the unknown component of the system. In the sequel, we shall restrict our attention to the case where is a real-rational proper transfer function, and it is given by ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) with real constant matrices and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Preliminary Results</head><p>We will first give an interpretation of the well-posedness condition in Corollary 1 in terms of the concept of topological separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. An analogous result can be obtained for the condition in Theorem 1. To begin, let us briefly review the notion of topological separation.</p><p>Consider the feedback system in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, where is a given real constant matrix and belongs to a known (compact) subset of constant matrices . Let the graph of and the inverse graph of be defined by Then the feedback system is robustly stable (or well posed) if and only if <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> the graph of and the inverse graph of are topologically separated, i.e., Note that zero is always an element of . The following lemma shows the separating property of in Corollary 1 used to establish topological separation. The result is first shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> with a complete proof in the context of robust stability analysis with IQC's. Here, we give an alternative proof based on simple algebra.</p><p>Lemma 1: Consider the result in Corollary 1. Suppose . Then the matrix in statement 2) can always be chosen to have positive eigenvalues and negative eigenvalues. In particular, can be written <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where and and are positive definite square root of and , respectively, and are partitioned blocks of .</p><p>Proof: Since , (7) implies . Noting that the inequality in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is strict, we may assume without loss of generality. Using partitioned blocks of , inequality (6) can be written Completing the square with respect to , this inequality leads to Since the left-hand side is nonnegative definite, we have . Thus, and are well defined, and it is now straightforward to verify <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 1 shows that the quadratic forms in Corollary 1 establish the topological separation of the graph of and the inverse graph of , motivating us to call a "separator." To see this, first note that the condition in Corollary 1 is equivalent to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> This fact can readily be verified using the duality lemma in Appendix II. From Lemma 1, can be written for some matrices and . Now suppose, for contradiction, that there exists such that (11) holds and that there exists a nonzero vector . Then, multiplying the first (second) inequality in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> by from the left and by from the right, we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> which is a contradiction. Therefore, the only element of is zero, and thus (11) establishes topological separation in terms of the conic sectors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>In fact, it may be implicit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> that the conic sector condition for topological separation is necessary (and sufficient) if at least one of and is a linear operator. Above, we demonstrated that this fact simply follows from our wellposedness result, provided both and are linear operators. Note that topological separation for robust stability can always be established (when possible) by the quadratic forms as in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, regardless of the structure of the uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Main Results</head><p>Next, we will use the separating property of to obtain small-gain-type conditions for robust stability.</p><p>Theorem 3: Let a subset and a matrix be given. Suppose . Then the following statements are equivalent.</p><p>1) The feedback system is well posed. 2) There exists an invertible matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> such that a)</p><p>is well defined and b) is well defined and Proof: Suppose statement 1) holds. Then, from Corollary 1, there exists a real symmetric matrix such that ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) are satisfied. Substituting ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) into ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), after some manipulations, we have 2)-a) with Substituting ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) into <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> It can be shown as in the Proof of Lemma 4 that is nonsingular for all . Hence we have or equivalently 2)-b).</p><p>To show the converse, suppose 2) holds. Then straightforward algebraic manipulations show that satisfies conditions ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Hence, in view of Corollary 1, we conclude that statement 1) holds.</p><p>In this result, the inequality in statement 2)-b) can be replaced by the following stronger condition: that is, one can show the necessity of this strengthened inequality by perturbing in the "right" direction in the proof of Theorem 3.</p><p>Theorem 3 shows that a robust stability condition can be given by the small-gain condition on the LFT of the statespace matrices of the nominal plant [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(a)</ref>]. The result is closely related to the LFT-scaling result by Asai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. They considered the following sufficient condition for robust stability [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(b)</ref>] There exists a matrix such that c) is well defined and . d) is well defined for all and</p><p>The basic idea there was to cover the uncertainty by the LFT on a (unstructured) ball as in d) and reduce the robust stability condition to a small-gain condition on scaled by the LFT. This approach has led to exactly the same condition as that in Corollary 1 except for an additional negativity constraint on the -block of . Corollary 1 shows that the LFT-scaling approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is indeed conservative due to the additional constraint, and Theorem 3 reveals where the conservatism came from. The first requirement in d) is not necessary, and it adds constraint which in turn leads to the additional constraint on the -block of . In Theorem 3, the matrices involved are constant. The following result generalizes Theorem 3 for frequency dependent matrices, i.e., transfer functions.</p><p>Theorem 4: Let the uncertainty set and an th order real-rational transfer function be given. Suppose . Then the following statements are equivalent. 1) The feedback system is robustly stable. 2) There exists an real-rational proper invertible transfer function such that and a) the transfer function is stable and b) the feedback system is internally stable and Moreover, the of can be chosen to be , that is, the order of .</p><p>Proof: Suppose statement 1) holds. Let be given by ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) with a minimal realization. Since , statement 1) implies that is stable. By minimality of the realization, we see that is well posed where (Continuous-time) (Discrete-time)</p><p>where denotes the real part of the complex number . In addition, 1) implies the well-posedness of . Hence, from Theorem 2, the feedback system is well posed where and is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Now, Theorem 3 implies the existence of a real scalar and a real invertible matrix of the structure as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where and . Note that where <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> Let the singular value decomposition of be Then can be written where Define a real-rational transfer function which satisfies due to the structure of . Then is given in terms of as ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>)</p><p>Now, since and are orthogonal matrices, we have, from ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)</p><p>It is a standard result <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that these two inequalities imply that is well defined and satisfies or equivalently, is internally stable and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>)</p><p>So far we have shown that 1) implies the existence of such that ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) hold for some . It can be shown by a perturbation argument that such can always be chosen to be invertible as a rational function. In this case, ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) implies Redefining by , we have 2). To prove the converse, suppose 2) holds. Let Then is a real-rational proper stable transfer function with . This definition of implies Now, since we see that is robustly stable. Noting the internal stability of , we conclude that is robustly stable.</p><p>Recall that the -scaling is known to be conservative, and restricting the class of the -scaling to be finite-dimensional linear time-invariant (FDLTI) systems may introduce extra conservatism. In contrast, Theorem 4 shows that the norm conditions scaled by the LFT's on the nominal plant and the uncertainty provide a necessary and sufficient condition for robust stability. Thus, the scaled small-gain condition can give a necessary and sufficient condition for robust stability, by enlarging the class of scalings. Moreover, our result shows exactly what class of scalings can be used for this purpose. That is, given any uncertainty structure and an FDLTI nominal plant of order , we may restrict our search for a dynamic LFT-scaling within FDLTI systems of order without loss of generality. Although this is a new result in a theoretical sense, the question of how this fact can be useful for computation still remains open.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Further Discussions</head><p>The idea behind the proof of Theorem 4 is to consider the condition in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a) with the special choice , where is the frequency variable and is the uncertain parameter, and pull down into to get a frequency dependent LFT-scaling [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(a)</ref>]. The "dual" formulation is also possible; we may pull down instead of into , to get a parameter-dependent LFT-scaling [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(b)</ref>]. In this case, the resulting robust stability condition involving may be interpreted in terms of the parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, where the Lyapunov matrix depends on the parameter in a linear fractional manner. Again, our result shows that this restriction of parameter-dependence does not introduce conservatism.</p><p>The state-space IQC formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> derived via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma provides a computationally tractable sufficient condition for robust stability. This condition may be interpreted as a generalization of the condition with the frequency-dependent scaling which is parameterized by basis functions. As the authors state there, however, this approach does not show the relationship between the parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and the IQC-type analysis. On the other hand, the well-posedness condition in Corollary 1 may be thought of as a new formulation of the state-space IQC condition, and based on this result Theorem 3 establishes a connection between the parameter-dependent Lyapunov condition and the scaled condition for robust stability. In the next section, we address the computational aspect of verifying statement 2) of Corollary 1.</p><p>Finally, we point out that similar results to those in Theorems 3 and 4 may be developed in the positive real setting with generalized multiplier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. APPROXIMATE COMPUTATIONS FOR ANALYSIS</head><p>Robust stability of the feedback system in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> can be checked by verifying the condition in statement 2) of Theorem 1. In view of Theorem 2, a robust stability condition in the state space can be given by statement 2) of Corollary 1. The separator can be restricted to a real matrix without loss of generality if is a real-rational transfer function. To verify the condition in statement 2), one may attempt to solve find s.t.</p><p>This is a convex feasibility problem. It is clear that the LMI in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">18</ref>) is a convex constraint. The fact that the constraint set in ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) is convex can readily be seen once we notice that is the intersection of (uncountably many) convex sets, each of which is defined by the LMI in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> for a fixed . However, it is difficult to solve this convex problem since the constraint set is not easily handled. One way to overcome this difficulty is to approximate the exact set in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> by a "tractable" set . If is chosen to be contained in the original set , then <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> with replaced by gives a verifiable sufficiency test for solvability of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. On the other hand, if is chosen to cover , it provides a necessity test. In this way, by choosing appropriate inner/outer approximations to , one may develop computable lower/upper bounds on certain stability margins such as . In the sequel, we consider special classes of and provide some reasonable choices for inner approximation for the given .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. -Separator</head><p>The choice for presented in this section is a generalization of the -scaling; the class of we consider for this case is a subset of block diagonal complex matrices with each block satisfying a sector condition. This class of can be transformed (with a mild assumption) to the class of "norm-bounded uncertainties," and therefore the -scaling is applicable. The set we propose, the -separator, is obtainable by transforming the -scaling and thus they are essentially "equivalent." While the -separator does not go beyond the -scaling in terms of conservativeness, it provides a way for directly treating sector-bounded "uncertainties" including the passive and norm-bounded uncertainties as well as the continuous/discrete-time systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consider the set</head><p>given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where repeats times in , and is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> for given real matrices and . For this class of , a reasonable choice of is given by the following result.</p><p>Lemma 2: Let be defined by s.t.</p><p>Then . Proof: Let and be given. Note that is a block diagonal matrix whose th block matrix is given by From <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and imply , and hence we conclude that . Using this lemma, one may attempt to solve problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> with replaced by in Lemma 2. We call a -separator. When we search for a -separator, the variables are the matrices in Lemma 2. This problem is a standard LMI feasibility problem for which efficient computational algorithms and software packages are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. If there is a solution, then robust stability is proved via theseparator. If there is no solution, then one can conclude nothing because there may be a gap between and in general.

Using this fact, certain equivalence between the -separator and the -scaling can be established. Then the result follows by calling for the existing nonconservative result on the upper bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The -separator defined in Lemma 2 is a generalization of existing "analysis tools" such as the Lyapunov matrix,scaling, and the multiplier, and it contains those tools as special cases, such as the following one.</p><p>• Continuous-time Lyapunov matrix:</p><p>In this case, the number of repeated blocks in is .

Note, however, that our point is that the -separator, the restricted class of the -separator (or the Hermitian matrix in the IQC condition), is still general enough to cover the existing analysis tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Vertex-Separator</head><p>In this section, we consider the case where the uncertainty set is a subset of real matrices and is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> where are the uncertain real parameters. The following class of separators can be used to assess well-posedness via LMI-optimization.</p><p>Lemma 3: Consider the set in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Define by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> where is the block matrix of on the th diagonal and are the vertices of . Then .</p><p>Proof: Fix arbitrarily, and consider the inequality in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. The left-hand side contains quadratic terms in parameters with coefficient matrices . Since , the quadratic terms can be expanded into affine terms using the Schur complement. As a result, we see that the inequality in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> holds for if and only if a certain multi-affine, matrix-valued function is positive definite for all . Now, we explain the key idea of the proof for the simple case where . The case can be treated similarly. Since is multi-affine, it can be written as for some affine function . Define</p><p>Then, since where denotes convex hull <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, we see that if and only if Hence, in order to conclude , it suffices to check if the inequality in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> holds on the vertices of . This condition is met due to the fact that . The result in Lemma 3 can be used to give an upper bound on the real . Recall, from Corollary 1, that the structured singular value of with respect to the uncertainty structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, denoted by , can be characterized as follows:</p><p>where is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Now, let us denote by the optimal value of (25) with replaced by . Clearly, we have since . Thus is an upper bound on . The condition in the definition of may introduce conservatism in general but makes it sufficient to use vertices of for providing the upper bound. In this way, computation of the upper bound involves only a finite number of LMI's at every vertices of , as opposed to the fact that the computation of involves infinitely many LMI's at every element of . Thus, can be computed numerically. It should be noted here, however, that the number of LMI constraints grows exponentially with the number of the uncertain parameters, and hence the proposed bound may be an effective tool only when the problem size is moderate.</p><p>Next, we show that the proposed bound is no worse than the existing real upper bounds. To this end, let denote the set of matrices that commute with any (i.e.,</p><p>), and define the following: -scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> LFT scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Replacing in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> by or , upper bounds on can be defined. Now, it is easy to see that From these inclusion relations, we trivially get the following: Thus, the proposed bound is no worse than the other two bounds. The following example shows that there are cases where the bound is strictly better than the existing ones.</p><p>Example 1: For real scalars and we would like to estimate the structured singular value of the matrix with the uncertainty structure This example is a slightly modified version of the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We consider the following two cases.</p><p>Case 1) Fix and vary in the interval . For each value of , the upper bounds of are computed by solving the minimization problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> for different sets of separators . The result is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> together with the exact value <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> of . For this case, the upper bounds by the -scaling and the LFT scaling are very conservative, while the proposed upper bound (almost) hits the exact for all values of in the interval shown in the figure. Case 2) Fix and vary in the interval . The three upper bounds and the exact value of are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> as functions of . We see that the proposed bound is tight when but is conservative when . This example shows that the proposed bound is not tight in general, and still there is some room for improvement. There are some other upper bounds on . Fu and Barabanov's bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is based on multiplier methods and has been shown to be equivalent to . Chen and Sugie <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> generalized this idea to the parameter dependent multiplier case. Their upper bound also hits the exact value of when applied to Case 1 of the above example <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. It would be interesting to investigate the relationship between their bound and ours. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Mixed /Vertex-Separator</head><p>The following result is obtained by a simple application of the -separator to state-space systems.</p><p>Theorem 5: Let real scalars real matrices and a real rational transfer function be given. Suppose Define by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Then the following statements are equivalent. 1) The following two conditions hold. a) All the eigenvalues of are inside the region where b) There exists a real scalar such that</p><p>2) There exists a matrix such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> Proof: We will give an outline of the proof. First note that statement 1)-a) is equivalent to the well-posedness of where Moreover, under condition a), statement 1)-b) is equivalent to the well-posedness of where and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> Hence, by Theorem 2, statement 1) is equivalent to the wellposedness of where . Noting that the -separator is nonconservative in this special case (one repeated scalar block and one unrepeated full block in ), we conclude that is well posed if and only if 2) holds.</p><p>Theorem 5 gives a unified representation of continuoustime/discrete-time bounded-real/positive-real lemmas 5 with appropriate choices for the parameters and . If the set is contained in the "stable pole region" in the complex plane ( and for continuous-time and discrete-time systems, respectively), then condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> implies that the feedback system in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>is robustly stable for all uncertainties</head><p>where the set is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Hence, if a set is given such that , then condition (26) establishes robust stability of . In fact, to prove robust stability of using ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>), we need to search not only for but also for and such that . If, in particular, is real parametric and norm-bounded as in ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>), then we may use the vertex separator for and . In this case the analysis problem becomes: find and such that (26) holds, where the set is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Clearly, this problem is a convex feasibility problem involving LMI's, which is computationally tractable. This robust stability condition is conservative. Yet, it is less conservative than the existing tests such as the (constant) -scaling, at the expense of more parameters and more constraints in the computational problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>A framework is established for robust stability analysis, based on the well-posedness of feedback systems. Several forms of exact (nonconservative) robust stability conditions are derived. Insights into the exact analysis are given in comparison with the existing results including those from the and the IQC analysis methods. In particular, the duality relationship is established between the scaled condition with frequencydependent scaling and the parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. Conceptual guidelines are given for tractable approximate computations in a general setting. Specifically, the vertex-separator is introduced to give an improved upper bound on the structured singular value. Then it is straightforward to verify the equivalence between this inequality and 2).
