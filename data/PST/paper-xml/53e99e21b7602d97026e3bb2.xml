<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Community wireless networks typically share a few wired Internet connections among many users spread over an urban area. Two approaches to constructing community networks are common. The first approach is to carefully construct a multi-hop network with nodes in chosen locations and directional antennas aimed to engineer high-quality radio links <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">29]</ref>; these networks require well-coordinated groups with technical expertise, but result in high throughput and good connectivity. The second approach consists of individuals operating "hot-spot" access points to which clients directly connect <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4]</ref>. These access points often operate independently and are loosely connected, if at all. Access-point networks do not require much coordination to deploy and operate, but usually do not provide as much coverage per wired connection as multi-hop networks.</p><p>A more ambitious vision for community networks would combine the best characteristics of both network types, operating without extensive planning or central management but still providing wide coverage and acceptable performance. This paper provides an evaluation of such an architecture, consisting of the following design decisions:</p><p>1. Unconstrained node placement, rather than a topology planned for coverage or performance. The network should work well even if the topology is determined solely by where participants happen to live.</p><p>2. Omni-directional antennas, rather than directional antennas used to form particular high-quality links. Users should be able to install an antenna without knowing in advance what nodes the antenna might talk to.</p><p>Nodes should be able to route data through whatever neighbors they happen to find.</p><p>3. Multi-hop routing, rather than single-hop base stations or access points. Multi-hop routing can improve coverage and performance despite lack of planning and lack of specifically engineered links.</p><p>4. Optimization of routing for throughput in a slowlychanging network with many links of intermediate quality, rather than for route repair in a mobile network.</p><p>These decisions ease deployment, but they also risk reduced network performance. For example, radio ranges might be too short to connect some nodes; many links might be low quality; nodes might interfere with each other and cause persistent packet loss; standard TCP might interact poorly with low-quality radio links; or the outdoor omni-directional antennas might pick up unacceptable levels of interference from other ISM-band users throughout the city.</p><p>While none of the individual elements of the unplanned mesh architecture outlined above are new [1, 3, 2, 6], there has been no systematic evaluation of whether the architecture as a whole can achieve its goals. Prior evaluations of similar mesh networks have focused on routing metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref> and the radio-level causes of packet loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref>. MANETs have been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">12]</ref>, but their routing protocol design is focused on coping with rapid topology changes due to mobility.</p><p>This paper evaluates the unplanned mesh architecture with a case study of Roofnet. Roofnet is a multi-hop 802.11b Internet access network consisting of 37 nodes spread over about four square kilometers of a city. While previous work investigated the physical-layer causes of packet loss in Roofnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref>, this paper describes Roofnet's end-to-end characteristics.</p><p>The paper's conclusions are as follows. The unplanned mesh architecture of Roofnet works: with few exceptions, users see throughput and delay comparable to DSL links and the average throughput between nodes is 627 kbits/second. Throughput decreases with number of hops, but even eighthop routes average 160 kbits/second. Single-flow throughput increases with node density, since the routing protocol makes use of short links and drives them at high bit-rates. The majority of the radio links are between 500 and 1300 meters long, though the links that prove the most useful to the routing protocol are a relatively small number of short high-throughput links. While Roofnet includes a few nodes positioned on the tops of tall buildings, its performance and robustness do not greatly depend on any small set of nodes; it is a true mesh. Finally, while a single-hop base-station architecture would have been possible for Roofnet, for any given number of wired access points, Roofnet's multi-hop forwarding improves coverage and throughput. Some areas that this paper does not investigate include the effect of multiple concurrent flows, network and protocol scalability, the detailed design of routing protocols, change in network performance over time, and the long-term evolution of the network as users join and depart.</p><p>The next section outlines Roofnet's design. Section 3 is the core of the paper, presenting measurements and discussing what they imply about the unplanned mesh architecture. Section 4 presents a snapshot of user traffic on Roofnet. Section 5 reviews related work, and Section 6 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">ROOFNET DESIGN</head><p>Roofnet is deployed over an area of about four square kilometers in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a map of the network. This area is urban and densely populated. Most buildings are three-or four-story apartment buildings; most Roofnet nodes are located in such buildings, but eight are in taller buildings. Line-of-sight signal propagation between nodes is often obstructed.</p><p>Each Roofnet node is hosted by a volunteer user. Volunteers were solicited by a combination of word of mouth, posters distributed in and near the network's coverage area, and links to a Web sign-up page. Each volunteer installed his or her own node, including the roof-mounted antenna. The resulting node locations are neither truly random nor selected according to any particular plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Hardware</head><p>Each Roofnet node consists of a PC, an 802.11b card, and a roof-mounted omni-directional antenna. The PC is small and quiet so that it is suitable for residential use. The PC's Ethernet port provides Internet service to the user. Each PC has a hard drive for collecting traces and a CD reader in case an over-the-network upgrade fails. An entire Roofnet kit (PC, antenna, mounting hardware, and cable) can be carried by one person.</p><p>Each 8 dBi omni-directional antenna has a 3-dB vertical beam width of 20 degrees. The wide beam sacrifices gain but means the antenna need not be perfectly vertical. The antenna is connected to its node with coaxial cable which introduces 6 to 10 dB of attenuation. Three nodes, located on the roofs of tall buildings, have 12 dBi Yagi directional antennas with 45-degree horizontal and vertical beam widths.</p><p>Each node is equipped with an 802.11b wireless card based on the Intersil Prism 2.5 chip-set. The radios transmit 200 milliwatts of power, operate with RTS/CTS disabled, and all share the same 802.11b channel. The cards use a nonstandard "pseudo-IBSS" mode that is similar to standard 802.11b IBSS (or "ad hoc") mode, in that nodes communicate directly without access points. Pseudo-IBSS omits 802.11's beacons and BSSID (network ID) mechanism, solv-ing IBSS mode's tendency to form partitions which have different BSSIDs despite having the same network ID. These partitions made it impossible to operate Roofnet reliably with IBSS mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Software and Auto-Configuration</head><p>Each Roofnet node runs identical turn-key software consisting of Linux, routing software implemented in Click <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>, a DHCP server, and a web server so users can monitor the network status. Most users pick up nodes from us at our lab with software pre-installed. We regularly upgrade all the nodes' software over Roofnet, and occasionally by mailing out installation CDs.</p><p>From the user's perspective, the node acts like a cable or DSL modem: the user connects a PC or laptop to the node's Ethernet interface, and the node automatically configures the user's computer via DHCP, listing the node itself as the default IP router. Some users choose to connect the node to their own wireless access point.</p><p>In order that Roofnet nodes be completely self-configuring, the software must automatically solve a number of problems: allocating addresses, finding a gateway between Roofnet and the Internet, and choosing a good multi-hop route to that gateway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Addressing</head><p>Roofnet carries IP packets inside its own header format and routing protocol. Each Roofnet node needs a unique address at the Roofnet layer, as well as an IP address so that IP applications work between Roofnet nodes. The Roofnet software running on a node must be able to assign itself addresses automatically, without requiring explicit configuration. It does this by choosing an address whose low 24 bits are the low 24 bits of the node's Ethernet address, and whose high 8 bits are an unused class-A IP address block. The node uses the same address at both the Roofnet and IP layers. These addresses are meaningful only inside Roofnet; they are not globally routable.</p><p>A Roofnet node must also allocate IP addresses via DHCP to user hosts attached to the node's Ethernet port. Each node allocates these addresses from the reserved 192.168.1.x IP address block. The node uses NAT between the Ethernet and Roofnet, so that connections from a user's host appear to the rest of Roofnet to have originated from the user's node. This use of NAT allows nodes to allocate IP addresses to users' hosts independently, but prevents these hosts from connecting to each other through Roofnet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Gateways and Internet Access</head><p>Roofnet's design assumes that a small fraction of Roofnet users will voluntarily share their wired Internet access links. Multiple consumer DSL ISPs in the Roofnet area (e.g. Speakeasy and Cyberion) have Acceptable Use Policies that allow wireless sharing of Internet connections, so there is no contractual difficulty.</p><p>On start-up, each Roofnet node checks to see if it can reach the Internet through its Ethernet port: it asks for an IP address as a DHCP client, and then tries to connect to some well-known Internet servers. If this succeeds, the node advertises itself to Roofnet as an Internet gateway. Otherwise the node acts as a DHCP server and default router for hosts on its Ethernet, and connects to the Internet via Roofnet.</p><p>Each gateway acts as a NAT for connections from Roofnet to the Internet, rewriting the source address of packets coming from Roofnet with the IP address of the gateway's Ethernet interface.</p><p>When a node sends traffic through Roofnet to the Internet, the node selects the gateway to which it has the best route metric. The node keeps track of which gateway is being used for each open TCP connection, because the gateway's use of NAT requires each connection to use a single gateway. If the routing protocol later decides that a different gateway has the best metric, the node continues to forward data on existing TCP connections to those connections' original gateways.</p><p>Each new TCP connection uses the gateway with the best metric when the connection starts. If a Roofnet gateway fails, existing TCP connections through that gateway will fail (because of the NAT), but new connections will use a different gateway.</p><p>Roofnet currently has four Internet gateways. Two are located in ordinary residences, one is on the roof of a sixstory university building, and the last is in a ninth-story window of another university building.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Routing Protocol</head><p>Roofnet's routing protocol, Srcr, tries to find the highestthroughput route between any pair of Roofnet nodes. Omnidirectional antennas give Srcr many choices of links it could use, but since most links are low-quality, Srcr must evaluate each link's usable throughput. Srcr's design is motivated by recent measurement studies of real-world wireless behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">14]</ref>.</p><p>Srcr source-routes data packets, like DSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>, in order to avoid routing loops when link metrics change. Each Srcr node maintains a partial database of link metrics between other pairs of nodes (see Section 2.4), and uses Dijkstra's algorithm on that database to find routes. Nodes learn fresh link metrics in three ways. A node that forwards a packet over a link includes the link's current metric in the packet's source route, so that other nodes on the route can see the metric. If a node needs to originate a packet but cannot find a route with its current database contents, it sends a DSRstyle flooded query and adds the link metrics learned from any responses to its database. Finally, nodes that overhear queries and responses add the metrics in those packets to their databases.</p><p>This combination of link-state and DSR-style on demand querying was inspired by MCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>. It is particularly efficient when most nodes talk only to a gateway. Each Roofnet gateway periodically floods a dummy query that allows all other nodes to learn about links on the way to that gateway. When a node sends data to a gateway, the gateway will learn (from the source routed data packets) about links back to the node. Thus in ordinary operation nodes do not ever need to send flooded queries.</p><p>One problem with the above scheme is that flooded queries often do not follow the best route <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>. Srcr addresses this problem as follows. When a node receives a new query it first adds the link metric information in the query's source route to its link database. Then the node computes the best route from the query's source, and replaces the query's source route with that best route. Finally the node re-broadcasts the query. If the node later receives another copy of the query and is able to compute a best route with a lower metric, it will forward the query again with the new best route. In practice, most nodes forward a query only once or twice. A larger or denser network than Roofnet in which nodes send data to many destinations might require a more scalable query mechanism.</p><p>Link conditions may change so that an active route is no longer the best route. If a link on an active route stops forwarding packets altogether, the upstream node will send a notification back to each failed packet's source. If a link on an active route merely degrades, sources using that link will learn of the link's new metric from forwarded data packets. A source re-runs Dijkstra's algorithm on its database whenever it learns of a changed link metric, so the source will switch routes if it knows about a better one. If a link changes to have a better metric, sources that might want to use that link can learn about it either through dummy queries from gateways, or by a mechanism in which nodes forwarding data packets include unsolicited link metric information about nearby links.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Routing Metric</head><p>Srcr chooses routes with an "estimated transmission time" (ETT) metric, derived from estimated transmission count (ETX) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>. ETT predicts the total amount of time it would take to send a data packet along a route, taking into account each link's highest-throughput transmit bit-rate and its delivery probability at that bit-rate. Srcr chooses the route with the lowest ETT, since that route is likely to be able to deliver the most packets per unit time.</p><p>Each Roofnet node sends periodic 1500-byte broadcasts at each available 802.11 bit-rate, and periodic minimumsize broadcasts at one megabit/second. Nodes keep track of the fraction of these broadcasts that they receive from each neighbor, and report the statistics back to each neighbor. Srcr predicts that a link's highest-throughput bit-rate is the bit-rate with the highest product of delivery probability and bit-rate. Delivery probability at a bit-rate is the product of the fraction of 1500-byte broadcasts delivered and the fraction of 60-byte one megabit/second broadcasts delivered in the reverse direction, to account for lost 802.11 ACKs.</p><p>The ETT metric for a given link is the expected time to successfully send a 1500-byte packet at that link's highestthroughput bit-rate, including the time for the number of retransmissions predicted by the measured delivery probabilities. The ETT metric for a route is the sum of the ETTs for each of the route's links. That is, Srcr assumes the following relation between the throughputs ti of a route's hops and the route's end-to-end throughput t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t = 1 P i 1 t i (1)</formula><p>This relation is reasonably accurate for short routes where at most one hop can send at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>. It underestimates throughput for longer routes in which distant hops can send concurrently without interfering, and overestimates throughput when transmissions on different hops collide and are lost. Section 3.7 examines the accuracy of Equation 1.</p><p>ETT is similar to WCETT <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>. ETT uses broadcast probes to predict transmission time, while WCETT directly measures ETT using unicast packets between each pair of nodes. ETT is likely to be less accurate than WCETT, but has lower measurement overhead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Bit-Rate Selection</head><p>Roofnet has its own algorithm to choose among the 802.11b transmit bit-rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 megabits/second. The algorithm included in the Prism firmware tends to avoid using bit-rates with significant loss-rates, a policy which performs badly on Roofnet. The highest-throughput routes often involve links with relatively high link-level loss rates, since a single-hop route with 40% loss can deliver more data than a two-hop route with perfect links. In addition, because the 802.11b bit-rates are at roughly power-of-two intervals, a high bit-rate with up to 50% loss is preferable to the next-lowest bit-rate.</p><p>Roofnet's algorithm, called SampleRate <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9]</ref>, adjusts the bit-rate as it sends data packets over a link. Like ETT, SampleRate judges which bit-rate will provide the highest throughput based on delivery probabilities measured at the different bit-rates. Unlike ETT, SampleRate bases its decisions on actual data transmissions rather than on periodic broadcast probes. As a result SampleRate can adjust its choice more quickly and accurately than ETT.</p><p>SampleRate sends most data packets at the bit-rate it currently believes will provide the highest throughput. Sam-pleRate periodically sends a data packet at some other bitrate in order to update a record of each bit-rate's delivery probability. SampleRate switches to a different bitrate if the throughput estimate based on that bit-rate's recorded delivery probability is higher than the current bitrate's throughput.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EVALUATION</head><p>This section characterizes the end-to-end performance of Roofnet and the impact of some of its architectural choices.</p><p>Section 3.2 presents basic measurements of throughput and latency over the network. Over all pairs, throughput averages 627 kbits/second, and round-trip latency averages 39 milliseconds. Transfers from the Internet gateways ran at an average of 1395 kbits/second, with an average latency of 22 milliseconds.</p><p>Next the paper investigates the effects of three choices in the unplanned mesh architecture. Section 3.3 studies how Srcr makes use of the large number of links afforded by omni-directional antennas. Most links are between 500 and 1500 meters long and have throughputs of less than 500 kbits/second; however, Srcr largely ignores them and uses a relatively small number of shorter links that run at two or more megabits/second. The median link-level loss rate of the links Srcr chooses is 20%. Section 3.4 explores the effect of node density on connectivity and throughput, by evaluating different-size subsets of the Roofnet nodes. These data provide a feel for how well other mesh deployments with different node densities might work. Section 3.5 assesses how Roofnet takes advantage of a highly connected mesh. Most Roofnet nodes route through many neighbors. The mesh is robust in the sense that no small set of links contributes disproportionately to overall throughput.</p><p>Section 3.6 compares multi-hop routing with a single-hop architecture that resembles an access-point network. With only single-hop forwarding, five well-placed gateways would be required to cover all Roofnet nodes, and even more would be required to match the average throughput that multi-hop Roofnet provides.</p><p>Finally, Section 3.7 presents measurements suggesting that inter-hop collisions are a major limiting factor in multi-hop throughput.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Method</head><p>The results presented here are derived from four sets of measurements on Roofnet:</p><p>1. The "multi-hop TCP" data-set is the result of a 15second one-way bulk TCP transfer between each pair of Roofnet nodes. Throughput is measured by the number of data bytes delivered to the receiving application. Each transfer is preceded by a 30-second quiet interval and then ten seconds in which the sender sends 84-byte pings once per second to establish the route and measure latency. The throughput result and the median round-trip ping time are recorded along with the route in use at the end of the transfer. The measurements are taken with RTS/CTS disabled; measurements with RTS/CTS enabled are presented in Section 3.7.</p><p>About 10% of pairs failed to find a working route in the multi-hop TCP measurements. The reason for this is that flooded routing queries sometimes do not reach distant nodes due to link losses: the query packets are broadcast without link-layer retransmission. Srcr refloods every five seconds if needed, but in many cases even this was not enough. The failed pairs are included in the throughput results with throughputs of zero.</p><p>2. The "single-hop TCP" data-set is the result of measuring the TCP throughput on the direct radio link between each pair of nodes.</p><p>3. The "loss matrix" data-set is the result of measuring the loss rate between each pair of nodes using 1500-byte broadcasts at each 802.11b transmit bitrate. These loss rates reflect underlying link losses, since 802.11 does not retransmit broadcast packets.</p><p>4. The "multi-hop density" data-set measures multi-hop TCP throughput between a fixed set of four nodes, while varying the number of Roofnet nodes that are participating in routing.</p><p>Some of the analyses involve simulated route throughput calculated from the single-hop TCP data-set and Equation 1. This technique allows us to estimate the throughput of paths that were not used by the all-pairs TCP measurements.</p><p>Each graph's caption ends with the data-set from which the graph was derived, in parentheses, and says "Simulated" when appropriate.</p><p>Roofnet ordinarily provides Internet access to its users, and this service was not disabled during these experiments. Thus the experiments may be affected by Roofnet traffic as well as other uses of the 2.4 gigahertz ISM band.</p><p>Most of the results presented below include all pairs of Roofnet nodes, rather than just communication with the gateways. This is because the Internet performance Roofnet users see is highly dependent on the specifics of Roofnet's Internet gateways, which in a community network would probably be randomly placed.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Basic Performance</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the distribution of TCP throughputs among all pairs of Roofnet nodes. The median is 400 kbits/second, and the average is 627.</p><p>The distribution of throughputs is explained largely by hop-count, as successive nodes in a multi-hop route usually must defer to each others' transmissions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> arranges the throughput data by hop-count in order to illustrate this point. The routes with low hop-count have much higher throughput than those with many hops.</p><p>For comparison, Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows the theoretical maximum throughput for various bit-rates over multiple lossless hops. This table is computed with Equation 1. Per-link throughputs include transmission time, inter-frame gaps, and linklevel acknowledgments.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table">2</ref> suggest that Roofnet's one-hop routes operate at an average speed consistent with the 5.5 megabit transmission rate, but that longer routes are disproportionately slower. Section 3.7 suggests that multi-hop routes suffer from inter-hop collisions and have lower performance than predicted by Equation 1. Most Roofnet users talk only to the Internet gateway with the best metric, and thus use routes with fewer hops than the average of the all-pairs routes. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows the TCP throughput to each node from its chosen gateway, again arranged by hop-count. The maximum hop-count is only five because no node is very far from the nearest gateway. The average throughput for each hop-count is typically higher because the Roofnet gateways happen to be more centrally located than the average Roofnet node. Even at four hops, the average of 379 kbits/second is comparable to many DSL links.</p><p>The tables also show round-trip latencies for 84-byte ping packets to estimate interactive delay on a relatively idle network. Latency is affected by per-hop processing time as well as by 802.11 retransmissions and back-offs when packets are lost. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> suggest that interactive latency is acceptable over a few hops but would be bothersome over nine hops. Roofnet users see on average 22 ms of latency to the gateways, which is hardly noticeable in an interactive session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Link Quality and Distance</head><p>While high quality 802.11 links can be constructed using directional antennas, it is not clear what useful ranges and speeds to expect with omni-directional antennas, or what kinds of links will be most useful to the routing protocol.</p><p>The upper graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the throughput and distance of each available link. Most of the available links are between 500 and 1300 meters long, and can transfer about 500 kbits/second at their best bit-rate. There are also a small number of links a few hundred meters long with throughputs of two megabits/second or more, and a few longer high-throughput links.</p><p>The lower graph shows just the links that Srcr uses in some route. Srcr uses almost all of the links faster than two megabits/second, but largely ignores the majority of the links, which are slower than that. This means that Srcr effectively favors short links of a few hundred meters, ignoring many links that would carry packets a kilometer or more in one hop. Fast short hops are the best policy: for example, four 250-meter hops that individually run at three megabits/second yield a route with a throughput of 750 kbits/second, which is faster than most of the single 1000-meter links.</p><p>A link's throughput is determined by its best transmit bitrate and the delivery probability at that bit-rate. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the CDF of delivery probabilities for the links used by Srcr at the bit-rate chosen by SampleRate. The median delivery probability is 0.8, and nearly a quarter of the links have loss rates of 50% or more. Section 2.5 justifies the use of links and bit-rates with significant loss rates, as opposed to favoring low-loss links. 802.11 detects the losses with its ACK mechanism and re-sends the packets; this decreases throughput but has little perceptible effect on latency, since the retransmissions occur within a few milliseconds. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Effect of Density</head><p>Mesh networks are only effective if the node density is sufficiently high. This section examines the effects of density by simulating different size subsets of Roofnet; subset size and density are roughly proportional, since the network area is about the same for all subsets.</p><p>The simulations function as follows. For each subset size n, a random set of n Roofnet nodes are selected. An estimate of the multi-hop throughput between every pair in the subset is computed, using only members of the subset as potential forwarders. The throughputs are estimated along the route that gives the highest throughput with Equation 1 and the single-hop TCP data-set.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows the simulation results. The x axes show the subset size. The top graph shows the fraction of node pairs in the subset that are connected by a route that provides throughput of more than one kilobyte per second. The middle graph shows the average throughput over all pairs. The bottom graph shows the average hop-count of the routes. The ticks in each vertical line show 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles over 100 random subsets.</p><p>The network only starts to approach all-pairs connectivity when there are more than 20 nodes, corresponding to a density of about five nodes per square kilometer. As the number of nodes increases, the average throughput also increases. The increase in hop-count in the third graph suggests the reason: a denser network offers a wider choice of short high-quality links, though using them causes routes to have more hops.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Mesh Robustness</head><p>This section investigates the benefits of the routing choices afforded by a mesh architecture and omni-directional antennas.</p><p>The most immediate measure of a mesh network's robustness is the number of potentially useful neighbors each node has. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows a histogram of the number of neighbors for each node, where a neighbor is defined as a node to which the delivery probability is 40% or more. Most nodes have  The simulated effects of node density on connectivity and throughput. The x axes show the number of nodes in the network. From top to bottom, the y axes show the fraction of node pairs that achieve throughput of more than one kilobyte per second; the average throughput over all pairs; and the average hop-count. Each bar shows the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile over 100 random subsets. Increasing density causes the network to be more highly connected, and increases the average throughput; higher density allows routes to be constructed from shorter, higher-quality hops. (Simulated from single-hop TCP)  (multi-hop TCP) many neighbors, though there are a few poorly-connected nodes.</p><p>If a node never routes through one of its neighbors, the neighbor's value is questionable. For example, if most nodes routed through only one or two neighbors, it might be worth using directional antennas pointing just at those neighbors. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows a histogram of the number of unique first hop neighbors used by each node when routing to all the other nodes in the network. While some nodes do indeed route through only one or two neighbors, the majority of nodes use many more neighbors. In this sense Roofnet makes good use of the mesh architecture in ordinary routing.</p><p>Another aspect of robustness is the extent to which the network is vulnerable to the loss of its most valuable links. The graphs in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows how the average throughput and connectivity among all pairs decreases as individual links are deleted. The results are simulated with Equation 1 and the single-hop TCP data-set. Each line shows the cumulative effect of a different deletion order. Most Effect deletes the link whose absence decreases average throughput the most; Long x Fast deletes the link with the highest product of distance and throughput; Fastest deletes the link with the highest link throughput; and the Random line shows the average of 40 simulations in which links were deleted in random orders.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows that the best few links contribute noticeably to average throughput, but that dozens of the best links must be eliminated before throughput is reduced by half. The fastest links are generally more important than the long/fast links for throughput, though the first few long/fast links are more important than the fastest links, and both kinds are disproportionately important (deleting them lowers throughput faster than deleting random links). On the other hand, the long/fast links are more important for connectivity than the fastest links.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> shows the effect on throughput of cumulatively eliminating the best-connected nodes. The throughputs are from the multi-hop density data set. The best-connected nodes are identified by looking for the nodes that appear in the most all-pairs routes.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> shows that the best two nodes are important for performance, since losing both decreases the average throughput by 43%. The penalties for losing more nodes are more gradual.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Architectural Alternatives</head><p>One way to evaluate Roofnet's architecture is to compare it to a network in which each node must communicate over a direct radio link to a gateway, without multi-hop routing. This corresponds to an access-point network. In such a single-hop network the number and placement of the gateways is important, since there must be a gateway near every node. This section evaluates the extent to which multi-hop routing improves performance and allows greater freedom in gateway placement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1">Optimal Choice</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> compares multi-hop and single-hop routing for increasing numbers of "optimally" chosen gateways. For single-hop, each successive gateway is the node that maximizes the number of additional nodes with non-zero throughput to some gateway, with ties broken by average throughput. The multi-hop gateways are chosen similarly, but with multi-hop connectivity and multi-hop throughput. The GWs column indicates the number of gateways. The Conn columns show the number of nodes which have non-zero throughput to at least one gateway. The Throughput columns show the average over these connected nodes of the throughput to each node's best gateway.</p><p>The data show that, in a single-hop architecture, five gateways are needed to cover all Roofnet nodes. For any given set of gateways, multi-hop forwarding provides higher average throughput. Multi-hop has a throughput advantage because it can often use a sequence of short high-quality links rather than a single long low-quality link.</p><p>The five optimal gateways turn out to be nodes located on three-story residences, not the tallest buildings in the network. This may be due to tallest buildings' locations around the network's perimeter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2">Random Choice</head><p>It is likely that a community network would not be able to choose the best nodes to act as wired gateways, but would choose them more or less randomly. mance for different numbers of randomly-selected gateways.</p><p>For each number of gateways, the set of gateways was chosen by considering 250 distinct sets of that size and choosing the median set where the sets were sorted by the number of connected nodes, and ties were broken by the median average throughput. The reason that not all nodes are connected with small numbers of multi-hop gateways is the query failure problem mentioned in Section 3.1. If Roofnet were a single-hop network, 25 gateways would be required to cover all the nodes. About 90% of the nodes are covered with 10 gateways, but there are a few nodes which are difficult to reach: the histogram in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows these last ten percent of nodes are within the range of three or fewer neighboring nodes. As with optimal gateway choice, multi-hop routing improves connectivity and throughput.</p><p>Comparison of the two tables shows that careful gateway choice increases throughput for both multi-hop and singlehop routing. For five or fewer gateways, even randomly chosen multi-hop gateways provide better performance than carefully chosen single-hop gateways. For larger numbers of gateways, however, carefully chosen single-hop gateways are better than randomly-chosen multi-hop gateways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Inter-hop Interference</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that throughput with each additional hop falls off faster than one might expect. The average singlehop route provides 2451 kbits/second. One would expect two-hop throughput to be half that, or 1225 kbits/second. Instead, the average two-hop route delivers 771 kbits/second.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> shows this phenomenon more clearly. Each point on the graph represents one node pair. pair of nodes. The x-value shows the throughput predicted along that route by Equation 1 and the single-hop TCP data-set. The expected throughputs for single-hop routes (most of the points above 2000 kbits/second) differ from the measurements, but the errors are not biased, since the predictions are themselves a separate set of measurements. In contrast, the measured multi-hop throughputs are mostly lower than expected. A likely explanation of why links are slower together than separately is that concurrent transmissions on different hops of a route collide and cause packet loss. Informal experiments in which the sender delays each packet to give the previous packet time to reach the destination lead to increased throughput, which supports this hypothesis. Similar observations have been made by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The 802.11 RTS/CTS mechanism is intended to prevent these collisions. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows the effect of RTS/CTS on throughput, measured between a random subset of node pairs. RTS/CTS does not improve performance. This is consistent with existing observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[33]</ref>.</p></div>

The gateway's radio was busy for a total of about 59,374 seconds during the 24-hour period. This total includes time for packets and retransmissions received, packets and retransmissions sent, and transmissions overheard by the gateway that were not addressed to it. The total does not include inter-frame spacing and back-off time. This means the gateway's radio was busy for about 70% of the monitoring period.</p><p>Almost all of the packets forwarded were TCP; less than 1% were UDP. Web requests to the Internet comprised only about 7% of the bytes transferred. The biggest consumer of bandwidth, accounting for about 30% of the total data transferred, was the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file-sharing program. Most of the rest of the traffic consisted of short connections to other unprivileged ports.</p><p>While web requests accounted for a minority of the data transferred, they did account for more connections than any other application: 68% of the connections through the gateway were web connections. Just 3% were BitTorrent.</p><p>During the 24-hour period, there were 16 Roofnet hosts that accessed the Internet; eight opened more than 100 TCP connections to the Internet during that time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper outlines the design and evaluates the performance of an urban rooftop 802.11b mesh network. The network's architecture favors ease of deployment in its use of omni-directional antennas, self-configuring software, and link-quality-aware multi-hop routing. Through the participation of volunteers, the network has grown to 37 nodes in the course of a year, with little administrative or installation effort on the part of the researchers.</p><p>An evaluation of network performance shows that the unplanned mesh architecture of Roofnet works well: average throughput between nodes is 627 kbits/second, and the entire network is well served by just a few Internet gateways whose position is determined by convenience.
