<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Passive brain-computer interaction (BCI) can provide useful information to understand a user's state and anticipate intentions, which is needed to support adaptivity and personalization. Given the huge variety of audiences, a game's capability of adapting to different user profiles-in particular to keep the player in flow-is crucial to make it ever more enjoyable and satisfying. We have performed a user experiment exploiting a four-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) tool similar to the ones that are soon likely to appear in the market for game control. We have performed a spectral characterization of the video-gaming experience, also in comparison with other tasks. Results show that the most informative frequency bands for discriminating among gaming conditions are around low beta. Simple signals from the peripheral nervous system add marginal information. Classification of three levels of user states is possible, with good accuracy, using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A user-independent classification performs worse than a user-dependent approach (50.1% versus 66.4% rate). Personalized SVM training and validation time is reasonable (7-8 min). Thus, we argue that a personalized system could be implemented in a consumer context and research should aim at improving classifiers that can be trained online by end users.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>B RAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE (BCI) technologies are an emerging means of interaction between users and systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Born in the medical domain, in particular offering assistive tools for users who suffer from neurological and muscular disorders, BCIs are now being introduced in various fields (e.g., education, gaming, transport) dealing with human-factor challenges in design, ergonomics, safety, and security <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The potential of BCIs is huge because they are able not only to provide an additional channel for controlling a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, but also to monitor a user's state in a continuous and quantitative way. In fact, while several BCI applications implement direct device control (active BCI, for instance, in gaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and wheelchair driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), a trend is emerging also in user-state monitoring (passive BCI), which looks promising and practical <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. BCI technologies, in fact, can provide a particularly useful data source to understand a user's state (alertness, mental workload, fatigue, attentiveness, stress, etc.) and anticipate intentions, which is needed to support adaptivity and personalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Moreover, user state monitoring does not need the high reliability and strict real-time responsiveness that are required to substitute mouse and keyboard as a user input tool.</p><p>van Erp et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provide an overview of the BCI research field. The paper, also referring to the work carried out within the Future Brain/Neuronal Computer Interaction 1 European research project, proposes some key actions for the BCI research agenda. Among these, we highlight the following points that represent major drivers of our research work:</p><p>• focus on BCI for user state assessment (rather than on direct device control), for the aforementioned reasons; • identification of near-term killer applications to drive research &amp; development; • need to get hands-on experience and feedback by implementing BCIs outside controlled laboratory environments; • need to support integration of BCI with existing gaming hardware and software. Given the huge variety of audiences-i.e., in terms of abilities, tastes, and gaming styles-a game's capability of adapting to different user profiles is considered key to making it ever more enjoyable and satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In particular, a game should be able to keep appeal, enjoyment, and attention, while preventing boredom, a problem which tends to appear especially if a game's difficulty does not scale with time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is relevant in this regard, as it represents a highly enjoyable mental state where the player is fully immersed and engaged in the process of activity. In flow, the emotions are positive and aligned with the task at hand. For this reason, keeping the player in a flow state is considered as one of the most important game design issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A consequent research issue is how to measure the player flow status during the game, ideally with no invasiveness. In fact, using questionnaires (either on paper or electronic) requires interrupting the game and leads to variable subjective values. Also, in-game embedded quizzes risk being intrusive if they are not properly designed for a good integration within the game play <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Moreover, participants may report their belief in general, but may not reflect the experiences of the moment while playing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In the current period of BCI transition from isolated demonstrations to systematic research and commercial development <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we envisage that passive BCI hardware and middleware could become a standard computer module, dedicated to user state monitoring for the sake of adaptivity. Also, given its access to the wider public, the entertainment arena could introduce new concepts and paradigms, gathering significant requirements and feedback from prolonged use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In light of these considerations, we believe that it is urgent to clearly define the field of BCI for user monitoring in games, in particular concerning the fundamental feature of enjoyment/flow and with tools reasonably near to the market. Our work focuses on this and intends in particular to exploit a simple commercial neurophysiological measurement tool, the Elemaya Visual Energy Tester. 2 We aim to undertake extensive analysis in order to answer some fundamental questions, such as the following: What is the neural spectral characterization of a game play activity? Is it possible to distinguish among the situations of boredom, flow, and frustration? What are the distinctive features?</p><p>We have employed an electroencephalogram (EEG), as it is the most common tool in the game market. Because of the player's movements, the EEG also records artifacts. We have not discarded them in our analysis because, as we will see, they represent only 5% of the signal and we do not want to discard potentially useful information about user movements. Since our work is game-application oriented, our analysis is not clinical. We do speak about BCI since, it is the prevalent component, but, more precisely, our focus is on the use of the EEG as a tool for player state assessment.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the background and related works. Section III details the procedures of the experiment, while Section IV presents and discusses the results. Conclusions are drawn in the final section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Player Modeling</head><p>The traditional approaches for modeling player's enjoyment in games are qualitative and mostly rely on psychology, where two major lines can be identified. The first one follows the Malone's principles of intrinsic motivation in instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In particular, Malone and Lepper <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have identified four major components of individual motivation that contribute to the exceptional appeal of computer-based gaming, namely: challenge, curiosity, control, and fantasy.</p><p>The second line concerns the theory of flow, based on Csikszentmihalyi's foundational concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The flow model involves eight major components: a challenging activity requiring skill; a merging of action and awareness; clear goals; direct, immediate feedback; concentration on the task at hand; a sense of control; a loss of self-consciousness; and an altered sense of time. Flow was first employed to measure engagement in an educational game in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Sweetser and Wyeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> drew together various heuristics present in the literature into a concise 2 http://www.elemaya.com/ model, the GameFlow, consisting of eight elements: concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. The GameFlow criteria were shown to be able to distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. Cowley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> investigated the mapping of the flow construct onto the game play. In particular, they have proposed a practical, integrated approach for analyzing the mechanics and aesthetics of game play, while also supporting adaptivity. As the result of more than three decades of commercial competition, most of today's video games deliberately include and leverage the eight components of flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>O'Broin <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> highlights that most games adequately meet two primary elements of flow-clear goal and feedback-but the balancing of game challenges and player skills is often lacking. In order to maintain a user's flow experience, the game's activity must balance both the inherent challenge and the player's ability to address and overcome it <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. If the challenge is beyond that ability, the activity becomes so overwhelming that it generates anxiety. On the other hand, if the challenge fails to engage the player, the player loses interest and quickly tends to get bored. However, designing such a balance becomes a greater challenge as the size of the potential audience grows, which is the typical case of video games. Most games presently offer only a single narrow, static experience, which might keep the typical player in the flow, but may not be fun for the hardcore or the novice player. Several choice possibilities should be given to the player to adapt to different users' personal flow zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. But simply increasing the number of choices is costly, and an excessive number of choices risks overwhelming or annoying the user, because of the frequent interruptions. This compromises the fundamental components of flow-a sense of control and concentration on the task at hand. The best way for designers to avoid these counterproductive situations is to embed the player choices into the core activities of the interactive experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and/or to make the game automatically adaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, in particular through player state assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which is a major driver of our paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. BCI Technologies</head><p>BCI technologies include a range of hardware tools used for brain activity signal acquisition, such as (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>): electrocorticography (ECoG), intracortical electrodes (ICE), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electroencephalography (EEG). ECoG and ICE require implanting sensors, which is not feasible for nonmedical applications; fNIRS and fMRI have high spatial but poor temporal resolution and are either technically or economically unsuitable for extra-laboratory use; MEG and EEG have very good temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution. MEG's bulkiness and expensiveness make it unsuited for nonmedical applications. For these reasons, EEG-despite clear usability and accuracy limits-is the most widely applied brain measurement technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Another extensive state-of-the-art review of BCIs, in particular focusing on the control aspects, has been recently published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Beside experimental and research-dedicated devices, commercial products have also appeared on the market, in particular in the entertainment field (e.g., Emotiv, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> IntendiX, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">4</ref> Neurosky, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref>Uncle Milton <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, MindGames,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref> Mattel<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref> ), and others are likely to come soon <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Quantitative Estimation of Player State Through BCI</head><p>The exploitation of tools for neurophysiological measurements have opened the possibility of a quantitative estimation of player states relevant to the learning.</p><p>Studying 14 teenagers playing a video game, Pellouchoud et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> observed similar responses elicited by increased mental load in normal adult population. In particular, using a 115 channel EEG, they report an increase in the amplitude of frontal midline theta (6-7 Hz), as well as an attenuation in the posterior alpha band (9-12 Hz) and in the central mu (10-13 Hz) rhythm, with respect to an open-eyes resting condition.</p><p>Similarly, a high-resolution (128 channels) EEG study of dynamic brain activity during video-game play was conducted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, with two users playing for a total of over 60 min (with 3-min rest periods every 10 min of play). Results revealed a frontal midline theta-wave activity increase and parietal alphawave initial decrease, followed by a slow increase (only alpha and theta waves were considered).</p><p>Derbali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> have shown that motivational factors in a serious game seem to elicit specific physiological trends in learners, especially observable in the EEG attention ratios (i.e., the theta/low-beta wave ratio).</p><p>Investigating the field of "affective ludology," a research area concerned with the physiological measurement of affective responses to player-game interaction, Nacke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have studied the impact of level design on brainwave activity measured with EEG and on player experience measured with questionnaires. The paper investigates three conditions (boredom, flow, and immersion) and reports some EEG indicators, in particular the fact that the immersion-level design elicits more activity in the theta band, which may support a relationship between virtual spatial navigation/exploration and theta activity.</p><p>Babiloni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> analyzed the concurrent brain activities of small groups of people interacting in social cooperation or competition, identifying different activated areas and frequency bands, according to the different physical or reasoning activities.</p><p>Neurofeedback (or biofeedback, in the case where peripheral nervous system's signals are also considered) presents the user with real-time feedback on the recorded neuro/biosignals. Some games have been developed that rely on neurofeedback, for instance, to support the balancing of waves from the two cerebral hemispheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> and improve concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. Coyle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> successfully experimented a new BCI-based game training paradigm which enables assessment of continuous control performance.</p><p>Girouard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have used an experimental fNIRS system to distinguish, in particular in terms of cognitive workload, two levels of difficulty of the Pacman game. Our approach is similar, but our contribution to the advancement of the state of the art is mainly in the following two directions: we use a portable commercial EEG and are interested to check if more levels of boredom/flow can be detected through a state of the art classifier.</p><p>Chanel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> investigated the use of affective information from neurophysiological signals (EEG and peripheral nervous system) in order to maintain a player's involvement through game difficulty adaptation. After confirming that their three different levels correspond to distinguishable emotions (boredom, engagement, and anxiety), the authors trained several classifiers to automatically detect the three emotional classes in a player-independent framework.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> presented the first work showing that affect-based dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) is able to enhance gaming experience compared to DDA without physiology (i.e., only based on player's performance). The system analyzes a player's physiological signals (heartbeat, temperature, electromyography) to infer his probable anxiety level.</p><p>Our approach is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and we compare approaches and outcomes in detail in Section IV-D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS AND PROCEDURES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Test Game</head><p>In order to recreate flow, boredom, and anxiety/frustration conditions, we have developed a simple plane battle video game and selected appropriate levels. We envisaged that a fast-paced level could create flow conditions, for young adults, and organized preliminary lab tests with a few selected users, supervised by the authors, in order to tune the game features. The other two levels were designed by scaling some parameters (e.g., number of enemies and their speed) in order to induce conditions of boredom and anxiety.</p><p>More precisely, the levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) featured the following characteristics. Level 1 (L1), designed for boredom (i.e., the level of challenge was lower than the estimated user ability), was characterized by a black background, the absence of displayed score, and the simultaneous presence on the screen of up to two firing enemy planes. The objective of the game, the same for all levels, was to maximize the score by destroying the enemy planes and avoiding penalties due to being killed.</p><p>Level 2 (L2), designed for flow, involved a simultaneous density of enemy planes ranging from 3 to 15. This level introduced the bonuses (colored blocks that the player plane had to collect in order to increase its bullets' power). In order to avoid an adaptation effect, difficulty was slightly scaled every minute. The score was displayed and the background represented an aerial view of the city of Genoa.</p><p>Level 3 (L3), designed for anxiety due to the huge difficulty of the challenge, involved an overwhelming quantity of firing enemy planes, so that it was impossible to avoid being quickly killed. The density of simultaneous planes ranged from 20 to 35. The impact on the player was terrific, leading to unexpected reactions, such as playing without engaging, or laughing or leaving the game, as happened in early lab tests. To avoid this, the instruction screen at the beginning of the game invited players to find good strategy for survival. In fact, due to the overwhelming difficulty of the context, the major goal of this level was to avoid being killed, by finding a good position on the screen. However, no strategy was actually possible, so every attempt would lead to frustration. This frustration was increased because, after being killed, the player plane had to restart from a fixed position, thus nullifying all the previous efforts made by the player to find a safer position on the screen. The background was black and the score displayed.</p><p>The three levels involve different visual information (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This introduces some confounding elements in our analysis, but we have considered it necessary for a proper level design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Test Users</head><p>Twenty three test users were recruited on a voluntary basis among engineering Master and Ph.D. students. After the tests, we discarded the results of one participant because his responses, and questionnaire answers, were not considered to be reliable. So, hereafter, we refer to a population of size 22. Of this, 17 were male (77%) and five were female (23%). The average age was 26.3 (standard deviation 5.5). Of this, 55% claimed to be very familiar with video games, 36% familiar, and 9% unfamiliar. Eighteen of them were right handed and five were left handed.</p><p>Given the players' various ability levels, reaching the flow condition required a different game challenge level for different players. For this reason, we made the three game levels parametric, by implementing three sublevels for each level. In particular, at the beginning of his/her test session, every user performed a tuning test on a very simple obstacle avoidance car race (on a straight road, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which is a game typology similar to the plane battle, but not the same, in order to avoid side effects. On the basis of this presession score, each user was assigned to one sublevel. In order to tune and validate the design of the game levels, we prepared a self-assessment questionnaire for checking the subjective perception. In fact, we designed levels for generating states of boredom, flow, and frustration. And we trained the classification system based on these designs, not the players' perceptions, in order to associate the measured neurophysiological values to actual in-game differences. However, we needed to check that the designed game levels were appropriate.</p><p>The questionnaire (inspired by the game engagement questionnaire (GEQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>) consisted of six questions, on a 1-5 Likert scale. Three questions were about elements of flow (concentration, control, and perceived length of time), and one about the self-assessment of the boredom, flow, or frustration condition, respectively. Free comments were also invited.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the scores of the self-assessed flow and no-flow conditions in the three game levels, after removing a baseline value. Removal was necessary because most of the players found all game levels engaging (average score of the flow condition was: 2.9, 3.5, and 2.9 in the three levels, respectively). L1 and L3 scores are significantly different after a one-way ANOVA test , while there was no significant difference between the flow and no-flow scores in L2, as can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We fully expected L2, which was designed to provide a flow condition, to be more difficult to detect automatically, in particular because a certain degree of enjoyment was perceived by the players even in L1 and L3. But this is a normal condition in any good game, and we have to consider it.</p><p>All tests were supervised by one researcher, who was responsible for setting up the system, in particular for placing belt with the sensors in the right position on the user's scalp. Supervisors also took notes during the test, in order to record each user's behavior and report the actual conditions.</p><p>All tests were performed in a laboratory. For each test, a user had to play a level for 4 min, answer the level questionnaire, rest for 30 s with closed eyes, and then start the next level, until the end. For simplicity, the order of levels was not pseudorandomized over subjects, which is a limitation of our study. However, we performed a preliminary test that excluded systematic effects such as amplifier drifts or changing electrode impedances due to dry out of gel. At the beginning of each level, a very short introduction text was displayed about the goals and rules. The level length has been decided as a tradeoff between the number of samples that can be obtained, which should be as large as possible for machine learning to be effective, and the length of the test which should be excessive in order not to overload the player.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Equipment</head><p>In order to simulate the hardware devices that are soon likely to appear on the consumer market as game controllers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, our experimental environment exploits a relatively simple portable commercial tool, the Elemaya Visual Energy Tester. The tool, which has been designed for research and bio/neurofeedback, includes a four-electrode EEG, one galvanic skin resistance (GSR) channel, and one heart-rate (HR) channel. The EEG electrodes comprise two frontal (positions F7 and F8 in the 10-20 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>) and two temporal (T5 and T6), placed on a belt that the user wears on his head. The system requires conductive gel between the sensors and the scalp (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>The HR measurement employs a photoplethysmo sensor, attached to a finger, to measure pulse rate and the amount of blood in each pulse. The GSR sensor measures the changes in the sweat and gland activity on the surface of the skin and is worn on a finger. All signals are sampled synchronously at 120 Hz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Dealing With Artifacts</head><p>In clinical settings (which is where EEG analysis was born and developed) appropriateness of EEG signal analysis strongly depends on the level of contamination of artifacts in the acquired data. Several physiological factors, different from brain electrical activity, can disrupt the acquisition results from electrodes by adding noise (artifacts) over the brain signal. Examples of artifacts sources are eye blinks, eye movements, head movements, and neck contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. In the medical context, the focus is on identifying the deviations of the brain activity from a standard behavior, in order to diagnose different types of diseases. This requires that the patient be relaxed and motionless in order to accurately acquire just the brain waves. For this reason, several methodologies and algorithms have been developed to remove artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>.</p><p>In a gaming context, however, user movements cannot be restricted. Although activities such as talking and eye blinking do interfere with the EEG signal, they are always present in an ecological setting for game play <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. As a consequence, the presence of artifacts is a normal condition for EEG signals in the area of game adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. Artifacts can also be considered as an additional source of information. In fact, the artifacts are caused by users' movements that can be associated to their state. From literature, we know that the increase in body movement during the game is correlated with the player's engagement level <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. A user's movements would become more intense as the game gets more immersive. However, this information is distinct from brain wave activity. So, it should ideally be detected and processed independently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Signal Preprocessing</head><p>For each participant, EEG data recorded from each channel were transformed into a power spectral density (PSD) using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) applied to each 1-s epoch (120 raw samples). We preliminarily tried to make a 50% overlapping window multiplied by the Hamming function to reduce spectral leakage. But having observed that this does not affect classification performance, we maintained the 1-s window in order not to delay the classification training and testing speed.</p><p>Exploiting the FieldTrip Matlab toolbox for MEG/EEG analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, we performed an artifact rejection heuristic on the extracted PSDs, using a threshold on the signal power, so as to discard the 1-s windows in which the total power was higher than three times the standard deviation of all the PSD windows. Since the percentage of affected samples represented only 5% of the total and the noise introduced alongside the bioelectrical activity generated in the cortex is limited, we decided to proceed without artifact rejection, considering all the aspects of natural settings and avoiding rejection of possible information sources. Moreover, avoidance of artifact rejection simplifies the implementation of an online personalized training system with real-time computation constraints. As anticipated, this approach is not correct from a clinical point of view, but looks suited to exploit the EEG as a tool for user state assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Spectral Band Subdivision</head><p>The electrical signals representing neural activities need to be transformed into features to be classified through machine learning. To this end, we exploited the subdivision into brainwave bandwidths. While the distinction of bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) is well established (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>), their definition in terms of wavelength is not homogeneous in literature, due to the different domain contexts, application purposes, and research questions.</p><p>We have chosen the subdivision presented in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, which was governed by the fact that it features a finer subdivision of the beta band, which is quite large and is generally related to reasoning, alertness, sensorimotor, and mental activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>). This subdivision is adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, with the difference that we restricted gamma to 32 Hz, because of the Elemaya's intrinsic bandwidth limitation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE I BRAINWAVE BANDS</head><p>However, we have also explored different band configurations, as reported in Section IV-B in order to investigate whether different subdivisions can impact the recognition rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Wave Power Analysis</head><p>Our initial step consisted of a preliminary wave power analysis. As a first measurement, we evaluated the total power of the brainwaves at the four electrodes across the three game levels. Results are obtained by averaging all the 1-s segments, on all the test users. Sensor 1 is F7, sensor 2 is F8, sensor 3 is T5, and sensor 4 is T6 in the 10-20 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. As is apparent from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, with the exception of F8, there is a general trend toward a power decrease with increasing game difficulty. Moreover, all the graphics are different in amplitude and slope which suggests the importance of considering all the four sensors covering various brain areas in order to capture different information.</p><p>The subsequent step consists of analyzing the PSDs of the different brainwave bands for the three game levels. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that the main differences are between the alpha and mid-beta bands.</p><p>We performed one ANOVA analysis for each user, each pair of levels, and in all the frequency bands. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the percentages, with respect to all the users (100% all the users), of ANOVA -values. Results confirmed that the most significant differences in most of the users are in the alpha, low-Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. PSD (total from all the EEG channels) of the different brainwave bands for the three game levels. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Percentage, with respect to all the users, of ANOVA -values (one asterisk means ; two asterisks mean ; three asterisks mean ; higher values), for assessing statistical differences in the three pairs of game levels, in each band. beta, and mid-beta bands. L2/L3 and L1/L2 seem more similar to each other, while there are more significant differences in the L1/L3 comparison. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> plots the evolution of the PSDs of all the different bands, averaged over all the four electrodes. The most visually apparent outcome is the huge variance, which highlights the difficulty of finding a simple classification rule. This suggests the need for a more complex machine-learning-based approach.</p><p>The graphics highlight the difference in shape for alpha, lowbeta, and mid-beta bands that distinguish the flow condition (L2) from the other two. Similarly, Pellouchoud et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and Sheikholeslami et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> concluded that alpha wave power attenuates in the video game play. Pellouchoud et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> show a result similar to ours comparing a rest and a game condition, although we also extend the value of the result to the flow and nonflow (both boredom and frustration) game conditions. Sheikholeslami et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> make a long-term (50-min play) time-domain analysis showing a progressive alpha wave attenuation, which we may interpret as an entering of the subject into a flow condition. However, we consider higher frequencies as well (both studies had considered only theta and alpha), and we can observe that the attenuation is even higher for low beta and not present in high beta and gamma. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Classification</head><p>Classification is a fundamental step for EEG signal processing for BCI. Currently, kernel-based methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> are considered the state of the art for this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref> and have been successfully used in a large number of active BCI applications (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>), also in real time, especially given their simplicity and robustness with regard to the curse of dimensionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In our experiment, we used the state-of-the-art library for support vector machine (LIBSVM) implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.</p><p>In the classification procedure, we divided our data sets of each user in each level into two separate clusters. The first 67% of the PSD samples was used as the training and validation set, while the remaining 33% was used for the testing of the prediction. Every sample vector was standardized with the -score method, which provides a centered and scaled version of the vector (mean ; std ). For the model selection, we first performed a preliminary analysis on data from five subjects, testing the different available kernels: radial basis functions (RBFs), linear, sigmoid, and polynomial. We chose the RBF, as the most effective. Then, for every actual test, the C and gamma hyperparameters were determined with a full grid search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[ 5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> for C; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[ 15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> for gamma; step ; all values are exponents of powers of 2) and a -fold cross validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>. The analysis was performed on a 36 EEG feature SVM, including three kinds of features.</p><p>• The PSDs in the seven bands: delta, theta, alpha, low beta, mid beta, high beta, and gamma. All these features were considered for every electrode ( total features). • The coherences between each pair of electrodes (six additional features). Coherences provide information about the cooperation between various brain areas and lend themselves to different interpretations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>). • The two peripheral nervous system signals (GSR and HR).</p><p>Also both the peripheral signals were computed from 1-s segments, for simplicity, although variability of these signals is typically on larger time windows. One different three-class SVM was trained for every user, in order to distinguish among the three conditions of boredom, flow, and frustration. Results of this 36 (EEG+Per) SVM, expressed in terms of average recognition rates, are reported in Table II (first line), where the last two columns show the average recognition rate of the worst user and of the best user.</p><p>The confusion matrix is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>. From the confusion matrix, it can be seen that L3 is well classified, while L1 and L2 classification is less accurate.</p><p>Results for the 28 EEG (only the PSD features) and 34 EEG (PSDs+coherences) are slightly worse (lines 2 and 3 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>) and show that all the physiological measures are useful to understand the user's current state. On the other hand, we also observed that adding different features, such as the "attention ratio" <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref> and the total electrode power (combinations of information already available), does not improve results.</p><p>Feature reduction or selection is frequently executed in machine learning as it is effective in cutting noisy features and, overall, in reducing the computation times needed for training and testing. However, analyzing classification accuracy after feature selection, using the LIBSVM's F-score strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>, we obtained worse results for all the test players and all the SVM configurations. This confirms the importance of considering all the original physiological data (a similar result is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref> for classification of motor imagery tasks).</p><p>Considering a reduction of the classification space, we also performed a feature reduction process based on a principal component analysis (PCA). We used an 80% threshold, which corresponds to employing only the first 11 components. The results of this 11 feature EEG+Per SVM are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(line 4).</head><p>There is a slight loss of performance, but the number of features is reduced to less than one third of the original, which could be important for a prospective implementation of a real-time validation and training system.</p><p>Another significant outcome of the PCA is that, observing the first component coefficients, the most important original features are: alpha, low beta, mid beta, and high beta, for all sensors. This confirms our expectations on the PSD values of the various bands for the various levels (Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p><p>Since the low-beta range is close to the mu rhythm, we felt it important to check if our measures could be mainly correlated to different degrees of motor activity (even if limited to only the right hand's index and middle fingers) in the three levels. To this end, we set up a simple experiment with the aim of classifying the neural activity of three test users who had to follow the same key press pattern as the one recorded during their game play. They had to simply close their eyes and follow sound alerts to press a key. The SVM classification accuracy was 40%. We thus argue that the different motor activities in the three levels do have some impact, but it is not sufficient to explain the difference in the neural activity measured in the three actual game plays (that the same system recognizes with a 66.9% accuracy).</p><p>This experiment was designed to simulate motor activity as in the three game levels, without engaging in any other activity (in particular, without playing). Occipital electrodes produce alpha activity when eyes are closed <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, but our analysis focused on the low-beta range as the major source of information for distinguishing the flow levels.</p><p>Since brainwave band definition is not standard across literature, we tried to explore different band subdivisions. In a first experiment, we reduced the number of bands to five: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-25 Hz), and gamma <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. This partition (or similar) is more common in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>). The only difference was the gamma filtering at 25-32 Hz (rather than the more common 30 ). The resulting 20 EEG SVM performed similarly to the others (and the same as EEG 28, with a slightly lower standard deviation), despite the lower number of features. Results are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> (line 5).</p><p>From our analysis, we have seen that some bands are more significant (alpha and beta), but all the electrodes provide useful information. Then, we explored the performance of subsets of the electrodes on the scalp. In each experiment, we used data from only two of the four electrodes. For every electrode, we considered all the bands. This led to a total of 14 features. Results, reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref>, show that even just two electrodes are able to provide significant information.</p><p>There is evidence in the literature that the two cerebral hemispheres have some different morphological, biochemical, and functional characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref> and that right-handed people have left-hemisphere dominance for some functions (e.g., language <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>). However, we could not observe significant differences in this regard among our test users (five left-handed, 18 right-handed).</p><p>We also explored Bayesian classification, by trying three simple algorithms for learning Bayesian network (BN) structures from data, namely, hidden naive Bayes (HNB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>, tree augmented naive (TAN) Bayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>, and weightily averaged one-dependence estimators (WAODEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>. Results from all test users, in the 28 (EEG) configuration, are lower than with the SVM (HNB: 56.6%; TAN: 56.5; WAODE: 56.2%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Collective Classification</head><p>While all the above presented computations were performed on personal classifiers (i.e., trained with data from the actual target user), we also trained a collective 30 (EEG+Per) SVM with 66% of all the samples from all the users (and tested with the remaining 34%). The system achieves an average accuracy of 47.3% (standard deviation: 9.9%, min: 32.9%, max: 66.7%), with a 27% performance drop with respect to the personal SVMs. The confusion matrix is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">V</ref>.</p><p>The collective classifier has the advantage that potentially no personal training would be required, once trained over a reasonable number of users. However, the data collection times (3 min for each level) and the SVM model selection and training time (4-5 min) needed for the personalized training solution seem to make the latter feasible even in consumer applications.</p><p>Performance results of the collective Bayesian classifiers are slightly worse again (45.3% average accuracy for HNB, 44.3% for TAN and 46.2% for WAODE), with respect to SVM. We also tried to fuse the results from the SVM and Bayesian predictors through a simple majority voting procedure, exploiting the fact that both classifiers can provide, for every classified sample, probability outputs for all the classes (not only the selected one), showing the trust degree of the prediction. For the collective system, the fusion resulting accuracy is of 50.1% (8% standard deviation, 29.8% min, 64.1% max), with a 5.9% improvement over SVM alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Execution Times</head><p>The SVM execution times were as follows. For model selection and training, personal SVMs require 4-5 min, while the collective SVM requires approximately 37 h. For testing, both the personal and collective SVMs require around 1 s. All the times were taken on an Intel Core i3-2120 processor 3.3-GHz, 6-GB RAM, Windows 7, x64.</p><p>The Weka BN execution times were the following. For training, personal BNs require less than 10 s, while the collective BN requires around 45 s. For testing, personal BNs require 1-3 s, while the collective BN requires less than 20 s. All the times were taken on an AMD Athlon 1640B 2.71-GHz, 3-GB RAM, Windows XP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Comparison With the State of the Art</head><p>After the fusion of the two signal categories (EEG and peripheral-for a total of 77 considered features), the player-independent system presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> achieved an accuracy of up to 63%. This result is computed from samples of 300-s width. Also, the authors show that performance constantly decreases, in particular for peripheral signals, reducing the window width (their analysis stops at around 30-s widths, with an accuracy of 51% for the EEG and 46% for peripheral signals). These time lengths do not look very suited to real-time analysis and feedback, as is required in a highly dynamic activity such as video gaming. Also, machine learning algorithms typically require huge numbers of samples. This is why we work on 1-s windows, as is common in clinical research and workload assessment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>), even if this value is less effective, particularly for peripheral signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For this time window, to the best of our knowledge, no results on video-game analysis are reported in the literature.</p><p>Accuracy results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, using nonneural physiological signals, are significant (15% better than <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), but their system is user dependent and requires six 1-h training game sessions for each participant, while Chanel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> involve a baseline recording of 1 min for each new player.</p><p>In our work, we have considered both a player-independent (collective) framework (like <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) and personalized training (like <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). Our execution times for the personal system (data collection and system training) are reasonable. In fact, we have Thus, our experiment shows that it is possible to train a system that can provide feedback in real time with accuracy levels (66.9% for personalized training, 50.1% for collective training) at least comparable to those of state-of-the-art laboratory systems that are characterized by a much higher complexity in terms of number of features, sensor sources, data collection, and, overall, amount of training and latency times. And, in the light of our results, differently from the conclusions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we argue that personalized training should be preferentially targeted in the next research.</p><p>We have also shown that the basis of the significant differences among the play conditions are essentially due to the frequencies around the low-beta band (Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>). A similar video-game spectral analysis was performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, but this was less detailed (only in the 6-13-Hz band) and focused on mental workload, not on flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Task Comparison</head><p>A final part of our work was devoted to defining and analyzing the spectral peculiarities of game playing, with respect to other intellectual tasks. To this end, we selected five users (four males and one female) among the 22 and asked them to perform three different tasks. In the first one, they were asked to relax for 3 min, then rest for 30 s, then to read an Internet journal article. This had been preselected by the reader as a gentle, easy reading. After a 30-s rest, they finally had to solve three challenging mathematical quizzes (3 min).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> shows the average among all the test users (5*150 samples for each task) of the PSDs of the different bands for the three tasks. Like in the previous tests, PSDs were obtained through FFT in 1-s windows. We have added the L2 game flow condition for comparison with the different tasks. From the traces, we can see that game flow seems to be the condition that distributes the energy more evenly across the frequencies.</p><p>We trained personal two-class 28 EEG SVMs to check whether the game task (in the flow condition) was identifiable with respect to the other tasks. Results are largely positive, with average accuracy levels of 86% (with respect to the relax condition), 87.9% (with respect to the read task), 84.1% (with respect to solving the mathematical problems). We can attribute these high values to the fact that a two-class classification is simpler than a three-class problem and that the game flow condition is compared, in these cases, with different tasks, not with other in-game conditions. In order to check that the results were not affected by overfitting, we verified that the samples were linearly separable, and obtained very similar results with a linear-kernel SVM.</p><p>We also tried to see if there are variations in the signal features between different days, due to differences in the player's status and in environmental conditions leading to different electrode impedances. We observed that the recognition accuracy for the same task (relax) is 87.7%, which is a significant drop. This suggests the need for periodical system training, for instance, exploiting online reinforcement learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>The aim of our work was to investigate the use of EEG for user status monitoring in games, attempting to maintain consistency with consumer deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and thus exploit a tool similar to the ones that are soon likely to appear in the game control market. Certainly, EEG is not a comfortable tool for the user, in particular because of the gel fixing of the electrodes. Thus, measurements could be degraded, and there are objective usability limitations. However, technological advances are likely to fill this human-computer interaction gap with appropriate devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>, in particular with dry sensors, that are more practical but still feature lower performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The results presented in this work contribute to advancing the state of the art of knowledge in several aspects. We have performed a spectral characterization of the video-gaming experience, in conjunction with other tasks, with particular attention to flow, which is a key element of the gaming experience. Results confirm that subdivision of brain frequencies in bands (and the consideration of coherences as well) is an important feature-definition criterion based on domain knowledge (while band combinations, such as the "attention ratio," do not increase performance), and that the most informative bands are those around low beta for discriminating among gaming conditions (mid beta for discriminating gaming from other tasks). Simple signals from the peripheral nervous system add information, but their contribution is marginal. Classification of three levels of user states is possible, with good accuracy, in particular using a kernel-based machine learning classifier such as the SVM. Bayesian analysis has not produced better results, in our implementations, and has provided only limited advantages in one case of information fusion. A user-independent classification framework performs worse than the user-dependent approach. And, given that personalized SVM training and validation time is reasonable (3-min data collection 4/5-min training), we argue that a personalized system could be easily implemented in a consumer context, and that future research should address this target. Online incremental training also looks important because we have observed certain differences in the signals from the same task and user in different days.</p><p>Our work has focused on a basic level that we consider necessary to enable further research and we hope it will provide a baseline reference for other studies aimed, in particular, at investigating new methods to improve classification performance.</p><p>In this regard, we believe that it will be interesting to investigate novel feature extraction and translation methods. Nicolas-Alonso and Gomez-Gil <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> suggest a wavelet analysis, while Krusienski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> highlight the potential of recurrent artificial neural networks (RNNs), that contain feedback connections and are capable of representing complex, nonlinear spatio-temporal patterns that are not captured by the current approaches based on PSDs. Assessing the complementary information encoded by amplitude and phase would contribute to a better representation as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is another data analysis and classification technique, based on spatial filtering. This is worth considering as it reduces the effect of volume conduction of EEG multichannel signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>.</p><p>An application field that we would like to address concerns serious gaming, where the ability to keep a user in flow (e.g., by increasing challenges when a user is detected as becoming bored) implies the added value of exposing the player to educational content for longer periods. This would imply investigating the neural correlates at the frontier between entertainment and learning.</p><p>One of the key actions for the BCI, beyond medical applications agenda, is the need to support the integration of BCIs with existing gaming hardware and software <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Our work suggests that a real-time user flow monitoring system-including standard hardware for signal acquisition and a processing software module as a component of the game engine architecture-could become a common feature of new generation adaptive computing systems. Additional research is needed to perform incrementally (e.g., with reinforcement learning) and real-time training, which would be an important step toward the implementation of personalized systems able to adapt to the user in an effective and continuous way.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
