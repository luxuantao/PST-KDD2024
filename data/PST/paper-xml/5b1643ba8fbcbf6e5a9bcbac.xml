<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Identification of anonymous identical users of cross-platforms refers to the recognition of the accounts belonging to the same individual among multiple Social Network (SN) platforms. Evidently, cross-platform exploration may help solve many problems in social computing, in both theory and practice. However, it is still an intractable problem due to the fragmentation, inconsistency and disruption of the accessible information among SNs. Different from the efforts implemented on user profiles and users' content, many studies have noticed the accessibility and reliability of network structure in most of the SNs for addressing this issue. Although substantial achievements have been made, most of the current network structure-based solutions, requiring prior knowledge of some given identified users, are supervised or semi-supervised. It is laborious to label the prior knowledge manually in some scenarios where prior knowledge is hard to obtain. Noticing that friend relationships are reliable and consistent in different SNs, we proposed an unsupervised scheme, termed Friend Relationship-based User Identification algorithm without Prior knowledge (FRUI-P). The FRUI-P first extracts the friend feature of each user in an SN into friend feature vector, and then calculates the similarities of all the candidate identical users between two SNs. Finally, a one-toone map scheme is developed to identify the users based on the similarities. Moreover, FRUI-P is proved to be efficient theoretically. Results of extensive experiments demonstrated that FRUI-P performs much better than current state-of-art network structure-based algorithm without prior knowledge. Due to its high precision, FRUI-P can additionally be utilized to generate prior knowledge for supervised and semi-supervised schemes. In applications, the unsupervised anonymous identical user identification method accommodates more scenarios where the seed users are unobtainable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>OCIAL networks (SNs) are pervasive and indispensable in our everyday life. Due to the contribution of massive behavioral data, SNs have exerted an enormous influence on various research fields, e.g., sociology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and epidemiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Cleverly, different SNs supply an individual with different functions, which activates the signups of several SNs for the same individual. For instance, in China, people use RenRen, a Facebook-style but autonymous SN for blogs, and Sina Microblog for sharing the statuses. Theoretically, the integration of users' behaviors from all these SNs can be beneficial for all these studies on SNs. This is because these cross-platform investigations on SNs merge various SN platforms to create richer raw data and more complete SNs for social computing tasks. Additionally, they enable an all-sided analysis on user behaviors. Accordingly, exploration of this topic lays a foundation for current, as well as further, studies on SNs.</p><p>User identification, which is also termed as user recognition, user identity resolution, user matching, and anchor linking, aims to find identical users among different SN platforms. Admittedly, the first and most important task for cross-platform SN research is user identification across these SNs, and it has attracted extensive attentions in recent years.</p><p>In the early stage, researchers utilized the uniqueness of the email address and linked identical users in different SNs correctly by building up the "Find Friend" mechanism through these email addresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Although email addresses are a powerful attribute for this task, they were banned by the SNs successively due to privacy protection concerns. To tackle this issue, more efforts were made on the accessible attributes of the SNs, e.g., the user profile attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the user activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the network structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. All these schemes can identify a portion of identical users and mitigate the cross-platform task. Currently, the accessible information among SNs becomes increasingly fragmented, inconsistent and disruptive. These characteristics of SNs marginalize the traditional resolutions and trigger demands for new techniques for user identification.</p><p>SN connections (or network) fall into two categories: single-following connections and mutual-following connections (or friend relationships) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Admittedly, the single-following connections are very noisy because not all connections represent true "friend" relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. However, friend relationships (mutual-following connections in microblogging SNs), in which each connection requires mutual confirmations between the two users, are much more reliable and consistent among SNs, and thus much more suitable for cross-platform user identification tasks. Currently, most of the solutions in this category are supervised or semi-supervised, which require some matched identical users, or seed users (prior knowledge) in advance. The seed users are often acquired from user self-posting websites, e.g., Google+ and About.me, or through human annotating by comparing profile, content and network features <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In the latter scenarios, e.g., obtaining prior knowledge from Sina Microblog and RenRen, it is laborious to label the seed users manually. Moreover, the quality and quantity of the seed users have significant influence on the identification results. For instance, when most of the seed users locate in a cluster, only a few identical users can be identified. Undoubtedly, exploration of unsupervised algorithm can mitigate the dependency on prior knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, Neighbor Matching (NM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> is the only unsupervised method highly pertinent to the user identification problem. Although NM is effective in de-anonymizing SN and won the "champion of the de-anonymization" task of the WSDM 2013 Data Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, its performance is not satisfactory in user identification tasks, as shown in Section 5.</p><p>Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the unsupervised strategy to recognize anonymous identical users across SNs purely by friend relationships. Without a specification, the network structure of SN denotes the friend relationships among the users and the relationships with single direction connection are ignored. Although this algorithm can only identify a portion of the identical users in real-world SNs, it can be applied jointly with other featurebased user identification algorithms for higher performance. Clearly, no algorithm can alone solve the problem. This study makes the following contributions:</p><p>1. Proposing a novel unsupervised user identification algorithm, termed Friend Relationship-based User Identification without Prior Knowledge (FRUI-P). FRUI-P extracts the multiple dimensional features of each user from the network structure, and then the similarities of any two users in two different SNs are evaluated from the multiple dimensional features. Since the multiple dimensional features of users are considered, FRUI-P has the ability to recognize more identical users than NM, in which the features in only one dimensional are taken into the consideration. Opposed to most of the existing schemes, FRUI-P identifies the identical users without prior knowledge and can be employed to provide prior knowledge for the supervised and semi-supervised algorithms, e.g., FRUI <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>2. Presenting the friend feature learning process with circumstances. Inspired by the state-of-art techniques in Word2Vec in the natural language processing (NLP) area <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, we proposed a Friend Feature Vector Model (FFVM) which utilizes the power of random walk. Although Word2Vec has been widely examined in measuring the similarity of any two words, its performance in unsupervised cross-platform task is unknown. We first carried out the investigation and the empirical testing results proved that FFVM is effective in the user identification task.</p><p>3. Discussing the efficiencies of FRUI-P and the strategies for ensuring the performance of user identification in FRUI-P. We proved that FRUI-P is much more efficient than NM in running time. We also introduced three parameters to improve the performance and one parameter to ensure the precision of FRUI-P.</p><p>4. Providing concrete demonstrations of FRUI-P performance with three synthetic networks and two major online SNs in China, namely Sina Microblog and RenRen. The synthetic networks include the Erdős -Rényi (ER) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> random networks, Watts -Strogatz (WS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> small-world networks and Barabási -Albert preferential attachment model (BA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> networks. The findings show that FRUI-P is superior to NM in these networks. Moreover, FRUI-P is effective for the de-anonymization task, as the user identification task is similar to, yet tougher than, the de-anonymization problem.</p><p>This article proceeds as follows. Section 2 systematically presents terminology on user identification across SN platforms, and formally presents the problem definition in friend relationship-based networks. Section 3 reviews related work on cross-platform user identification. Section 4 proposes the FRUI-P algorithm. Section 5 covers the experimental studies. Section 6 offers conclusions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Terminology Definitions</head><p>Since only the friend relationships are considered in this study, an SN is defined as SN = {U, F}, where U and F are the sets of users and friend relationships in SN, respectively. As more than one SNs are discussed in this study, SN A = {U A , F A } is used to represent SN A. For instance, SN Twitter denotes the Twitter. Usually, SN is modeled as an undirected graph, where the nodes and the edges are the users and friend relationships, respectively. Therefore, SN is also termed graph in this study.</p><p>Throughout this paper, the superscript indicates variables (or notations) associated with SN, and the subscript is the user in the SN. For instance, Ui denotes user i in a not specified SN, while U A i is user i in SN A . Moreover, the set items are marked in italic, while the vectors are presented in bold. The notations frequently used in this paper are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>

Suppose that { U A a , U A c , U A b } is the result of a random walk, the context of U A c is C A c = { U A a , U A b }, and the negative user set of U A c is N A c = { U A a , U A b , U A d , U A e }. Subse- quently, (C A c , U A c ) is a positive sample, while (C A c , U A d ) is a negative sample.</formula><p>For convenience, we had the following definitions. Fig. In this study, we employ random walk to model the context of users. Since a user may appear more than one times in one or more random walks, a user may have more than one contexts. We anticipate that Ci has a higher probability to predict Ui and a lower probability to predict Uj (j ≠ i), thus we have Definitions 4 and 5 for Ci. Definition 4 (Positive Sample). For a given Ci in an SN, (Ci, Ui) is a positive sample. All the positive samples form the positive sample set S. Definition 5 (Negative User Set, Negative Sample). Opposed to the definition of positive sample, all the other users except Ui, denoted as Ni or N(Ui), are termed as the negative user set for Ci. Thus, Ni = U -{Ui}. For any user Uj  Ni, (Ci, Uj) forms a negative sample. Definition 6 (Friend Feature Vector). For any user Ui in an SN, his friend feature vector fi is an x-dimensional vector which embeds his friend feature. x is a parameter given in advance. Definition 7 (Friend Feature Similarity). The similarity of any Ï (U A i , U B j ) is the similarity on the friend feature of the two users, denoted as s(U A i , U B j ). Since the friend feature is represented by a friend feature vector, s(U A i , U B j ) is measured by f A i and f B j .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Problem Definition</head><p>In the real world, each person has his own circle of friends, which is highly personal. Therefore, if we know all of the friends of a person, we may know who he/she is. Using the SN in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) as an example, if one has the friend set of users 2, 3 and 5, it is obvious that he could be user 1.</p><p>SNs can be considered as mirrors of the real world, and most popular SNs have similar network structures. Some studies have already examined that users tend to have similar friends across different SNs. Dunbar et al. confirmed that the structure of online social networks mirrored those in the offline world by an empirical study on Twitter and Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. In our former study <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we also found that an average of 67.5% of a person's friends in Sina Microblog concurred in RenRen. Suppose that people set up random friendships in the real world, and the probability of a friendship between any two persons is p (0 &lt; p &lt; 1). For any friendship, sa (0 &lt; sa &lt; 1) and sb (0 , are identical users or not, and is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">&lt;</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">1, U = U ; (U , U</formula><p>, SN , SN ) 0, otherwise.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P AB A B A B ij ij f      <label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P is the prior knowledge, or extra information, except SN A and SN B which is given in advance. For instance, P is the seed users in FRUI. When there is no other extra information available, P = ϕ. In this scenario, only the friend relationships can be utilized, and (2) turns into</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1, U = U ; (U , U SN , SN ) 0, otherwise. AB A B A B ij ij f      <label>(3)</label></formula><p>Obviously, f( • ) is the function we sought in this study. For various reasons, some people hold a few accounts in the same SN, yet we often assumed that these multiple accounts are independent and belong to different individuals.</p><p>In other words, we only identified one of these accounts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RELATED WORKS</head><p>We review the current studies on cross-platform user identification from three categories: profile-based, contentbased and network structure-based approaches, and present a brief summary of the network embedding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Profile-Based User Identification</head><p>Several studies addressing anonymous user identification have focused on public profile attributes, including screen name, gender, birthday, city and profile image. A screen name is the publically required profile feature in almost all SNs. It has been widely explored as a way to recognize users across different SNs. Perito et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> calculated the similarity of screen names and identified users using binary classifiers. Similarly, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> focused on deciding whether cross-platform user identities with same username belong to same natural person. Zafarani and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> developed a user mapping method by modeling user behavior on screen names. The profile image is another feature that has received considerable study. Acquisti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> addressed the user identification task with a face recognition algorithm. Although both screen name and profile image can identify users, they cannot be applied to large SNs. Because some users may have the same screen name and profile images. For example, many users have the screen name "John Smith" on the Facebook.</p><p>Leveraging a combination of profile features can result in better user identification. Iofciu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed an approach by measuring the distance between user profiles. Motoyama and Varghese <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> gathered attributes (education, occupation, etc.) as sets of words and matched users by calculating the similarity of users. Goga <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> linked accounts belonging to the same person identity, based solely on the profile information. Cortis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a weighted ontology-based user profile resolution technique. Abel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> aggregated user profiles and matched users across systems. Similar studies across multiple platforms are also found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Public profile attributes provide powerful information for user identification. However, some attributes are duplicated in large-scale SNs, and are easily impersonated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Content-Based User Identification</head><p>Content-Based User Identification solutions attempt to recognize users based on the times and locations that users post content, as well as the writing style of the content.</p><p>Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a framework for authorship identification using the writing style of online messages. Almishari and Tsudik <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> linked users across different SNs by exploiting the writing style of authors. Kong and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed Multi-Network Anchoring (MNA) to map users. MNA calculates the combined similarities of user's social, spatial, temporal and text information in different SNs. Goga et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> exploited the geo-location attached to users' posts, the timestamp of posts, and users' writing style to address user identification tasks. Riederer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> also presented an algorithm which utilizes trajectory-based content features to link identical users.</p><p>Geo-location appears to have forceful features for user recognition. However, this information is often sparse in SNs, since only a small portion of users are willing to post their locations. The writing-style solutions can be improved by the new techniques on authorship verification and clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Network Structure-Based User Identification with Prior Knowledge</head><p>The network structure-based studies with prior knowledge can be divided into two groups: supervised and semi-supervised models.</p><p>In the supervised category, Man et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> developed Predicting Anchor Links via Embedding (PALE) based on latent features of users in SN. Nie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed Dynamic Core Interests Mapping (DCIM) by jointly modelling neighborhood-based network features and interestedbased content features.</p><p>In the semi-supervised category, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have similar workflow, finding seed users first, then using these seed users to recursively propagate information through networks and extend sets of mapped nodes. The key difference among these studies is the similarity definition in the information propagation. Clearly, the similarities of any unmapped nodes are evaluated based on the mapped nodes. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proposed Input Output Network Embedding (IONE).

The overall running time of each iteration is O(n 2 dmax 3 ), where dmax is the upper bound of the number of user friends. SN has been verified as a scale-free network repeatedly. Thus, dmax ≈ n and the time complexity of NM is O(n 5 ) in the SN.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">USER IDENTIFICATION WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE</head><p>Usually, when the similarity of the two given users is larger than a threshold, the two users are identical. Thus, the key problem of cross-platform user identification is to find the similarity of any item in Ï (•, •) in the two given SNs. Given enough identical users as prior knowledge, many solutions can be used to define and evaluate the similarities of the candidate identical users, e.g., the solutions in FRUI <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and NS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. However, it is still a challenging task to evaluate the similarity of any two users without prior knowledge. To address this issue in the area of social network de-anonymization, NM <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> evaluates the similarities of all the item in Ï (•, •) by an iteration process. To a certain extent, NM only utilizes one feature of the users' network. Intuitively, the performances of NM can be improved by employing multiple dimensional features.</p><p>For any individual i in the real world, if the feature of his friend relationships can be extracted and embedded in a vector fi, then his friend feature vectors f A i in SN A and f B i in SN B must be similar, because the individual deploys similar friend relationships in different SNs. Take Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>  in SN B into two-dimensional vectors, they must localize closely in geometry. That is, f A a and f B a' localize almost at the same spot in a two-dimensional space.

Thus, if</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">U A i = U B j , then s(U A i , U B j</formula><p>) is no less than s(U A i , •) and s(•, U B j ).

Increasing either S or x raises the complexity of FRUI-P, yet can improve the performance of user identification. Our empirical studies also confirm that t, S and x can enhance the performance of FRUI-P. λ guarantees the minimal similarity of the identified users and ensures the precision. Since identical users with similarity less than λ are missed, higher λ results in lower recall rate. When λ = 0, all the identified users are considered as identical users.</p><p>Since |S| ≥ |F|, and |S| ≤ |U| 2 in practice, we approximately took O(|S|) = O(|U| 2 ).

This allows us to use asynchronous version of stochastic gradient algorithm in the multi-worker case and help achieve an optimal rate of convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Also, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_53">26</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_55">27</ref>) can work in a parallel manner. Consequently, parallel version of FRUI-P is easy to implement, which makes FRUI-P scalable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES</head><p>We verified FRUI-P in both the synthetic and ground-truth networks. All the experiments were conducted using a computer with 8 G memory and 2.8 GHz CPU.</p><p>We used NM as the main baseline because it is the closest to FRUI-P as a state-of-art, network structure-based unspervised algorithm, which won the first prize in the deanonymization task of WSDM 2013 Data Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. In our empirical testing of NM, the sizes of the graphs are no more than 1,000 nodes. Because the running time and the space requirement of NM, which are O(n 5 ) and O(n 2 ) respectively, limit the scalability of NM. For instance, a pair of graphs with 50,000 nodes, NM requires no less than 50,000 × 50,000 × 4B × 2 (NM uses the k-th and (k+1)-th similarity matrices) = 20 G memory space, which is beyond the capacity of our experimental computer.</p><p>FRUI is the other adversary in this study, because it is the state-of-art semi-supervised user identification purely using network structure.</p><p>We employed recall rate, precision and F1-measure to measure the performance. They are defined as   # of correct identified users Recall rate = , # of total identical users # of correct identified users Precision = , # of total identified users 2 Recall rate Precision F1 -measure = . Recall rate Precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> Higher recall rate, precision and F1-measure indicate better performance of a user identification solution.</p><p>Besides the real-world experiments, we also conducted extensive experiments on synthetic networks to evaluate the performance of FRUI-P. SNs are naturally overlapped in both users (nodes) and friends (edges) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The node overlap is the fundamental assumption for all the user identification solutions, while edge overlap lays the foundation for all the network structure-based algorithms. To achieve various degrees of node and edge overlap, we added graphs with different levels of noise. For a given network, a subnetwork is generated by keeping every node/edge with a sampling probability. Through two rounds of the sampling process, pair of subnetworks are produced, and the common nodes kept in both subnetworks are identical. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> presents an illustration. We introduced the Jaccard Coefficient to measure the degree of </p><formula xml:id="formula_64">A B AB A B XX overlap X X XX  (32)</formula><p>where overlap(, ) denote the degree of the overlap of X and X represents the U/F of the two graphs. Thus, when each of the two graphs shares 2/3 of nodes, overlap(U A , U B ) = 0.5. The degree of edge overlap was limited by the relationships between the overlapping nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Synthetic Network Experiments</head><p>To validate the performance of FRUI-P, we conducted experiments in the ER <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> random networks, WS <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> smallworld networks and BA <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> networks. The properties of the three synthetic networks refers to our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Both ER and WS networks are generated from the regular random network by rewiring each edge with a probability. If all edges are rewired so that the probability of rewiring equals 1, the network turns out to be an ER network; otherwise, it is a WS network. In the experiments, the probability of rewiring in a WS network was 0.5.</p><p>We generated 75 pairs of networks in experiments to illustrate the performance of FRUI-P in synthetic networks. In all the three synthetic network experiments, five networks with 5,000 nodes were created. In the five ER and WS network experiments, p, the probability that an edge exists between two nodes, equals to 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1, respectively. Similarly, in the BA network experiment, the number of edges to attach a new node to existing nodes, denoted as m, increased from 20 to 100 by 20. Subsequently, 75 pairs of networks were generated by 15 synthetic networks, with overlap(U A , U B ) = 1 and overlap(F A , F B ) equaling to 0.25, 0.36, 049, 0.64 and 0.81. We set t = 1, λ = 0, |S| = 50|F| and x = 500 in all these experiments. It is notable that all the edges are sampled randomly in our experiments, which can model the real world SNs more precisely. This random sampling also describes the difference between the cross-platform user identification task and the de-anonymization task, in which the two SNs totally overlap among a host of nodes.</p><p>The results of empirical testing in ER networks are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">2</ref>. The performances of FRUI-P increase with the growth of the overlap of the edges between the two SNs. It is also remarkable that FRUI-P identified almost all identical nodes when overlap(F A , F B ) ≥ 0.49. Moreover, all the 25 pairs of networks have precisions larger than 90%. The of FRUI-P in networks are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">3</ref>. Analogous to the experiments in the ER network, FRUI-P recognized no less than 90% of all identical users when overlap(F A , F B ) ≥ 0.36, and the precisions in all the 25 pairs of networks is larger than 96.3%. Seemingly, the performances of FRUI-P in WS networks are somewhat better than those in ER networks. The results presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">4</ref> show that FRUI-P also performs well in BA networks. Although the performance of FRUI-P was not that good in BA networks as those in ER and SW networks, the precisions are larger than 91.5% when overlap(F A , F B ) ≥ 0.49. Additionally, almost all the identified users are correct when m ≥ 40, and almost all the identical users are recog-nized when overlap(F A , F B ) ≥ 0.64. Undoubtedly, the performances of FRUI-P in BA networks can be further improved by increasing x, t and |S|, as verified in Section 5.2. In all the experiments on the ER, WS and networks, FRUI-P revealed nearly all identical nodes when overlap(F A , F B ) ≥ 0.64, which approximately equals that in real-world SNs. This indicates that FRUI-P can address the user identification task without seed users. Also, the precision is almost 1 when overlap(F A , F B ) ≥ 0.49, this verified that FRUI-P can be used to generate the prior knowledge for some other user identification algorithms, e.g., FRUI <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>We also conducted experiments to compare the effectiveness of FRUI-P, FRUI and NM. The comparisons of FRUI-P, FRUI and NM in the three synthetic networks are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. We changed overlap(F A , F B ) from 0.25 to 1 in the experiments. p = 0.02 in the ER and WS networks, and m = 20 in the BA networks. We used the graphs with 5,000 nodes in the evaluation of FRUI-P, FRUI and NM. The size of prior knowledge of FRUI was 50. Since the recall rate, precision and F1-Measure exhibit the same trends in the experiments, only the recall rates are demonstrated. The results of experiments conducted in the networks generated by ER and WS models are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a</ref>) and (b). Evidently, both FRUI-P and FRUI identify almost all the identical nodes when overlap(F A , F B ) ≥ 0.36 in ER and WS networks. The recall rates of the three algorithms in BA networks are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(c</ref>). Both FRUI-P and FRUI have a promising performance, especially when overlap(F A , F B ) ≥ 0.64. In contrast, NM recognizes all the identical nodes when overlap(F A , F B ) is almost 1, whereas little if anything when overlap(F A , F B ) ≤ 0.81, in all these three synthetic networks. That means that NM performs inadequately when the two graphs are sampled randomly. Accordingly, we can adopt the attitude that NM cannot be applied to the cross-platform user identification task when the two SNs overlap at around 65%.</p><p>In addition, a more delicate comparison between FRUI-P and FRUI, in all the three synthetic networks with overlap(F A , F B ) = 0.25, are also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. We compared FRUI-P with FRUI, which were given 50 and 100 matched identical users as prior knowledge. Conspicuously, FRUI-P outperforms FRUI in WS and BA networks when only a small slice of identical users is given in advance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Effect of Parameters</head><p>Three parameters, namely x, |S| and t can improve the performance of FRUI-P, while λ is introduced to ensure the high precision on FRUI-P. This section validates the effect of the four parameters. Without specification, overlap(F A , F B ) = 0.64, x = 500, |S| = 50|F|, t = 1, λ = 0 in this part.  As the empirical testing on the three synthetic networks, FRUI-P almost identifies all the identical nodes in the ER and WS networks. Thus, we only conducted further experiments on the BA networks to show the effect of these parameters on FRUI-P.</p><p>Since enlarging |S| can provide more positive samples for the friend feature learning, we varied |S| from 30|F| to 70|F| by steps of 10|F| to observe the influence of the number of positive samples on FRUI-P. The results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>(a) and (b) reveal that more positive samples can ensure more identical users with higher precision. We also varied x from 100 to 900 by steps of 200 to evaluate the effect of x on FRUI-P. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">7(c</ref>) and (d), larger x can also result in higher recall rate with higher precision.</p><p>The experimental result with overlap(F A , F B ) = 0.49 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(a)</ref>. Actually, the recall rates increase along with t. In other words, higher t results in more identical users, no matter how sparse or dense the networks are. The results presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(b</ref>) reveal the effect of t with m = 60. No matter how much overlap there is between the two SNs, higher t also ensures more users.     The experimental results under the circumstance with m = 60 and overlap(F A , F B ) = 0.36 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(c</ref>) and (d). Fig. <ref type="figure">8(c</ref>) demonstrates the relationship between the precision and λ. Clearly, the precision increase along with λ, and almost all the identified users are correct when λ = 1. We also present the tradeoff between precision and recall rate along with λ in Fig <ref type="figure">8(d)</ref>. It conveys that the improvement of precision may cause the decline in recall rate. Noticeably, FRUI-P can identify 20% of identical users with no less than 95% precision, even for the condition t = 1. This proves that FRUI-P has the ability to provide prior knowledge for other solutions, e.g., FRUI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Social Network Experiments</head><p>In this section, we use ground truth datasets to evaluate the user identification resolution. In order to verify FRUI-P in different types of SNs, we collected data from two heterogeneous SNs: Sina Microblog and RenRen. Sina Microblog has 1.17M users and 1.9M friend relationships, while RenRen has 5.5M users and 14.6M friend relationships. More details of the datasets can be found in our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. To evaluate the performance of FRUI-P with real-world datasets, we generated a series of controlled datasets. We selected a pair of subgraphs from both SNs, and each had over 50,000 nodes.</p><p>In the experiments, we randomly chose a number of shared nodes as a priori identical users for FRUI, and t = 1, λ = 0, x = 500 and |S| = 50|F| for FRUI-P. Then, we executed user identification in both FRUI-P and FRUI. We increased the percentage of a priori identical users in all identical users from 0.01 to 0.1 by 0.01. Since the average degrees of both Sina Microblog and RenRen are fairly low, only the nodes with no less than θ neighbors were selected as overlapping nodes. To check the performance of FRUI-P, we increased θ from 20 to 100 by a step of 20 each time. Although only those users with friends above θ are selected, after the sampling, the degree distributions also follow the power-law distribution. That is, many, if not most, users with friends less than 5 in the sampled SNs, which are difficult to identify.</p><p>The recall rates of FRUI-P and FRUI in both Sina and RenRen networks are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. In FRUI, 1% and 8% of the identical users are the prior knowledge. Although FRUI shows a better performance, FRUI-P also have the ability to identify around 20% of all the identical users without any prior knowledge of the identical users. Moreover, FRUI-P finds slightly more identical users than FRUI in the SNs with θ = 20, when only 1% are given as the prior knowledge in FRUI. The performance of FRUI-P in real world SNs appears not that satisfactory as in synthetic networks, as almost half of the users in these real world SNs only possess one friend whose features are virtually impossible to be learned from their friends. We also examined the influence of the number of friends and λ on FRUI-P, which are suitable to explain the performance of FRUI-P in real world SNs. The trends of precision over the number of friends, in the SNs with θ = 100, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(a)</ref>. Evidently, the precision of FRUI-P increases with the number of friends. Moreover, the precision is above 80% for the users with more than 60 friends, it suggests that FRUI-P identify those users with more friends with high precision, and verifies that the friend features of users with few friends can hardly be learned. Additionally, almost all the identified users are identical when the users have more than 120 friends in Sina and 250 friends in RenRen. The trends of precision along with λ are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(b</ref>). Similar to experiments in synthetic networks, higher λ results in higher precision of the identification results, and the precision hits as high as 0.9 with λ = 0.4 in both the Sina and RenRen networks. The tradeoff between precision and recall rates is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(c</ref>). It is obvious that FRUI-P returns more than 15% identical users with 95% in precision in both the Sina and RenRen networks. As illustrated in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, only a small portion of prior knowledge, e.g., 1%, can help identify more than 40% identical users in the Sina dataset and 60% identical users in RenRen dataset. Accordingly, FRUI-P can be a powerful complement to FRUI and as a result FRUI-P can be applied to provide prior knowledge for those algorithms that require prior knowledge.</p><p>We also evaluated the performance FRUI-P in user identification across Sina Microblog and RenRen by conducting three groups of experiments. In each experiment, we selected a pair of subgraphs by starting with the identical users from the Renmin University of China (RUC) and extracting two-layer friends using a breadth-first search. The leaf nodes are removed, and only the users with an education background of RUC are left. Since the exact number of identical users is unknown, only the precision was compared. With λ = 0, FRUI-P returns almost as many as identical users as NM. Here we chose the 300 identified users with the highest similarity to check the precision of FRUI-P and NM. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref> illustrates the empirical results. The precisions of FRUI-P are around 80%, outperforming NM in all the three experiments. These findings reveal that FRUI-P is much more proficient for recognizing identical users across Sina Microblog and RenRen.</p><p>Finally, we conducted experiments jointly using FRUI-P and FRUI. 150 identified users with the highest similarity of FRUI-P are taken as the prior knowledge for FRUI. We randomly chose 300 identified users to check the precisions. The empirical results show that around half of the identified users are identical through jointly using of FRUI-P and FRUI. The total numbers of identified users and the precisions are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref>. The results confirm that FRUI-P can be applied to obtain the prior knowledge for the supervised or semi-supervised schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This study addressed the problem of user identification across SN platforms and offered an innovative solution. As a key aspect of SN, network structure is of paramount importance and helps resolve the user identification tasks. Many studies have reported that identical users have similar friends in different SN platforms. Therefore, we proposed a uniform network structure-based user identification solution. Based on our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we developed a novel unsupervised relationship-based algorithm without prior knowledge called We also addressed the complexity and discussed its scalability. Finally, we verified our algorithm in both synthetic networks and ground-truth networks.</p><p>Results of our empirical experiments reveal that the network structure can accomplish important user identification tasks. Our FRUI-P algorithm is efficient, and performs much better than NM. In scenarios when raw text data is sparse, incomplete, or hard to obtain due to privacy settings, FRUI-P is extremely suitable for cross-platform tasks. Moreover, FRUI-P can provide reliable prior knowledge for many prior knowledge-based user identification schemes, e.g. FRUI. Since the parallel version of FRUI-P is easy to implement, our method is scalable and can be easily applied to large datasets. To improve the efficiency, preprocessing processes which retrench the candidate identical nodes for each node on another graph will be explored in our future work. Clearly, the anonymous identical user identification method without prior knowledge accommodates more scenarios where the seed users are hard to obtain, thus largely empowering the applicability.  Identifying anonymous users across multiple SNs is challenging work. Therefore, only a portion of identical users with different nicknames can be recognized with this method. This study built the foundation for further studies on this issue. Ultimately, it is our hope that a final approach can be developed to identify all identical users with different nicknames in an ideal case. Other user identification methods can be applied simultaneously to examine multiple SN platforms. These methods are complementary and not mutually exclusive, since the final decision may rely on human user's involvement. Therefore, we suggest applying these methods synergistically and a proper usage of their strengths should lead to optimal effects beneficial to their common goals.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>SFig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
