<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This is a multi-site case study of firms that have implemented enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. It examines eight dimensions of culture and their impact on how ERP implementation teams are able to effectively share knowledge across diverse functions and perspectives during ERP implementation. Through synthesizing the data, we develop a cultural configuration that shows the dimensions of culture that best facilitate knowledge sharing in ERP implementation. The results also indicate ways that firms may overcome cultural barriers to knowledge sharing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a tool that helps companies cut costs and improve efficiency by integrating business processes and sharing common resources across an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[49]</ref>. ERP systems institutionalize the sharing of resources by requiring the consolidation of diverse and decentralized computing platforms, data models, and functional processes in order to improve operational efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">47]</ref>. ERP systems are large, complex and often require fundamental changes to the way organizations perform processes. They may also impact the organizational decision making that underlies the processes 0167-9236/$ -see front matter D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.dss.2004.06.017 B Findings were presented at ICIS 2001 in New Orleans. However, the paper submitted here and the paper that appears in the ICIS proceedings are substantially different. The ICIS proceedings paper is a bresearch-in-progressQ piece that does not include findings or the rich description of the cultural dimensions. Because of the limits on time, the findings presented at ICIS were substantially fewer and not nearly as rich as those presented in this submission. <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. There is evidence that ERP enables organizations to achieve decision support benefits such as improved knowledge processing, enhanced decision making reliability, and better ability to gather corporate evidence to support the decisions made <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. Furthermore, managers believe it is important for ERP systems to provide decision support for quicker decisions, lower costs of decision making, and improved ability to manage large quantities of knowledge <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. In order for this to occur, however, appropriate organizational knowledge must be incorporated into an ERP system so that the system has a sufficient underlying knowledge structure to achieve this support. Knowledge from a diversity of perspectives and experiences must be shared and incorporated during ERP implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">28]</ref>.</p><p>Knowledge is a multi-faceted concept and is embedded within many entities in an organization including the organization's culture, policies, documents, and members themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Knowledge is often described in terms of a taxonomy of knowledge types (e.g., tacit vs. explicit, individual vs. collective, declarative vs. causal vs. relational). However, another way knowledge is described is in terms of its pragmatic nature. The pragmatic facet of knowledge taps the types of knowledge that are useful to an organization such as knowledge about products, best practices, business frameworks, and projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The way knowledge is shared among individuals is tied to its pragmatic nature <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Because ERP requires firms to integrate processes across an organization, one of the most important areas of knowledge sharing in an ERP implementation is sharing of the knowledge that individuals possess about processes and business frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[26]</ref>. Therefore, we define knowledge sharing in this study to be the sharing of knowledge about business processes and the related knowledge required to make these processes work. bIn order for an individual's or a group's knowledge to be useful for others, it must be expressed in such a manner as to be interpretable by the receiversQ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, p. 110). Thus, we examine knowledge sharing during ERP implementation to identify factors that facilitate this expression.</p><p>ERP implementation teams typically consist of organizational members from a variety of functional areas and organizational divisions. These teams are charged with the implementation of the ERP system, which begins with the initial analysis of current organizational processes and data (often referred to as the das isT stage), includes the planning of organizational process and data changes the ERP is used to bring about (dto beT), and extends through training users and installing the completed package for use. Opportunities for knowledge sharing are present on the team because the knowledge that individuals must have for ERP implementation is more diverse than the knowledge required for traditional jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This gives rise to conflicts that make the management of knowledge sharing complex. This is particularly evident where team members represent independent silos and want to retain their own identity. An ERP implementation team interacts with other organizational members to gather relevant information and keep them informed about changes to expect when the ERP is implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[39]</ref>. Ideally, there is an intensive exchange of knowledge between the team and the organizational members they represent <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Inadequate knowledge sharing between these two groups contributes to unsuccessful ERP implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">43]</ref>.</p><p>Successful ERP implementation requires organizational groups to break down barriers to knowledge sharing. ERP systems integrate business processes across functions and units, thereby creating a divergence in the required knowledge of organizational members <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Organizational members must understand more than just the piece of the whole that they have traditionally been required to know <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[39]</ref> and must understand where and how their function fits in the entire process <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[46]</ref>. A firm's culture is the shared beliefs, ideologies, and norms that influence organizational actions or behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">42]</ref>. It is both a key driver and inhibitor of organizational knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[32]</ref>. Organizational culture may also be thought of as knowledge resource because it provides the context within which organizational members create, acquire, share, and manage knowledge <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">24]</ref>. bIn many organizations, a major cultural shift may be required to change employees' attitudes and behavior so that they willingly and consistently share their knowledgeQ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, p. 126). Thus, organizations must foster the underlying culture necessary to support knowledge sharing activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[24]</ref>. Because organizational culture influences member's attitudes towards knowledge sharing and because knowledge sharing is critical to successful ERP implementation, it is important to understand the relationship between organizational culture and knowledge sharing and develop theory that contributes to successful ERP implementation.</p><p>This research explores how differing dimensions of culture influence knowledge sharing on ERP implementation project teams. The study contributes to the body of information systems knowledge in several ways. First, by synthesizing data from four in-depth case studies, we develop a cultural configuration that shows the dimensions of culture that facilitate knowledge sharing within an ERP implementation initiative. This cultural configuration provides a theoretically grounded basis upon which future research about the role of culture in information systems implementation can be built. Second, we propose a model showing the relationships between organizational cultural dimensions, team culture, initiatives to overcome cultural barriers, influence of external forces, and knowledge sharing in an ERP implementation environment. Third, we highlight examples of cultural barriers that can impede knowledge sharing as well as initiatives to overcome these barriers.</p><p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The next section provides the research framework by describing eight dimensions of culture followed by a section that describes the methodology used for the study. In Section 4, a within-case analysis provides profiles of each of the four case study sites and describes knowledge sharing activities occurring at each site during ERP implementation. Section 5 synthesizes the study findings in a cross-case analysis discussing each cultural dimension and related knowledge sharing activities, and develops a cultural configuration. The last section discusses contributions of the study and directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Research framework</head><p>There are many influences on knowledge sharing, and it is difficult to examine knowledge sharing separately from the factors that influence it <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[29]</ref>. These factors include environmental, managerial, and technical artifacts, and a major challenge in knowledge sharing is managing the interactions among the various influences <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. However, it can be argued that these factors are all part of or are influenced by an organization's culture. For example, managerial coordination and control influence are factors that are both rooted in organizational culture <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> and influence the structure of decision making and the flow of knowledge through that structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[44]</ref>. Knowledge is embedded in the broader context of culture, and that culture influences the way organizational members share what they know <ref type="bibr">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">24]</ref>.</p><p>Our assessment of knowledge sharing during ERP implementation is grounded in a framework proposed by Detert et al. <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. Detert et al. derived the dimensions of culture in their framework from a content analysis of ba synthesis of what have repeatedly emerged as the components of cultureQ in other organizational culture research ([9], p. 851). One of their goals was to provide a basis upon which future theoretical and empirical work on organizational culture could be conducted. This framework supports assessment of dimensions of organizational culture and the practices or artifacts that arise out of those dimensions. It focuses on organizational culture as a system of shared values that define what is important and that guide organizational members' attitudes and behaviors. We use the eight dimensions of culture included in Detert et al.'s theoretical framework to identify behaviors related to cultural values that underlie ERP implementation in order to inform theory about the way these cultural dimensions facilitate or impede knowledge sharing during ERP implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Orientation to change (stability vs. change)</head><p>Some organizations are change oriented and are characterized by a focus on continuous improvement <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Change is often more widely accepted in these firms because organizational members are accustomed to change and view it as positive <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Others are more stability oriented, and are characterized by bnot rocking the boatQ or bif it's not broken, don't fix it.Q They may even seem to change without actually doing so <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">12]</ref>. For example, a firm may adopt a policy of improved customer service, but the behavior of organizational members may remain the same, or the organization may fail to change its infrastructure to actually improve customer service <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Change often requires organizational members to understand a new way of performing processes, as well as how and why their processes have changed <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Control, coordination, and responsibility (concentrated vs. autonomous decision making)</head><p>Organizations vary in the degree to which the structure of decision making is concentrated or shared. Where decision making is fairly concentrated, the rules of a few guide the behavior and actions of the majority, and decisions making is centralized <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[38]</ref>. In organizations where it is shared, organizational members are encouraged to be autonomous in their decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[36]</ref>. An overriding norm in many organizations is silo behavior where individual divisions, units, or functional areas operate as silos or independent agents within the organization [6,7,22].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Orientation to collaboration (isolation vs. collaboration)</head><p>Perceptions about the relative value of working alone or collaboratively are motivated by underlying beliefs about how work is best accomplished <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. A culture that values individual efforts more than collaborative ones places more value on individual autonomy and believes that collaboration is inefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[32]</ref>. On the other hand, organizations that believe collaboration is more efficient and effective than individual effort encourage teamwork and organize tasks around groups of people <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Basis of truth and rationality (hard data vs. personal experience)</head><p>In some organizations, truth is considered to be a product of systemic, scientific study, and codified, hard data are vital to problem solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[41]</ref>. Central to this belief is that the phenomenon of interest about which decisions are made is too complex to be evident without such data collection and analysis. Many organizations take this a step further and focus on making what is already codified into hard data more readily available to the organization <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Furthermore, the norms of some organizations are such that that if their dsoftT or intuitive knowledge is not already codified, then they believe it is either not worth doing or can not be done, and they do not attempt to capture this knowledge <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Other organizations view truth as a product of the exchange of unique, specialized knowledge possessed by individuals, and they gauge effectiveness through personal experience and intuition <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. They are likely to agree with the estimation that up to 75% of an organization's knowledge is experiential and intuitive <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Beliefs about what is true may differ depending on which approach is used to determine truth. Degrees of both may also be seen in organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Motivation (external vs. internal)</head><p>One view of motivation holds that people are intrinsically motivated to perform well; however, the processes or environment within which they work can thwart their motivational drive <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">41]</ref>. If organizations believe people are internally motivated, they structure work environments to remove impediments to effective work. These organizations address weaknesses in systems and processes in order to enhance performance <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. Other views of motivation reflect the belief that individuals must be externally motivated to perform. Central to these views is choice of the appropriate type of reward systems. Organizations that assume people are externally motivated to perform will implement external rewards for performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Orientation to work (process vs. results)</head><p>Some organizations work from a results focus where bthe fundamental concern is on work accomplishment and productivityQ ([9], p. 856). Others view work from a more social or process focus. In these organizations, the focus is on achieving outcomes deemed important to stakeholders by the most effective methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[38]</ref>. These firms focus more on improving the way in which jobs are done and how results are achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">45]</ref>. They expect that favorable outcomes will follow when results are attained <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. This view espouses that borganizations should focus only on process improvements and that by doing so results would followQ ([9], p. 856). However, a more recent viewpoint is that firms should focus on both process improvement and results to achieve their objectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Orientation and focus (internal vs. external)</head><p>Orientation and focus addresses the relationship between a firm and its environment. This includes ideas about the extent to which the firm is focused on its internal or external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[38]</ref>. For example, many firms assume that the key to organizational success is to focus on the processes and people within the organization, whereas others focus primarily on external constituents.</p><p>2.8. Nature of time horizon (short term vs. long term)</p><p>Ideas about time horizon relate to whether the organizational leaders adopt long-range plans or focus primarily on the short term <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">38]</ref>. Firms with management in the former category are more likely to make investments that support their longterm missions. These include investments in information technologies that help the firm more effectively manage its knowledge and get better control over its data and processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A firm with a more short-term focus is more likely to make investments that support particular initiatives, applications, or functional processes.</p><p>A summary of these eight dimensions is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Using Detert et al.'s [9] eight dimensions of culture as a theoretical lens, we investigate how these dimensions affect knowledge sharing in ERP implementation. A model of our research framework is provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>Data were collected using a multi-site case study of four firms in the petroleum industry that had implemented SAP R/3. A single industry and a single ERP software package were chosen to minimize bias that might be introduced because of differences across industries and across ERP software. SAP R/3 was chosen because it is one of the most widely used ERP packages in the petroleum industry and because it has one of the largest market shares in most industries. Since we do not examine the technical configuration of the package, findings should be generalizable to large-scale, cross-functional implementations of ERP packages other than SAP. However, because we are examining large-scale implementations, findings may not be applicable when only one or a few modules of an ERP package are implemented.</p><p>Selection of the four firms began with the researchers contacting the CIO or top IS executive of 10 firms in the petroleum industry to determine if they had implemented or were in the process of implementing SAP, and if so, whether they would agree to participate in the study. Of those that agreed to participate, we eliminated firms that had implemented only one or two SAP R/3 modules with no plans to implement additional modules and we eliminated firms that had not implemented SAP R/3 across the organization or the specific division in which we were interested. Each of the firms in this study implemented the major modules of SAP including FI/CO (financial accounting and controlling), AM (fixed assets management, PS (project systems), PM (plant maintenance), SD (sales and distribution), MM (materials management), and PP (production planning). The dates the firms began their SAP projects range from late 1995 to late 1996. Each used phased implementations rather than a big bang approach. The first implementation in each of the firms occurred 2-3 years after the project began. The firms completed their last implementations 12-18 months after the first ones. Data for this study was collected after all implementations had been completed. The earliest was 7 months afterward, and the latest was 27 months afterward.</p><p>The unit of analysis in this study is the project team. The project team at each site was responsible for identifying and defining processes to be included, configuration and design, coding, testing, implementing, and training. Thus, the team was the unit around which knowledge sharing centered, including sharing among team members and between team members and other organizational members.</p><p>Because of the size of the project teams, interviewing a sample of key members was deemed more manageable than attempting to interview each member. We asked each of the top IS executives to identify key members of their SAP project team. This is an appropriate way to select respondents for case study research because professionals in a field have been shown to be capable of nominating key respondents that have a consistent set of attributes appropriate for a study such as this <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[31]</ref>.</p><p>A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 people across four firms. A written interview guide was used to guide the questions asked and to ensure consistency between interviews (Appen- dix A). The interviews lasted between 1 and 2 hours each and were conducted over a period of 7 months. In addition to in-person interviews, the researchers also preceded and followed the interviews with e-mail and telephone calls for background information, clarification, and points not covered during the interviews. Respondents in each firm included both information systems staff and business/functional staff. Some had been on the team from the beginning, while others joined at various points in the project. Respondents in each firm represented a variety of perspectives on SAP, including some who were pleased with it, some who hated it, and others who were indifferent. They also represented a variety of functional perspectives including accounting, purchasing, refineries, sales and distribution, and engineering. Many were in managerial positions on the SAP team, and many came from various levels of management positions in the firm. Some remained in jobs related to SAP after implementation, while others were given either different or broader responsibilities. In addition, some who were not in IT jobs prior to the SAP project, switched to IT positions during or after the implementation.</p><p>Data analysis was done in two stages. First, a within case analysis was performed in which responses were extracted for each firm and grouped into the eight dimensions of culture. Responses to questions designed to measure knowledge sharing were also extracted. Examples of these measures include such things as dhow did your team learn from the rest of the organization about processes, needs, etc. . .?T, dhow did you make sure that you had learned enough from the integration partner so that you could carry on after they left?T, and dhow was transition of organizational membersT knowledge managed when they left the team?T Examples of responses coded as knowledge sharing (or lack thereof) include things such as dwe used checklists during transition off the teamT. dI felt like I couldn't express my concerns about that because they were process team things, and I was technicalT, and djunior level people felt free to explain to senior level people how they thought the configuration should workT.</p><p>Each firm was assessed in terms of where it fit in the cultural dimensions and for the knowledge sharing that took place during ERP implementation. A crosscase analysis was then performed, where knowledge sharing during ERP implementation across the four firms was compared in terms of each of the eight cultural dimensions. This method links cultural dimensions to organizational knowledge sharing during ERP implementation and provides a logical and coherent understanding.</p><p>To help ensure the validity and reliability of the assessment, we established a case study protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[48]</ref>. The protocol includes a case study database that consists of case study notes, case study documents, tabular materials, and a case study narrative. The case study database created in this research consists of the case study written notes and transcribed interviews, any documents obtained from the respondents, tables of evidence by case site and construct of interest, and a narrative set of answers to each question asked in the interviews. It consists of approximately 100 separate files and 12-15 legal pads of hardcopy. It reveals both the actual evidence and the circumstances under which the evidence was collected (e.g., time and place of interview, whether in-person or telephone interview, responses to questions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Within case analysis</head><p>This section presents a profile of each case site and the knowledge sharing activities that occurred on ERP implementation teams at each of the firms during ERP implementation. Detert et al.'s [9] eight dimensions of culture are used to organize the presentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Company A</head><p>Company A is a U.S.-based oil company engaged in the refining, marketing, and transportation of petroleum products including gasoline, diesel fuel, jet turbine fuel, heating oils, petrochemicals, lubricants, and petroleum-based industrial fuels. Company A operates several refineries in the U.S. and markets gasoline through a network of independently owned and operated retail outlets. Its annual revenues are in excess of $10 billion dollars. It owns one of the largest shares of the U.S. gasoline market and is among the largest owner/operators of bulk petroleum storage facilities in the U.S. It began its SAP project in late 1995, with its first implementation in 1998, and six subsequent implementations completed by the end of 1999. SAP was implemented in all business units in the U.S., for a total of more than 3500 named users (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Knowledge sharing.</head><p>Knowledge sharing took place on the ERP implementation team in Company A in both informal and formal settings. Company A held social events so that members could meet together in an informal setting, build relationships, exchange social information and share knowledge on a casual basis. Informal knowledge sharing also occurred in the workplace, spurred by an open pod layout of the physical workspace. Conversations were initiated or joined by members of the group that would have been much more limited in a structured environment (e.g., with traditional walled offices.)</p><p>Formal settings for knowledge sharing included team meetings and team building exercises. Team members shared hard data during team meetings. This included data from computer printouts, formal analyses, and external reports. However, they also shared opinions and previous experiences. Because managers had come from an environment where they focused primarily on their own units or silos, they found it difficult at first to share knowledge and focus on knowledge integration. They engaged in heated debates at times, yet decisions were made and the group moved on. The team members were able to move beyond what might have been resentment of other silos, perhaps partially because of the informal relationships that had been built early in the implementation project. Team building exercises were done at the beginning of each project phase. These exercises included a review of the previous phase which allowed the team to crystallize lessons they had learned and to identify what to do differently in the future. Overall, Company A's knowledge sharing was fairly high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Orientation to change: change</head><p>Company A was able to make a number of changes as a result of SAP, even though it had been largely stable in the past. Prior to SAP, each area was judged based on its own success within its own area of responsibility. The focus shifted from optimizing each unit's success to optimizing overall corporate success through collaboration and common processes. As one person said, bSAP made my job harder because I came out of a world where I controlled a relatively small team and every aspect of that system. . .. You had control over your own silo. You didn't have a consolidated customer master file, for example.Q Thus, managers were forced to change from managing autonomous silos to managing pieces that fit into an integrated whole.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3.">Control, coordination, and responsibility: autonomous decision making</head><p>Company A was characterized as ba loosely organized, decentralized company,Q where bmanagement doesn't dictate unilaterally how things will be done.Q Employees had flexibility to pursue ideas and make decisions on their own. Although this facilitated collaboration within units, it also led to autonomous, silo behavior among business units where common processes and consistent data across the firm were hard to obtain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4.">Orientation to collaboration: collaboration</head><p>A great deal of emphasis was placed on teamwork and collaboration within each unit. For example, one team member stated, bWe don't have a whole lot of individuals contributing or working on their own,Q and how well employees work in teams is a performance measure. bTeamwork helps develop skills for all the people on the team, and helps people feel a part of the whole.Q ERP implementation team members were encouraged to share knowledge and few contributions were rejected without consideration. A bpodvilleQ structure was used, removing walls and partitions, with team members working in small groups (pods) in one large open area. This structure helped people share knowledge because bsometimes you could learn something just by hearing what the person next to you was talking about.Q Proximity encouraged them to share knowledge that they otherwise may not have shared if they had had to make the effort to find someone to share it with.</p><p>4.1.5. Basis of truth and rationality: hard data and personal experience The implementation teams were structured so that knowledge sharing of personal experiences and perceptions could take place, in addition to knowledge sharing of hard data. As one person at Company A put it, bit was a great team atmosphere. People expressed their opinions, and expressed them very strongly. They'd call people names, and 2 minutes later, they all worked together.Q</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.6.">Motivation: internal</head><p>Interventions to motivate people to share knowledge were focused on internal motivation rather than external motivation. For example, team members participated in both formal and informal team building exercises to motivate them to be willing to share what they knew. The informal activities were primarily social activities to help people get to know each other better so that they would feel comfortable with each other. This helped create an environment in which people felt comfortable sharing knowledge, and thus were more willing to do so.</p><p>The formal approach was used at the start of each new phase of the project. They spent half of a day or a day off-site to go through bwhat we'd done, what we'd accomplished, what we had in front of us, and how we were going to address that.Q This created an environment that emphasized knowledge sharing by explicitly building it into the implementation. Unfortunately, as the project progressed the team felt more time pressure to finish and they tapered off these exercises. With less attention paid to the environment, knowledge sharing became more difficult for the teams. One member said bwhere people came on who didn't go through the extensive team building exercises we noticed some problems with them not having the background of how the culture of team relationships worked and not having had team building experience. We had a few more issues we had to deal with to get everybody in line and working toward the same objectives.Q The team members who did not participate were perhaps less internally motivated to share knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.7.">Orientation to work: process</head><p>The SAP team knew about widely publicized failures of other firms' implementation, and their mantra became bkeep us out of the papers.Q They were more process than deadline/results oriented. They delayed some of the implementations when something was not working. For example, they delayed going into production on one module by 3 months because of poor invoice data and engaged in intensive knowledge sharing across the team to find a solution to the problem. In other cases, they had underestimated the scope of processes, and bshuffled the scheduleQ so they could gather enough knowledge from each other and others in the organization to implement the necessary functionality. bUntil we reached the target, we didn't go live.Q Thus, their focus was on gathering the right knowledge in order to achieve a positive outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.8.">Orientation and focus: internal</head><p>The focus of installing SAP R/3 at Company A was to cut costs and improve operations by leveraging common processes. In regard to ERP, they had an internal focus.</p><p>4.1.9. Nature of time horizon: long term.</p><p>More than 4 years were required to implement ERP software. The expectation from the outset was that this project would be long-term spanning multiple years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Company B</head><p>Company B is the U.S. division of one of the world's leading oil companies. It includes upstream (exploration and production), downstream (marketing, refining, and transportation), and chemical segments. The firm has exploration and production interests in many countries, with a large concentration in the U.S., and it markets its products worldwide. Company B performed five SAP implementations, including one for each of its major business units and corporate headquarters, plus a small pilot test site. It began its SAP project in early 1995, and completed its first implementation in March 1996. The final two implementations were completed simultaneously in July 1998. There are approximately 15,000 SAP users in Company B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Knowledge sharing</head><p>The ERP implementation team in Company B was initially able to overcome some significant challenges to knowledge sharing. However, over time some of the key interventions unraveled, and, as a result, knowledge sharing became limited. At the time of embarking on ERP implementation, Company B had an atmosphere of internal competition. The business units viewed themselves as self-directing silos that competed for common resources, and each unit had its own goals. This, along with an atmosphere of resistance to change in some divisions, made knowledge sharing and focusing on common processes difficult initially. Hard data was used to help divisions realize that their processes were not so different than other silos. For example, one major conflict at the start was that the upstream division did not want to go to common processes at all. So, the team members from each of the other units mapped out the processes in question, and had upstream team members map out their processes, then all met and compared them to identify commonalities. Upstream came to see over time that many of the things they believed were unique were really not, and upstream agreed to move to common processes. In this case, documenting actual processes and comparing them across silos was an effective method of knowledge sharing. During later team meetings however, members discounted personal experiences or insights not based on hard data as invalid. This squelched softer knowledge exchange.</p><p>One intervention to facilitate knowledge sharing that proved successful at first later deteriorated. This was eliminating seniority and functional distinctions among team members. Initially this enhanced knowledge sharing in the form of formal and informal discussions as well as documents and emails exchanged. The lower level employees felt free to provide their input. However, over time, the senior team members began to resent the lower level members, and the degree of knowledge sharing significantly slowed and began to shut down. So, what began as a difficult, but successful attempt at knowledge sharing, deteriorated to limited knowledge sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Orientation to change: stability and change</head><p>Some divisions within Company B had experienced more change than others in the past, and these divisions were more willing to embrace SAP-based change. The more stable divisions did not respond as readily. As one team member said, bdifferent streams (divisions) have adapted differently.Q For example, the SAP sales and distribution operations function was the most complex to implement and the division responsible had experienced the least change in the past. It had the greatest difficulty in adapting to integrated, common processes. The implementation team had to spend more time sharing knowledge and working with the people in this division than they had originally anticipated. As one team member indicated, b(They) adapted very poorly early on. We've worked with them and now, 3 years later, they are doing fine. They believe the data and are comfortable with it.Q On the other hand, the chemicals division was accustomed to change because it operates in an bacquisition and trade environment.Q It had an easier time adapting. We heard, bupstream is primarily accounting-based, so with the changing economy they grew used to change,Q and have adapted to SAP more readily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Control, coordination, and responsibility: Autonomous decision making</head><p>At the time of the ERP implementation, Company B's business units were operating as highly autonomous silos optimizing their own goals, resulting in internal competition. As one manager described it, bwe're really good at competing with each other, but we haven't been as good at competing with external competitors. For example, Company B chemicals competes with Company B oil for resources.Q The culture was one in which divisions were essentially pitted against each other. They each sought to optimize their own goals, with little awareness of whether they were accomplishing overall organizational goals. Autonomous decision making not only abounded, but was viewed by the divisions as necessary for their own survival. Therefore, the cross-divisional collaboration required in an ERP implementation was quite counter to the mindset of those on the team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4.">Orientation to collaboration: isolation</head><p>Prior to SAP, working in a project team had a negative connotation and, consequently, people did not like to work in teams. bOnce someone is on a project, they are always destined to be a project person.Q It is difficult for a person to go back to their old job once they are pulled out for a project. Teams sometimes, although not always, were used as a dumping ground for weak employees. The culture was one where isolation was more valued than collaboration. Although they were able to successfully facilitate knowledge sharing in the implementation team at first, they were not able to overcome the culture of isolation and in the long run knowledge sharing on the ERP team eventually broke down.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5.">Basis of truth and rationality: hard data</head><p>Hard data for decision-making or problem-solving tasks was required and knowledge sharing in terms of personal experience and opinions was discouraged. As one person described it, bIf someone said we can't do it this way, we said, dWhy can't you? Is it really unique?T We'd get them to list what they do and to look at what others have listed, and identify the commonalities.Q Although this is a useful tool for knowledge sharing, Company B's requirement to codify knowledge before any analysis was done may have reduced the sharing of knowledge that was difficult to codify or back up with hard data. The rigid requirement for hard data may have also inhibited people from expressing ideas based on experience about what might or might not work, thereby limiting knowledge sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.6.">Motivation: internal</head><p>Knowledge sharing was internally motivated on the implementation team by eliminating seniority and functional distinctions. External rewards were not addressed. Senior people worked alongside hourly workers on the team, and if the lower level employees had an idea or wanted to try something, the senior people listened to them, and in some cases took direction from them. bIn the old culture a lower level person wouldn't say what they thought in front of a more senior person.Q This worked well in the beginning, but as the project progressed, senior people began to resent that junior people knew more than they did about both the processes and the SAP software. Eventually, the attitudes of the senior people created an environment in which the freedom to express ideas was inhibited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.7.">Orientation to work: results</head><p>There was btremendous push from senior management to meet time deadlines.Q Rather than delaying the project to gather more knowledge, senior management provided more money and resources, going over budget, to ensure the project was not delayed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.8.">Orientation and focus: internal</head><p>When installing ERP, the orientation at Company B was internally focused in that they wanted to improve their organizational processes while cutting costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.9.">Nature of time horizon: long term</head><p>Company B understood from the outset that installing ERP software would require a long-term commitment to the project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Company C</head><p>Company C is the U.S. downstream division of an integrated, global energy company. Company C's parent firm has annual revenues of approximately $40 billion dollars, with $17 billion of that coming from Company C. Company C markets and produces a full range of refined petroleum products including gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, aviation fuel, heavy fuel oil, asphalt, lubricants, petroleum coke, and specialty products and petrochemical feedstocks. It sells gasoline through approximately 5000 branded stations in the United States. Its refined product sales average more than 1.75 million barrels/day, with 64% of sales in the U.S. Company C's parent has also implemented SAP in various divisions around the world; however, since those implementations have been largely independent, we focused on Company C rather than the parent firm to provide a more comparable unit of analysis. Company C began its SAP project in 1996, and divided its implementation into two parts. The first implementation, in October 1998, was for all units of Company C except sales and distribution. Because of the complexities of the sales and distribution implementation, that implementation was completed in October 1999. Company C has approximately 4500 SAP users across both implementations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Knowledge sharing</head><p>There were several barriers to knowledge sharing at Company C that the ERP implementation team had to overcome. At the outset, the team perceived that the outside integrator hired to coordinate the ERP implementation created an atmosphere that was not conducive to knowledge sharing. Because of the integrator's expertise, it appeared to Company C team members that their opinions, experiences, and observations were not welcomed. Reports, descriptions from procedure manuals, and other hard data were presented at team meetings, but the team believed that more subjective knowledge sharing was discounted and thereby stymied. As a result, the team members did not bring up issues such as concerns about ineffective procedures or the possibility of missing target dates. Another inhibitor to knowledge sharing was the competition between business units, and there was a lack of motivation to overcome these barriers. Differences in terminology exacerbated the resistance to share knowledge. Because of these inhibitors, the amount of data sharing throughout the implementation was limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Orientation to change: stability</head><p>Efforts were focused on changing and integrating processes across functional areas both within and across strategic business units. The primary vehicle for this change was the development of a network of people to work with the SAP business implementation managers across functions, across SAP modules, and across business units to facilitate and identify ways to integrate processes. However, as one team member commented, bit is hard for them to carry this (integration) across units, because if they want to do something that the other units don't, they have to convince them it's worth doing.Q For example, the same part may be called three different things by three different units. They have not been asked to change in the past, so each unit resists the changes now, and no unit wants to rename their part. bPeople still want their things the way they had them in the past.Q Thus, resistance to change inhibited the company's ability to share knowledge across units and functions to support organizational change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Control, coordination, and responsibility: autonomous decision making</head><p>The organizational structure underwent changes prior to ERP implementation. In the early 1990s, it moved to a highly decentralized structure based largely on geography. There were several autonomous strategic business units across the U.S., each perform-ing roughly the same functions, yet managed independently. Later in the 1990s, about the time of the SAP implementation, they attempted moved back to more centralized control over operations but silo behavior was still predominant at the time of the ERP implementation. The units bcompete internally better with each other than we compete with competitors.Q</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Orientation to collaboration: collaboration</head><p>At Company C, the implementation team members were accustomed to working in teams on other projects. Therefore, they were comfortable sharing knowledge and working with people from diverse perspectives and different functional areas at the beginning of the ERP implementation. Company C implemented a dpodvilleT structure for the ERP implementation team to help facilitate collaboration, similar to that of Company A. Working together bwas more natural than difficult,Q as one team member said. bWe already knew how to work in teams, we just had to get to know each other on this team.Q However, the integration partner was not as open about knowledge sharing, and often inhibited the team members' knowledge sharing. For example, at one point, the integration partner took over a major portion of the system configuration and largely excluded Company C's organizational team members from participating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.5.">Basis of truth and rationality: hard data</head><p>Team members often felt they could not express ideas without hard data to back them up. Part of this was because the integration partner bwas a lot more rigid on things than we were. We were jointly managing the project, but (the partner) took a very hard line in a lot of things.Q The integration partner's culture did not match the company's culture. One team member indicated that they felt like there were issues that would keep them from making the final implementation date, yet did not express that because bthey weren't my issues-they were process team things, and I was technical.Q One such area was invoicing, which had process oriented post-implementation problems. Even though the integration partner was hired by the company, and was therefore working for the company, it was still able to influence the culture of the project team to the point that experiential knowledge sharing was inhibited. It was able to gain this influence largely because it held more knowledge and had more experience about the software and the process of implementation than the organizational team members. Thus, in spite of a strong organizational orientation toward listening to others ideas, the project team orientation became one of relying on knowledge that consisted of hard data because that was how the group with the most ERP knowledge did things. This suggests that even when organizational culture is one that encourages certain behaviors, the culture of the project team may be quite different when an external integration partner is involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.6.">Motivation: neither external nor internal</head><p>Because team members were already used to working in teams it was believed that the environment was already conducive to knowledge sharing. Thus, the company did not make a concerted effort to provide a special environment for the ERP implementation team. It did not explicitly implement facilitators of either internal or external motivation. For example, it did not provide team building activities, changes to seniority distinctions, special bonus programs or other motivational initiatives. In addition, Company C's integration partner imposed a rigid team environment that actually inhibited knowledge sharing. Thus, Company C's ERP team had neither internal motivators to remove barriers to knowledge sharing nor external motivators in place to facilitate knowledge sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.7.">Orientation to work: process</head><p>The company was more process oriented than results oriented. For example, they had two implementations, yet had only planned for one dbig bangT implementation when they started the project. Soon after the project began, they began to see that the sales and distribution configuration was far more complex, taking more time and resources than estimated. The team felt that it could not implement that part effectively in the original time frame. So, they postponed it for 1 year in order to be sure they had time to gather enough knowledge to implement that piece of the system so that the organization could effectively use it. Thus, although time was important, the focus was on ensuring that the goals for SAP were met, not on simply getting something implemented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.8.">Orientation and focus: internal</head><p>Two of the primary objectives for installing ERP were to cut operating costs and to streamline and improve organizational procedures. The driving force and focus was internal for this project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.9.">Nature of time horizon: long term</head><p>The company spent more than 3 years working on ERP implementation, acceptance, and user training. The time horizon for this project was long term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Company D</head><p>Company D is the chemical division of an international petroleum company. The parent company has annual revenues of approximately $16 billion dollars. Company D accounts for approximately one-fourth of its parent company's revenue, with annual revenues of approximately $4 billion dollars. Company D is a leading chemical manufacturer with interests in basic chemicals, vinyls, petrochemicals, and specialty products. Its products are produced and sold in large volume, primarily to industrial customers for use as raw materials. Company D began its SAP project in late 1996, with the first of nine implementations completed in January 1998. It completed an implementation about every 2-3 months, completing its last one in December 1999. Company D has approximately 5000 SAP users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Knowledge sharing</head><p>The ERP implementation team at Company D exhibited strong knowledge sharing throughout their implementation. Extensive communication of ERP plans, work process changes, and the importance of ERP implementation took place among team members and between the team and the rest of the organization. The project team managers implemented team-based bonuses so the entire team was rewarded upon success of milestones. This facilitated knowledge sharing on the team because it minimized benefits usually associated with knowledge hoarding. Team members were willing to share knowledge with one another, both on a formal and an informal basis. Both hard data, such as current written policies, reports, and other analyses were shared along with soft data such as previous experiences or personal insights. Team members were also encouraged by the project manger and each other to seek out additional expertise if the requisite knowledge was not in existence within the team. Thus, Company D exhibited a considerable amount of knowledge sharing throughout the ERP implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1.">Orientation to change: change</head><p>Processes were changed as a result of ERP implementation. bOur business processes have become much more well-defined and understood.Q bA lot more people are aware of the integration and dependencies among processes.Q For example, the purchasing process is now uniform throughout all the plants. To help achieve this, the plants worked together to change their nomenclature for parts to create a common master file of parts across plants. This was a major hurdle to cross because of the vast number of parts involved. Company D's implementation team explicitly focused on knowledge sharing activities that helped get the organization ready for change. bWe had never worked so hard on cultural readiness,Q one person said. We had decision makers from every functional group in the plants in each design and implementation, which went a long way toward the cultural readiness on which change management was focused.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2.">Control, coordination, and responsibility: concentrated decision making</head><p>While the style of decision making was highly concentrated, Company D also had extensive knowledge sharing, which is counter to what theory predicts about the role of concentrated decision making in times of extensive organizational change. Theory indicates that autonomous decision making provides the freedom of thinking and idea generation necessary for extensive change to occur. Yet, this is not this case at Company D. One explanation for this may be that ERP tends to consolidate decision making by integrating processes across intra-organizational boundaries. Because Company D's decision making style more closely matched that required by ERP, perhaps this match was more conducive to the knowledge sharing required for ERP implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.3.">Orientation to collaboration: collaboration</head><p>Prior to SAP, efforts were in place to create a culture that promoted teamwork, where bpeople are encouraged to share their ideas across functions.Q To help foster this culture, many facilities moved away from the use of traditional titles that imply a hierarchy. Because no one person on the ERP team knew all the things it took to do the project, beveryone on the team had to rely on everyone else.Q Thus, extensive knowledge sharing occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.4.">Basis of truth and rationality: personal experience</head><p>After the first implementation, the team realized that it did not have the right mix of knowledge to adequately model how the processes worked. They believed that this was partly because they did not have the right people involved in the implementation, and that they were missing experiential knowledge. Therefore, they restructured their approach to knowledge sharing and data gathering, even though the new approach required more time for the implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.5.">Motivation: external and internal</head><p>Team members were internally motivated and externally rewarded. The company organized teams by process rather than function to create an environment in which knowledge sharing was internally motivated. This required team members to gain diverse knowledge and understand processes beyond their own functional areas. As a result, they worked in an environment in which knowledge sharing was built into the implementation because neither individuals nor functional areas could proceed without it.</p><p>In addition, external motivation was provided for the teams with a bonus program. Each team member received the same bonus at the end of an implementation, regardless of rank in the organization. The bonus was based on the team's quality of work. This was done to remove competition among individuals that might exist to dget there firstT or to be dlone rangersT in the implementation. Providing the same bonus helped focus team members on accomplishing the common goal of implementing a system that would most benefit the organization. The project manager said that bone of the things I always tell my folks is that SAP is a team sport. If you don't play as a team you can't win.Q Equalizing bonuses also helped to minimize hierarchical and seniority distinctions on the team so that everyone could feel freer to be an equal contributor. As one person described it, bwe had a foxhole mentality,Q whereby team members were united around a common cause. Thus, team members were both internally motivated and externally rewarded to share knowledge to accomplish a common goal. It should be noted, however, that the team-based bonus system was counter to the way employees had been rewarded in the past, and was not easy to implement. The project managers had to work hard to convince top management in the parent organization to let them implement it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.6.">Orientation to work: process</head><p>The company had a process rather than a results orientation to work. They reorganized their entire approach to knowledge gathering after their first implementation in order to provide a system in which knowledge acquisition could better occur. At the start of the project, they followed their integration partner's model where they met with one or two key people at each plant such as engineers and bfolks who knew plant processes and were going to make decisions on who was going to do what.Q However, bthe users were not involved in the actual understanding of how we were building this system, what they were going to see, and what they were going to get.Q In the first implementation, they realized that the users not only did not understand how the processes worked in SAP, they bdidn't really even know what the real process was.Q They only knew their piece of the process. Thus, relying on a few people for process wide knowledge was not sufficient. In subsequent implementations, the implementation team brought more key business people from across plants into the implementation although this took more time. Achieving a strong outcome was more important than meeting a deadline with a weaker product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.7.">Orientation and focus: internal</head><p>Company D was primarily internally focused in terms of their ERP implementation. ERP was seen as a way to reduce expenses internally by making internal processes more efficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.8.">Nature of time horizon: long term</head><p>Management was well aware that an ERP solution was not a bquick fix.Q They were willing to embark on a multi-year effort to install and successfully implement an ERP system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Cross case analysis: synthesis of findings</head><p>In this section, we synthesize our findings and present our extension of theory through a cultural configuration that illustrates which dimensions of culture best facilitate knowledge sharing in ERP implementation. We also discuss barriers to knowledge sharing and propose a model which suggests barriers to knowledge sharing on a project team that arise out of existing cultural dimensions can be minimized by taking initiatives that alter the culture within the project team itself. External forces, such as consultants or integrators can also potentially affect project team culture. This model further posits that the project team culture may be a key driver of knowledge sharing on the team regardless of broader organizational cultural factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Extent of knowledge sharing</head><p>It is useful to first assess which firms facilitated the most knowledge sharing during their ERP implementations. Based on the within case analysis, it appears that Company A and Company D encouraged knowledge sharing throughout the entire implementation. Company B's knowledge sharing started out strong, but broke down later in the implementation. Company C team members felt inhibited to share knowledge from the start of their implementation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> provides a summary of the cultural dimensions for each case site. Companies A and D exhibited the most knowledge sharing. Analyzing the differences and similarities of the firms that exhibited the most knowledge sharing vs. those that exhibited the least yields a configuration of the cultural dimensions that best facilitate knowledge sharing in an ERP implementation environment. These differences and similarities are discussed in the section below. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> provides a summary of the resulting cultural configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Cultural configuration</head><p>Companies A and D differ from Companies B and C on two dimensions: orientation to change and the basis of truth and rationality. First, in terms of orientation to change, all of the firms investigated operate in a relatively stable industry, and are thus traditionally more stability oriented than change oriented. However, Company A and Company D had the least difficulty changing processes after implementation, whereas Company B and Company C found a good bit of resistance. Although Companies B and C were making efforts to change, they seemed unable to sufficiently overcome their orientation to stability to do so. The differences in this orientation between the two sets of firms offers further insight into the differences in knowledge sharing between the  Companies A and D also differ from Companies B and C in their basis of truth and rationality. The teams in Company A and Company D emphasized personal experience in addition to hard data, whereas the teams in Company B and Company C relied primarily on hard data, often discouraging members from sharing dsofterT knowledge. This suggests that, although sharing hard data is important, this alone is not sufficient for the type of knowledge sharing that is needed for a cross-functional, enterprise wide system such as ERP. Thus, the cultural configuration value is Hard Data Plus Personal Experience.</p><p>Interestingly, Company A and Company D differed from each other on two other dimensions of culture. They differed on control, coordination, and responsibility and on motivation. Company A's control, coordination and responsibility was manifest in decentralized silos making autonomous decisions; whereas, Company D was largely centralized with concentrated decision making. Company D's extensive knowledge sharing is counter to what theory indicates about the role of autonomous decision making in times of organizational change, while Company A's knowledge sharing is consistent with theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[27]</ref>. Theory indicates that decentralization promotes knowledge sharing because it allows knowledge to flow more freely throughout the organization and fosters the exchange of ideas [10]. One explanation for the knowledge sharing at Company D is that because SAP centralizes control through convergent data and integrated processes, a concentrated decision making structure may more closely match SAP, and thus also provide an atmosphere conducive to knowledge sharing during implementation. On the other hand, while ERP centralizes data and processes, it simultaneously pushes decision making out through the levels of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Thus, where a firm lies on this dimension may not substantively influence knowledge sharing during ERP implementation because ERP requires both convergent and divergent decision making. Hence, this dimension should be considered within the context of other dimensions.</p><p>Companies B and C were moving from decentralized silos to a more centralized locus of control, coordination, and responsibility. They had begun their moves prior to the ERP implementation, but were still changing during the implementation. In companies A and D, this dimension had been relatively stable. In Companies B and C, the shift away from decentralized silos may have caused people to be unsettled or unsure of what was expected of them. Team members may have been clinging, either consciously or subconsciously, to autonomous behaviors that the prior control structure had enabled, and thus were not as willing or able to share their knowledge. Thus, Consistency in Either Concentrated or Autonomous control, coordination, and responsibility may be more important to knowledge sharing than the actual position within the dimension.</p><p>Companies A and D also differed from each other on the motivation dimension. Company D was the only firm in which the project managers focused on external motivational factors. There is no specific evidence for how much of Company D's knowledge sharing is attributable to the external bonus plan. However, it is likely that because the external bonus plan was team-based, motivating individuals to maximize team performance rather than individual performance, the bonus plan created an environment in which individuals felt encouraged to share knowledge or removed barriers in the environment that may have precluded knowledge sharing. Thus, we have included Team-Based External Motivation in the cultural configuration.</p><p>While both Companies A and D relied on internal motivation, the relationship of internal motivation to knowledge sharing is not straightforward. Company A and Company C each tried a dpodvilleT workspace to create a physical work environment that would internally motivate people to exchange knowledge, yet with very different results. Company A team members were better able to share knowledge with the impediment of physical distance removed, while at Company C this motivator seemed to have little effect. Thus, specific motivators alone are not sufficient explanations for the differences in knowledge sharing. At Company C, an external agent (the integration partner) was able to substantively inhibit the team's efforts to motivate knowledge sharing. Thus, we include Internal Motivation in the cultural configuration as a requisite, but not sufficient condition of knowledge sharing.</p><p>While orientation to collaboration is important to knowledge sharing as evidenced in Companies A and D, our findings suggest that a culture oriented towards collaboration alone is also not sufficient to facilitate knowledge sharing in ERP implementation. For example, even though Company C's culture was one of collaboration and the implementation team members were accustomed to working in teams prior to the implementation, they found knowledge sharing during ERP implementation more difficult because the environment of the ERP implementation team was not conducive to knowledge sharing. Thus, a prior orientation to collaboration does not ensure that knowledge sharing will occur in any given new context. The environment of the team must be addressed and managed from the beginning of the implementation.</p><p>In addition, our data show that prior orientation to isolation does not necessarily impede knowledge sharing in ERP implementation. For example, Company B facilitated knowledge sharing early on in the implementation even though its existing culture valued isolation more than collaboration. It did so by structuring the team so that barriers to collaboration such as seniority and functional distinctions were removed. This structure helped create an environment of collaboration. Teams can take proactive steps or initiatives to overcome the isolation orientation that is rooted in the broader organizational culture. Thus, team environment and structure can overcome a culture of isolation. However, it is important to note that knowledge sharing broke down in Company B as the project progressed. Senior people began to resent the knowledge that junior people had gained and the power the environment provided the junior people. They began to retreat to the old culture of isolation by not listening to or valuing the input of the junior people on the team. Although the project managers had implemented successful interventions in the beginning of the project to facilitate knowledge sharing, they did nothing to reestablish an environment of collaboration when it broke down, even though they recognized that it occurred. One possible explanation may lie in the influence of the traditional culture of isolation; perhaps the intervention was viewed as an effort to overcome an orientation to isolation, and the break down was viewed as evidence that this dimension of the culture could not be overcome. Although traditional orientation to isolation is not sufficient to impede knowledge sharing, the interventions to overcome this must be carefully managed and monitored throughout the project to maintain their impact. Because the two companies that exhibited the most knowledge sharing were highly collaborative, the cultural configuration value for this dimension is Collaboration.</p><p>Our data also suggest that an orientation to work that is focused on Process rather than on deadlines/ results is generally more conducive to knowledge sharing. Companies A and D both had a process orientation, yet so did Company C. However, the influence of this dimension on knowledge sharing at Company C may have been minimized by factors within other dimensions discussed above. Thus, the impact of orientation to work on knowledge sharing may be contingent upon the presence of or lack of other factors, such as external change agents, in the organization's environment.</p><p>None of the four firms differed on the orientation and focus or on the nature of time horizon dimensions of culture. In each firm, the desire was to cut costs and to improve operations by leveraging common processes. With regard to ERP, there was an internal focus in each firm. Furthermore, each of the firms in this study spent 3-4 years implementing SAP R/3 software and all spent many months afterwards to achieve a dsteady-stateT of operations so organizational members understand how to use ERP software effectively. Their commitments to implement ERP were all long-range. Thus, there is insufficient variability among the firms to assess knowledge sharing on the basis of these dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Summary and cultural configuration</head><p>Through examining the dimensions of culture it is apparent that there are complex interrelationships between the dimensions. However, two dimensions of culture unique to the two firms that exhibited the most knowledge sharing are Orientation to Change and the Basis of Truth and Rationality. Companies A and D had an orientation towards change, whereas Companies B and C exhibited significant resistance to change. This highlights the important role of change management in ERP implementation to prepare the organization and the project team for knowledge sharing. The second dimension, Basis of Truth and Rationality, underscores the importance of sharing personal experiences in addition to hard data. This supports the knowledge-based view of the firm which asserts that employee knowledge, experiences, and know-how, are critical resources of the firm. While these two dimensions are necessary, the case studies have demonstrated that each dimension must be supportive of the others, forming a cultural configuration that is conducive to knowledge sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Barriers to knowledge sharing</head><p>Applying the lens of cultural dimensions to knowledge sharing during ERP implementation has allowed a finer grained perspective of the link between culture and knowledge sharing. When analyzing the case data, it became evident that certain cultural barriers impeded knowledge sharing during ERP implementation. For example, at Company B, organizational Team members more likely to share knowledge among those they are already familiar with</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Used formal and informal team building exercises</head><p>Helped orient team membersT toward both a willingness to share knowledge and to listen to others, both for hard data and personal experience Motivation (external vs. internal)</p><p>Team members prone to compete with one another for bonuses in the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Provided equal bonus for all team members</head><p>Reduced tendency to hoard knowledge for personal gain or recognition Orientation to work (process vs. results)</p><p>Organization put pressure on the team to finish by a given deadline Allowed team to rethink situations that do not seem to be working; extended deadlines and reorganized knowledge gathering where necessary Placed focus on gathering the right knowledge hierarchy distinctions carried over to the ERP team. This was a barrier to knowledge sharing because the more highly ranked members were unwilling to listen to members who ranked below them in the organization. This barrier arose out of the organization's cultural norms for how superiors and subordinates interact (Control, Coordination, and Responsibility dimension). At Company C, the integration partner, who participated as part of the ERP team, discouraged sharing of experiential knowledge (Basis of Truth and Rationality dimension) and created barriers to knowledge sharing unique to the ERP teams. Although these barriers existed, there is evidence that, at least some of the time, ERP teams were able to apply initiatives to overcome cultural barriers. For example, several of the companies used formal and informal team building exercises to help team members become accustomed to sharing and accepting both hard data and personal experience (Basis of Truth and Rationality dimension). These initiatives were focused at the team level and therefore affected team culture but not the broader organization's culture. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> provides examples of barriers and initiatives identified in this study, the dimension they address, and how they helped overcome cultural barriers.</p><p>The data suggest that elements of an organization's culture may act as barriers to knowledge sharing on ERP implementation teams. The project team may enact initiatives to overcome cultural barriers, ena-bling the development of a project team subculture. External forces, such as the presence of an external integrator may also influence team culture. This highlights the importance of understanding the norms, values, and modes of operation of external consultants or integrators prior to their selection. The resulting team culture, then, is a direct determinant of the extent to which knowledge is shared within the implementation team. These relationships are shown in the proposed model in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Contributions of the study and directions for future research</head><p>The proposed cultural configuration and research model arising from data collected during our multisite case study extends theory about knowledge sharing in ERP implementation. They provide a theoretically grounded basis upon which future research can be built. Findings suggest that ERP implementation teams are influenced by, but not necessarily bound by existing organizational culture. Although theories exist that support the idea of subcultures within an organization <ref type="bibr">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">40]</ref>, these findings extend these theories specifically for the IS discipline. Because ERP is often implemented to support change in the fundamental structure of an organization, it can also require or bring about Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Proposed conceptual research model. changes in the underlying organizational culture to support the integrated, cross-functional nature of an ERP environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Furthermore, the requirements for knowledge sharing do not stop with the implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">39]</ref>. Therefore, rather than forming a sub-culture, the initiatives that ERP implementation teams pursue in order to overcome cultural barriers to knowledge sharing on the team during implementation may actually form the framework for changes in the broader organizational culture in the post-ERP implementation environment.</p><p>The research model and cultural configuration can also be used as a foundation for investigating further the nuances of knowledge sharing in the ERP environment. While we examined knowledge sharing from a pragmatic perspective in this study, future research should also investigate knowledge sharing from a tacit vs. explicit knowledge perspective. This may yield additional insight on the way cultural barriers affect the sharing of these specific types of knowledge.</p><p>Firms can use the examples of cultural barriers to knowledge sharing as a basis to identify their own barriers and link those barriers to specific aspects of culture. In addition, they can assess whether the barriers are organizationally based issues or whether they arise from within the team itself. This assessment is useful so that firms can also determine the level at which an initiative is required. It is important that organizations monitor these initiatives and make adjustments as needed.</p><p>Our data show that clearly, knowledge sharing does not bjust happen.Q Understanding how these cultural dimensions influence knowledge sharing is important for practitioners engaged in ERP implementation. It is important to recognize that other factors such as leadership, technology, organizational change, and the evaluation and administration of knowledge management may also influence knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. However, it could be argued that these all occur within the broader context of organizational culture. Thus, these findings provide insight into specific aspects of an organization's culture that may be built upon to facilitate knowledge sharing and help identify cultural issues that may need to be overcome. Actions such as team building activities, team bonus programs, relocation of team members into dpodvilles,T and encouragement of members to contribute both bhard dataQ and bsoft knowledgeQ to discussions are examples of changes that could be implemented to facilitate knowledge sharing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
