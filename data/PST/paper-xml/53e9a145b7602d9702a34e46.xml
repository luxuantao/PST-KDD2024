<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invited Paper</head><p>This paper provides an overview of the taxonomy theory which has been proposed as a fundamental platform for solving practical stability related problems in large constrained nonlinear systems such as the electric power system. The theory reveals a two-level intertwined cellular nature of the constrained system dynamics which serves as a unifying structure, a taxonomy, for analyzing nonlinear phenomena in large system models. These broadly divide into the state sjiace aspects (related to dynamic stability issues among others) and the parameter space aspects (connected with bifurcation phenomena among others). In the state-space formulation, the boundary of the region of attraction for the operating point is shown (under certain Morse-hale like assumptions) to be composed of stable manifolds of certain anchors and portions of the singularity surface. Such boundary characterization provides the foundation for rigorous Lyapunov theoretic transient stability methods. In the parameter space analysis, the feasibility region which is bounded by the feasibility boundary provides a safe operating region for guaranteeing local stability at the equilibrium under slow parametric variations. The feasibility boundary where the operating point undergoes loss of local stability is characterized in the form of three principal bifurcations including a new bifurcation called the singularity induced bifurcation. An overview of the recent results which prove that the two-level structure exists even in nonmsooth models that incorporate the effects of system hard limits is also included. SpecGcally hard limits induce a number of new bifurcations. This natural taxonomy of the system dynamics stands as the backbone for developing practical and rigorous computational techniques in detecting diverse instability mechanisms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The objective of this research, ongoing now for more than a decade, is to develop a mathematically precise and physically meaningful theory for the large constrained nonlinear dynamic systems with a clear structure of the details and the interactions throughout the state and parameter spaces-a taxonomy. The mathematical theory for large differentialalgebraic systems (DAE's in short) as separate from power system specifics is presented in Section IV with an overview in Section 11.</p><p>A brief history of recent nonlinear phenomena in power system analysis is presented now with special emphasis on constrained power system models. More extensive citations appear throughout the text on relevant subject areas.</p><p>The first major step in the direction of developing a stability theory was a systematic analysis in [141, [651, [921, 1931   of the large nonlinear (unconstrained) smooth system in a MorseSmale like formulation, which observed the composition of the stability boundary. As in the Morse-Smale theory 1441, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[57]</ref>, a stratification of the stability boundary as a union of the stable manifolds of unstable equilibria (in a descending order) was proved in 1931 while the explicit contribution to the boundary analysis from the presence of periodic orbits was established in [ 141. A novel concept of a "quasistability boundary" was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[92]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[93]</ref> which eliminated impractical interior segments of the boundary and by so doing importantly simplified the analysis and engineering use of the boundary. Specifically based on the concept of the quasistability boundary, it was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[93]</ref> that it is sufficient to consider only the order one unstable equilibrium points (the type one equilibria) for precise and practical analysis of the stability boundary.</p><p>In the parameter space analysis, a static notion of feasible regions was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref> introducing the concept of regions as a tool in analyzing the general feasibility of load-flow solutions. Significance of nonlinear dynamic phenomena such as bifurcations in smooth unconstrained power system models was identified in [ 11 which studied the occurrence of Hopf bifurcations, while other early works <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[51]</ref> analyzed global bifurcations and complex behavior in angle-stability models. On the voltage side, the relationship between the singularity of the load-flow Jacobian, proximity to multiple load-flow solutions and voltage instability phenomena was recognized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, and the precise mathematical connection between these three events was established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> using the Sotomayor theory of the saddle node bifurcation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[59]</ref>. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> also observed the occurrence of a special bifurcation arising in a constrained power system model related to the noncausal nature of the algebraic constraints.</p><p>The importance of the differential-algebraic formulation in voltage stability studies was demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> where several new phenomena were introduced related to the singular points (called noncausal points in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref>). These include observations in small-scale power system models on new contributions to the stability boundary from certain special singular points and the presence of certain bifurcations directly connected with the singularity. The interaction of the state space and the parameter space with initial beginnings of a taxonomy were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[99]</ref> on some minimum size power system models.</p><p>The constrained nature of detailed power system models has been well known in power system analysis. For instance, <ref type="bibr">[94]</ref> and [7, Section 9.21 state the dynamic problem as a "coupled" set of differential equations, coupling via the power-flow equations and variables. Explicit models of the constrained nature were introduced in [I21 for transient stability analysis of nonconstant-impedance type load models. These "nonclassical" power system models were given the name "structure preserving power system models" <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref> which directly reflected the network structure of the power system in the form of algebraic equations within the model.</p><p>There exists a rich history of "direct" stability methods based on energy function concepts and Lyapunov theoretic tools <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref>. Development of Lyapunov theoretic techniques to constrained power system models can be seen in <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>. An extensive Lyapunov stability theory for DAE systems has been proposed in <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref> where some effects of singular points (called impasse points in <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>) are considered. Recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref> uses Lyapunov theory tools <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>, the stability boundary characterization <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> and the static bifurcation properties of the singularity in deriving transient stability algorithms for DAE models.</p><p>The first detailed geometric analysis of a rudimentary constrained power system model was carried out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref> where the rich interactions of the state space features (such as those related to the singularity) and parameter space phenomena (including the occurrence of several local and global bifurcations) were rigorously analyzed. Moreover it was proved that these individual details indeed fit in nicely as an overall structure, what we later called the taxonomy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> included an analysis of a special local bifurcation which arises when an equilibrium crosses the singularity called the singularity induced bifurcation and a new global bifurcation called the singularity connection bifurcation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> where periodic orbits were annihilated. The full fledged taxonomy theory for analyzing the dynamics of large differential-algebraic nonlinear models was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>. A precise two level intertwined cellular structure for each of the state space and the parameter space was proved there.</p><p>In a more general sense, DAE models have been analyzed in singular control theory with applications in robotics [ 131 among other areas. Differential-algebraic systems have also been studied with much interest in nonlinear network theory. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[52]</ref> analyzed certain jump phenomena in singularly perturbed large scale models, while [ 181 proved that in general large DAE's, impasse points where the trajectories of differential-algebraic equations cannot be continued are generic within the set of all singular points.</p><p>In mathematical theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[60]</ref> first posed the problem of special phenomena arising in constrained nonlinear systems. Jump phenomenon in a class of constrained gradient vector fields was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[61]</ref> which also studied the generic dynamic structure near certain singular points in two and three dimensional systems. Later mathematical works in this context appear to be focused on the concept of canards which are complicated jump phenomena leading to duck cycles or canard oscillations <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. Canards occur near certain special singular points under singular perturbations of the DAE models. These methods are based on nonstandard mathematical analysis [ 1011, and are restricted to two and three dimensional systems [lo], <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Around 1990, we and others started systematically investigating large nonlinear systems modeled by differential equations with algebraic equality conditions (DAE's) <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[99]</ref>. The authors have since proceeded to develop a currently nearly complete theory which was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> under the name of a "taxonomy"' which is the topic of this paper. The taxonomy theory in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref> is a theory of very large scope (includes something like 25 major theorems and hundreds of lemmas) which covers both the state and parameter spaces for DAE's, and in its most recent developments <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> also for large systems with many different types of system hard limits. In the Taxonomy theory, all major and minor analytical and structural aspects of these classes of systems are analyzed in detail. The theory for the DAE case is summarized in Section V with a brief synopsis of the hard limit version in Section VI. Section VI also summarizes recent results by others tied to this theory.</p><p>Analysis of the state and parameter spaces for large constrained nonlinear systems in this work have revealed that both these spaces have a two-level cellular structure (in the form of regions and subregions) in a topological sense. This structure is summarized below for the DAE case.</p><p>Briefly the state space is divided at the upper level by the singular surface into open components so that the constrained dynamics restricted to individual components is smooth. However the trajectories when reaching the component boundaries namely the singularity surface typically undergo loss of existencehniqueness, hence lose analytical tractability in the sense of the DAE model. The components in turn contain possibly several stability regions and other instability regions in the lower level of for papers <ref type="bibr">[102]</ref>.</p><p>the state space structure. Among these subregions of a component, the dominant and most interesting region is the region of attraction of the stable operating point. It is proved that the boundary of the region of attraction (under certain Morse-Smale like assumptions) consists among other segments some which derive from the singularity surface itself and also from stable manifolds anchored at special very high dimensional subsets of the singularity surface.</p><p>The parameter space at the upper level is divided into feasibility regions of various operating points by the feasibility boundaries. Operating points cannot cross the feasibility boundaries without losing their local stability in a generic sense. The feasibility boundary consists of three types of principal bifurcation segments including a new bifurcation called the singularity induced bifurcation which was first rigorously studied by us in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. The subregions in the parameter space are called by us the typal regions because the state space topology is uniform at all parameter values within these typal regions. The boundaries of the typal regions consist of local bifurcations and global bifurcations.</p><p>Within the taxonomy theory of DAE's, a special role is played by the singularity both in the form of singular boundaries in the state space and in the form of bifurcations connected with the singularity in the parameter space. The complexity encountered accordingly in the study of these is a major aspect of the work reported here. New bifurcations both local and global are observed here and are precisely analyzed (Sections V and VI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. The singularity and its neighborhood, a difficult area mostly neglected in the literature, has been analyzed thoroughly with a rich classification of subsets of the singularity (such as transverse singular points, nice pseudo-equilibria and nice semi-singular points, and the bad subsets) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, [721. The local and global properties are established for the singular system by globally transforming the singular vector field of the DAE into a smooth vector field which preserves the topology of the state space and the parameter space and this formulation is a novel contribution of our work <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>. Analysis of these matters reveals many detailed questions which must be answered before a precise description of these major structural elements is possible. All this amounts to a theory of very large scope <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> that is presented in a condensed form in Sections V and VI. It is offered as the solid foundation for continuing research in this area, and as the basis and starting point for engineeringkomputational solutions of practical problems. The authors and others are now engaged in work on these areas.</p><p>Application of the feasibility boundary aspects of the theory (related to the occurrence of the supercritical Hopf bifurcation and the birth of sustained oscillations) was recently completed by us in <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> for computational analysis of a very large (about 7500 buses) power system subject to a real life disturbance. This recent effort by the authors encourages further development of large system computational algorithms based on the taxonomy theory making this theory a practical tool for stability analysis of the large power system.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 11, we summarize the mathematical aspects of the large DAE models while Section 111 is specifically connected with the operational aspects of the electric power system. Section IV introduces the singularity aspects of the DAE problem through a simple rudimentary power system example. Section V presents the salient features of the taxonomy theory for the dynamics of large DAE systems in the form of several theorems and lemmas. Section VI reports some of the recent extensions to the theory by others and by us.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">A N OVERVIEW OF THE DAE DYNAMICS</head><p>A large class of physical systems [13] including the quasistationary (slow with respect to the carrier frequency which is 60 Hz in US) dynamics of the large electric power system can be modeled by a parameter dependent differential-algebraic system of the form (1) f : IRn+m+q + IR,"</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E: x = f ( z , y , p ) , 0 = d",Y,P), g: IRntm+u i IR" (2) 2 E X C I R n , y E Y C I R " , p E P C I R 4 .</formula><p>The formulation of the model (1) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is as follows.</p><p>In the state space X x Y , dynamic state variables 5 and instantaneous state variables y are distinguished. While the (dynamic) z variables have their associated dynamics explicitly modeled by (l), the dynamics of the (instantaneous) y variables is assumed to be so fast that the constraints g = 0 (2) are always satisfied. Even though formally the variables y and p appear to be of similar nature in (1) and (2), they play fundamentally different roles in the formulation of E. As just stated, the variables y are state variables which change instantaneously with variations in the z states, whereas the variables p are parameters which are assumed to have no dynamics in the model E.</p><p>For the electric power system, typical dynamic state variables are the time dependent values of generator fluxlinkages and rotor phases, control states, and load dynamic variables. Typical instantaneous variables are the load-flow variables (the bus voltages and angles) so that the power balance equations or the load-flow equations typically form the set of constraints g = 0. The parameter space P is composed of system parameters (the system topography, i.e., what is energized, and equipment constants, e.g., inductances), and operating parameters (such as loads, generation, voltage set points, etc.).</p><p>For a fixed parameter, po, the state variables z and y describe the time behavior of the system, i.e., the stationary solution as well as the transients. Note that in the DAE model C, each trajectory (or transient) must satisfy the network equations or the algebraic constraints (2) at all times. Therefore the state space which is the collection of all trajectories is contained in the constraint set L where L is defined by the constraint (2) as </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L = {(Z,Y) E x x Y : g(z,y,po) = o}. (3)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Various kinds of bifurcation surfaces</head><p>Typically the constraint set L is a "stratified set"* of maximal dimension n and note that L need not be a manifold in general. Every trajectory of the DAE model C must lie within the set L so that the trajectory obeys the underlying network (2). However, generally there exist certain points within L where the trajectories may run into "conflicts" in satisfying the constraints (2) which are called the "singular points" <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref> or "noncausal points" <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> or "impasse points" [18], [34] for the network (2).</p><p>For properly understanding the system behavior near the singular points, it becomes necessary to consider much more detailed models for "resolving" the conflicts at the singular points and therefore the system behavior near singular points demands a very careful scrutiny.</p><p>Next we proceed to identify the singular points of C mathematically. Given a point on the constraint set say (50, y0,po) E L, if the Jacobian D,g = is nonsingular at (zo, yo, PO), then by Implicit Function Theorem, there exists a unique solution say y = h(z,p) of the network equations which satisfies g ( z , h ( z , p ) , p ) = 0 locally near (zo, yo, PO). Therefore locally near (20, yo, PO), the dynamics of C exists as a well defined smooth system described by k = f ( z , h ( z , p ) , p ) . Consequently, the trajectories of the constrained system C are uniquely defined (with no "conflicts") near (50, yo, PO) and we conclude that (ZO, y0,po) is not a singular point for E. As the natural next step, we define the remaining points of L where the Jacobian D,g is singular to be the singularpoints of C or the singularity S ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s := ((2, Y) E L: A(2, Y , P O ) := det(D,g)(z, Y,PO) = O } .</formula><p>(4) regions In later sections, we will prove that the trajectories of the constrained model C can undergo loss of existenceluniqueness at singular points and hence generally the behavior of C near singular points in S is very difficult to analyze.</p><p>Typically the singular set S is a stratified set of maximal dimension n -1 embedded in L and L is separated by S into open regions, the components C of the state space. Since the trajectories of C are typically not well defined at the singular points in S , the state space then is confined to the complement of S in L. In other words, the state space is separated into connected components by singular surfaces 2Loosely speaking, a set that can be written as an ordered union of several manifolds of decreasing dimensions is said to be stratified <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref>. (the first level of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Within each component, stable equilibria and other stable limit sets have their regions of attraction bounded by stability boundaries along with other instability regions (the second level of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</p><p>The stability boundary of the region of attraction of a stable equilibrium can be characterized for the DAE system C as shown in Section V. This assumes that the system admits a dissipating energy function and the w-limit set3 for any trajectory in the stability boundary consists only of equilibrium points and periodic orbits. Under Morse-Smale-like assumptions, it can be shown that the stability boundary of the singular system C consists of trajectories which converge to the anchor points, along with sections of the singular surface. Unstable equilibria, unstable periodic orbits and special subsets of the singular surface called the semi-singular surface and the pseudoequilibrium surface constitute the set of anchor points. The detailed analysis of the singular dynamics C is summarized from <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref> in Sections V-B and V-C.</p><p>The parameter space (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) which is the set of all parameter values is composed of typal regions (regions of structural stability) bounded by bifurcation surfaces (first level of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). Typal regions have the property that the type of the system or the topological nature of the state space remains unchanged for all the parameter values within a typal region. Conversely, the parameter values where the topological properties of the system do undergo changes are the bifurcation values for C and the bifurcations then bound the typal regions in the parameter space.</p><p>Typal regions are grouped into feasibility regions where the feasibility region consists of all operating points which can be reached from the given operating point by continuous variations of parameters without loss of local stability (second level of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). The boundary of the feasibility region is mostly composed of three types of codimension one (roughly ( q -1)-dimensional in a q-dimensional parameter space) bifurcation surfaces, namely the well known saddle node and Hopf bifurcations <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>, and a new bifurcation called the singularity induced bifurcation [68], <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>. At the singularity induced bifurcation, one eigenvalue along the equilibrium locus changes its stability status by diverging through infinity, while the other eigenvalues remain bounded. It can be shown that the feasibility boundary for C can be solved for as common zeros (called zero sets hereafter) of three different sets of functions and each zero set corresponds to the closure of one of the three bifurcation surfaces mentioned above, i.e., the saddle node, Hopf, and the singularity induced bifurcations. Therefore generically the loss of local stability at the operating point is completely characterized by these three local bifurcations. Moreover, it can be shown that <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref> some of the interior feasibility boundary segments which correspond to the common boundary of the saddle node and Hopf bifurcation segments are also interesting 3 A point 2 is defined as a w-limit point for a trajectory z ( t ) , if there exists a diverging sequence { t k } such that z ( t k )i as t -+ 00. The set of all w-limits points for the trajectory z ( t ) is defined as its w-limit set. because global bifurcations such as the saddle connection bifurcation [30] will also be present near these points. However, for large nonlinear systems, analysis of other global bifurcations which may be related to complicated system behavior appears to be a formidable task owing to analytical and numerical difficulties. Now after establishing the structural features of the state and parameter spaces, let us study the problem from a different viewpoint namely in the sense of local and global stability properties. By local stability, we mean the local properties near an equilibrium point. The global stability issues on the other hand are connected with global properties such as whether an initial condition belongs t0 the region of attraction of an operating point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Local Stability Issues</head><p>When the parameters p are varied, it is intuitively clear that the quantitative behavior of the trajectories of the model C will be different. However, when we consider system operation at a stable operating point, we can demand that the condition of small-signal stability or local stability at the operating point be preserved under parametric variations (such as under slow load variations) so that continued system operation at the equilibrium point is feasible. This motivates a notion of feasibility region in the parameter space as the set of all operating points in the parameter space which can be reached by quasistatic parametric variations during the system operation. This region then naturally identifies a safe operating region in the parameter space within which the operation can be shifted around freely (by slow continuous parameter changes) without an imminent danger of losing local stability or small-signal stability. Of course, it has to be remembered that typically the size of the region of attraction (roughly the size of the stability domain) decreases down to zero as one approaches the feasibility boundary, therefore the proximity to the feasibility boundary (the boundary of the feasibility region) could also imply potential emergence of transient instability problems. In other words, while the system operation has to stay inside the feasibility region for sustained local stability, it is also desirable that it stays well inside the region and away from the boundary to lessen the danger of transient instability phenomena.</p><p>All this demands a careful analysis of the feasibility boundary for gaining insight into its structure and for developing computational methods. These matters are summarized in the first level of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. It can be shown (see Section V-(2.2) that the boundary of the feasibility region typically consists of three types of bifutcation surfaces, namely the saddle node, Hopf, and a special type of bifurcation which only arises in constrained models of the form C called by us the singularity induced bifurcation (Section V-C.2). Identification of these bifurcation boundaries either by eigenvalue computations (such as by using the EPRI program SSSP) or by other direct means <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[56]</ref> (see point of collapse methods [6] and continuation algorithms [4]) provides us with the means for computing the boundary of feasible system operation. Our team has recently developed effective computational techniques for the feasibility boundary computation in large scale systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> using the results in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Global Stability Issues</head><p>The primary question in global stability issues is connected with determining whether the trajectory starting from an initial condition say zo will converge to a stable equilibrium point say xS. Therefore the limits of global stability are defined by the boundary of the region of attraction or simply the stability boundary for z, (the lower level in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). More details on the stability boundary analysis follow in Section V-C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In. AN OVERVIEW OF POWER SYSTEM OPERATION ISSUES</head><p>The objective of the large power system is to economically generate and to distribute power to its customers through transmission and distribution networks with standard quality of service meaning that voltages, currents and frequency are within appropriate tolerances (this quality is called here the viability of the system and is also called the acceptability in the power engineering literature) and as free as possible of disturbances, oscillations, etc. Planning designs the system for being able to be operated viably under most circumstances and to minimize the number and seventy of cases when such normal operation is not possible.</p><p>Changing conditions and disturbances are always a possibility and the system is very large indeed with states ranging in the tens and hundreds of thousands. Typically every transmission line and every generator is different, unlike even larger telephone and computer systems where identical components are present by the millions. The time scales of the dynamic events considered here range widely: the fast range of the voltage and angular transient stability roughly from 10 ms to 10 s, medium range of automatic generation control (AGC) involving speed governors, turbines, and boilers in the minutes, and much slower even seasonal for hydrostorage.</p><p>Our personal motivation for these studies comes from the power system and mostly its fast and medium range dynamics. Nevertheless most of the results are applicable to any large nonlinear DAE system, and such DAE problems will also occur across all time ranges of the power system. Accordingly the presentation in Sections V and VI is in general terms although the power system interactions and motivations are stated throughout. Some of the general issues connected with the power system will now be pointed out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Region of Security</head><p>There are numerous optimization problems in the power system such as the economic dispatch of generation, energy management systems (EMS), automatic generation control (AGC), and the optimal power flow (OPF) among many others. Load forecasting and generation scheduling form another crucial area. However the bottom-line is the security of the operation and we will take our motivation from there in this paper.</p><p>The power system is secure if it has regions of feasibility, viability, and transient stability of adequate shape and size either 1) to assure continued system operation or 2) return of the system to the operating point, or 3) (in case of equipment loss) the shift to an alternate feasible, viable and transiently stable equilibrium point following any "first contingency" from a prespecified set of first contingencies. Furthermore the following definitions apply.</p><p>1) Viability, i.e., all voltages, currents, frequency, etc., are within the applicable tolerances. This defines an open viability region, V, in the parameter space.</p><p>2 ) Feasibility, i.e., the operating point exists as a stable equilibrium which is continuously movable as such over an open feasibility region, F , in the parameter and state space. 3) Transient stability, i.e., when subjected to any of a specified set of contingencies, trajectories converge back to a stable operating point from any state within an open region of transient stability in the state space. In other words, the region of security, i.e., safe operating region is defined as the intersection of the regions of viability, transient stability and feasibility. Our attention here will be devoted primarily to feasibility and transient stability since viability has no direct dynamic features.</p><p>Note that "transient stability" is a special and traditional term in the power system in that it depends on a set of specified contingencies. This term will be used in its traditional meaning within this paper. Specifically an equilibrium point say 2, is transient stable if the system converges back to a viable stable equilibrium condition after it is subjected to any one of a specified set of first contingencies. This of course happens if the post-contingency initial state lies within the region of attraction of a suitable stable equilibrium point for the post-contingency parameter values. This postulates a knowledge of the stability boundary of the relevant region of attraction for checking transient stability which is difficult problem analytically and computationally. However transient stability can be evaluated without knowing the stability boundary by numerically computing the post-contingency trajectories.</p><p>A very large effort is in progress in the literature (more than a thousand papers) to "bypass" the trajectory computation or the finding of the stability boundary by various approximations often connected with Lyapunov theory, to estimate the minimum distance, the dynamic security margin, from the post-contingency state to the stability boundary. This paper is not directly connected with this part of the literature. In the paper, the emphasis is on establishing the precise structure of the stability boundary. Equipped with this knowledge of boundary composition, viable approximations of the boundary can be developed using Lyapunov theoretic tools. Some developments in this direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref> will be discussed in Section VI. In what follows, we will see that dynamic stability problems (both numerical and analytical ones) are naturally related to the dynamic structure shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Validity of the Quasi-Stationary Phasor Models</head><p>The differential-algebraic model C based on the phasor representation for the transmission network is indeed an excellent model for studying dynamic phenomena provided the variations of the phasor state variables are much slower than that of the carrier (that is, for studying dynamic phenomena which are much slower with respect to the 60 Hz carrier frequency). This traditional assumption known as the quasistationary (or quasistatic) phasor approximation is a fundamental limitation in the DAE power system model and it cannot be ignored in the analysis of E.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, [SI], <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref>, we have observed the limitations connected with conventional quasistationary lumped parameter RLC models for the transmission lines in the DAE phasor formulation. The lumped parameter transmission line model is indeed a good approximation in analysis for dynamics not faster than those in the common transient stability variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref>. However, many of the emerging (thyristor based) voltage control actions and some of the voltage stability phenomena are so fast that the quasistationary assumption which is the basis for the traditional DAE phasor model simply loses validity. The DAE formulation implies instantaneous dynamics of the transmission lines (resulting in the algebraic phasor power flow (2)) and so it neglects the fast electromagenetic transients within the transmission lines.</p><p>Recently by using a novel notion of fast balanced timevarying phasors <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, an extensive analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> has proved that the precise model for the balanced power system (with distributed parameter type line models) is one of differential equations for the equipment (generators, loads, etc.) constrained by algebraic equations with line specific time-delays for the transmission network. When the lines are short and for sufficiently slow dynamics, the effects of these time delays can be neglected as an approximation thus yielding the conventional power flow equations. However, for studying faster phenomena such as for the behavior near the singularity and for understanding the trajectory behavior In this section, we will focus on a simple power system model studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>, E901 which serves as an excellent platform for introducing the special nonlinear phenomena in DAE models. We want to emphasize that the two-dimensional (2-0) model example used in this section is only meant to be for illustrative purposes and the theory to be presented in Section V i s applicable for systems of any size that is for the general large system. Assumptions like the generator dynamics in (5)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and on load models in (10) and (1 1) apply only to this section and should not be inferred to the general discussion. The rudimentary power system model CZ to be introduced in Section IV-A has the advantage that the constrained dynamic properties can be readily displayed graphically in the form of comprehensive numerical simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>. Moreover, the structure of the dynamics observed for this model in Section IV-B on the state space properties does carry over to the large system as established in Section V. We will also return to the DAE example Cz in later sections for additional illustrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A Rudimentary Power System Model</head><p>A rudimentary power system consisting of a generator with load at the end of a transmission line as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> is used as a vehicle to illustrate various constrained system related dynamical phenomena investigated in this paper. Using a simplified one axis generator model and a first degree control dynamics which is a simplification of the IEEE Type 1 excitation dynamics [103], the model for this rudimentary power system can be stated as follows where the quantity HG denotes the generator mechanical inertia (time) constant, f s is the synchronous frequency ( f s = 60 Hz for the US power system), the quantity Er is the voltage set point, Efd is the nominal field excitation, and T and K are control coefficients. All the quantities are stated in per unit and the notations are conventional.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 0 = -(E; -EGE'COS(SG -8 ) ) 4 1 + -(E&amp; -EGE COS(&amp; -6 ) ) R: (9) E E G .</formula><p>Note that the model CO indeed has the fundamental differential-algebraic structure as stated in Section 11.</p><p>Among the dynamic equations, the second order (5) represents the angle dynamics while the (6) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) together model the generator voltage dynamics for this simple power system. The algebraic (8)-( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) are the standard power balance equations for real and reactive power-flow written at the generator terminal bus ((8), ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)) and at the load bus ((lo), (1 l)), respectively.</p><p>First note that this differential-algebraic power system model CO reduces to the very familiar classical swing equation model under the following assumptions: (aal) set the load bus to be an infinite bus; that is, set E = 1 and 6 = 0; and (aa2) set E' = constant. Under assumptions (aal) and (aa2), the voltage dynamics drops out of the model since E' = constant and the angle dynamics reduces to the simpler form,</p><p>The second order ODE model C1 is routinely used in angle stability studies and specifically C1 is a standard power system dynamic model introduced in power system textbooks in the context of transient stability [ll]. Local and global dynamic phenomena in the model C1 are well understood and hence we will not discuss the model C1 in this paper. We only note the following in the context of constrained systems. Under assumptions (aal) and (aa2), it follows that the algebraic constraints (8)-( 11) can always be eliminated so that the classical power system model C1 results from the full DAE model CO as an unconstrained ordinary differential equation model. In other words, there is no singularity in the model CO when assumptions (aal) and (aa2) are imposed. We see next that when these assumptions are modified for studying the voltage dynamics, there do exist singular points in the algebraic constraints (8)-(11) depending on the load P and Q behavior.</p><p>Next for analyzing voltage dynamic properties, we remove assumption (aal) and replace (aa2) with the following assumption on the angle dynamics: (aa3) set 6' = constant.</p><p>Note that assumption (aa3) (6' = constant) is the exact counterpart of the assumption (aa2) (E' = constant) for the voltage problem and has the same purpose of simplifying the overall model CO into a reduced order model say C2 which is more suited for identifying voltage dynamic phenomena. This assumption can also be justified by the fact that there is only one inertia in the system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and hence the angle dynamics (5) is essentially decoupled from the voltage dynamics by assuming that PM matches the load P. With assumption (aa3), the differential-algebraic model CO reduces to the simpler DAE model CZ as stated below after straightforward algebraic simplifications.</p><p>I ) Dynamic Equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I C ~ -IC&amp; ( E 2 + IC'&amp;) +---IC' E' + E a ] (13) 1 -K ( , J ( I c P ) ~ + ( Z Q + E 2 ) 2 -E, (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>2 ) Algebraic Equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">0 = E'2E2 -( I C ' P ) ~ -( d Q + E 2 ) 2 .

Before we proceed to analyze C2, we note that other simplifications of the model CO are possible of course. For instance, if we only impose assumption (aal) (that is by assuming that E = 1 and S = 0), the model CO would be a convenient model for studying the voltage-angle interactions in the rudimentary power system configuration and in this case it can be shown that the overall dynamics (which is four dimensional) is extremely complex. In fact, a recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> proves the occurrence of complicated behavior (which is induced by excitation system hard limits) in the model CO under the assumption (aal) from the nonlinear interactions of the voltage and angle phenomena. However, these results are beyond the scope of this paper and we restrict the discussion in this section to the model C2. Here the real power load P is assumed to be a constant and the reactive power load Q is assumed to be bus voltage (which can vary during system operation) and the system parameters p , = (Tio, X d , IC&amp;, x)' (which are equipment and transmission line constants), respectively. We proceed to discuss the singular aspects of the state space phenomena for Cz in Section IV-B.</p></div>

In other words, it can be proved that the model E2 always has singular points (that is the singularity S (18) is nonempty) unless both P and QO are zero which would be an unrealistic load model <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>. To visualize the implications of the constraint manifold L and the singularity S, let us look at the actual constrained dynamica of C2 shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> for a specific set of parameters. The folded manifold shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> is the constraint set L for this example. Note that all the trajectories of Cz lie on the manifold L; however, some of these trajectories approach and seem to "end" at (or originate from) the line denoted a -a in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> which can be verified to be the singularity S for our example. First note that at every nonsingular point, i.e., for every point in the constraint manifold not on the line a -a, there exists a unique smooth trajectory which lies on the manifold as was stated in Section 11.</p><p>On the other hand, at each singular point on the segment aa (excepting at the special singular point $), either two trajectories of Cz approach the singular point (in positive time) and end up in a "conflict" or an "impasse" [IS] at this singular point (when the singular point is below the point $ on the singularity aa) or two trajectories of Cz leave the singular point (when the singular point is above the point $ on the line aa). In reality, when a trajectory reaches such a singular point either in positive time (for singular points on the segment a-$ below $) or in negative time (for singular points on the segment $ -a above $), since this trajectory cannot be continued on the constraint manifold L, it is clear that the trajectory exits the manifold L , i.e., the trajectory behavior can no longer be predicted using the DAE model E. It becomes necessary to consider more detailed system models for describing the dynamics 08 the manifold L ("beyond" the singular points) and the nature of these models would depend on the actual physical system under study. For nonlinear circuits for instance, singularly perturbed dynamic models emerge when the parasitic effects of circuit capacitances and inductances are included in the model [lS], <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[52]</ref>. However, in the electric power system, questions on the dynamics off the constraint set L are far more challenging to analyze since the quasistationary assumption which is the fundamental building block of phasor dynamic representation used in DAE power system models loses its validity in these domains (see Section 111-B) and hence the singular points should be considered as transitions to unpredictable behavior in power system models <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. At the special singular point $, two different trajectories of C2 seem to crisscross each other at $ and hence the DAE system behavior is even more complex.</p><p>Geometrically we see from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> that the constraint manifold L is divided into two open connected components namely LFhlgh and LFl,, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> by the singularity S (the line aa in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) and the dynamics within each of these two components is smooth. As observed above, the trajectory behavior near the singularity S, i.e., the line a -a in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, is more complicated. Some of the singular points (above $ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) act as "sources" of two trajectories while some other singular points (below $ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) act as ''sinks'' of two trajectories and the special singular point $ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> separates the two different types of singular points. In Section V-A, we prove that this source-sink nature of the singularity is in fact preserved in general large system models E. The source-like singular points are precisely defined "transverse sources" and the sink-like singular points are defined "transverse sinks" in Section V-A. The special point $ which has an interesting characteristic that the trajectories near $ behave like near a saddle point of a smooth system is indeed proved to possess dynamic properties like a saddle point and is defined a pseudo-saddle in Section V-A.</p><p>The main difference in large systems compared to the rudimentary power system in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> is that each of these subsets namely transverse sources, transverse sinks and pseudo-saddles emerge as very high dimensional surfaces: (n -1)-dimensional, (n -1)-dimensional, and (n -2)-dimensional manifolds, respectively, within an ndimensional constraint set L. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, since the constraint manifold L is 2-D with n = 2, the transverse sources (the singular points on the segment $ -a above $ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) are 1-D; the transverse sinks (the singular points on the segment a-$ below @ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> ) are also 1-D; whereas, the pseudo-saddle (the point I , ! J in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) is zero-dimensional, respectively. The precise structure of the singularity for the large system including properties of other types of singular points is established as an ordered dynamical hierarchy in Section V-A (see Theorem 1, the Singular Dynamics Hierarchy Theorem).</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, note that there exist two stable equilibrium points xi and x; each belonging to a state space component LFhlgh and LFl,,, respectively. There exist two regions of attraction in the state space of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> for the two stable equilibrium points xi and xi, respectively. For the DAE model C2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, the regions of attraction of the two stable equilibria xi and z j are clearly subsets of the state space components LFhlgh and LFl,,, respectively, and the boundaries of the regions of attraction consist of singular points together with trajectories converging to the special point +. Specifically for the stable equilibrium (which is the normal operating point), the boundary of the region of attraction for lc; (the stability boundary) consists of the singular source points on a -$ above the point $ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and the trajectory in the component L F h l g h that converges to the point $ from below point $ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. A similar structure exists for the region of attraction of the other stable equilibrium xe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>Note that the trajectory originating from an initial condition (for instance, the post-contingency state in power system transient stability studies) within the region of attraction for xi converges to the operating point zS, thus resulting in normal system operation. On the other hand, if the initial condition (or the post-contingency state) is outside the region of attraction for xi (e.g., anywhere in the component LFl,, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) then the trajectory will not converge to the operating point xi thus possibly leading to voltage collapse and system breakup.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, we observe that the structure of the stability boundaries for the two equilibria xi and xj are quite similar. That is, the stability boundary for either equilibrium in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> is a union of 1) certain singular source points, and 2) the trajectory converging to the pseudo-saddle point $. In fact, we prove in Section V-B that the stability boundary in the n-dimensional large system model C can consist of ((n -1)-dimensional) singular sources as well as the trajectories converging to ((n -2)-dimensional) pseudo-saddles. Moreover, there can exist additional types of singular points called nice semi-singular points and bad pseudo-equilibrium points on the stability boundary together with stable manifolds of regular unstable equilibria and of smooth unstable periodic orbits. Full details on the stability boundary for DAE models follow in Section V-B. We need to remark at this point that the stability status of the low voltage equilibrium xe (observed as a small-signal stable equilibrium in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) demands a careful scrutiny in a real power system as related to the fast dynamics off the constraint set L which has not been considered so far in the DAE model C <ref type="bibr">[102]</ref>. Detailed discussions on this topic of dynamics outside the DAE domain of C in power system models are available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</p><p>In summary, we observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> that the singular points can drastically influence the trajectories of the DAE system since the validity of the DAE model typically breaks down at singular points. Structurally, singular points are significant a) in dividing the constrained state space L into open components (upper level of the state space structure in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>), and b) in bounding the region of attraction of a stable equilibrium (lower level of the DAE state space structure in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Similarly the singular points play fundamental roles in determining the parameter space structure leading to the birth of local and global bifurcations in the DAE model and a comprehensive analysis for the DAE model C2 is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>. However, owing to space limitations, we will not discuss the details of the singularity related parameter space phenomena in this section.</p><p>V.</p></div>

An analysis of the main structural features of the constrained dynamics with emphasis on those aspects which are caused by the presence of the algebraic constraints is given in Section V-A. Since the analysis of the overall structure in Section V-A is necessary for both the state space analysis of stability regions and the parameter space analysis of bifurcations, these issues are treated separately in Section V-A. Section V-B deals with stability regions in the state space and the main objective is to characterize the stability boundary d A of the region of attraction A of a stable equilibrium point. The structure of the parameter space is summarized in Section V-C. The concept of a feasibility region is defined. The singularity induced bifurcation, which arises when the equilibrium is at the singularity, is rigorously analyzed in Sections V-C.3 and V-C.4. A brief introduction to the concept of typal regions is presented in Section V-C.5.</p><p>In this paper we present the theory in a more tutorial fashion.

The flow of the vector field Z describes the dynamics of the system. The transformed vector field ZT is globally smooth and leaves the constraint surface invariant. ZT will be used in the proofs thus facilitating standard nonlinear analysis. The results for the singular systems can be readily reinterpreted for the DAE system C. Therefore this singular transformation serves as a powerful tool for analyzing the singular dynamics of C using standard (i.e., not nonstandard [loll) mathematical analysis. This formulation allows us to analyze both local and global properties of the singular dynamics in large DAE's C which is a novel contribution of our work.</p><p>The vector field ZT is obtained when the vector field Z is pointwise scaled by the determinant A(z, y). Denote by (L\S)+ and (L\S)the open sets where this determinant is positive and negative, respectively. Then it is easy to see that on (L\S)+ the vector field Z and ZT are equivalent while Z and the time reversed vector field -ZT are equivalent on (L\S)-. If (z0,yo) is an equilibrium point for the vector field 2, then it is also an equilibrium for the new vector field ZT, and the eigenvalues in the transformed system are simply scaled by A(z0,yo). As curves, the trajectories of Z and ZT are identical in L\S.</p><p>Whereas 2 is not defined on S , ZT defines a smooth vector field on all of the constraint surface L. But because of the multiplication with A which vanishes on S, the transformed vector field ZT has an additional set of equilibrium points in the pseudo-equilibrium surface Q.</p><p>An example for illustrating the transformation from Z to ZT is quoted for the DAE system Cz from <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">10</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>) as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>   Comparison of the phase-portraits for the actual Z dynamics in (a) and the transformed in Section 1V.A on the phase-portrait shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).

It is intuitively clear (and mathematically a direct consequence of the implicit function theorem since M does not intersect S) that the differential-algebraic system can be described by a smooth dynamics on the manifold portion M . However, it is a priori not at all conceivable that a smooth dynamics may also exist, respectively, extend to the nonmanifold portion L\M (necessarily a subset of S by definition). In fact, this can only be done if all nonmanifold points become equilibria for the transformed system.

The strength of our theory is that we can state these properties for the general system C as summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>Singular points such as the transverse sources R,, and transverse sinks R,; are significant because they are related to the impasse nature of DAE trajectories (or DAE solutions). The impasse behavior of DAE solutions has been pursued with much interest in the theory of nonlinear networks. In [18], points where positive (negative) timecontinuation of solutions is not possible are called forward (backward) impasse points. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction arguments, it is proved in [18] that impasse points (forward and backward as defined above) must be generic within the set of singular points S. The analysis in this section proves that transverse sources are backward impasse points and transverse sinks are forward impasse points f o r the DAE system E. In our geometric analysis of codimension one dynamics, the transverse sources and transverse sinks have been derived analytically with explicit easily verifiable algebraic formulas (by construction), and these naturally emerge as the least degenerate objects within the singularity S.

It can be proved that when the two nonzero eigenvalues are complex at a pseudo-sink (or a pseudo-source) say $, there exists no DAE solution of C that converges to II, in positive or in negative time. However, when the two nonzero eigenvalues at a pseudo-sink or a pseudo-source II, are real, the local dynamics is more involved and this topic will not be discussed here. We concentrate our discussion in this section on the dynamics of Z near pseudo-saddles since the pseudo-saddles play a vital role in the stability boundary analysis later in this section.</p><p>Consider any I I , E N,,. Since the equivalent linear system has a one dimensional stable and unstable manifolds, it directly follows that $ has one dimensional stable and unstable manifolds for Z T . But we are interested in analyzing the dynamics of 2. Locally near $, the singular set is a manifold by Lemma 7 and the determinant A changes sign at the singular set. Therefore the trajectories of ZT need to be reversed on one side of the singular set for finding the integral curves of 2. Hence we need to carefully look at the relative position of the singular set, compared to the stable and unstable manifolds.</p><p>We call a pseudo-saddle transverse if its stable and unstable manifolds are not tangent to the singularity and denote the set of transverse pseudo-saddles as Ntr.sa. Locally near any pseudo-saddle $ E N,,, the singular surface is described by setting 7 1 = 0 and the pseudo-equilibria (which locally are pseudo-saddles) are characterized by setting 171 = 0 and 172 = 0 in Lemma 7. Clearly the Jacobian of the dynamics evaluated at $ has n -2 zero eigenvalues. Define e k as the unit vector along the q k axis. Then it is easy to see that ( e 3 , e4, . . . , e,} form the set of eigenvectors for the zero eigenvalues. If the stable (unstable) manifold is tangential to the singularity at 4, then the eigenvector for the stable (unstable) eigenvalue lies on the singular surface 171 = 0. Hence in particular at $, f," in Lemma 7 must be zero for nontransverse pseudo-saddles. Hence, generically, tangentiality of the stable (unstable) manifold to the singularity, occurs only at a lower dimensional subset of N,,. In other words, generically, pseudo-saddles are nontransverse only at lower dimensional subsets. In the general spirit of our approach, we look at the transverse pseudo-saddles as the most regular structure in N,,. The local dynamics for the vector field Z near transverse pseudo-saddles is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref>. Near any transverse pseudo-saddle, as the stable and unstable manifolds are transversal to the singularity, the singularity divides a neighborhood of $ into two parts, each containing one stable and one unstable trajectory as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref>. Since the trajectories get reversed on one side of the singular set from ZT to 2, the unstable and stable manifolds of the pseudo-saddles for ZT become continuous trajectories for Z as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref>.</p></div>

Analysis of the Stability Regions</head><p>The objective of this section is to study the stability boundary d A of the region of attraction A of a stable equilibrium point.

Intuitively, for z to lie in the stability boundary of another equilibrium say 7, it is necessary that it separates two regions of convergence (condition (*)). This is guaranteed if part of the unstable manifold of z lies in the closure of the stable manifold of 7. These essentially are the first two statements made.

The contribution of the stable manifolds of the periodic orbits to the quasistability boundary aA c,an also be established in an analogous way.</p><p>More precisely, in addition to Assumptions (A0)-(A3), we make the following assumption:</p><p>(A4) The w-limit set for any trajectory in d A consists only of equilibrium points. Assumptions (A3) and (A4) together imply that all the trajectories on the stability boundary converge to equilibrium points, pseudo-equilibria, or semi-singular points (no periodic orbits on aA). The energy function Lemma (Lemma 9) can be restated to guaraintee both assumptions (A3) and (A4) and the proof is exactly the same as for Lemma 9. Note that all the existing energy functions for constrained power system models of the form C do not permit the presence of periodic orbm anyway [33], [34], hence this assumption (A4) is not restrictive.</p><p>For the quasistability boundary we only give the decomposition analogous to Theorem 3. The main constituents are the same objects except that now only the most regular structure needs to be considered, such as only order 1 equilibria versus arbitrary unstable equilibria in the stability boundary. Recall that the order of an equilibrium point zo is the dimension of its unstable subspace and it is denoted by a superscript in the theorem below. A qualitative representation of the boundary d A is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">10</ref> (periodic orbits are also included for conceptual clarity) which pictorially describes the qualitative behavior of the various constituents in the quasi stability boundary. For instance, trajectories in the semi-saddle surface touch the singular segment, but do not cross over. Hence the backward orbits form part of the stability boundary since trajectories to one side converge to zo while trajectories to the other side diverge to the singularity. Similar features explain the presence of stable manifolds of equilibria or periodic orbits very much like it can be observed in the phase portraits for the rudimentary system.</p><p>A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for determining when a candidate is an anchor point on the quasistability boundary is summarized as a Theorem below. This is a fundamental result which distinguishes the anchor points of the quasistability boundary aA for instance from unstable equilibria which may lie in the interior of the quasistability region int (A).</p></div>

For instance, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">8(a)</ref>, indeed the trajectory leaving the saddle xy to the left of xg converges to xS, while the trajectory leaving the saddle xy on the right side diverges to the singularity. Hence, we can conclude that the saddle xy does belong to the quasistability aA which is evident in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">8(a)</ref>. The second statement within (a) of the Theorem above then implies that the stable manifold of x; belongs to the quasistability boundary and this is indeed the case in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">X(a)</ref>. That is, the two trajectories which converge to the saddle xy thus forming the stable manifold for xy do belong to the quasistability boundary in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">8(a)</ref>.</p><p>The second set of statements (b) in the Theorem is a more technical result. Essentially since pseudo-saddles and semi-saddles are very high dimensional surfaces, the necessary condition for anchor points is applicable only at most of the anchor points but need not be satisfied at all the anchor points. That is, when the pseudo-saddles in the set N$-l belong to the quasistability boundary, most of the trajectories leaving the pseudo-saddles will converge to the stable equilibrium under consideration and a similar statement applies for the semi-saddles as well. For instance, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">8(c</ref>), note that the pseudo-saddle $ lies on the quasistability boundary of xi. In this case, indeed the trajectory leaving the pseudo-saddle $ on the right side of qj (which is the unstable manifold for $) does converge to xi, and moreover the trajectory which converges to $ from the right side (which is the stable manifold of +) is part of the quasistability boundary. In other words, the stable manifold of 4 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">8(c</ref>) separates trajectories converging to xS, from those diverging to the singularity. It needs to be stated that since the rudimentary system C2 is 2-D, for the special case of n = 2, since the set N?-, (and NiPl) is a zero (n -2 = 0) dimensional object, density requirement leads to the stronger condition of being applicable everywhere. 5) Energy Function Results: This section introduces briefly an application of the stability boundary results using the machinery of energy functions which has been pursued by a number of researchers i141, <ref type="bibr">[191, i291, [341, [421, [93]</ref>. Another paper in this special issue <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> discusses the energy function aspects of power system stability analysis in more detail. The results in this section specifically are extensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> of the arguments introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[93]</ref> for the unconstrained nonlinear system formulation.</p><p>Suppose an energy function V with the properties as defined in Lemma 9 is available but the w-limit set in A only consists of equilibria.

The energy V is decreasing along the trajectories. Suppose 01 and p are anchor points. By continuity, if 01 E aWs(p), then V ( a ) 2 V ( p ) . By Theorem 4, every anchor point that is not principal, belongs to the boundary of the principal anchor points or the boundary of their stable manifolds. Hence we have proved the next result:</p><p>Lemma 14: The energy function attains its lowest values at the closure of the set of principal anchor points in the quasistability boundary.</p><p>The next result provides an energy function based estimate of the stability region A.</p><p>Lemma 15: Suppose a is an anchor point.

To provide a practical tool for judging the stability of the given point, next an energy function type method is described for finding the "critical" sections of I he stability boundary (which has multitudes of sections, on a large system) where the boundary may be breached. Among all the principal anchor points, we will prove that those with energy higher than the energy of the given initial state, can be ignored for the stability test. The result thus considerably reduces the complexity of a rigorous stability test. This concept was originally introduced and analyzed in 1931 and stability monitoring schemes based on this concept have been developed in 1911. Here we extend those results to include new segments in the quasistability boundary for our problem, such as the singularity and the pseudo-saddles.</p><p>Dejnition 2: Given an initial condition 20, the critical anchor points are the principal anchor points with energy lower than V ( x 0 ) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Structure of the Parameter Space</head><p>The parameter space can be broadly divided (functionally) into the set of all system parameters (which do not change during system operation) and the set of operating parameters (that can change during operation). When these parameters change, the state space (consisting of system trajectories or transients) associated with each parameter value undergoes changes, however the structure of the state space remains topologically equivalent unless we encounter certain boundaries in the parameter space, namely the bifurcation boundaries. In other words, the bifurcation surfaces in the parameter space divide the parameter space into open connected regions called the typal regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> within which the structure of the state space remains identical. This includes the static properties such as the equilibrium structure, dynamic local, properties such as the stability status of equilibria, and dynamic global properties such as the composition of the stability boundary. Therefore this knowledge on the properties of typal regions would provide us with a sort of "complete" overview of the current system operation for security studies. However at the present time, such an overview ,seems to be impossible even theoretically for large nonlinear systems. This is because the boundary of the typal regions consists of local and global bifurcations. Specifically the global bifurcations in general can themselves be dense in open sets of the parameter space [9], [30] (complex behavior), which then renders the problem extremely difficult to analyze even for systems in dimension three, let alone the large system. For these reasons, we restrict the analysis in this section to the study of a simpler yet more practical concept in the parameter space called the notion of feasibility regions.</p><p>The concept of feasibility regions in the solution space of nonlinear problems has existed for a long time (for instance, in optimization theory). In the power system context, Jargis and Galiana <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref> introduced a notion of load-flow feasibility for quantifying the solvability of the load-flow equations in the parameter space. Later work of Fischl et al. 1281 extended this concept to include the effects of small-signal stability by restricting the analysis to those solutions where the system is small-signal stable. The boundary of this region then consists of points where an operating point undergoes change in its eigenstructure, and these points therefore correspond to local bifurcations. In unconstrained system models, it is well known that the generic local bifurcations are the saddle-node bifurcation (connected with zero eigenvalue of the system Jacobian) and the Hopf bifurcation (related to purely imaginary eigenvalues of the system Jacobian). The first case of zero eigenvalues and the saddle-node bifurcation has been studied extensively in the recent past connected with the voltage collapse phenomena. The Hopf bifurcation can be generally associated with oscillatory phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref>, [SO] leading to either stable oscillations (supercritical Hopf [30]) or oscillatory divergence (subcritical Hopf [30]). Recently, occurrences of oscillatory voltage disturbances have been reported by the industry, even though this phenomenon is not well understood in general. There has been extensive research progress recently 141, [6], [23], 1261 on the problem of computing the nearest saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation points in the parameter space.</p><p>In 1671, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, we have proposed a notion of feasibility region in the parameter space as the set of all operating points in the parameter space which can be reached by quasistatic parametric variations as part of the system operation. This region then naturally identifies a safe operating region in the parameter space within which the operation can be shifted around freely (by slow continuous parameter changes) without an imminent danger of losing local stability. Of course, it has to be remembered that the size of the region of attraction (roughly the size of the region of transient stability) decreases down to zero as one approaches the feasibility boundary (see Loss of Stability Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>, and Section IV-C. 1), therefore the proximity to the feasibility boundary, that is the boundary of the feasibility region, could indicate potential emergence of transient instability problems. So in summary, while the system operation has to stay inside the feasibility region for sustained small-signal stability, it is also desirable to stay well inside the region and away from the boundary to lessen the danger of transient instability phenomena. All this demands a careful analysis of the feaGbility boundary for gaining insight into its structure and for developing techniques to compute them.</p><p>We will show that the boundary of the feasibility region as defined here typically consists of three types of </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SADDLE NODE</head><p>bifurcation surfaces, namely the saddle node, Hopf and the singularity induced bifurcations (Section IV-C.2). It can be shown that the saddle node bifurcation boundary segments can be computed by solving for a zero set of explicit functions [30], <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[59]</ref>, which forms the basis for computational methods which exploit the rank deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[56]</ref> (point of collapse methods [6]). Computational methods have been developed for computing the distance to the saddle node (a small sample [4], [6], <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>) and Hopf bifurcation boundaries [23], <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. Here we will show that all the three bifurcation surfaces can be characterized as zero sets of explicit functions and hence the whole feasibility boundary should be amenable to computational methods for system security of the large system. Note that this characterization may need to be combined with model reduction techniques such as dynamic clustering approaches [98] and/or participation factor approaches <ref type="bibr">[64]</ref> for developing practical computer algorithms.</p><p>1) Feasibility Regions and Feasibility Boundary: In this section we give a brief introduction to the concepts, but refer the reader to [80] for a detailed analysis and more discussions.</p><p>Let EQ = {(z,y,p) E X x Y x P:</p><p>f ( z , y , p ) = 0, g(z,Y,P) = 01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref> all eigenvalues of J = oXj -~, j ( ~, g ) - <ref type="bibr">' ~, g</ref> have negative real parts}.</p><p>(64) OP = {(z, y,p) E E&amp;: D y g is nonsingular and</p><p>Here D, f etc. denote the matrix of partial derivatives of the components of f with respect to z.

Hence OP is a p-dimensional submanifold embedded in EQ C X x Y x P.</p><p>De$nition 3: Given a stable equilibrium = (50, yo) (a load flow solution) for parameter value po, the connected component F of OP which contains (zo,yo,po) is called the feasibility region of z:. Its boundary (relative to EQ) is the feasibility boundary.</p><p>Note that the feasibility region is defined as a subset of X x Y x P , not as a subset of the parameter space. This way, all possible stable equilibrium points which can be reached ji-om (xo, yo, PO) by continuous variations of the parameter while maintaining stability form the feasibility region. Furthermore the feasibility regions directly interact with the regions of viability and transient stability. The intersections of these three define the region of security as explained in Section 111-A.</p><p>Theorem 6 (Feasibility Boundary Theorem): For a system defined in (1) and (2), the feasibility boundary of a feasibility region F consists of three zero sets</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">d~ = ( d ~ n cs) U ( d ~ n C z ) U ( d F n C H )</formula><p>where Cs = {(z,y,p) E EQ: det Dyg = 0 } Cz = { (x,y,p) E EQ: d e t D y g # 0 and CH = { (S,Y,P) E EQ: det Dyg # 0, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">J = D,f -Dyf (D,g)-'DXg (69)</formula><p>and Hn-l is the Hurwitz matrix <ref type="bibr">[loo]</ref> corresponding to the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of J .</p><p>The three zero sets, which constitute the feasibility boundary, correspond to specific conditions on the eigenvalues of the system. As a point on EQ approaches Cs some eigenvalues diverge to infinity. The equilibrium has zero eigenvalues in the set Cz and purely imaginary eigenvalues for points in the set CH (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">11</ref>). Under generic conditions local bifurcations occur at all these points, namely a singularity induced bifurcation in Cs, a saddle-node bifurcation in Cz and a Hopf bifurcation in C H . Moreover, generically these bifurcations constitute a dense subset of the feasibility boundary for (1) and (2). Saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations are well known in the literature and these will not be discussed here. The singularity induced bifurcation will be analyzed. A qualitative representation of the feasibility boundary is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">12</ref>.</p><p>2) Principal Bifurcations on the Feasibility Boundary: The feasibility boundary d F may cont,ain some internal segments of the boundary, i.e., in int(F) (closure is with respect to EQ, the set of all equilibrium points). Since such boundary segments a F n (int(F)) lie in the interior, they do not correspond to loss of stability of the operating point. If ( x , p ) E d F n (int(F)), then we ciin find a neighborhood U of ( x , p ) in EQ such that most of the operating states in U are stable. Hence, with the model (1) and (2), the feasibility boundary segments in the interior d F n (int(F))</p><p>do not imply loss of stable operation at the present operating equilibrium state.

Furthermore, for the system (1) and (2) most of the boundary points lead to a saddle-node, Hopf, or a singularity induced bifurcation.</p><p>3) Analysis of the Singularity Induced Bifurcation: When the steady state solution or the equilibrium defined by EQ approaches the singularity S , it has been observed that some eigenvalues of the system Jacobian at the equilibrium point become unbounded [17], <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>, it was shown that this case generally is 'equivalent' to a transcritical bifurcation ('exchange of stability <ref type="bibr">' bifurcation [30]</ref>) for a 2-D system. In this section, we analyze this scenario for the general system (1) and (2), when the equilibrium approaches the singularity. As the change in the structure is caused by the presence of the singular surface, we call this bifurcation the singularity induced bi- furcation. For analyzing the bifurcation, we use the singular transformation, which was introduced in Section V-A.3. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Local Dynamics Near the Three Principal Bifurcations:</head><p>A detailed study of the qualitative behavior of the system C near the three principal boundaries, namely the saddle-node, Hopf, and the singularity induced bifurcations provides the insight on how the instability develops as the system operation approaches one of the feasibility boundary segments. For the saddle node bifurcation boundary, such an analysis was presented in [24] using center manifold theory for certain unconstrained power system models. It was shown that the occurrence of the saddle node bifurcation is related to the voltage collapse phenomenon under some conditions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref>, [SO], we have considered all the three principal local bifurcations for the large constrained system C, and established the qualitative local behavior of C for the three cases. These results are briefly stated below 1781, [801.</p><p>1) The saddle node bifurcation segments of the feasibility boundary correspond to monotonous divergence. (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref>).</p><p>2) The supercritical Hopf implies the transition from stable equilibrium to sustained oscillations. (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">14</ref>).

Moreover, this invariant manifold is locally "attracting" on one side of the singular surface, and "repelling" on the other side, thereby providing a "conduit" for the trajectories from one side of the singular surface to cross over to the other side at finite speed, possibly either diverging toward a new steady state condition or ending at the singular surface, where a different model takes over. The constrained model C does not provide sufficient information to distinguish between the two different types of behaviors, so the singularity induced bifurcation denotes a true barrier to predictable behavior with the model C from a mathematical as well as an engineering viewpoint, Moreover the loss of reliable system prediction using C at this bifurcation follows for any constrained model of the form C under certain generic transversality assumptions and is not related to the limitations of the quasistationary assumption in phasor power system models. A detailed description of the local dynamics near the singularity induced bifurcation is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[80]</ref>.</p></div>

Using a Lyapunov function from [34], a constrained minimization algorithm is proposed in 1481 which identifies the "nearest" pseudoequilibrium points on the stability boundary for computing the dynamic security energy margins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Hard Constraints or Hard Limits in Large Nonlinear Systems</head><p>In analyzing large physical systems which is the objective of this study, we need to consider hard limits which are always present (in very large numbers) in a real physical system. The significance of analyzing these hard limits has been emphasized in recent committee reports on voltage stability [ 1051, [ 1061 and an extensive coverage of modeling the hard limits in power system stability analysis can be seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>. Recent papers in the power system literature [25], [3S], [SS] have analyzed certain instability phenomena arising from encountering the hard limits in specific system models.</p><p>In a general sense and functionally these hard limits can be divided into three basic types <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>, namely 1) the actuation limits (or the windup limiters in IEEE power literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>, [103], [104]), 2) state limits (or the nonwindup limiters in IEEE power terminology 1391, [103], [104]), and 3) switching type limits (or the relay type limits in power terminology). These are briefly introduced below from a conceptual viewpoint:</p><p>The windup limits or actuation limits &lt;are hard limits which appear in the internal transfer of certain variables such as control errors which are functions of some states and have an internal actuating role. These hard limits do not directly affect state variables (unlike the nonwindup limits as we see below in item 2), rather the effect is through the overall dynamics. Specifically the input to such a device could "wind-up" while the output is stuck at a limit, hence the name the windup limits. These limits can be modeled in the system by introducing internal actuation variables say z, = h,(z,p) for some function h, so that z, is strictly limited between a maximum value say zu, and a minimum value say ze,. (see Section V-C.1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>, L84.1, [1031. Nonwindup limits or state limits are functionally quite different from the windup limits since a nonwindup limit directly affects the status of a state variable. That is, when a state with a nonwindup limit reaches its limit, the state variable gets "stuck" at this limit value until the dynamics drives the state to move away from the limit value. In other words, when a nonwindup limit is encountered, and is active (the "free" dynamics is trying to push the state past the limit), then the state variable becomes a constant in the model, and the system loses a degree of freedom (system dimension in the sense of dynamics drops by one). Note that this state variable stuck at the nonwindup limit will indeed return to be an unconstrained variable the moment the "free" dynamics allows it to do so. Hence there is no windup of the state involved here. The state variable is strictly limited between its limiting values at all times hence the name state limit. The state limits can be formulated by suitably modifying the respective state derivative terms to become zero when the limits are reached and are active [391, [841, 11031. 3) In the case of switching limits, reaching the limits initiates preprogrammed structural action which then in turn can change the whole system, its state and/or parameter space. These switching actions are initiated by relay mechanisms and protective limiters in the physical system, which monitor certain states (or certain functions of several states) of the system and depending on their preprogrammed logic, take protective actions when certain (disruptive) events are sensed. For the power system, detailed models for including the effects of relays in system dynamic studies have been recently proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref>. Essentially the relay elements can be included in the analysis by modeling their internal logic mechanisms as state dynamic equations. In general, the switching type limits can be modeled by introducing certain internal variables say s, = i j 2 ( z , p ) where the function v,(x,p) takes only two values either zero or one <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Each of these hard limits can be introduced into the DAE model resulting in an overall system representation which is of a hard constrained set of differential-algebraic equations. By separately considering the three types individually, it can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> that the two-level cellular structure of the DAE dynamics introduced in Sections I-V is preserved in this case.</p><p>Here we briefly discuss some aspects of this two-level cellular structure in the parameter space which consists of feasibility regions in the first level and the typal regions in second level. Let us start with the construction of the feasibility regions. Then we will analyze its bifurcation structure and show that there exist new bifurcation types on the feasibility boundary which arise when some of the hard limits are encountered under parametric variations.</p><p>In general, encountering the actuation limits either 1) may imply sustained local stability at the operating point, or 2) may lead to local bifurcations which disrupt local stability (called actuation limit induced bifurcations). The first case 1) then corresponds to interior points within the feasibility region whereas the latter case implies a boundary for feasible operation at the equilibrium. Therefore one of the main problems in local stability analysis of systems with constraints is to construct methods for distinguishing between the two types. In what follows, we develop such methods, for the case of actuation (wind-up) limits, in the form of several Theorems.</p><p>The model for studying actuation limits or windup limits can be formulated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> where and 2 E IR", z E IR"", p E I R 4 , f : R"+"z+q + R", h: R"+q + R " z , h: R"+'J + R " z , f is C" and h i s C".</p><p>Essentially the internal actuation variables z, which are functions of ( z , p ) are bounded above by zu, and are bounded below by ze,.</p><p>Specifically we will show that when the hard limits are reached, if a certain quantity called a' is positive, then these points must be static bifurcation points (see Theorem 10). The strength of this result is that the annihilation of the operating point at the static bifurcation can be proved and be verified by simply checking the sign of a without doing any time-consuming eigenvalue computations. The actuation limit induced static bifurcation is similar in character to the saddle node bifurcation of smooth systems [30] but here two equilibrium points meet transversally and disappear <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. The case of a' being negative is more complex. We will show later (see Theorem 11) that this case may either lead to sustained stability or result in dynamic bifurcations depending on the eigenproperties.</p><p>As a first step in the construction, let us define the set of all equilibrium points EQ. All the topological definitions which follow are with respect to EQ. EQ := { ( z , p ) E Rn+q: f ( 2 , p ) = O}. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(76)</ref> The limiting surfaces are defined as those points where the states reach the respective hard limits.  (80) Some of the critical equilibria may also be locally stable, however since the local dynamics is not smooth, their stability status cannot be verified in the form of Jacobian or its eigenvalues. To obviate the technical difficulty, we simply dejne those critical equilibria to be operating points which upon parametric perturbations lead to smooth operating points in OPsmooth. To be precise, define the set of operating points by the topological operation which is in the spirit of a method introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[93]</ref> O P := int(OPsmooth).</p><p>When the topological definition is interpreted, essentially an equilibrium point in EQ is an operating point in OP, if under small parametric perturbations, most of the neighboring equilibria lie in OPsmooth, i.e., most 'of the neighboring equilibria have locally smooth dynamics and are locally stable. Note that this broad formulation of OP also includes relevant nonhyperbolic equilibria in EQsmooth hence is a powerful tool for analyzing the feasibility. Next we can define the feasibility region which by construction of OF (81) also captures all the interior critical operating points.</p><p>Definition 4 (Feasibility Region): Given an operating point ( z , p ) E OP, the feasibility region F of (xs,ps) is the connected component of OP that contains ( x S , p s ) . The boundary of F (relative to EQ) is the feasibility boundary denoted d F .</p><p>As in the case of the DAE system C, the feasibility can be shown to be composed of zero sets.</p><p>7'heorem 9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>: Feasibility boundary d F consists of the three zero sets C z , C H , and EQcritical, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82)</ref> where and denotes the Hurwitz matrix of order n -1 as usual.</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">d F = ( d F n C z ) U ( d F n C H ) U ( d F n EQcritical)</formula><p>A qualitative representation of the feasibility boundary for the actuation limited model C,i is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_28">17</ref>.</p><p>Among the three zero sets in Theorem 9, the sets Cz and C H lead to saddle node and Hopf bifurcations respectively as in the case of smooth systems. However, specifically  the model constrained by actuation limits (windup limits).</p><p>Qualitative representation of the feasibility boundary for because of the presence of actuation limits in the model C,l, there arise additional bifurcations which are parts of the feasibility boundary segment in d F n EQcrltlcal. These bifurcations are summarily denoted actuation limit induced bifurcations.</p><p>Actuation limit induced bifurcations roughly divide into two fundamentally different types, the limit induced static bifurcations denoted BASB and limit induced dynamic bifurcations denoted BADB. At actuation limit induced static bifurcations, it can be shown that two equilibrium points of C, 1 "collide" and disappear. Hence feasible system operation ends at the limit induced static bifurcations on the feasibility boundary BASB n d F , with the annihilation of the operating point. In other words, there does not exist a local equilibrium after encountering the feasibility boundary BAsBndF much like the saddle node bifurcation [30], even though in this case the bifurcation is encountered abruptly and in a nonsmooth fashion by the operation hitting some actuation (windup) hard limits.</p><p>In the case of actuation limit induced dynamic bifurcations, it can be shown that the equilibrium point "survives" the bifurcation but the local stability properties in the sense of the eigenstructure of the system Jacobian undergo changes at the bifurcation. Therefore encountering the feasibility boundary BADB n d F again leads to loss of local stability at the operating point, even though further study is indicated on establishing the resulting dynamic behavior. In some cases, this diverging trajectory (after the limit is encountered) can be shown to result in sustained hard limit induced oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Conditions are proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> for determining when the limit induced dynamic bifurcations lead to the birth of stable (and unstable) limit induced nonsmooth periodic orbits in 2-D system models.</p><p>Brief statements of the Theorems for the static bifurcation BASB and the dynamic bifurcation BADB are presented below. The Theorems require certain transversality conditions which are stated first <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. The first condition is a simplifying assumption. In power system models, generally the actuation limits or the windup limits appear related to one state variable at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref> which motivates</p><p>Strictly speaking, at the critical equilibrium (20, PO), neither of these Jacobians J: and J i is directly applicable.</p><p>However in bifurcation analysis under parametric perturbations, they play significant roles in determining the local behavior. The next condition enforces certain txansversality with respect to parameter variations (AB3)</p><p>We define a factor ai which essentially determines the nature of the bifurcation, whether it is static or dynamic as we will see in the Theorem below. Next we can consider the remaining case, namely when the factor ai is negative. Let us define ne, and ne, as the number of eigenvalues of J: and J,, respectively, with positive real parts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(ADB4)</head><p>With Assumption (ADB4) in place of (ASB4), we get the dynamic bifurcation Theorem. It can be shown that in 2-D models, occurrence of these bifurcations is related to the emergence of stable and unstable hard limit induced oscillations and precise conditions can be stated <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>: (Actuation Limit Induced Dynamic Bfurcation Theorem): Suppose (z0, P O ) E EQcritical satisfies assumptions (ABO), (ABl), (AB2), (AB3), and (ADB4). Then (z0,po) is a dynamic local bifurcation point. Moreover ( z 0 , p o ) @ OP. In particular, ( z 0 , p o ) does not belong to any feasibility region.</p><p>Essentially the results in this section prove that the presence of actuation limits can themselves induce both static and dynamic bifurcations when the operating point encounters the limits upon parameter variations. Simple conditions have been proposed in this section which are directly valid for the large system model applicable to any number of actuation type or windup type hard limits. Moreover there also emerge global bifurcations such as the emergence of hard limit induced homoclinic orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</p><p>In general, it needs to be emphasized that both local and global properties of the system Cat in the state space ai &lt; 0 and ni, # nk,.</p><p>and parameter space can undergo significant changes when the trajectories encounter hard limits, and modeling them explicitly in the analysis is crucial for identifying and in understanding instability phenomena accurately.</p><p>An analysis of the nonwindup limits or the state limits has been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. The results for this cases are even richer than for the windup limits. Unfortunately space does not permit a discussion of these even in the form of a sketch.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>A systematic theory for large scale nonlinear systems which are constrained either 1) by smooth algebraic equality conditions or 2) by nonsmooth hard limits of the various types including the actuation (windup) limits, state (nonwindup) limits, and the relay type (switching type) limits, is currently being developed by the authors under the name of a taxonomy. The theory covers most of the varied dynamic phenomena arising in such models in the state and parameter spaces as they interact. Results for the algebraically constrained systems are almost complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>. Recently the theory has been extended to incorporate the effects of hard constraints in the form of various hard limits and has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. This part of the theory is substantially complete and the theoretical work is continuing on some aspects. There is significant progress on practical implementations by others [34], <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref> and also by the authors who are analyzing very large scale actual disturbances encountered in the US system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
