<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper addresses the problem of synchronizing networks of nonidentical, nonlinear dynamical systems described by Euler-Lagrange equations, which are assumed fully-actuated, with their states available for measurement, but with unknown parameters. The only assumption made on the communication graph is that it is connected. Moreover, the communication is subject to constant time delays, which are also unknown. The main result of the paper is the construction of an adaptive controller that achieves global full-state synchronization, i.e., the difference between the agents positions and velocities asymptotically converges to zero. If a desired trajectory for all systems is given, a slight modification to the proposed scheme achieves also full-state synchronization.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Motivated by applications in physics, biology and engineering the study of synchronization of collections of dynamic systems has become an important topic in control theory. For a literature review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and references therein. Roughly speaking, the synchronization objective is to reach some kind of agreement between some variables of interest of the systems. Clearly, the two main ingredients in this problem are the individual dynamics of the systems and the interconnection pattern among them. In the present paper, the goal is the design of interconnection control laws to synchronize nonidentical, nonlinear dynamical systems described by Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations. The motivation to consider EL-systems stems from the fact that EL-models describe a very large class of physical systems of practical interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In particular, it contains mechanical, electrical, electromechanical, power network and power electronic systems. In several applications it is desirable to synchronize EL-systems. For instance, multiple robot manipulators or mobile robots achieving a cooperative task, or an electrical power network, where the generator angles must be kept in synchrony. In these applications, the dynamical systems are different and the communication channels have restricted topologies, which are subject to transmission delays. E.

Some analysis results for nonidentical nonlinear nodes may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and references therein. In the remarkable paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> the new concept of semi-passivity was introduced to synchronize systems, such concept was later used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to establish conditions for global synchronization of diffusively coupled (non-necessarily identical) nonlinear systems. Recently, in the fundamental paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> it was observed that interconnecting the outputs of passive systems through strongly connected, balanced graphs induces output synchronization. It is also shown that synchronization is preserved in the presence of constant communication delays. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the balanced assumption has been recently relaxed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The passivity property has also been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to analyze synchronization behavior. In the interesting paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, instead of passivity, a relaxed version of incremental output strict passivity-called in the paper co-coercitivity-has been used to prove synchronization to the average of the outputs if the passivity gains dominate the interconnection gains, in a small-gain theorem-like way. The authors also consider in the paper the presence of identical groupings of the systems, called compartments, and, invoking the well-known diagonal dominance condition for large scale systems of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, impose an additional constraint on the passivity gains dominating the algebraic connectivities of the graphs interconnecting the same species. Using the method of controlled Lagrangians, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> presents a controller for the stabilization and synchronization of a network of underactuated mechanical EL-systems, over undelayed connected graphs, whose dynamics evolve on a constant momentum surface.</p><p>The synchronization problem can also be formulated when a desired trajectory is explicitly defined. The first result along those lines for cooperative robot manipulators was reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, where a nonlinear observer-based controller with all-to-all coupling, which achieves position synchronization is proposed. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> considers general EL-systems and present a generalization of the well-known Slotine and Li controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for the case of multiple systems. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The schemes of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, being designed to track a given reference, will obviously drive all positions to zero in the absence of a desired trajectory, i.e., they "synchronize to zero" the systems positions. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> where a similar undesired behavior of a recently proposed adaptive scheme for bilateral teleoperators is reported, and corrected.</p><p>This paper presents a unified scheme that can handle, with a slight modification, both versions of the synchronization problem for fully actuated EL-systems with full state measurement, but unknown parameters. In the absence of a reference signal, the aforementioned synchronization to zero behavior is avoided. The controller generalizes the authors' previous result on adaptive control of bilateral teleoperators <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to the more challenging case of synchronization of nonidentical, nonlinear EL-systems (called agents in the sequel), coupled trough a connected communication channel subject to constant, unknown time delays. The only assumption on the communication graph is that it is connected. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the standard assumption of a balanced graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is conspicuous by its absence. Moreover, in contrast to most existing results, the graph is not required to be strongly connected, but just connected. The qualifier "strong" from the connectivity assumption is removed using the projection matrix of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and the interesting property, reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, that the "reduced Laplacian matrix" is Hurwitz. For the case with delays, to relax the assumption of balanced graph, the idea of adding up weighted Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals is borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>-see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The main contribution is the construction of an adaptive controller that achieves global full-state consensus-that is, (asymptotically) drive to zero the difference between the positions and velocities of all the agents for any initial conditions. In the case of known parameters without communication delays and balanced graph, we can get-via injection of high gains-arbitrarily close to the average consensus, hence extending the fundamental result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to the case of nonidentical EL-systems.</p><p>The main novelty of the present approach, which distinguishes it from existing techniques, is the use of nonlinear couplings among the agents in the proposed control law. Although nonlinear couplings have already been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, they have been restricted to control signals of the form i = j2N ij (x j 0 x i ), where N i is the set of agents transmitting information to the i-th agent, i 2 m , x i 2 n are the control and the state of the i-th agent, respectively, and ij : n ! m are mappings, which are restricted to be first-third quadrant nonlinearities, to preserve the passivity properties required for the stability analysis. In our case, the control takes the form i = j2N ij (x i )(x j 0 x i ), where ij : n ! m2n are suitably defined mappings. In the context of mechanical systems, this is tantamount to the interconnection of systems through nonlinear springs and dashpots whose stiffness and friction coefficients are nonlinear functions of the i-th system state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. EULER-LAGRANGE SYSTEMS</head><p>EL-equations of motion describe the dynamic behavior of a large class of physical systems and are given as (d=dt)(@L=@ _q) 0 (@L=@q) = , where L : n 2 n ! is the Lagrangian function defined as L(q; _q) = (1=2)_q &gt; M(q) _q 0 U (q), with q 2 n the generalized configuration coordinates, M : n ! n2n the generalized mass matrix, U : n ! the potential energy function and 2 n the vector of external forces acting on the system. Throughout the paper, the following standard assumption is made.</p><p>M(q) is symmetric positive definite and bounded and U (q) is bounded from below. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for further details and applications of EL-systems. Although the generalized coordinates may represent physical quantities other than positions, e.g., charges or fluxes in electrical systems, extrapolating from the application to mechanical systems, in the sequel q is referred as the systems position vector and _q its corresponding velocity. It is well-known that EL-systems satisfy the power-balance equation _ H = &gt; _q, where H : n 2 n ! , H(q; _q) = (1=2)_q &gt; M(q) _q + U (q), is the systems total co-energy. Consequently, they define passive operators ! _q. Besides this fundamental property, which has been extensively exploited for passivity-based control design, EL-systems enjoy another key property, first reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> (but implicit in the calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>), that is instrumental for the present developments. Namely, writing the EL-system as M(q) q + C(q; _q) _q + g(q) = , where C(q; _q) _q are the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, C : n 2 n ! n2n , and g(q) := @U=@q are the forces due to the potential field. It can be shown that, if C is defined via the Kristoffel symbols of the first kind, then _ M(q) = C(q; _q) + C &gt; (q; _q). See Lemma 2.8 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for an intrinsic, differential geometric, interpretation of this property.</p><p>It is also well-known that C satisfies 9kc : kC(q; _q)k kcj _qj, where k 1 k is the matrix 2-norm and j 1 j is the Euclidean norm. Moreover, it is known that EL-systems admit a linear parametrization of the form M(q) qr + C(q; _q) _q r + g(q) = 8 8 8(q; _q; _q r; qr)</p><p>, where qr 2 n , 8 8 8 2 n2p is a regressor matrix of known functions and 2 p is a constant vector containing the EL-system parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. NETWORK TOPOLOGY AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>This paper deals with networks of N non-identical EL-systems, denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Mi(qi) qi + Ci(qi; _q i ) _q i + gi(qi) = i (1)</formula><p>where i 2 N := f1; .. .;Ng. [The sub-indices of the various func- tions and agents coordinates usually range in the set N , unless stated otherwise, this clarification is omitted for brevity.]</p><p>Following the synchronization scenario, the EL-systems exchange information over a network described by a directed interconnection graph, where each agent is a node of the graph. The information exchange between the i-th and the j-th agent is subject to a constant, unknown time delay-denoted T i;j 0.</p><p>Throughout the paper, it is assumed that the interconnection graph is simply connected, that is, there exist a node such that all other nodes of the graph are connected to this node via a directed path. Note that the standard assumptions of strongly connected and/or balanced graphs are conspicuous by their absence. See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for some basic preliminaries on graph theory as applied to consensus and synchronization problems. The interconnection graph is modeled using standard tools, such as the Laplacian matrix L 2 N 2N whose elements are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">`ij = N k=1 a ik i = j 0a ij i 6 = j,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with aij = 1 if j 2 Ni, aij = 0 otherwise, with Ni the set of agents transmitting information to the i-th agent. By construction, L1N = 0, where 1 N stands for a column vector of size N filled with ones.</p><p>Moreover, the assumption that the graph is connected ensures that rank(L) = N 0 1, that L has a single zero-eigenvalue and that the rest of the spectrum of L has positive real parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Problem Formulation: Consider a network of N EL-systems of the form (1), which are interconnected through a communication protocol. Find control laws of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 i = j2N F ij (x i ; i )[x j (t0T i;j )0 xi], _ i = Gi(xi) j2N [xj(t 0 Ti;j ) 0 xi],</formula><p>where xi = col(qi; _q i ) and F ij : 2n 2 p ! m22n and G i : 2n ! p22n are suitably defined mappings, which solve the following problems:</p><p>TSP (Tracking Synchronization Problem): Given a desired, bounded, trajectory for all agents x d (t) = col(q &gt; d (t); _q &gt; d (t)) 2 2n , with q d 2 L1, all agents states must track this trajectory, that is, lim t!1 jx i (t)j = 0, where xi := x i 0 x d .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CP (Consensus Problem):</head><p>When there is no reference signal, i.e., q d (t) 0, all agents positions must reach a consensus, that is, lim t!1 q i (t) = q c , for some q c 2 n . Moreover, lim t!1 j _q i (t)j = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MAIN RESULTS</head><p>This section presents the solution to the problems formulated in Section III. To simplify the notation, a generalized position error is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">e i := j2N [q i 0 qj (t 0 T i;j )] + q i ;</formula><p>(3) where = 1 for the TSP and = 0 for the CP. It is also convenient to define the signals</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">i := _ qi + e i :<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where &gt; 0. For the sake of clarity of exposition we consider first the case when the time-delays are zero, i.e., T i;j = 0. The general result is presented in Section IV-B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Case Without Delays</head><p>Proposition 1: Consider a network of N EL-systems of the form (1). Assume that the agents are interconnected through a connected com-munication graph without time-delays. Let the controller be defined by ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) and i = 8 8 8 i (q i ; _q i ; e i ; _ e i ) i 0 D i i <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where 8 8 8 i i := Mi(qi)[ q d 0 _ ei] + Ĉi(qi; _q i )[ _q d 0 ei] + ĝi(qi), D i = diagfd i1 ; . ..;d in g 2 n2n , d ij &gt; 0, together with the estimation law</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">_ i = 00 0 0 i 8 8 8 &gt; i i ;<label>(6)</label></formula><p>with 0 0 0 i 2 p2p , 0 0 0 i = 0 0 0 &gt; i &gt; 0. Setting = 0, 1 the above controller solves the CP and the TSP, respectively.</p><p>Proof: Replacing ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) in (1), using (4), and the fact that 8 8 where e; q 2 N n , and is the standard Kronecker product. Similarly, we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">8 i i = M i (q i )[ q d 0 _ e i ] + C i (q i ; _q i )[ _q d 0 e i ] + g i (q i ), yields the error equation M i (q i )_ i +[C i (q i ; _q i )+D i ] i =</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">2 N n as = _ q + e:<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Using ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">9</ref>) and standard Kronecker product properties, yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">_ q = 0 [(L + I N ) I n ] q + :<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The closed-loop dynamics is then described by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">10</ref>) that are similar to the dynamics of the classical Slotine and Li adaptive controller for robot manipulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. One fundamental difference is that in the latter the dynamics of q is asymptotically stable, while here the matrix 0[(L + I N ) I n ] is Hurwitz when = 1, but it is not Hurwitz if = 0. The analysis of the TSP proceeds then along clas- sical lines, and is given here for the sake of completeness. On the other hand, the CP requires the development of a special machinery pre- sented below.</p><p>Consider first the TSP case and, consequently, set = 1. As indi- cated above, the matrix 0[(L + I N ) I n ] is Hurwitz. This follows from the fact that the matrix 0(L + I N ) is Hurwitz, because L has an isolated eigenvalue at zero and all others have positive real part, and is a positive scalar. Thus, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">10</ref>) is a linear time-invariant (LTI) asymptotically stable system with an input in L2 \L1, hence q; _ q 2 L2 \L1 and q ! 0, see Theorem 4.9.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Now, the regressor matrix 8 8 8 is bounded because q d ; _q d ; q d ; q; _q 2 L 1 . Hence, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, it is concluded that _ 2 L1, which together with 2 L2 \ L1 implies that j j ! 0. Finally, j j, jqj ! 0 and (10) imply that j _ qj ! 0, which establishes the solution of the TSP. 3   2 In the sequel a vector without subindex is used as a generic notation for a vector obtained by piling up N components. 3 Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> a Lyapunov analysis reveals that the trivial equilibrium is globally stable.</p><p>For the CP, set = 0 and remark that in this case q = q. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, define y = (Q I n )q 2 (N01)n , where Q 2 (N01)2N has the following properties: i) QQ &gt; = I N 01 ; ii) Q &gt; Q = I N 0 (1=N)1N1 &gt; N ; iii) Q1 N = 0; iv) (Q In)q = 0 , q = (1N q c ) for some q c 2 n . Using (8), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">9</ref>), the fact that L1 N = 0, the properties of Q and standard Kronecker product algebra, we can write _y = 0[QLQ &gt; In]y + (Q In)</p><p>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> it is shown that for a connected graph the (reduced Laplacian) matrix 0QLQ &gt; is Hurwitz. From which it immediately follows that 0(QLQ &gt; In) is also Hurwitz. Consequently, 7 ! y is an LTI asymptotically stable system with an input in L 2 \L 1 , hence jyj ! 0. From property iv) above, this implies that q ! (1 N q c ) for some (possibly time-varying) qc 2 n . The latter, together with (8)-for = 0-and the fact that L1 N = 0 implies that jej ! 0. Also,</p><p>; e 2 L 1 implies, via (9), that _q 2 L 1 . It is important to note that, in view of the properties of EL-systems, 4 the regressor matrix 8 8 8 is bounded because _q; e 2 L 1 . Consequently, proceeding as done for the TSP, it is concluded that j j ! 0. Finally, j j ! 0, q ! (1N qc) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">10</ref>) clearly imply that j _qj ! 0, completing the proof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Case With Delays</head><p>To facilitate the understanding of the material contained in this subsection it is useful to underscore the main difficulties that arise with delayed communications. The presence of the delays, hampers the use of the compact representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and the use of the stability properties of the reduced Laplacian matrix QLQ &gt; . Several modifications, at the controller and the analysis level, are needed to overcome this problem.</p><p>First, to prove boundedness of _q, besides the local damping coming from the term 0D</p><p>, a new term 0_ e, that injects additional damping from the neighboring agents, is needed. Without the latter term, the overall system can be decomposed as a cascade of two subsystems, one with states ( ;</p><p>) and the other one with states q. Based on this cascade decomposition, a simplified analysis can be carried out. The addition of the term 0_ e introduces a feedback interconnection that destroys the cascaded structure, requiring a full-fledged Lyapunov analysis. Second, the proof that j _qj ! 0 in the undelayed case exploits the structure of the LTI system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, however in the presence of delays this is not possible. Instead, it is feasible to analyze the corresponding delay-differential equation invoking an argument based on the final value theorem, which is applicable only to systems with, at most, one isolated root at the origin. Since L In has N roots at the origin, it is necessary to rewrite these equations grouping the elements of each generalized coordinate in N -dimensional vectors and writing n delay-differential equations for them. In this way, the Kronecker product is avoided and each of the n characteristic quasi-polynomials has an isolated root at zero. Before presenting the new controller and the main result, the equations will be rewritten as explained above. That is, consider the i-th generalized coordinate qi = col(qi1;qi2; ... ; qin) 2 n , with i 2 N , and define q k = col(q 1k ; q 2k ; .. .;q N k ) 2 N , with  </p><p>To get a suitable delay-differential representation for the qk dy- namics, define m := N i=1 cardNi and k := Ti;j , where 4 The dependence of 8 8 8 with respect to q is due to M, g and C, the first two mappings are bounded by assumption and the latter is bounded by _ q.  where the matrix A 0 := diagf`i i g 2 N2N and the matrices A j 2</p><p>N2N have all elements equal to zero, except one off-diagonal element equal to one of the a ij , placed (in an obvious way) such that the system Laplacian satisfies L = A00 m j=1 Aj , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Replacing ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">12</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">yields _ qk = 0(A0 + IN )q k + m j=1 Aj qk (t 0 j) + k<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Using the fact that L has a single zero-eigenvalue and that the rest of the spectrum has positive real parts, it can been shown that if = 1, (14) is asymptotically stable, i.e., all roots of the characteristic function are in the open left-hand complex plane, while, there is an isolated root at the origin when = 0. Noting that the dynamics of and are unaffected by the delays, it is clear that the solution of the TSP follows verbatim from Proposition 1. The presence of the root at the origin, unfortunately, renders the CP far more complicated-essentially because the properties that can be proven for are not sufficient to conclude the analysis using the controller of the undelayed case.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>An adaptive controller that achieves consensus (or trajectory tracking) for nonidentical EL-systems with unknown parameters coupled through a communication network with unknown transmission delays has been proposed. In spite of the fact that the agents have different dynamics is possible achieve consensus because, through the action of the controller, all agents share the same equilibrium point. Interestingly, the result is established assuming only that the graph is connected. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, there is need for the ubiquitous-and highly restrictive-balanced assumption.</p><p>The inclusion of adaptation comes at a price. Indeed, although all trajectories are shown to converge to the identity set, i.e., qi ! qj, with j _q i j ! 0, the motion inside this set is not guaranteed to be bounded, nor even converging to a constant. This stems from the fact that we cannot prove boundedness of the coordinate 1 &gt; N q k , because i cannot be shown to be integrable-except in the known parameter case or assuming persistency of excitation, when j ij ! 0 exponentially fast. In the latter case, we can prove that the set fx i 2 2n jq i = q c ; _ q i = 0g is globally attractive. Moreover, it can be shown that q k c = (</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">&gt; = &gt; 1N)[q k (0) + 1 0 k ()d].</formula><p>This expression reveals that if the graph is balanced, e.g., = 1 N , and k converges arbitrarily fast-which is achieved increasing D i -then</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">q k c = (1=N) N i=1 q k i (0) + 1 k</formula><p>, where 1 k 2 can be made arbitrarily small. Thus (approximately) solving the average consensus problem for EL-systems under the same assumptions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>As explained in Section IV-A the closed-loop dynamics without delays ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">10</ref>) is similar to the dynamics of the Slotine and Li controller for robot manipulators, with the fundamental difference that the dynamics of q is not asymptotically stable. Recently, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> an attempt has been made to extend the Slotine and Li controller to the case of networks of EL-systems. To put in perspective the present contribution, recall the closed-loop dynamics obtained in those papers, namely Mi _ si + Cisi + D1si 0 j2N D2(sj 0 si) = 0 with s i := _ qi +q i the signal used in the classical Slotine and Li controller and D1; D2 2 n2n are some suitable gain matrices. A standard analysis with the function s &gt; Ms gives conditions on D1; D2 such that s 2 L 2 and, consequently, that q ! 0. This controller solves the TSP but, in the absence of a reference position, drives all positions to zero. The authors' current research proceeds along the following avenues.</p><p>• What is the convergence point of the positions, without adaptation, but in the face of communication delays? • Studying the case of time varying communication delays is also of interest. The results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for teleoperators lead us to believe that this is a feasible problem. • In the spirit of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, it would be desirable to implement an observer-based controller that does not require the measurement of velocities. Given the recent results of globally convergent speed observers for mechanical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, this problem seems solvable. • Extension of the results to the case of underactuated system is clearly a practical, though extremely challenging, problem. It may be argued that fully actuated systems are full-state linearizable, and the basic results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> would be applicable. However, this kind of controllers suffer from serious robustness problems-even in their adaptive versions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. • In the paper it has been assumed that all agents share a common coordinate frame, which may be unrealistic in some applications. If this is not the case we have to deal with systems living on nonlinear manifolds as done, for instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further Results on Global Asymptotic Regulation Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With iISS Inverse Dynamics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION AND DISCUSSION</head><p>During the past few years, a new concept, that of integral input-tostate stable (iISS), has received a lot of attention in the field of nonlinear control. It was discovered that the iISS property is strictly weaker than the input-to-state stable(ISS), so that the set of iISS systems is much larger and could include more general nonlinearities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Currently, this very useful property of iISS is widely applied in the feedback design and analysis of control system. For example, the stability of cascade interconnection of iISS time-varying systems is investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It is demonstrated that a smooth Lyapunov function of cascade systems can be constructed explicitly under some trade-off conditions. More fruitful results can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, supposing the dynamic uncertainty subject to the iISS property, presents a unifying framework for global output feedback regulation control from ISS to iISS. By introducing an inputdriven filter, with the help of the Nussbaum-type gain technique and observer backstepping with adaptive tuning function design, the global regulation problem is successfully solved for a broad class of nonlinear systems with iISS inverse dynamics. The framework established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> extends many known classes of output feedback form systems. However, the emphasis therein lies in the nonlinear nature of the system class. The system uncertainties in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> are generated only by the inverse system state and system output, without any other unmeasured state information. Global stabilization for a class of nonlinear systems whose disturbances depend on all the unmeasured states, is achieved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> by output feedback, but the sign of control coefficients is assumed to be known. Here, we intend to develop further the recent results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and our efforts are made to extend the set of systems with the complete unmeasured state components. Specifically, we consider a class of nonlinear systems described by _ = q(; y) _ x i = x i+1 + d i (t)x i + i ( ; y); i = 1; 1 1 1 ; n 0 1; _ x n = gu + d n (t)x n + n ( ; y) y = x 1</p><p>(1) with state ( ; x) 2 R r 2 R n , control input u 2 R, and output y = x1 observable, while d i (t)(i = 1; 1 1 1 ; n) is time-varying function and the sign of nonzero high-frequency gain g is unknown. The uncertain functions q(1) and i(1)(i = 1; 1 1 1 ; n) are supposed to be locally Lipschitz. The state (x 2 ; 1 1 1 ; x n ) and the state of the -sub- system, which is referred to as the inverse system, are not assumed to be measurable.</p><p>As a result of the unavailable terms d i (t)x i (i = 1; 1 1 1 ; n), the studied system (1) is a perturbed version of its counterpart in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The purpose of this note is to design a dynamic output feedback control law for the more general class of nonlinear uncertain system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, which drives the state to the origin while keeping all other closed-loop signals bounded. It will be shown that by designing a full-order observer based on a time-varying Riccati differential equation, this problem is well addressed. The work has three aspects. First, a linear state transformation is introduced, through which the original system is turned into a new nonlinear system convenient for feedback design. Then the observer is designed for the transformed system. Finally, a constructive design procedure is presented using the integrator backstepping technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
