<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper investigates exponential synchronization of coupled networks with hybrid coupling, which is composed of constant coupling and discrete-delay coupling. There is only one transmittal delay in the delayed coupling. The fact is that in the signal transmission process, the time delay affects only the variable that is being transmitted from one system to another, then it makes sense to assume that there is only one single delay contributing to the dynamics. Some sufficient conditions for synchronization are derived based on Lyapunov functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI). In particular, the coupling matrix may be asymmetric or nondiagonal. Moreover, the transmittal delay can be different from the one in the isolated system. A distinctive feature of this work is that the synchronized state will vary in comparison with the conventional synchronized solution. Especially, the degree of the nodes and the inner delayed coupling matrix heavily influence the synchronized state. Finally, a chaotic neural network is used as the node in two regular networks to show the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>connection delays to be taken into account, since they naturally arise as a consequence of finite information transmission and processing speeds among the units. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of time delay in synchronization of coupled systems. Usually, time delay involves two parts. One is the delay inside the systems, referred as internal delay. The other is caused by the exchange of information between systems, called coupling delay. Despite the very large literature to be found on synchronization of coupled systems with delayed coupling both numerically and theoretically, the great majority of researchers have been focused on synchronization of systems with a coupling term described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. There are few to consider the case in which the coupling term is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Even less previous work concerns synchronization in array of coupled systems with the aforementioned coupling as we address in this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>In general, in the signal transmission process, the time delay affects only the variable that is being transmitted from one system to another, then it makes sense to assume that there is only one single delay contributing to the dynamics, while, in the case of , it requires that each system has a feedback term with the same delay as the transmittal delay. On the one hand, the requirement is unreasonable. Usually, for an isolated system, the ability to acquire its own information is powerful, especially for the agents in cooperative control. Therefore, it can be assumed that no delay exists in self-feedback. Even if there is a delayed feedback term, the delay should be independent of the transmittal delay, but not the same. On the other hand, in practice, each system needs a memory function to realize this delayed feedback. If each system does not have such a memory, the coupling is inevitably recognized as <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Our main contribution in this paper is to pose and address synchronization of coupled systems with the delayed coupling term as in a general model. It is shown that under this coupling scheme, a wide range of new collective behavior which the individual system is incapable of producing in isolation, are observed by varying the weights of the configuration matrix, inner coupling matrix, and the coupling delays. It has important applications for neural networks since synaptic coupling strengths can change through learning. These interesting phenomena provide additional motivation for investigating the role of delays in complex systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In our paper, the proposed general model includes delayed Hopfield neural networks, delayed cellular neural networks, Ikeda oscillator, and some famous chaotic systems, such as Lorenz system, RÃ¶ssler system, Chua's system, etc, while results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> cannot be applied in delayed neural networks. Several criteria are given to guarantee synchronization among these coupled general systems. It should be noticed that the internal delay in our paper is independent of the coupling delay. Furthermore, the configuration matrix can be asymmetric. This corresponds to the direct network, which is more realistic. We provide a theoretical framework for synchronization of coupled systems with one delay coupling. Furthermore, some new interesting behaviors are reported. Last but not least, two regular networks are constructed to verify the theoretical results.</p><p>An increased interest has been devoted to study synchronization of coupled systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In most of these results, the effect of time delays that includes internal delays and coupling delays has not been considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Only recently, synchronization of coupled systems with time delays has been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, synchronization of coupled delayed neural networks with linear constant coupling was investigated. The inner coupling matrices were required to be diagonal. Synchronization of coupled system with a delayed coupling term as has also been approached <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, some delay-dependent conditions for local synchronization of coupled systems without internal delays were obtained in terms of LMI. However, the configuration matrices were symmetric and the LMIs contained time-varying terms and could not be solved directly. Later, some researchers focused on synchronization using coupling term that consisted of linear combinations of both constant coupling and the above delayed coupling. Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> discussed global synchronization of coupled delayed neural networks with this hybrid coupling scheme, and these results have also been extended for systems with nonlinear delayed coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, stochastic coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and synchronization for discrete-time networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, robust synchronization with parameter uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, etc.</p><p>On the other hand, synchronization for networks with the coupling term as has been considered in a few papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Among them, Moreau <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> addressed the consensus problem for networks of agents with this coupling scheme. Synchronization of coupled chaotic maps in discrete time was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, in which the effect of time delays on synchronization was reported. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, synchronization of three coupled Ikeda systems with the above coupling was discussed. Furthermore, bifurcational relations among coupling delay and coupling strength for different values of the internal delays were obtained. Considering synchronization in arrays of coupled systems with delayed coupling, Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> investigated its local and global synchronization, in which the isolated system was without internal delays and the inner coupling was diagonal. Nijmeijer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> analyzed synchronization problem for coupled systems without internal delays, and similar results can also be found with one single distributed delayed coupling for systems without internal delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>In fact, delayed systems can exhibit complex dynamical behavior, especially for delayed neural networks such as stability, bifurcation, periodic attractors, and even chaotic attractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Many applications of delayed neural networks have been found in various fields, including patter recognition, signal and image processing, and associative memories. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, we investigated synchronization of coupled neural networks with one single delayed coupling. It should be noticed that the configuration matrix was symmetric, and the internal delay was the same with the coupling delay.</p><p>Motivated by the above discussions, a new general hybrid coupled network with delayed coupling is proposed, which is an extension of our former work <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, and its global exponential synchronization is then further discussed. The obtained results can be applied to systems both with or without delays, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, only systems without internal delay can be treated and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, only neural networks can be applied. Moreover, by extending the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> in which the distance between different nodes via the structural matrix is introduced, some sufficient conditions for global exponential synchronization are obtained. The approach is different from the ones in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Our goal is to build a basic theoretical framework for synchronization of general coupled systems with this delayed coupling scheme. The relaxed conditions on the configuration matrix and inner coupling matrix make the results more general. Furthermore, the internal delay and the transmittal delay do not need to be the same. They are independent from each other. With this delayed coupling, the synchronized state will change, which is different from those of a single node. Especially, the degree of the nodes and the delayed coupling matrix heavily influence the synchronized state. Three examples are given to illustrate our theoretical results.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, problem formulations are presented for exponential synchronization of hybrid coupled networks with delayed coupling; some lemmas and notations that will be used throughout this paper are also given. In Section III, two theorems are obtained for exponential synchronization based on Lyapunov functional and LMI. In Section IV, three typical examples are simulated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria. The conclusions are drawn in Section V.</p></div>

In this case, the dynamics of the array reduces to those of a single node. However, in our paper, due to the single delay in the coupling, the nodes cannot be decoupled. That is, the dynamics of the array cannot reduce to those of a single node as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, but a modified one based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. This coupling leads to the emergence of a wide range of new collective behavior.

MAIN RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we will present some novel criteria in terms of LMIs by using Lyapunov functional method and some Kronecker product techniques.</p><p>Before stating the main results, some notations are given.

It is the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Many chaotic systems, including Lorenz system, RÃ¶ssler system, and Chua's circuit, etc., are of this form.</p><p>Corollary 3: Under Assumption 1, system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> with is globally exponentially synchronized if there exist positive-definite matrices , , such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where . Remark 2: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, the authors investigated synchronization of coupled system with a coupling delay. The individual systems are without time delays, which is a special case of our model. Corollary 3 can be applied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Moreover, The inner delayed coupling matrix is the identity matrix in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Therefore, the effects of on the synchronized state are neglected. In this paper, can be any matrix with appropriate dimension. The effects of on the synchronized state are reported in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.

It can be any proper matrix but with the same diagonal element. Moreover, the inner coupling matrix can be nondiagonal, while most of the previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> on network synchronization required must be symmetric or the inner coupling matrix must be diagonal. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the authors removed these restrictive conditions on the coupling matrix. However, the internal delay in the individual system to be the same with the transmittal delay. In this paper, these two delays can take different values.</p><p>Remark 4: For the isolated system, some researchers focus on a general system without internal delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Therefore, synchronization criteria cannot be used in the coupled delayed system such as delayed neural networks; while others are interested in the delayed neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. However, some famous chaotic systems, such as Lorenz system, RÃ¶ssler system, Chua's system, etc., are not included. In this paper, we propose a generally linearly hybrid coupled networks. The criteria can be applied in chaotic systems with or without delay. Moreover, the transmittal delay is different from the internal delay, which is more realistic. Although we study the synchronization problem with two constant delays, the method can also be applied in the time-varying cases. Furthermore, some delay-independent conditions are given in Theorems 1 and 2. For delay-dependent criteria, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> for Theorem 1, and (42) for Theorem 2.</p><p>Remark 5: In the past, a number of researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> have worked on problems that are different forms of synchronization of coupled systems with differences regarding the types of node and coupling schemes. They provide many methods to investigate synchronization, but are seldom to consider one single delay coupling in an array of coupled systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Although some work <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> has been done on synchronization of coupled chaotic maps and consensus problem, few of them focus on the issue we address in this paper. Here, we propose a general hybrid coupled delayed networks with delayed coupling and give some criteria for synchronization of general systems. Furthermore, a wide range of different behaviors are observed in this coupling scheme. These interesting phenomena provide the motivation for studying the role of delays in complex networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS</head><p>In this section, we give several simulations to verify theoretical results. We show how to use these criteria to judge whether a coupled system with one coupling delay can be synchronized and how the degree of the node and the delayed coupling matrix influence the synchronization. Fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used to solve the equations with time step 0.01 s.</p><p>A delayed neural network is chosen as the node to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results. Theorems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> cannot be applied in those cases.</p><p>Example 1-Synchronized State: Consider a 2-D delayed neural network <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> (29) where , , and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows system (29) has a chaotic attractor. Based on (8), the synchronized state equation is described as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> We choose the transmittal delay as . Let be Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>show the synchronized trajectories of system ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) with different and . The coupling matrix denotes that the network nodes are coupled through their corresponding variables. If there is an edge from node to node , then the two variables of node are fully connected to those of node , but the first variable of node only has an effect on the first variable of node . The second is the same. This is common in chaos synchronization. Furthermore, considering the effect of the scalar term or on the synchronized state, matrices and are constructed. That is, they are coupled only through or . In this case, synchronization can also be reached. One possible application is in secure communication concerning chaotic masking. In the bidirectional coupled chaotic systems, one variable of chaotic systems can be added into the plaintext message for masking the signal, and the other variables are used to couple with another system. If synchronization is achieved, the plaintext message can be recovered. More details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>One can see that with different and , the synchronized states in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>are totally different from those of a single node as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. With a given , the shape of synchronized trajectory varies as increases. Also, when , different synchronized trajectories are reported in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. A range of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. When D = D , the synchronized trajectories of system <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> with different a.</p><p>new behaviors have been reported in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. It is shown that both the degree of the node and inner delayed coupling matrix heavily influence the synchronized state. Moreover, the transmittal delay also has an effect on the synchronized state. In a real network, the transmittal delay is hard to control, as it is induced by transmission. For neural networks, the value of can change through learning. Therefore, more attention is paid to the parameter and coupling matrix . The synchronized states of other famous chaotic systems like Lorenz, RÃ¶ssler system, Chua's circuit, and cellular neural network have been reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. It is shown that the dynamics of the synchronized trajectories are complex. In our experiment, we find that the two variables of the synchronized state seem to be periodic in some cases, and both of them sometimes increase as time goes on. Furthermore, in another cases, one of them acts periodically, and the other increases. We conjecture that the variables of synchronized state may tend to infinity, although synchronization still can be achieved. This needs rigorous theoretical analysis for it to be supported. It is difficult to say how and affect the synchronized state. It remains a difficult problem and needs further investigation.</p><p>Example 2-Application to a Regular Network: Consider a regular nearest neighbor network with ten nodes, then the configuration matrix is Then, . Let</p><p>. The dynamics of each node is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. It is easy to verify .

Based on Theorem 2, by referring to the Matlab LMI Toolbox, one can get the feasible solution with . ("tmin" is the index to show whether LMI is feasible. If it is negative, LMI has a feasible solution.) The array of systems (29) can achieve synchronization. The total error of (31) is defined by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(a) depicts total synchronous error.</p><p>Example 3-Application to an Asymmetric Network: In this example, we show that the obtained results can be applied in the case that the coupling matrices are asymmetric, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, only the symmetric configuration matrix can be treated.   Consider a network with four nodes where the configuration matrix is the following asymmetric matrix:</p></div>

The total synchronous error is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>A linear hybrid coupled general model with delayed coupling is proposed, and its global synchronization is investigated. Our analysis relies on Lyapunov functional theory and LMI. Two main theorems are obtained to guarantee global exponential synchronization of the coupled systems. The inner coupling matrix does not need to be diagonal and the configuration matrix can be asymmetric. The less restrictive conditions make the model more general. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by numerical illustrations.</p><p>It should be especially pointed out that in this paper, the dynamics of the synchronized state does not reduce to those of a single node. This proposed coupling leads to the emergence of a wide range of new collective behavior which the individual units are incapable of producing in isolation. From simulations, we can see that the synchronized state depends heavily on the degree of the node and the inner delayed coupling matrix. Different inner delayed coupling matrices and parameters are chosen, and we can obtain different synchronized states. There is abundant dynamics in the synchronized state which deserves to be investigated further, such as the effect of the parameter on the synchronized state. The effect of the coupling matrix and the transmittal delay should also be considered. The criteria provide some new insights for the underlying mechanics of network synchronization. Possible application for these criteria in the real-word neural networks, engineering networks, and biological systems will be explored.</p></div>
