<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The emerging wireless energy transfer technology enables charging sensor batteries in a wireless sensor network (WSN) and maintaining perpetual operation of the network. Recent breakthrough in this area has opened up a new dimension to the design of sensor network protocols.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK</head><p>Currently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are mainly powered by batteries. Due to the limited energy storage capacity of a battery, WSNs usually can remain operational only for a limited amount of time. However, in many applications such as earthquake and glacial movement monitoring, due to the harshness of the environment, a long period of unattended operability is required. There has been a flourish of research efforts on prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. Despite these intensive efforts, network lifetime remains to be a performance bottleneck of WSNs and one of the key factors that hinder their large scale deployment. Moreover, the limited battery energy sources often can support only low data rates in the network, which may not meet the requirements of various applications.</p><p>Energy harvesting from natural sources, such as solar, wind, thermal and vibration, has been shown to be effective in improving network performance and prolonging network lifetime. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Kansal, et al. considered power management while maintaining energy-neutral operation to maximize the system performance in environmental energy harvesting sensor networks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Vigorito, et al. designed an adaptive duty-cycling mechanism that allows sensor nodes to maintain energy neutral operation by adapting to changing environmental conditions. However, the success of extracting energy from the environment remains limited in practice. This is because that the proper operations of any energy-harvesting technique highly depend on the environment.</p><p>Besides the works on performance improvement in energy harvesting sensor networks, how to gather sensed data from sensors has also attracted much attentions in wireless networking community. For example, Fan, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Liu, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposed solutions for fair and high throughput data extraction in the presence of renewable energy sources, which aim to compute the lexicographically maximum data collection rate for each node. These schemes belong to relay-routing based static data gathering, and may lead to non-uniform energy consumption among all the sensors and heavy congestion and packet loss at the sensors close to the static sink.</p><p>To overcome the above problems, mobile data gathering has been considered recently, see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>[6] <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In such a scheme, one or more mobile collectors are employed to collect data from sensors. Since the routing task has been partially or fully taken over by the mobile collector, this approach can effectively eliminate the non-uniformity of energy consumption among sensor nodes and reduce the heavy traffic load of sensor nodes closer to the data sink.</p><p>In the meanwhile, recent breakthrough in the area of wireless energy transfer technology developed by Kurs, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> has opened up a new dimension to prolonging sensor network lifetime. It was showed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that by exploiting a novel technique called coupled magmatic resonance, wireless power transfer from one energy storage source to another energy receiving device is both feasible and practical. The implementation consists of two self-resonant coils. One coil (the source coil) is coupled inductively to an oscillating circuit; the other (the receiving coil) is coupled inductively to a resistive load. Shi, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> considered the scenario of a mobile charging vehicle periodically traveling inside a sensor network and recharging each sensor node's battery wirelessly. Clearly, wireless energy transfer will have a profound impact on the design of WSNs, which is attributed to its following advantages: (1) it enables transferring clean electric energy that is efficiently generated elsewhere to sensors periodically over relatively long distance (more than 2 meters) without subject to the constraint of weather or season as solar harvesting does; (2) it does not require the connection or the contact between the energy charger and receiving devices; (3) it does not affect the normal operations of sensors such as sensing, delivering and receiving.</p><p>Inspired by the new breakthrough energy transfer technology and motivated by the superiority of mobile data gathering, Zhao, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed a joint design of energy replenishment and data gathering (J-MERDG) by exploiting mobility and established a flow-level network utility maximization model to characterize the data gathering performance. Jiang, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> addressed the problem of scheduling sensor nodes for efficient data collection in a wireless rechargeable sensor network, which consists of a collection of static rechargeable tags and a mobile reader deterministically recharging the tags. Although the aforementioned schemes can effectively collect data and save energy by utilizing mobile collectors, they only took into account of energy consumption in data transmission but not in data receiving and sensing, and regarded the recharging rate as a constant instead of time-varying. In reality, the time varying profile of recharging rates poses challenges in the computation of optimal data rates.</p><p>Based on above observations, in this paper, we present a comprehensive scheme of joint wireless energy replenishment and mobile data gathering (WerMDG), which takes into consideration of all types of sensor energy consumption, time-varying nature of recharging and the charging time. The proposed scheme has the following advantages. First, since the mobile collector directly provides the electric energy to sensors by using the wireless energy transfer technology, energy delivering will no longer suffer from environmental variations such as weather or season. Second, as long as the mobile collector keeps the proper distance to sensors, the steady and high recharging rate can be achieved to ensure the high-rate data service. Third, the mobility of the mobile collector can alleviate the routing burden of sensors so that energy can be saved to further prolong network lifetime.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to provide a distributed and adaptive solution that jointly selects the sensors to be charged, finds the optimal data generating and uploading rates and the optimal scheduling and routing paths for each node, and determines the optimal sojourn time for the mobile collector at each anchor point, such that the overall network utility can be maximized. To that end, we first formulate the WerMDG problem as an optimization problem. Then we convert the original non-convex WerMDG problem into a convex one by employing some auxiliary variables, and separate the convex optimization problem into two levels of optimization by taking a hierarchical decomposition approach.</p><p>The main contributions of the paper can be summarized below. First, we consider comprehensive sources of energy consumption including transmission, reception and sensing, and the time-varying nature of energy recharging, to better characterize real networks. Second, we propose a WerMDG optimization framework under the constraints of flow conversation, energy balance, link and battery capacity, and the bounded sojourn time. Third, we develop a proximal approximation based crosslayer algorithm to obtain the system-wide optimum by adjusting data rates, link scheduling and flow routing for each sensor, and allocating sojourn time for the mobile collector in a distributed manner. Finally, we validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by extensive numerical results and evaluate the impact of utility weight on network performance. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the network model and anchor point selection. Section III outlines the proposed WerMDG framework. Section IV presents the distributed WerMDG algorithm, and Section V provides numerical results. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Network Model</head><p>We consider a rechargeable sensor network consisting of stationary energy rechargeable sensors and a data sink. In the sensing field, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we deploy a multi-functional mobile collector, called SenCar, which could be a mobile robot or vehicle equipped with a powerful transceiver to gather data. Moreover, the SenCar is also equipped with a resonant coil as the transmitter of energy to recharge sensors as well as a high capacity rechargeable battery to store sufficient energy. The SenCar periodically visits some pre-defined positions called anchor points in the field and stays at each anchor point for a period of sojourn time to collect data from nearby sensors via multi-hop transmissions, and meanwhile recharges the visited sensors wirelessly via non-radiative energy transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Let B i denote the battery capacity of sensor node i and N be the set of all sensor nodes in the network. All sensors in the coverage area of anchor point a form a neighbor set of the anchor point, denoted by N a . The SenCar starts from the static data sink and roams over the entire sensing field in a predetermined sequence of anchor points, at a certain traveling speed V s (in m/s). The SenCar gathers data directly from sensors by visiting the anchor points in a periodic data gathering tour. When the SenCar moves to an anchor point a, it will stay at the anchor point for a period of sojourn time τ a to gather the data uploaded by nearby sensors in N a . After τ a time, the SenCar leaves anchor point a and travels to the next anchor point. In data gathering, we consider a simple interference model in this paper, the node-exclusive interference model, in which any two links are not allowed to share a common node to transmit at the same time. Otherwise, a collision occurs and the transmission is discarded.</p><p>To recharge the battery at each sensor, we assume that the anchor points are close to the locations of sensors, such that the SenCar can charge the sensors nearby wirelessly with high efficiency. Let ρ a i (t) denote the instantaneous energy replenishment rate of node i at anchor point a in time t, which is a twice-differentiable, decreasing and strictly convex function with respect to time t, and π a i represent the average replenishment energy for sensor i during a period of sojourn time τ a , and is defined as π a i = τ a 0 ρ a i (t)dt. Clearly, function π a i is also convex with respect to τ a due to the convexity of ρ a i (t). It is worth pointing out that in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we take into consideration of the recharging time for a sensor battery; on the other hand, we assume that the SenCar spends short time to recharge its own battery at the data sink and compute the sequence of anchor points to visit in its next trip.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Anchor Point Selection</head><p>Choosing anchor points is a crucial step of the data gathering process since it determines the efficiency of energy transferring and the latency of data gathering. After the SenCar completes data gathering for the sensors in its neighbor set N a at anchor point a, each sensor i in N a will report its current battery status or remaining battery energy b i to the SenCar and then the SenCar will utilize this information to determine the sequence to visit anchor points at the beginning of the next tour. In wireless rechargeable sensor networks, as each sensor has different energy status at different time, it is desirable that as many as possible sensors with low energy get recharged promptly to ensure the perpetual operation of sensors. Accordingly, the sensors located near the selected anchor points should be those with the most urgent needs of energy supplement. Thus, the locations near the sensors with lower energy are chosen as anchor points at high priority so that the nearby sensors can get timely recharged.</p><p>In the meanwhile, to better enjoy the benefit of the energy supply provided by the SenCar, more anchor points should be selected. However, this would prolong the traveling tour length and increase the data gathering latency. Thus, it is an inherent tradeoff between the number of sensors to be recharged in a tour and the data gathering latency. Based on these observations, when determining the sequence of anchor points to visit, we jointly consider the remaining energy levels of sensors and the traveling tour length of the SenCar as follows. First, the SenCar receives the current battery energy status {b i } of all the sensors when it moves over the anchor points for data gathering during a tour. Second, the SenCar sorts the sensors in an increasing order according to their battery energy {b i }, and records the sorted sensor list by S , where S (i) denotes the i-th element in list S . Finally, the SenCar searches for the maximum number of anchor points for the next tour in the sorted sensor list such that the tour length is no more than a threshold L tsp , i.e., finds a target sensor S (n) such that by visiting the sensors with an index no more than n, i.e., S (1), S (2), ..., S (n), the tour length of the SenCar is no more than a bound L tsp .</p><p>To find target sensor S (n), the algorithm first searches the middle element of S , denoted by S (m), and then inspects the shortest traveling tour among the locations of sensors S (1), S (2), ..., S (m). Note that in order to facilitate the computing of the tour length of the SenCar, the locations of sensors are regarded as the candidate anchor points. The Here, we use the TSP genetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to find the shortest traveling tour of the SenCar. If the traveling tour length equals the bound L tsp , then the target sensor is found; otherwise, the upper half or the lower half of the list is chosen to further search for the target sensor based on whether the tour length of the SenCar is more than or less than the bound L tsp . In the worst case, the time complexity of the selection algorithm is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O(|N | 2 log |N |).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this section, we formulate the WerMDG problem into a utility maximization problem under the constraints of flow conservation, energy balance and link capacity.</p><p>We model the sensor network with the SenCar located at anchor point a as a directed graph G a = (V a , E a ). V a = N ∪ {s a } consists of all sensor nodes and the SenCar at the anchor point, denoted by s a . E a = {(i, j)|i, j ∈ V a } represents the set of directed links among the sensors and the SenCar. A directed link (i, j) ∈ E a exists if d ij ≤ R tx , where d ij denotes the distance between node i and node j, and R tx stands for the transmission range of sensor nodes. f a ij represents the flow rate over link (i, j) at anchor point a. Sensor i ∈ N generates data for the SenCar at a data rate of r a i when the SenCar moves to anchor point a. For each sensor node i ∈ N, we assume that it consumes different energy in different working stage. To elaborate, μ tx ij denotes the energy consumption of sensor i delivering a packet over link (i, j), μ rx i represents the energy consumption for receiving a packet at node i, and μ gn i denotes the energy consumption for generating a packet in the sensing environment at node i. These notations and their corresponding definitions are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p><p>In our model, in order to characterize the effect of the data from a sensor on the overall data gathering performance, we assume that each sensor i attains a utility function U i (•), which is twice-differentiable, increasing and strictly concave with respect to the total amount of data gathered from sensor i in a data gathering tour (i.e., a∈A r a i τ a ). Our objective is to maximize the network utility under the constraints of flow conversation, energy balance and link capacity while maintaining the perpetual operation of the network. With the given sequence to visit anchor points, we can formulate the joint wireless energy replenishment and mobile data gathering (WerMDG) problem in rechargeable sensor networks into the following optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">OPT-1: max r, f , τ i U i ( a∈A r a i τ a )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r a i + X j:(j,i)∈E a f a ji = X j:(i,j)∈E a f a ij , ∀i ∈ N , ∀a ∈ A (2) τ a 0 @ X j:(i,j)∈E a f a ij μ tx ij + X j:(j,i)∈E a f a ji μ rx i + r a i μ gn i 1 A ≤ Z τ a 0 ρ a i (t)dt -ζi, ∀i ∈ N , ∀a ∈ A (3) 0 ≤ f a ij ≤ C a ij , ∀(i, j) ∈ E a , ∀a ∈ A (4) Z τ a 0 ρ a i (t)dt ≤ Bi, ∀i ∈ N , ∀a ∈ A (5) X a∈A τ a ≤ T (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where r = {r a i |i ∈ N, a ∈ A}, f = {f a ij |(i, j) ∈ E a , a ∈ A}, τ = {τ a |a ∈ A} and ζ i is an arbitrarily small positive constant, which represents the minimum remaining energy of sensor i to avoid being drained. Flow conversation constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> states that the aggregated outgoing link flow rates at each sensor equal the incoming link flow rates plus its local data rate. Energy balance constraint (3) enforces that the average energy consumption for transmission, reception and sensing should be slightly less than the average charged energy income during a period of sojourn time τ a . Link capacity constraint (4) specifies that the flow rate allocated on link (i, j) should be within the capacity of that link. Battery capacity constraint (5) captures the fact that the recharging energy for battery cell cannot exceed its capacity. Sojourn time constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> shows that the total data gathering latency is bounded by T .</p><p>The objective of optimization problem (OPT-1) is to find the optimal data rate for each sensor and the proper flow rate for each link, and determine the optimal routing of the data from sensors to the SenCar and the optimal sojourn time of the SenCar for gathering data, when the SenCar moves over different anchor points such that the network utility can be maximized. In general, problem (OPT-1) is non-convex since the objective function U i (•) is not strictly concave with respect to r a i and τ a due to the coupling between the optimization variables r a i and τ a and the linearity of a∈A r a i τ a , even though it is strictly concave with respect to the total data amount a∈A r a i τ a from sensor i.</p><p>To break down the couplings and make problem (OPT-1) solvable, we need to introduce auxiliary variables x a ij , y i and φ a i and convert problem (OPT-1) into an equivalent convex problem. Let x a ij = f a ij τ a , y i φ a i = r a i τ a , φ a i ≥ 0, and a φ a i = 1, where x a ij denotes the flow amount over link (i, j) destined to the SenCar at anchor point a during τ a , y i represents the total amount of data generated by sensor i in a data gathering tour, and φ a i is a data split variable, such that φ a i ≥ 0, and a φ a i = 1, which determines the portion of the data uploaded by sensor i to the SenCar at anchor point a over the total amount of data generated by sensor i in a data gathering tour.</p><p>By multiplying the flow conservation and link capacity constraints by τ a and using these auxiliary variables, we can reformulate optimization problem (OPT-1) into a convex optimization problem (OPT-2) with respect to x, y, τ and φ as follows.</p><p>OPT-2: max</p><p>x, y, τ, φ i∈N</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">U i (y i )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">yiφ a i + X j:(j,i)∈E a x a ji = X j:(i,j)∈E a x a ij , ∀i ∈ N , ∀a ∈ A (8) X j:(i,j)∈E a x a ij μ tx ij + X j:(j,i)∈E a x a ji μ rx i + yiφ a i μ gn i ≤ Z τ a 0 ρ a i (t)dt -ζi, ∀i ∈ N , ∀a ∈ A (9) 0 ≤ x a ij ≤ C a ij τ a , ∀(i, j) ∈ E a , ∀a ∈ A (10) Z τ a 0 ρ a i (t)dt ≤ Bi, ∀i ∈ N , ∀a ∈ A (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where x = x a ij |(i, j) ∈ E a , a ∈ A , y = {y i |i ∈ N }, φ = {φ a i |i ∈ N , a ∈ A}, a τ a ≤ T and a φ a i = 1. Since the objective function i∈N U i (y i ) is concave with respect y i while the constraint set composed by ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">11</ref>) is convex, optimization problem (OPT-2) is a strictly convex optimization problem, however, with nonlinear constraints (8) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, which are induced by the coupling between y i and φ a i . To decompose the coupling variables y i and φ a i in constraints ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), we employ a hierarchical decomposition approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to separating optimization problem (OPT-2) into a repeated two-level optimization problem, which first maximizes the network utility over x, y and τ while keeping φ fixed, then maximizes the network utility by updating φ. Next, we will discuss the two-level optimization problem in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHM FOR WERMDG PROBLEM</head><p>In this section, we employ a hierarchical decomposition approach to separating optimization problem (OPT-2) into two levels of optimization to decompose coupling variables y i and φ a i . At the lower level, we provide a distributed algorithm for data control, routing and sojourn time allocation by solving the following optimization problem, denoted as OPT-2a, that maximizes network utility over variables x, y and τ while keeping φ fixed.</p><p>OPT-2a: max</p><p>x, y, τ i∈N</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">U i (y i ) (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM subject to constraints ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">11</ref>) and a τ a ≤ T . At the higher level, our goal is to determine the optimal proportion of uploading data to the SenCar at different anchor points by considering the following data split problem, denoted as OPT-2b, that maximizes network utility by updating φ.</p><p>OPT-2b:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">max φ U (φ)<label>(13)</label></formula><p>subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">a φ a i = 1, ∀i ∈ N (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">φ a i ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ N , ∀a ∈ A (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where U (φ) is the optimal objective value of problem (OPT-2a) over x, y and τ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Lower Level Optimization</head><p>Since optimization problem (OPT-2a) is strictly convex, in this subsection, we use Lagrangian dual decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> approach to solve it. We first relax constraints ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) by introducing Lagrangian multipliers λ a i , ν a i and ξ a ij , respectively.Here, λ a i can be interpreted as the flow conversation price at sensor i for the SenCar at anchor point a, ν a i can be regarded as the energy balance price to ensure the perpetual operation of each sensor node, and ξ a ij can be referred to as the link capacity price over link (i, j) at anchor point a.</p><p>We define the objective function of the Lagrangian dual problem as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">D(λ, ν, ξ) = max x,y,τ L(x, y, τ, λ, ν, ξ)<label>(16)</label></formula><p>with constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.

To elaborate, if i &lt; U i (Q i ), which indicates case 1) is satisfied, then y i = Q i ; if i &gt; U i (0), which implies case 3) is satisfied, then y i = 0; otherwise, the value of y i is updated by y i = U -1 i ( i ). This subalgorithm is summarized in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. It is apparent that to find the solution of y * i , sensor i needs to examine at most |A| anchor point. Thus the time complexity of the data control subalgorithm for sensor i is O(|A|).</p><p>2) Joint scheduling and routing subalgorithm: The joint scheduling and routing subalgorithm aims to schedule link activation and determine routing of data from sensor i to the SenCar so as to allocate the optimal flow amount on scheduled links destined to anchor point a during τ a .

We can utilize the sequential greedy algorithm similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to solve scheduling problem (25) distributively in linear time O(|E a |).

The joint scheduling and routing subalgorithm for sensor i is described in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. Apparently, in the worst case, the time complexity of the subalgorithm for sensor i is O( a∈A |E a |).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Higher Level Optimization</head><p>The lower-level optimization subproblems of data control, joint scheduling and routing, and sojourn time allocation are solved under the assumption that each φ a i is fixed. At the higher level, we now explore how sensor i adjusts φ a i to achieve the optimum of WerMDG problem (OPT-2) by solving optimization problem (OPT-2b).</p><p>As aforementioned, U (φ) is the optimal objective value of problem (OPT-2a) over x, y and τ . Thus, we can characterize the marginal utility for φ a i by the partial derivative of U (φ) with respect to φ a i , U (φ) = ∂U(φ)</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">∂φ a i = -(λ a * i + ν a * i μ gn i )y * i</formula><p>, which reflects the changing rate of U (φ) with φ a i or the gain of data delivery from sensor i to anchor point a. Clearly, it is preferred that to maximize network utility U (φ), sensor i should always transfer some of its data destined to other anchor points to the one with higher gain until φ i reaches equilibrium. If we let φ * i = {φ a * i |a ∈ A} be the optimal data split vector for sensor i, the optimal solution φ a * i to problem (OPT-2b) satisfies the following optimality condition, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">φ a * i &gt; 0 =⇒ ∂U (φ * i ) ∂φ a i ≤ ∂U (φ * i ) ∂φ a i , for all a ∈ A,<label>(37)</label></formula><p>which implies that sensor i always sends more data to the anchor point that has the maximum marginal utility U (φ).</p><p>For sensor i, assume that a denotes the anchor point with the maximum marginal utility, i.e., a = arg max a∈A ∂U(φ) ∂φ a i . Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, in the n-th iteration, sensor i can update φ a i according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">φ a i (n + 1) = φ a i (n) + δ a i (n),<label>(38)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">δ a i (n) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ -min {φ a i (n), κ(n)( ∂U(φ) ∂φ e a i (n) -∂U(φ) ∂φ a i (n))} if a = a -a =e a,a∈A δ a i (n)</formula><p>if a = a where κ(n) is a positive scalar stepsize. This is exactly Wardrop equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In other words, data split ratios per sensor node only settle when the gains of data delivered from sensor i to anchor point a have equalized (and thus are equal to the node marginal utility) and the remaining unused anchor points have lower gains.</p><p>Finally, we summarize the distributed algorithm for Wer-MDG problem in Table V. In the inner (lower) loop, sensors search for optimal data rates and flow rates as well as optimal prices of flow conversation, energy balance and link capacity, while the SenCar determines optimal sojourn time at different anchors. In the outer (higher) loop, sensors adapt the data split vector based on the stabilized prices in the inner loop.</p><p>V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this section, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate WerMDG algorithm. The following network utility function: U i (•) = w i log(y i + 1) is used to evaluate the network performance. The utility function represents the data uploaded  from sensors and a sensor with a larger weight w i would have more impact on the overall performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Convergence and Performance Analysis</head><p>First, we investigate the convergence property and analyze the performance of the proposed WerMDG algorithm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the network topology for our evaluations. Specifically, we consider a rechargeable WSN with 40 sensor nodes uniformly randomly scattered over a 60 × 60 m 2 field. The SenCar selects 5 anchor points (s 1 to s 5 ) for recharging sensors wirelessly and collecting data from the neighborhood. Since the data gathering algorithm is distributed and the energy replenishment of SenCar is independent of each other, WerMDG algorithm is also applicable to large scale sensor networks. All the communication links carry the same capacity C a ij and the power consumption for transmitting a packet is proportional to the square of the distance between the sender and the receiver. We consider supercapacitor or micro energy cell for fast recharging purposes and model the recharging process by function ρ(t) i = aB i e -at <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, where t is the time duration of recharging, and a is a constant related to the rate of recharging. All the parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table">VI</ref>.</p><p>Note that in order for variables to reach equilibrium in the higher-level optimization, the variables have to converge first in the lower-level optimization. For clarity, we show the convergence of some variables on selected sensors or links at the lower-level optimization, in which the diminishing stepsize is chosen. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the convergence of the algorithm in lower-level iterations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a) depicts the evolution of total amount of data collected from sensors 1, 4, 13 and 29. We can see that the variables fluctuate in the first 30 iterations and reach equilibrium after 80 iterations. As the stepsize becomes smaller and smaller, the algorithm tends to be stable and achieves convergence. Similarly, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b</ref>) and (c) present the convergence of Lagrangian multipliers λ a i and σ a , respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(d)</ref> shows the evolution of link flow rates on some selected links. We can see that link flow rates can converge to equilibrium in 350 iterations. In the meanwhile, the flow rate of a link with more hops converges more slowly than a link with fewer hops. For example, the flow rate of link (29, 23) with three hops to anchor point 3 (i.e., s 3 ) converges more slowly than that of link (8, s 1 ) with one hop to anchor point 1.</p><p>The underlying reason is that for a link with a higher number of hops, its flow rate is influenced by remaining energy and buffer size of relay nodes, flow conversation cost of relay links and flow competition on these links. After the variables have converged in the lower-level optimizations, we need to examine properties in higher-level optimization. For each sensor, we set the data split variables for different anchor points with equivalent values initially, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">φ 1 i = φ 2 i = φ 3 i = φ 4 i = φ 5 i = 0.2.</formula><p>We use a constant stepsize which equals 0.005 for the higher-level optimization. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the evolution of total network utility and data split variables on sensor nodes 5, 11, 22 and 32. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(a), the total network utility surges greatly in the first 20 iterations and then fluctuates slightly within 5% of the optimal value. It is justifiable since the convergence of network utility on different sensors is not synchronized, while it also differs for different anchor points. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4(b)</ref>, the evolution of data split variables is plotted for sensors nodes 5, 11, 22 and 32. At the optimal state, sensor 11 and 22 will send nearly 50% of its data to anchor point 3, sensor 5 will send 45% of its data to anchor point 2 and sensor 32 will send all of its data to anchor point 4, which shows that a sensor always prefers to transfer more data destined to the anchor point with higher gain of data delivery. The reason is that the data split ratio for different anchor points depends on the gains of links from a sensor to anchor points and the prices of both flow conversation and energy balance at sensor nodes on these links.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Impact of Utility Weight on Performance</head><p>Next, we examine the impact on performance by adjusting the utility weight at selected sensors. The purpose to assign different weights to sensors in various locations is to control the order of preference for the SenCar when collects data from them. Here, we linearly increase w i on sensors {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} from 500 to 3000 while keeping w i at 500 for all other sensors. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a) and (b) show the impact of utility weight on the amount of data gathered from sensors and anchor points, respectively. In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a), compared to sensor node 16, whose utility weight is kept unchanged, the amount of data collected for sensor nodes 1, 3 and 8 increases with utility weight. Furthermore, notice that the amount of data collected even declines with the increase of utility weight from sensor node 16 around anchor point 1. It indicates that the SenCar is able to collect more data from designated sensors by assigning a larger utility weight to them and sensors with lower utility weight might have to give up some data uploading opportunities to sensors with higher utility weight. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(b) presents the amount of data collected at anchor points 1, 2 and 3. Similarly, the amount of data collected at anchor points closed to sensor nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 increases with a higher utility weight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we have studied the problem of joint wireless energy replenishment and mobile data gathering (WerMDG) for rechargeable sensor networks. We first present an anchor point selection algorithm to determine the sensors that should get recharged in priority and the sequence of the anchor points that the SenCar visits. We then formulate the WerMDG problem into a network utility maximization problem under the constraints of flow conversation, energy balance, link capacity and sojourn time by taking into account the overall energy consumption and the time-varying recharging rate. Furthermore, we propose a distributed cross-layer WerMDG algorithm, through which each sensor adaptively tunes its optimal data rates and routing paths based on the current energy replenishment status while the SenCar dynamically adjusts its optimal sojourn time at each anchor point such that the entire network utility can be maximized. Finally, extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed WerMDG algorithm converges, and verify the impact of utility weight on network performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
