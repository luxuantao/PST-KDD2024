<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many biological research areas such as drug design require gene regulatory networks to provide clear insight and understanding of the cellular process in living cells. This is because interactions among the genes and their products play an important role in many molecular processes. A gene regulatory network can act as a blueprint for the researchers to observe the relationships among genes. Due to its importance, several computational approaches have been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. In this review, six inference approaches are discussed: Boolean network, probabilistic Boolean network, ordinary differential equation, neural network, Bayesian network, and dynamic Bayesian network. These approaches are discussed in terms of introduction, methodology and recent applications of these approaches in gene regulatory network construction. These approaches are also compared in the discussion section. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of these computational approaches are described.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Human DNA contains approximately twenty per cent of proteinencoding genes, with the other eighty per cent encodes retrotransposons, transposons and pseudogenes. Retrotransposons copy themselves to RNA and then back to DNA by reverse transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[1]</ref>. Transposons are called "jumping genes" as they can change position within the genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[2]</ref>. Both transposons and retrotranposons create mutations and alter or amplify the genome size. DNA also encodes many types of small RNA. In order to understand the nature of cellular function, it is necessary to study the behaviour of genes from a holistic perspective instead of individual manner. The expression and activity of genes are independent from each other.</p><p>Many crucial molecular processes and cellular pathways are based on the interactions among genes. The genes in living cells regulate each other to control the production of gene products. The regulation network of gene expression in an organism is very complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[3]</ref>. Computational approaches have been developed for the construction of genetic interaction models. Gene X is said to be regulated by gene Y if a change in the expression of gene Y also induces change in the expression of gene X. This regulation can be either up-regulation or down-regulation. Up-regulation results in activation and downregulation results in inhibition. One of the most famous paradigms in gene regulation is the lac operon in prokaryotes.</p><p>Gene regulatory networks describe control at the gene expression level and could be inferred from microRNAs (miRNAs), regulatory motifs, expression profiles and interactions between regulatory targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[4]</ref>. Gene regulation has become important as information of molecular regulatory interactions has become increasingly available. The importance of gene regulatory networks is evident for all biological species and system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[5]</ref> as they play important role in maintaining the biological functions of living organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[6]</ref>. The inference of regulators is the core factor in interpreting the actual regulatory conditions in gene regulatory networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[7]</ref>. This provides a clearer blueprint on the relationship between target genes and regulator genes. Each gene expression level in the genome is modified by a central dogma control process. Central dogma is the process that comprises transcription and translation. The expression of the gene products affects the expression rate of other genes, thus giving rise to a complicated network structure. Genes and proteins do not act independently. Some proteins function independently; however, others only react actively in a complex form <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Gene expression data is crucial for gene regulatory network construction. It serves as the raw input data to provide information on gene expression. According to the information provided by gene expression data, gene-gene interactions can be inferred to construct a gene regulatory network. Gene expression data allows biologists to observe the expression level of genes on a large scale. This includes DNA microarray, RNAseq <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[9]</ref> and SAGE (Serial analysis of gene expression) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[10]</ref>. There are two types of gene expression data used for gene regulatory network construction: time series and perturbation experiments. Time series expression data enables biologists to investigate the temporal pattern in biological networks. Perturbed expression data provides the information on interactions directions. The perturbation treatments are divided into two classes: gene manipulation (i.e. gene deletion, over-expression, temperature sensitive or kinetic mutation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[11]</ref> or external treatments (i.e. environmental stresses) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Gene regulatory network construction is a major focus in biological research since it can provide important information that is useful for drug design or medical-related fields. The resultant network or module would serve as a working model for researchers to form novel hypotheses and assist in experimental design <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[13]</ref>. For example, Madhamshettiwar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[14]</ref> applied gene regulatory network construction to ovarian cancer, generated a series of testable hypotheses, and finally discovered a list of potential drug targets. Nowadays, researchers use not only gene expression data but also integrate prior biological knowledge such as DNA sequence data or annotation data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[17]</ref>. The confluence of expression data and prior biological information can improve the accuracy and the quality of the gene regulatory network <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[13]</ref>. In the past, gene regulatory networks were constructed by using the clustering approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[18]</ref>. However, this approach failed to identify significant transcriptional network interactions. Hence, many computational approaches have been developed for constructing gene regulatory networks more effectively. Some review papers on gene regulatory network construction exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">20]</ref>, but this review focuses on reviewing some of the commonly used computational approaches for gene regulatory network construction, which include Bayesian network, dynamic Bayesian network, Boolean network, probabilistic Boolean network, ordinary differential equation and neural network. Also, this review discusses recent applications, development, and comparison of the aforementioned approaches, as well as future challenges. Readers are encouraged to consult review on recent attempts by biologists to apply predicted gene regulatory networks to bench experiments for new findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[13]</ref>, as well as a review on the performance of recent gene network inference software <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Bayesian network</head><p>Bayesian network (BN) models the qualitative properties of gene regulatory networks by using a combination of two mathematical areas: probability and graph theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[22]</ref>. Bayesian network allows visualisation of the independent relationships between genes through a directed acyclic graph (DAG).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Bayesian network methodology</head><p>According to Kaderali and Radde <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[8]</ref>, Bayesian network is a directed and acyclic graph where G ¼(X, A) with a set of local probability distributions P. X represents the nodes, {x 1 ; …; x n }, which represent the gene variables. However, A indicates the directed edge that corresponds to probabilistic dependence interactions among genes. A DAG is a network graph with directed edges and no cycles. In a DAG, the edge pointing from one node to another represents the regulatory relationship between parent node and child node. For instance, if X 1 is the parent of X 2 and X 2 is the parent of X 3 , the assumptions are that X 1 is the ancestor of X 3 and X 3 is the descendant of X 1 . The interaction between two nodes linked by an undirected edge is described by the neighbour term or adjacent term <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[23]</ref>. The joint distribution of a set of variables is showed below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pf x 1 ; x 2 ; … x n g ¼ ∏ n i ¼ 1 Pf x i j parents ðx i Þg<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where x i is a given gene node. n is the total number of genes involved. The parents (x i ) is the parent gene that regulates gene x i . Pðx i j parents ðx i ÞÞ for node i is denoted as Conditional Probability Distribution (CPD) or local distribution. CPD must be specified for the nodes that have parents. In a Bayesian network, the node set is decomposed into conditional independent node subsets that are non-overlapping according to their position. Bayesian network implements belief propagation for inference. Belief propagation updates and propagates the beliefs on the network by asserting evidence of certain entities existence that is found to support the network structure. Bayesian network modelling involves two major steps: structure learning and parameter learning. Structure learning is also known as model selection. The structure of the network is constructed in the structure learning stage. However, the probability values of each network node are estimated during parameter learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Applications of Bayesian network</head><p>Peer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[24]</ref> extended the Bayesian network framework to deal with perturbations in gene regulatory network inference. Other than that, a discretisation process is applied to the data prior to gene regulatory network inference. First, the data underwent a discretisation process. The following steps included inferring gene regulatory network using Bayesian Network, and finding the optimal gene network according to the scoring function. The intervention is not done by using genetic mutation experiments but by substituting external molecular control to the original one based on the expression of X. The results suggested new features and showed the differences between the proposed technique and the clustering technique.</p><p>Werhli and Husmeier <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[25]</ref> combined expression data with the prior biological knowledge from multiple resources for gene regulatory network reconstruction. They believed that including prior biological knowledge in gene regulatory network reconstruction is advisable to improve the result. Bayesian network was used with the information from expression data and prior biological knowledge to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, they used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme to sample the hyperparameters from posterior distribution. They observed that the values of the hyperparameters were close to optimal for reducing reconstruction error.</p><p>Yavari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[26]</ref> clustered the genes according to the gene ontology and inferred the interactions between the co-clustered genes using Bayesian network. This approach could solve the circumstance that arose due to the exponential number of possible structures caused by the increasing number of genes. Furthermore, they also proposed a new technique that employed cross-correlation between co-clustered genes in the inferring process. The cross-correlation between co-clustered genes provided time delay information to Bayesian network. The resulting accuracy increased around 6% and the sensitivity of the model also improved. The results revealed that this proposed technique is able to model a large number of genes.</p><p>Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[27]</ref> suggested reducing the computational time of Bayesian network using the Sparse Graph Search (SGS) algorithm. The SGS algorithm utilises iterated statistical independence test and searching technique to find the optimal network structure. Furthermore, the optimal gene regulatory network is produced using a hybrid approach. The proposed hybrid approach consists of the search-and-score and constraint-based approaches. For the search-and-score approach, a scoring metric evaluates the network quality according to the dataset and searches the best network structure over all candidate networks using the optimisation technique. However, the constraint-based approach investigates the existence of an edge by applying conditional independency tests instead of using statistical or information theory measurements. The results showed that the accuracy and computational efficiency was improved by the proposed approach.</p><p>Tan and Mohamad <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[28]</ref> applied Bayesian network to construct gene regulatory networks with the hill-climbing and Efron's bootstrap approaches. For the initial step, the Least Local Squares (LLS) imputation algorithm was used to impute the missing values that existed in the microarray dataset. After that, Bayesian network was used for network model construction and learned by using hill climbing algorithm. The bootstrap approach was used to extract a set of edges with a high confidence level. The authors concluded that the gene regulatory network achieved a high true positive rate, and more novel relationships among the genes were revealed by the proposed approach. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarises the recent studies on Bayesian network in gene regulatory network construction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Dynamic Bayesian network</head><p>Constructing gene regulatory networks using dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) has become the major focus for discovering the relationships between genes. Dynamic Bayesian network is an extension of Bayesian network that is able to infer the interaction uncertainties among genes by using a probabilistic graphical model. Compared to a Bayesian network, Dynamic Bayesian network is capable of modelling cyclic interactions among genes, which is an important aspect for biological network modelling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Dynamic Bayesian network methodology</head><p>In dynamic Bayesian network, the nodes in the network are duplicated in order to model the cyclic interactions and dynamic behaviours of gene regulatory networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[22]</ref>. Dynamic Bayesian network is capable of modelling the evolution of temporal processes based on the time slices property. Temporal relationships among genes are represented by interconnecting time slices. According to Manfredotti <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[29]</ref>, the probability distribution can be represented by a two-time-slice Bayesian network (2TBN) which is a Bayesian network that consists of variables from X t whose parents are variables from X t À 1 and/or from X t . The probability distribution,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">pð X t jX t À 1 Þ ¼ ∏ N i ¼ 1 p ð X i;t j Pa Bt ðX i;t ÞÞ<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where pðX i;t j Pa Bt ðX i;t Þ is the CPD. X i;t is a given gene node at time t. Pa Bt ðX i;t Þ is a set of parents for gene x i at time t in the Bayesian network B. N is the total number of gene nodes. Dynamic Bayesian network provides DAG as in Bayesian network. However, the edges in dynamic Bayesian network connect particular nodes between two consecutive time slices. Dynamic Bayesian network supports both intra-slice connections and inter-slice connections. Intra-slice connections are the connections within time slices, whereas interslice connections are the connections between time slices. The Conditional Probability Table, which represents the dependencies over time in the tabular form of a transition matrix, is incorporated to the temporal connections. The discrete state of dynamic Bayesian network needs to converted into hidden Markov models and then propagated forward and backward based on the conditional probabilities in the time direction for inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[30]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Applications of dynamic Bayesian network</head><p>Dojer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[31]</ref> focused on incorporating dynamic Bayesian network with perturbations in gene regulatory network construction. The objective of their research was to infer more reliable gene regulatory networks since the perturbed expression data was able to provide a wealth of information about causal relationships. The expression of genes was perturbed by special treatments such as knockout experiments, thus changing the structure of the interactions. The perturbations were introduced by substituting differential equation of mRNA of a perturbed gene into the model. The discretisation of the expression level with a threshold of 0.5 was necessary before employing the learning procedure. The threshold value of 0.5 aimed to reduce the low variability of expression caused by the discretisation process. This is followed by a learning algorithm with self-loop forbidden involved in the gene regulatory network construction. Based on the results, the authors concluded that the quality of the predicted networks had improved significantly due to the perturbed expression data.</p><p>Wu and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[32]</ref> aimed to improve dynamic Bayesian network modelling by using two different model searching approaches. The model searching approaches were applied to dynamic Bayesian network modelling to reduce the dimensionality problem of gene expression data. Additionally, the feasibility of dynamic Bayesian network modelling for gene regulatory network construction from high dimensional gene expression profiles generated from microarray experiments was examined. The model searching approaches included MCMC and Greedy hill-climbing Search with Restarts (GSR). The authors analysed the performance of these two model searching approaches through model averaging technique. For GSR, the possible mutation of the initial structure with the highest score was done by either a single edge addition or removal. The mutated dynamic Bayesian network model was set as the new base structure. This process loop continued until a local maximum was achieved. The final structure was saved and new run was restarted. Finally, a set of models was sampled. The Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm was applied in the MCMC approach. A new candidate model was obtained from the jumping distribution based on the current model. The acceptance probability was computed for the candidate model to determine whether the candidate model should be accepted or rejected. In the results, it was showed that both approaches had comparable performance in terms of time efficiency. However, the MCMC approach achieved higher prediction accuracy when compared to the GSR approach.</p><p>Grzegorczyk and Husmeier <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[33]</ref> improved the dynamic Bayesian network-based approach by combining the multiple changepoint process with the reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) approach for the Bayesian inference scheme. They optimised the convergence over the RJMCMC by introducing a dynamic programming scheme which sampled the change-point from the correct conditional distribution. Moreover, a new scheme of Bayesian clustering was introduced to encourage information sharing between nodes to provide automatic model complexity tuning. The results showed that the inference accuracy of the constructed gene network was enhanced and the performance of the proposed approach outperformed other previously reported alternative inference approaches.</p><p>Chai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[34]</ref> presented a dynamic Bayesian network-based model with missing values imputation. This study aimed to improve the prediction efficiency and reduce the computation time. Missing value imputation was applied to increase the efficiency of dynamic Bayesian network in gene regulatory network construction. Additionally, the computation time was reduced by limiting the potential regulators based on the changes in expression. Three stages were involved: missing value imputation, potential regulators selection and dynamic Bayesian network construction. Bayesian principle component analysis (BPCA) was selected as the imputation algorithm. In order to reduce the search space, cut-off thresholds were determined. Dataset discretisation was also carried out for potential regulators selection. Lastly, inference was conducted using the output from missing value imputation and potential regulators selection. The results of this research showed that the computation time and efficiency of dynamic Bayesian network had been improved by the proposed model.</p><p>Vinh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[35]</ref> observed that dynamic Bayesian network learning with local search or stochastic global optimisation provides sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, dynamic Bayesian network is only able to model gene networks of a small size. Hence, they integrated dynamic Bayesian network approach with deterministic global optimisation for gene regulatory network construction from time course expression data in order to solve these problems. Their proposed model employed the mutual information test (MIT) with a global optimization framework. MIT is a novel scoring metric based on information theory. High-order time delayed gene interactions can be learned by the proposed model. A scoring function was defined to assess the goodness-of-fit of the dynamic Bayesian network. In the following step, optimal gene regulatory networks were obtained using a search procedure based on the scoring metrics. As a result, a large number of gene regulatory networks could be inferred by the deterministic global optimisation based dynamic Bayesian network approach. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> summarises recent studies on dynamic Bayesian network in gene regulatory network construction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Boolean network</head><p>According to Kaderali and Radde <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[8]</ref>, Boolean network is said to be the simplest models for regulatory networks construction. It is easy to simulate and popular in capturing the global dynamical behaviour of genetic regulatory networks and interactions of genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[36]</ref>. Boolean Network can describe different biological phenomena in a system, such as oscillations, multi-stationarity, switch-like behaviour stability and hysteresis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Boolean network methodology</head><p>Two types of inferring approaches are used in the Boolean network: correlation and inferring <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[13]</ref>. For the correlation approach, gene relationship information is obtained by different approaches, which are then used in modelling the topology of the connections between genes. The inferring approach is a machine learning approach and the most commonly used algorithm in genetics.</p><p>A Boolean is defined as variable that can only assume two values; the values are usually represented by 1 and 0 or true and false. The operators of logic are and, or and not. For example, x 1 ; x 2 and x 3 ¼ 1 if and only if their variables are 1. The interaction types are divided into two classes for building a model: inactive and active <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[38]</ref>. A Boolean function is a function in which Boolean variables are linked by logic operators. This means that, in a Boolean network, the state of gene expression level is either on or off.</p><p>A Boolean network is a directed graph G(X, F) and represented by variable x A X, whereas the node or variable is associated with the function in Boolean. The state of the network is represented by values of nodes where S is denoted as the state, SðtÞ ¼ ðx_1 ðtÞ; x_2; ……; x_nðtÞÞ. All nodes are updated according to the function x_1 ðt þ 1Þ ¼ b1 ðx_i1 ðtÞ; x_i2 ðtÞ; ……; x_in ðtÞÞ.</p><p>One of the most attractive aspects of Boolean network is their simplicity and straightforward nature. They are fast and efficient. Moreover, Boolean network apply time-discrete and synchronous updates. On the other hand, the limitations of Boolean network are that they are not able to capture many important details of system behaviour. The deterministic nature of Boolean network is a problem because noisy data in the computation may cause inconsistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Applications of Boolean network</head><p>Davidich and Bornholdt <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[38]</ref> developed a Boolean model for biochemical networks controlling cell cycle progression in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The protein activation based on a time sequence along the biological cell cycle was reproduced by the dynamics of the network. A network connectivity graph was applied, and all biochemical kinetic parameters were neglected. The fission yeast cell cycle model was then compared to the similar Saccharomyces cerevisiae network model. A dominant attractor in the space characterised the dynamics of the network. The dynamics of the network were sturdy against perturbation treatments on biological sequences of protein activation. As a result, there was remarkably little different in the circuitry of fission yeast proteins with a similar network model in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe network has an auto-excited system with external damping when the latter runs strongly and is driven by external excitation.</p><p>According to Akutsu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[39]</ref>, Boolean network infers a genetic network from the state of a transition table with a time series of gene expression. The results showed that small numbers of the transition state pair are sufficient in inferring the original Boolean network. A simpler algorithm has been developed which showed that if the indegree of each node is bounded by a constant, O(log n), the O(log n) state transition pairs are sufficient to determine the original Boolean network. The constant factor of O (log n) is exposed. It has been shown that Boolean network with a size of 100,000 can be identified by 100 INPUT/OUTPUT pairs only if the maximum indegree is 2. The algorithm described in Akutsu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[39]</ref> showed a simple and extensible algorithm for realistic network models.</p><p>Silvescu and Honavar <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> focused on Boolean network models of genetic networks where each gene was either in the ON or OFF state. Temporal Boolean network, which is in the form of decision trees, is used for inferring gene networks from time series data. A decision tree can be constructed for each gene; the output shows the expression level of the gene. A series of experiments using artificially generated networks demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple and fast decision tree inference algorithm for inferring temporal Boolean network and temporal discrete networks.</p><p>According to Akutsu et al. <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>, gene network data from multiple gene disruptions can be analysed. The analysis also involves overexpression in a number of experiments whereby all of the genes are either expressed or not. A genetic network of Boolean network is constructed with a series of algorithms that identify approaches to determine the underlying genetic network. Lower bounds on the number of experiments are required for identification.</p><p>According to Saadatpour and Albert <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>, Boolean logic can be used to describe the interactions between mRNAs and proteins to predict gene pattern, especially for a gene that has not been studied. mRNA or protein is represented by a node within the network, while the edge represents the interaction between them. The state is either 1 or 0 corresponding to the presence or absence of one substance. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Probabilistic Boolean network methodology</head><p>Probabilistic Boolean network is an extension of Boolean network in which two or more possible transitions are combined. Every Boolean network is randomly selected in order to update the target gene. Updates are based on the probability of selection that corresponds to each Boolean function coefficient of determination (COD). The same set of variables is used, where x A X and GðX; FÞ, but using fF 1 ; F 2 ; …F n g. The COD is employed to select a set of predictors for a given gene, as stated by Shmulevich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[44]</ref>. The value of COD is set between 0 and 1 to measure the relative decrease in error. For a given gene, the COD is used to select predictors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Applications of probabilistic Boolean network</head><p>Shmulevich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[44]</ref> constructed a genetic regulatory network model in which the four model classes were (i) rule-based dependencies between genes, (ii) a systematic study of global network dynamics, (iii) ability to handle uncertainty in data and model selection, and (iv) quantification of the relative influence and sensitivity of gene interactions. In the probabilistic context of Markov chain, the dynamics of the network were studied. The basic building blocks of Bayesian network is derived from probabilistic Boolean network that showed the probabilistic dependencies between genes and their parent genes.</p><p>Pal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[46]</ref> stated that automatic control can be employed to find optimal approaches to manipulating external variables. Dynamic evolution over a finite time horizon would be affected by the transition probabilities of an instantaneously random system. The extension of approaches of external control to context-sensitive probabilistic Boolean network is focused. Probabilistic Boolean network yield a subclass of Markovian genetic networks in which the Markov chain state space is composed of gene vectors and each Markov chain state space corresponding to a probabilistic Boolean network is context-specific. It is composed of the current gene vector occupied as well as the current constituent Boolean network. Second, analysis of probabilistic Boolean network with perturbation in which gene perturbation is carried out randomly is allowed at each instant. Third, the choosing of particular gene that intervened by using the (mathematical) influence of genes within the network. Finally, the design of a probabilistic Boolean network with the recently proposed inference procedure includes the steady-state in its consideration. As a conclusion, the expected cost without control is much higher than with control, which means better outcomes.</p><p>The optimal infinite-horizon control for Probabilistic Boolean Networks has been considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[43]</ref>; however, this is timeindependent and relies on the current state of the stationary policy obtained. These formulas were applied for the generation of stationary policies for the construction of a probabilistic Boolean network from melanoma gene expression data. The results showed that the stationary policies were easier to implement compared to a policy that changed over time.</p><p>Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[47]</ref> used probabilistic Boolean network to determine the dependencies and regulating relationships among genes. A network inferring algorithm was implemented to recover direct gene connectivity and regulation orientations. A probabilistic modeling framework was adopted with a family of models represented by dynamic Bayesian network and probabilistic Boolean network. The reduction of the graphical solution search space and the optimal trade-off between data fitting and modeling complexity was proposed by a novel network inference algorithm. This study showed that the proposed algorithm achieved greater efficiency, robustness, accuracy and scalability.</p><p>Ching et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[48]</ref> aimed to develop an effective and efficient approach to discover the steady-state probabilistic distribution for a general probabilistic Boolean network model. Two steps were involved in the computational approach: (i) a final transition matrix was obtained from the construction of the transition probability matrix without perturbation and the construction of the perturbation matrix. (ii) The eigenvector corresponded to the maximum eigenvalue. As a result, the construction probability matrix, had the complexity of OðnN2 n Þ in the original system, where N represents the total number of Boolean networks and n represents the number of genes. In their approach, the value of N was made smaller by neglecting some Boolean networks with low probability based on the probability distribution of all Boolean networks and error evaluation. The theoretical results on the proportion of Boolean networks and probabilistic Boolean networks with at most two Boolean functions for a gene were presented.

A number of options are available in the extensive literature on different ODE models, such as parameter values, the number of equations and kinetic laws in functional form. The differential equation models are more accurately compared to discrete variables. This is because they represent underlying physical phenomena by virtue of their use of continuous variables.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dxi dt ¼ f iðx1; x2; …; xN; p; uÞ ð<label>4Þ</label></formula><p>in which x is the expression level of gene i at time t (the independent variable), n represents the number of genes, u is the an external perturbation to the system and p indicates the parameter set of the system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Applications of ordinary differential equation</head><p>Chen et al. <ref type="bibr">[50]</ref> used differential equations for gene expression; two approaches were used to develop the model from temporal data. Transcription and translation were modeled by kinetic equations with feedback loops from translation and transcription. Two approaches were involved: Minimum Weight Solution to Linear Equation (MWSLE) and Fourier Transform for Stable Systems (FTSS). MWSLE was used to determine the regulation by solving under-determined linear equations. Meanwhile, FTSS was used to refine the model with cycle constraints. The results show that this was sufficient to construct a model at the genome level with a minor set of temporal data.</p><p>Ando et al. <ref type="bibr">[51]</ref> used hybrid Evolutionary Modeling (EM) of Genetic Programming (GM) and statistical analysis to build differential equation systems. EM was used to identify a causal model from the observed time series data. In their experiment, they limited the functions to minima so GP could include more functions, which was useful to formulate anomaly reaction rules. 40 noises added data and derived network modeled from each data is created. The two terms with the largest positive and negative Z-scores for the analysis of each gene were chosen. GP identified the influencing terms and the degree of influence of the approved gene relation model on the S-system.</p><p>Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) were developed for modeling dynamic diffusion processes due to irregular Brownian motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[52]</ref>. The inference of the transcriptional regulatory network of S. cerevisiae was achieved with SDE. Temporally dynamic gene-transcription processes were modeled based on the theory of SDE. The SDE approach was tested on some of Spellman's data. The estimated coefficients selected regulators, a combination of regulatory functions inferred the transcriptional regulatory ability, and the LS approach derived the transcription pattern of a specific target. Putative regulators were combined to estimate the transcriptional pattern of a target gene. These were used to fit a generalized linear model. Statistical approaches were used to estimate the contributions of regulators and for transcriptional pattern inference.</p><p>Reverse-engineering algorithms based on ODEs relate changes in gene transcript concentration to each other and to an external perturbation. An experimental treatment can alter the transcription rate of genes in a cell, i.e. external perturbation.

Polynikis et al. <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref> aimed to compare different ODE modelling approaches in gene regulatory networks. The models obtained from different modeling approaches led to conflicting conclusions on the existence as well as the stability of equilibria and stable oscillatory behaviour.

The occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation leading to persistent oscillatory behaviour is shown in the complete non-linear model. The SNM and CNM predictions change as the time scales of mRNA and proteins change. The time scales of mRNA and proteins vary corresponding to the Hopf bifurcation point and disappear at infinity after making the quasi-steady-state approximation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Neural network</head><p>Another commonly used method for gene regulatory network construction, neural network was inspired by animals' central nervous systems. It is a flexible statistical method capable of recognising input pattern, and modelling any functional relationships and data structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[54]</ref>. The most successful neural networkbased model for gene regulatory network construction is the recurrent neural network (RNN). It is capable of capturing the nonlinear and dynamic interaction among genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[55]</ref>, thus providing the benefits of biological plausibility, noise-resistant, allowing feedback loops and handles internal states during the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Neural network methodology</head><p>Neural network allows continuous variables as it is continuous in time, and it transforms the input into a similar shape as observed in natural processes. The model formulates the genegene relationships by using nodes to represent genes and connections between genes to represent interactions. Neural network models the gene interactions by representing them in a tightly coupled system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">de i dt ¼ 1 τ i g ∑ N j ¼ 1 w ij e j þ β i ! À λ i e i !<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where w ij represents the type and concentration of the interaction between i-th gene and j-th gene, in which a positive value implicates j is repressing i and vice versa. λ i represents the reaction decay rate parameter, β i represents the basal expression level, and e i represents the gene expression level for i-th gene. The function g signifies the regulatory effect on each gene in the model that is defined by a set of weights such as w ij . Therefore, the computed weighted sum of all potential regulating genes is regarded as the regulatory effect on a particular gene. Network performance is then evaluated by utilising a scoring function, and this process can be considered as a parameter estimation problem whereby the desired results might include optimising network performance or minimising error measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Applications of neural network</head><p>Blasi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[56]</ref> used a recurrent neural network to identify gene regulatory networks for ribosomal and genome stability genes from expression data. A set of transformation rules is applied to increase the empirical correlations in the gene regulatory networks. They also utilised a synaptic weight matrix to keep the correlation coefficients invariant throughout the experiment. The results showed that the proposed model was able to identify the important aspects of gene regulatory networks and categorising different elements involved in the networks. Furthermore, the results also suggested that gene regulatory networks exhibited a high degree of clustering based on their modular architecture.</p><p>Lee and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[57]</ref> proposed a clustering-based approach for inferring recurrent neural networks as gene regulatory networks to tackle the scalability problem. To this end, they employed the self-organisation feature map (SOM) method for clustering the genes into multiple smaller-scaled networks. The small networks were then reconstructed using recurrent neural network. These small networks can be considered as a self-contained system Gunther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[59]</ref> used a feed-forward multilayer perceptron as a neural network model to estimate the arbitrary functional relationships among genes. They also picked the resilient backpropagation as learning algorithm as it eliminated the problem of deciding a suitable learning rate for each data structure. The simulation results showed that the proposed model was more efficient in modelling the underlying structure of gene regulatory networks when compared to the logistic regression model and multifactor dimensional reduction.</p><p>Noman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[60]</ref> proposed a decoupled recurrent neural network model to address the dimensionality problem and thus making the inference of larger networks more feasible from an algorithmic viewpoint. The global parameter estimation problem was divided into multiple sub-problems, thus creating a divideand-conquer methodology. The authors applied the proposed model on an artificial dataset and the Escherichia coli SOS response pathway dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The proposed model showed promising results and the potential of enabling parallelisation or granular distribution of the model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>In this review, several commonly used computational approaches for constructing gene regulatory networks are reviewed, as well as their recent developments and applications. Table <ref type="table">7</ref> shows the advantages and disadvantages for each inferring approaches discussed in this review. As the significance of gene regulatory networks in biological field increases over the years, many computational approaches and models have been developed to construct gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. Most of the approaches or models share the same principles, which include emphasising the reverse engineering paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[61]</ref>. Additionally, researchers are also interested in applying pattern-oriented process specification to describe a general solution for gene regulatory network construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[62]</ref>. Recent studies also showed that gene regulatory networks can be used to highlight genes and proteins that are involved with cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[63]</ref>. It should be noted that although the exact details might differ, but generally most approaches follow the same idea for measuring prediction accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[64]</ref>: a measure for calculating sensitivity, specificity, fall-out and precision. In some cases, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve might be used to illustrate the performance of an approach.</p><p>However, there are some issues and challenges remain in gene regulatory network construction. One of the issues is the scarcity of reliable gene expression data, and this in turn results in a restriction on the applications of gene regulatory network construction. The biological plausibility of the inferred gene regulatory networks would be questionable as well. Another issue would be the inference complexity due to the high dimensionality of data. A typical gene expression data contains thousands of expression values and the number of network parameters and structures increase exponentially. This would severely burden the whole inference process in terms of software and hardware. There are two suggestions for addressing this problem. For one, dimension reduction can be applied on the data to reduce the large search space; secondly, employ a 'divide and conquer' strategy whereby an overall solution can be derived from multiple partial solutions. This strategy could be also applied on network parameter estimation or network decomposition to reduce complexity.</p><p>As biological research fields began their transition into a new perspective of holistic research, biological data is increasing exponentially at an unprecedented speed. Along with the advance of technology, gene regulatory network construction serves as the catalyst to propel future promising achievements in systems biology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Summary of recent dynamic Bayesian network techniques in gene regulatory network construction.</figDesc><table /></figure>
