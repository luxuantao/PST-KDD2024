<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Current research in automatic train operation concentrates on optimizing an energy-efficient speed profile and designing control algorithms to track the speed profile, which may reduce the comfort of passengers and impair the intelligence of train operation. Different from previous studies, this paper presents two intelligent train operation (ITO) algorithms without using precise train model information and offline optimized speed profiles. The first algorithm, i.e., ITOE, is based on an expert system that contains expert rules and a heuristic expert inference method. Then, in order to minimize the energy consumption of train operation online, an ITOR algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL) is developed via designing an RL policy, reward, and value function. In addition, from the field data in the Yizhuang Line of the Beijing Subway, we choose the manual driving data with the best performance as ITOM. Finally, we present some numerical examples to test the ITO algorithms on the simulation platform established with actual data. The results indicate that, compared with ITOM, both ITOE and ITOR can improve punctuality and reduce energy consumption on the basis of ensuring passenger comfort. Moreover, ITOR can save about 10% energy consumption more than ITOE. In addition, ITOR is capable of adjusting the trip time dynamically, even in the case of accidents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>U RBAN metro system has received much attention as it is an environmentally friendly transportation with high speed and punctuality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In addition, a subway is considered one of the main approaches to deal with notorious urban traffic congestion. Many large cities in China are making great efforts in developing urban railway networks. For example, the length of the Beijing Subway will extend from 456 km in 2013 to 660 km until 2016.</p><p>As a core technology of a train control system, subway train operation has gone from manual operation to automatic train operation (ATO). ATO is responsible for all traction and braking controls that have a direct impact on the performance of subway operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Therefore, research has been done to enhance the performance of ATO as it is widely used in the subway train operation of major cities including Beijing and Shanghai. Generally speaking, the research can be divided into two levels.</p><p>The first level of research concentrates on how to obtain the offline energy-efficient speed profile between successive stations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. On the basis of the Pontryagin maximum principle, Howlett and Cheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> built a discrete control model and confirmed the fundamental optimality of the accelerate-coast-brake strategy for energy-efficient train operation. Considering variable gradients and arbitrary speed limits, Khmelnitsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> constructed a numerical algorithm to obtain the optimal velocity profile. Liu and Golovitcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> estimated a continuous traction force model with constant efficiency to find the optimal control change points on a multilayer statevariable plain. In addition, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed a stochastic optimization model with uncertain resistances. In recent years, with the rapid development of computer science, intelligent algorithms have been successfully applied into the calculation of the energy-efficient speed profile. Chang and Sim <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> applied a genetic algorithm on a train control problem to generate an optimal coast control based on the joint evaluation of punctuality, riding comfort, and energy. Wong and Ho <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> showed that a genetic algorithm was robust compared with classical calculating methods. By designing a fitness function, Bocharnikov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> balanced the energy consumption and trip time of train operation, and a genetic search method was used to find the optimal train trajectories. Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> compared a genetic algorithm, an ant colony optimization algorithm, and dynamic programming in calculating an energyefficient profile to obtain the characteristics of each algorithm. To tackle optimal profile problems with constraints, a fixed arrival time, and the balance between energy consumption and riding comfort, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed two approaches that were pseudospectral methods and a mixed-integer linear programming method. In addition, Su et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> obtained a global optimal solution by estimating a bilevel programming model and designing an integrated timetable algorithm.</p><p>The second level of research in ATO concentrates on automatic train control methods to track the optimal speed profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In the Beijing Subway train operation, proportional-integral-derivative-based controllers are widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for its practicality. Rigatos <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed fuzzy stochastic automata of vehicle control. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> utilized iterative learning control by using previous running data to track the speed profile. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of vehicle dynamics, involving nonlinear factors, variable resistance, actuator saturation, even in-train forces, more advanced control methods are derived to track the speed profile more precisely. For example, to overcome the traction/barking saturation of a train dynamic model, Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> designed a computationally inexpensive tracking control method where a single-coordinate dynamic model that reflects in-train forces was derived. More recently, Gao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed two robust adaptive control methods considering the actuator saturation and unknown system parameters.</p><p>Admittedly, the research and implementation of ATO have greatly improved the performance of subway train operation. However, there are still problems that restrict the intelligence of train operation. (Note that intelligence in this paper means that the algorithm is robust with unknown parameters and a flexible trip time in train operation.) On one hand, the calculation of the optimal speed profile rarely considers multiple objectives such as punctuality, the comfort of passengers, and energy consumption, which are all important factors in subway train operation. On the other hand, ATO algorithms that aim to track the offline optimized speed profile are automatic and are not intelligent. Indeed, when facing system nonlinearity, unknown resistance forces, and variable in-train forces simultaneously, complex control methods are difficult to implement in actual operation. In addition, the trip time of a train needs to be dynamically adjusted in case of accidents. In actual subway operation, the ATO mode has to be switched into manual driving under such circumstances as existing algorithms are unable to fit with the variable trip time.</p><p>As far as we know, there are few works focusing on online train control algorithms without a target speed profile. One possible reason is that a subway train control system is a complex system, and it needs to meet multiple objectives. In addition, unknown resistance and the nonlinearity of a train model cannot be ignored, which means that ATO algorithms must be robust and intelligent to deal with this uncertain interference. From a new perspective, this paper proposes two intelligent train operation (ITO) algorithms to address these challenges. The first is called ITOE as it is based on an expert system. Then, on the basis of ITOE, we propose ITOR, which is based on reinforcement learning (RL), to optimize energy consumption online. The two intelligent algorithms do not need the offline speed profile and a precise train model to achieve online and intelligent train operation.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we define the necessary symbols and performance indexes in subway train operation, and then, we formulate the problem of subway train operation. Section III presents the ITO algorithms' design based on an expert system and RL. In Section IV, we build an ITO simulation platform. Numerical examples with actual data from the Yizhuang Line of the Beijing Subway (YLBS) are presented in Section V. We conclude this paper in Section VI. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>The process of ATO for a subway is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The three dimensions are the trip time, the distance, and the speed of the train <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. State switches in the process are also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We define Δt as the minimal sample time interval; thus, the trip time of a train at any position can be described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t i+1 = t i + Δt.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Based on this time-speed-distance 3-D model, we define the necessary symbols of the online and offline data, as well as the parameters and indexes in train operation as follows.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Definition of</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem Statement</head><p>Generally speaking, subway train operation concentrates on two aspects. The first aspect is to maintain the safety of the train such that the speed of the train cannot exceed certain limits. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> represents the speed limits between two successive stations in the YLBS. It is shown that speed limits are divided into three intervals, with v lim 1 , v lim 2 , v lim 3 . The second aspect is to improve punctuality, energy efficiency, and the comfort of passengers. The definitions of these indexes are presented in (2)-( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), respectively. We explain these indexes in detail as follows.</p><p>• Overspeed protection. Safety is the premise of subway train operation where keeping the speed of the train under certain speed limits is required. If the speed of the train exceeds speed limits, we define index Y as 1, else Y is equal to 0, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y = 1, if v i &gt; V lim 0, if v i ≤ V lim .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>• Punctuality. Punctuality is an important indicator for subway train operation that affects the passengers' transfer and the timetable of the whole line. We define the running time error e t that indicates the error between the planned trip time and the actual trip time as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">e t = |T -t m | T .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>• Comfort. The passenger density in an urban subway system is relatively high, which is different from a railway network that links major cities in China. This character requires ensuring the comfort of passengers, which directly relates to the quality of subway service <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. As shown in (4), index C is defined as the indicator of comfort. The smaller C is, the more comfortable passengers feel</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C = 1 m m-1 i=1 |u(t i+1 ) -u(t i )| Δt .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>• Energy efficiency. Energy-efficient train operation is critical as the rising of energy prices and environmental concerns. This is one of our core considerations in designing ITO algorithms. The energy consumption between two stations per unit mass is defined as E in</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E = T 0 κ |u(t)| v(t) dt, κ = 1, if u(t) &gt; 0 0, if u(t) ≤ 0. (5)</formula><p>Therefore, the purpose of ITO algorithms is to develop a new method to meet the following objectives.</p><p>• Without using the target speed profile, ITO can automatically operate the train similar to an experienced driver with real-time data including the current speed and the position of the train. • ITO algorithms do not need the precise information of the train model. • With ITO algorithms, indicators of overspeed protection, comfort, and punctuality are ensured, and the energy consumption of train operation is minimized. • An ITO algorithm should be adaptive with different speed limits, gradients, and planned trip times. • An ITO algorithm is capable of dynamically changing the control strategies to adapt to the altered trip time. The work in this paper is motivated by achieving a humansimulated intelligent control of a subway train. Through the analysis of the manual driving data in the YLBS, we found that experienced drivers can drive the train without the target speed profile and that they can satisfy multiple objectives including safety, punctuality, energy efficiency, and comfort. Since then, we have been talking with experienced drivers in the Beijing Subway to learn their experiences and driving strategies. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> introduced agent-based and data-driven methods, which simulated experienced experts and machine learning techniques in transportation systems. We have also applied machine learning techniques in train automatic stop control (TASC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. However, compared with TASC, ITO for a subway needs not only to adapt to a variable trip time and the unknown parameters of a train model but also to achieve energy-efficient train operation. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed two intelligent algorithms, i.e., ITOE and ITOR. ITOE is based on an expert system to handle the multiple objectives. In addition, RL-based ITOR is developed to optimize energy consumption online (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ITO ALGORITHM DESIGN</head><p>First, we develop the ITOE algorithm based on an expert system. The expert system contains expert rules and a heuristic inference system. By communicating with subway train drivers and analyzing the data from the YLBS and literature, we first summarize the expert rules. Since there is no target speed profile, we develop a heuristic inference method that is motivated by drivers' operation strategy. Then, the appropriate output of ITOE is obtained via a comprehensive consideration of speed limits and the current state of the train.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. ITOE</head><p>Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the train control model, it is difficult to design the controller to overcome all Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. ITO algorithms for subway train control with an expert system and RL. potential problems. However, experienced drivers can satisfy multiple objectives very well. By observing the drivers' action, we find that experienced drivers can control the train to coast at the right position, distribute the reserved time reasonably, avoid unnecessary braking, restrict the speed of the train to prevent overspeed, and reduce the switching numbers of the controller output. We take comprehensive measures to get the expert knowledge, including questionnaires with experienced drivers about how to drive with high comfort and low energy consumption, observations in the Beijing Subway by ourselves, and data analysis with data mining methods from historical manual driving data. Finally, after summarizing and validating these data <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, we derive IF-THEN rules by treating the position, the speed, and the running time as inputs and the accelerating/braking rates as outputs. These rules can be described as follows.</p><p>• In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, energy-efficient train operation is divided into three states, namely, acceleration, coasting, and braking. • The acceleration for a train starting process should be appropriate to ensure comfort (usually less than 0.6 m/s 2 ). • For better comfort, the change rate of acceleration in each time interval should not be too large. • When the velocity is relatively high, the train should keep in the coasting mode and avoid accelerating or braking as much as possible; but when the speed of the train is too low to arrive on time, the train should accelerate to increase the speed. • If the train is in a section of a downward slope, reduce the controller output properly; otherwise, in a section of a sharp upward slope, increase the controller output appropriately. • Judge the next operation mode in advance according to the current velocity and the next speed limit value to avoid triggering the automatic train protection. • Distribute the total trip time into intervals according to the speed limits, and operate the train following the distributed time in each interval as much as possible.</p><p>In addition, as there is no target speed profile, we design a data-driven inference method to judge the time when to coast or accelerate to ensure punctuality. This inference method, which is motivated by manual driving, contains a minimal-time distribution (MTD) algorithm. In our investigation, experienced drivers make a comprehensive consideration of the reserved time, reserved distance, speed limits, and current speed of the train: If the speed of the train is too low to arrive on time, the train will accelerate. On the contrary, the train will coast if the speed of the train is too high. Therefore, we calculate an estimated velocity by the MTD algorithm to judge the current speed of the train.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 3.1</head><p>The algorithm for MTD is summarized as follows.</p><p>1: Obtain the online data and the offline data including current train position s i , velocity v i (the point in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), and speed limits V lim . The reserved trip time is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">t r i = T -t i . Assume that s lim k-1 ≤ s i ≤ s lim k , which means that the train is in speed limit interval (s lim k-1 , s lim k ). 2:</formula><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, we draw the maximum traction speed profiles from the train position and each speed limit section. Then, from the left end of each speed limit section, we draw the maximum braking speed profile to obtain the minimum trip-time profile. 3: Calculate the minimum reserved time T min r in the current speed limit interval t lim r . 4: The distributed reserved time in the current speed limit section can be calculated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">tr = (T -t i )t min r /T min r . (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>5: Return tr , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">i ← i + 1.</formula><p>With the online data of the train, we first use the MTD algorithm (see Algorithm 3.1) to get the appropriate reserved trip time tr in the current speed limit interval. Then, the estimated velocity vi is calculated by tr and reserved distance s lim ks i in the current speed limit interval as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">vi = s lim k -s i / tr . (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>The MTD algorithm and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">7</ref>) indicate that, if the train speed is equal to vi in the whole reserved trip time Tt i , the train can get to the destination punctually. Thus, we suggest that, if the speed of the train is lower than vi , the train needs to accelerate; else, the train should coast. Then, the inference method for judging operation modes (coasting or accelerating) is summarized as follows.</p><p>• If v i ≤ v, the train should accelerate, and the output of the expert system is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">u E i+1 = u E i + Δu max i , if u E i &lt; u max u max , if u E i ≤ u max<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where Δu max i is the variation of acceleration in time interval Δt. Note that parameter Δu max i is assumed as a constant in the expert system. In addition, after our experiments where Δt is set to be 0.2 s, we find that Δu max i = 0.3 m/s 2 is an appropriate value to balance the energy consumption and comfort. Δu i is not constant if considering unknown interference factors, such as the gradient of the line, the resistance, etc. Thus, the parameter will be adjusted via RL in the next section.</p><p>• If v i &gt; v, the train should remain or switch to the coasting mode, and the output of the expert system is described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">u E i+1 = 0. (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>After designing the expert rules and the heuristic inference method, the expert system for ITO is accomplished. With the online data and the speed limit information, the expert inference method can make an appropriate decision to accelerate or coast. Furthermore, the output is restricted by the expert rules to ensure comfort and punctuality. The expert system does not need a specific train model and the resistance parameters. However, as Δu max i is assigned as a constant value, ITOE cannot learn to optimize the energy consumption online. Therefore, we apply RL to improve the performance of ITOE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. ITOR</head><p>RL is learning how to map situations to actions to optimize a numerical reward signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Different from supervised learning, RL does not need the correct output in every learning sample but the long-term reward for a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Another important feature of RL is that it does not need the precise model information; hence, it is a useful tool when dealing with optimal control problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. RL has been applied to many industrial fields, such as web pages ranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, autopilot <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, urban traffic control <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, commutation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, vehicle control <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, etc. However, as far as we can see, RL has not been applied to ATO to achieve energy-efficient train operation. In this paper, we use RL to improve the performance of ITO mainly for three reasons. First, ITO algorithms do not need the target speed profile, which fits RL very well since RL does not need an external supervisor. Second, in a train control process, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the rewards of the following states. By using input-output data, RL can get the environment information and output the optimal solution by a trial-and-error search. Third, the basic solutions of ITOR are restricted by the expert rules into a certain range. Therefore, the RL for ITO is not likely to diverge.</p><p>Before applying the RL algorithm, the train control model needs to be redefined as a Markov decision process (MDP). As shown in the following, the current position, the speed, and the reserved trip time are considered the state of the train:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">X i = [s i , v i , T -t i ], i = 0, 1, . . . , m. (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>Let X 0 denote the initial train state and X m denote the final state. Obviously, the following equations should hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">X 0 = [0, 0, T ]<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">X m = [S, 0, T -t m ].<label>(12)</label></formula><p>After the initial state, the next state will be generated by the controller output. Thus, the following can be derived:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(0, 0) u 0 → (s 1 , v 1 ) u 1 → (s 2 , v 2 ) . . . (s m-1 , v m-1 ) u m-1 → (S, 0). (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>Moreover, the time interval between each continuous state is Δt. It is clear that state X i+1 is only related to state X i and action u i . Therefore, {X} is indeed an MDP that can be handled via RL. Then, we define a dynamical train control system (time varying), as shown in</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">X i+1 = F [X i , u i , i], i = 0, 1, . . . , m<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where u ∈ R denotes the control action, and F is the system function of the train dynamic model. To optimize the energy consumption of ITO online, we define the critical elements of RL as the policy, the reward function, and the value function, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>• Policy. A policy defines the learning agent's way of behaving at a given time. We regard the train as an intelligent agent; then, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">12</ref>) describe the agent's states in the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS train operation process. Note that, compared with Δu max i in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">9</ref>) in ITOE, the variation of acceleration in each time interval for ITOR is variable in each state. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> shows, we use Δu var i to replace Δu max i . Then, to improve the convergence rate of RL, we define Δu var i as an optional action. The reason is that u i varies from -1 to 1, whereas Δu var i varies from -0.3 to 0.3 according to the expert system. Thus, (15) can be derived for ITOR as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">u i = u i-1 + Δu var i . (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>The policy, which is denoted by π(X, Δu var ), is the probability of selecting a certain action when an agent is concerned with states. The action-selection policy method we utilize in this paper is called the ε-greedy policy. It means that, most of the time, they choose an action that has an optimal estimated action value, but with probability ε, they select an action at random. • Reward Function. A reward function defines the goal in an RL problem. Therefore, we define energy consumption as the reward for each step Δt in</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">U i = u 0 + i k=1 Δu var k × (v i + v i-1 ) × Δt/2.<label>(16)</label></formula><p>• Value Function. A value function specifies what is good in the long run that can be also described as the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate in the future, starting from that state <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. As Δu var is defined as the optional policy shown in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Δu var ∈ [-0.3, 0.3]<label>(17)</label></formula><p>the value function is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Q(X, Δu var ) = m-1 i=1 γ m-1 U i (X i , Δu var , i) k = m-1 i=1 γ m-1 u 0 + i k=1 Δu var k (v i + v i-1 )Δt/2 k.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 3.2</head><p>The detailed process of ITOR is described as follows.</p><p>1: Initialize the parameters, and the train is at state X 0 . Assume that i ∈ [0, m]. 2: Start with the acceleration calculated by the expert system u E 0 . 3: If Ss i &lt; d, go to 10; Else, go to 4. 4: Evaluate reward U i at state X i based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. 5: Improve the policy and the value function according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. 6: Obtain the optimal Δu var i , and adjust output u i by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">15</ref>). 7: If u i meets the expert rules in Section III-A, go to 8; Else u i ← u E i . 8: Output u i , and update the value function according to (18). 9: i ← i + 1. 10: Brake to park the train in the station.</p><p>In addition, in actual subway operations, particularly for Shanghai and Beijing, the adjustment of the trip time often occurs in case of emergencies as the train is running between two adjacent stations. Thus, we modify the RL to adapt to this case. Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">13</ref>) have described the state of RL that are the current position, the speed, and the reserved trip time. Thus, the reserved trip time can be redefined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">t r i = T -t i , if t i &lt; t p T + T va -t i , if t i ≥ t p . (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, t p is the time when the emergency happens, and T va is the value of time adjustment at t p . If trip time t i is less than t p , the planned trip time does not need to be changed; otherwise, the planned trip time turns into T + T va . Hence, we redefine the state of RL as</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">X i = [s i , v i , t r i ].</formula><p>If an accident happens at t p , then trip time T is changed into T + T va , and the state of the train will be switched into a different state, as shown in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">X i = [s i , v i , T -t i ] → X i+1 = [s i+1 , v i+1 , T + T va -t i+1 ].</formula><p>(21) After these definitions and derivations, the specific process of ITOR is described in Algorithm 3.2. It is noted that ITOR in this section is on the basis of ITOE; therefore, the requirements for the punctuality and comfort of ITOR are still satisfied.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. ITO Simulation Platform</head><p>To simulate the effectiveness and robustness of the ITO algorithms, an ITO simulation platform is built on the basis of the multiple-point-mass train model. It is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> that the platform consists of four parts, i.e., the Input Module, the Algorithm Module, the Train Model, and the Output Module. The Input Module is used to input the offline data on the ITO platform including the speed limits, the gradient of the line, the planned trip time, and the train dynamic model parameters. The Algorithm Module is the core part of the platform that calculates the outputs by the online and offline data, and it generates outputs to the train model. The Train Model simulates the actual train accelerating/braking system with the time delay, the time constant, and the resistances that have been described in Section IV-A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS</head><p>To illustrate the proposed ITO algorithms, we present numerical examples based on actual field data from the YLBS. The YLBS started operation in 2010 and is regarded as an important line not only for field tests but also for the economic development of the Yizhuang area in Beijing. The type of train used in the YLBS is the DKZ32 EMU, which is composed of six vehicles (three locomotives, i.e., the first, third, and last vehicles, and three carriages, which are expressed as L-C-L-C-C-L). The detailed parameters of the train model are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>.</p><p>It should be noted that the aforementioned train model parameters are solely used for test purposes, whereas the ITO algorithms do not need such information. In addition, the speed limits and gradient of the YLBS will be described in the case study in the following.</p><p>Next, we present three different cases to test the effectiveness, robustness, and intelligence of the ITO algorithms. In Case 1, a comparison among the three algorithms, i.e., ITOM, ITOE, and ITOR, is derived. In Case 2, we alter the planned running time to verify the robustness of the ITO algorithms. In Case 3, we test the intelligence of ITO by dynamically adjusting the trip time as the train is running between adjacent stations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Case 1</head><p>Taking the interstation between Rongjing and Wanyuan as an illustrative example, the speed limits and the gradient during this interval are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>, respectively. The planned trip time T = 101 s is the same as it is in actual operation, and the distance between two stations is 1280.3 m. The data sets we use in this section are collected in the YLBS from <ref type="bibr">March 21, 2012</ref> to <ref type="bibr">March 26, 2012</ref>, including 120 groups of up trains and down trains. Among them, half of the data are with manual driving, whereas the others are with ATO driving. We select the manual driving data with the best universal performance from the recorded data sets as ITOM.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> shows the energy consumption E and running time error e t in the online learning process of ITOR. It is shown that, in the process of RL, the energy consumption is reduced from 135 to 122 after about 100 learning times, and it comes close IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Speed limits from Rongjing to Wanyuan. to a good value gradually. In addition, the running time error has a little floating, but it is strictly kept in a 2% range. This suggests that RL can reduce the energy consumption online while satisfying the running time error constraint.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref> shows the operation curves of ITOM, ITOE, and ITOR. It is shown that the speed of ITOE and ITOR are much lower than that of ITOM, and the curves are very smooth. In addition, ITOE and ITOR are very similar, except for the coasting position. ITOE coasts from 296.5 to 1060 m, whereas ITOR coasts from 276.9 to 1072 m. Compared with ITOE, the coasting distance of ITOR is longer, and the coasting speed is lower.</p><p>The performance of the three control algorithms is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. It is shown that all three algorithms can achieve safe driving as they never exceed the speed limits. Moreover, the running time errors of the three algorithms are under 3%, with ITOM as the worst compared with the other two. The possible reason is that drivers operate the train through experience without rigorous mathematical calculation. The values of comfort for the three algorithms are very close, and ITOM is the best, which means that experienced drivers can drive the train more comfortably. The energy consumption is of great difference among the three algorithms. ITOM costs more energy than  ITOE and ITOR. In addition, ITOR can further reduce about 10% energy consumption than ITOE. This indicates that, by online learning, the energy consumption is reduced by changing the coasting position and extending the coasting distance. In addition, ITOR can find the optimal outputs by interacting with the environment information online with RL techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Case 2</head><p>In this case, we verify the robustness of ITO by changing the planned trip time. We choose another interval between Tongji and Rongchang with different speed limits and gradients. The  trip times we set are 150, 160, and 170 s, respectively. We also compare ITOE and ITOR under each planned trip time. Note that due to page limitations, we only show the operation curve comparison between ITOE and ITOR under the 160-s trip time.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, with the 160-s trip time, both ITOE and ITOR can operate the train without exceeding the speed limits. The coasting points of ITOE are at 226.1 and 1205 m, whereas the coasting points of ITOR are at 250.7 and 1152 m. Apparently, the coasting points are slightly adjusted by RL.</p><p>Furthermore, the specific performance is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref>. The results of ITOR under different planned trip times are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>. It can be observed that both ITOE and ITOR with different trip times can operate the train smoothly, and the speed of the train never exceeds the speed limits. For all situations, the ITO algorithms can keep running time error e t within 3%. The results suggest that the two ITO algorithms have good robustness with different trip times. In addition, the values of comfort are increased if the trip time is reduced, which is caused by the higher acceleration transforms. Furthermore, we can see that the energy consumption decreases about 10% for an arbitrary trip time via the application of RL. It means that, by searching for the optimal coasting points, RL can find better control strategies online.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Case 3</head><p>In an urban railway transit, the arriving time of a train is always revised in case of accidents, even when the train is running between intervals. For example, in the Beijing Subway, the running train must extend its trip time if the next station is occupied by another train with a temporary problem. For ATO with an offline speed profile, it is difficult to adjust the trip time dynamically, but ITOR is able to overcome this difficulty. We show two examples to dynamically adjust the trip time by using ITOR for this case, extending or cutting back the trip time. This kind of examples in our simulation is named as the ITO with a variable trip time.</p><p>The interval we choose is from Rongjing to Wanyuan, as described in Case 1. Planned trip time T is set as 100 s. The first example is that an accident happens when the train has operated for 35 s. The train is informed to arrive at the station 10 s earlier. This means that the reserved trip time for the train has suddenly changed from 65 to 55 s. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">12</ref> shows the running curve of ITOR with a variable trip time. In addition, we show another curve of ITOR with a constant trip time where no accident occurs. The position where the train is informed to change the trip time is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">12</ref>, and we name this point as the Accident Position. By comparing  the two curves, it is shown that, if an accident happens and the trip time is decreased by 10 s, ITOR intelligently changes its driving strategy and accelerates immediately. In addition, the detailed performance of ITOR with a variable trip time is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref>. The final running time error is 2.2% (note that the trip time has been changed to 90 s). However, because the train accelerates at the Accident Position, indicator C is a relatively large number, which might be uncomfortable to passengers.</p><p>The second example is in contrast to the first example. The time-altered position t p is set as 20 s, and the time-altered value T va is set as 10 s. After the train has operated for 20 s, it is informed to arrive to the next station 10 s later. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> and<ref type="figure">Table V</ref>.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>, as the reserved trip time is changed from 80 to 90 s at the accident point, the train stops accelerating and begins to coast right away. Then, the train keeps coasting until braking to park. Even so, in Table V, it is shown that the running time error is a little more than 4% (note that the trip time has been changed to 110 s). It means that, in spite of RL's application and the improvement of the general performance of the subway train operation, the punctuality of the train operation is still affected by accidents. However, in general, the results still suggest that ITOR is highly adaptable to a variable trip time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed two ITO algorithms for subway train operation in a new perspective. The offline speed profile for tracking is no longer needed, as well as the precise information of the train model. By using drivers' experiences, we build an expert system to obtain the output of ITOE. Furthermore, on the basis of the expert system, we redefine the critical elements of RL and develop ITOR to optimize the train operation's energy consumption online. Then, from the actual driving data of experienced drivers, we choose the manual driving data with the best universal performance as ITOM. Finally, numerical examples are derived on the ITO simulation platform. The results show that all three algorithms, i.e., ITOM, ITOE, and ITOR, can ensure that the speed of the train is lower than the speed limits. Both ITOR and ITOE significantly outperform ITOM in punctuality and energy consumption, whereas the values of comfort are very close. In addition, by the comparison between ITOE and ITOR, we conclude that the application of RL can reduce about 10% energy consumption. Furthermore, ITOR can be adaptive with a variable trip time. In case of accidents when the trip time is occasionally changed, ITOR still can be very effective considering speed limits, punctuality, and energy consumption.</p><p>The proposed ITO algorithm in this paper has its unique advantages not only because it is based on the real-time data of a running train without the precious information of the train model but also because it learns online to get the optimal control strategy without the offline optimized energy-efficient speed profile. In spite of these advantages, a few issues need to be addressed in the future. For example, expert rules should be more specific, and RL with function approximation may be taken into account. These aspects remain to be our future research directions.</p><p>To our knowledge, F.-Y. Wang and B. Ning et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> have proposed parallel control concepts for railway transportation systems where expert knowledge and intelligent control methods, such as adaptive dynamic programming, serve as key elements for building an Artificial systems, Computational experiments, Parallel execution (ACP)-based parallel control system. We believe that the ITO algorithms proposed in this paper can be also treated as an overture in realizing intelligent railway systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
