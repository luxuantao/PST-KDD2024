<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robust Simultaneous Detection of Coronary Borders in Complex Images</head><p>Milan Sonka, Michael D. Winniford, and Steve M. Collins Abstract-Visual estimation of coronary obstruction severity from angiograms suffers from poor inter-and intraobserver reproducibility and is often inaccurate. In spite of the widely recognized limitations of visual analysis, automated methods have not found widespread clinical use, in part because they too frequently fail to accurately identify vessel borders. We have developed a robust method for simultaneous detection of left and right coronary borders that is suitable for analysis of complex images with poor contrast, nearby or overlapping structures, or branching vessels. The reliability of the simultaneous border detection method and that of our previously reported conventional border detection method were tested in 130 complex images, selected because conventional automated border detection might be expected to fail. Conventional analysis failed to yield acceptable borders in 69130 or 50% of images.</p><p>Simultaneous border detection was much more robust (p &lt; .001) and failed in only 15/130 or 12% of complex images. Simultaneous border detection identified stenosis diameters that correlated significantly better with observer-derived stenosis diameters than did diameters obtained with conventional border detection (p &lt; 0.001). Simultaneous detection of left and right coronary borders is highly robust and has substantial promise for enhancing the utility of quantitative coronary angiography in the clinical setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>ACH year about 1.5 million people in the United States E with coronary artery disease suffer myocardial infarction <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. The death rate from coronary artery disease is in excess of 500 000 per year. Assessment of coronary arterial geometry is central to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, to decisions about pharmacological therapy or coronary artery revascularization with transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, to judgments about the short-and long-term outcome of revascularization procedures, and to assessment of patient prognosis. Although a variety of cardiac imaging techniques are under active development, selective coronary arteriography is the only method capable of accurately depicting the details of coronary anatomy <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Accordingly, coronary angiography has maintained a pivotal role in the evaluation and treatment of patients with coronary disease <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> and hundreds of thousands of coronary angiograms are performed every year in the United States. The vast majority of these angiograms are interpreted visually. The shortcomings of visual analysis have prompted leading clinical investigators to call for the use of quantitative coronary angiography for assessing coronary obstruction severity in routine patient care [2], [5]- <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. A very substantial amount of research has been directed at the development of semiautomated and automated methods for defining coronary arterial borders and calculating indices of lesion severity and physiologic significance [9]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the widely recognized limitations of visual assessment of lesion severity, most patient management decisions continue to be based on visual assessment of percent diameter stenosis [2], <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. An important reason for the poor clinical acceptance of quantitative coronary angiography is its limited reliability in clinical use. Currently available automated border detection techniques often fail to accurately identify vessel borders in complex images with poor contrast, nearby or overlapping structures, or branching vessels. Current methods fail in part because they separately identify the left and right coronary borders. The resulting borders may individually be consistent with local image gradients but be unreasonable when considered as a pair. We have previously reported a formulation of the border detection problem that permits the simultaneous detection of left and right coronary borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. This approach is based on the premise that improved border detection accuracy will result when detected borders are optimal when taken as a pair. In a preliminary evaluation in a small number of images, this approach produced coronary borders that were judged to be superior to borders obtained with a method that individually identified the left and right coronary borders. In spite of its promise, our initial method of simultaneously identifying both borders failed to produce acceptable borders in a significant number of complex images. Thus, in the current work, we have sought to develop and evaluate a robust method of coronary border detection based on simultaneous identification of the left and right coronary borders. Our hypothesis was that simultaneous border detection would be substantially more robust than conventional border detection in the analysis of complex images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">RELIABILITY OF QUANTITATIVE CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY</head><p>An enormous amount of research has been directed at the development of quantitative methods for the analysis of coronary angiograms [9]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Both nongeometric (e.g., videodensitometric) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> and geometric approaches have been pursued [9]-[ 171, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Videodensitometric approaches 02784062/95$04.00 0 1995 IEEE are based on the measurement of the total density of contrast material in the vessel lumen and have the important advantage of permitting measurement of lumen cross-sectional area from a single view. Unfortunately, the accuracy of videodensitometry is limited by numerous technical problems, particularly when based on the analysis of cine film and when absolute areas are to be determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. Geometric approaches are based on the identification of coronary borders in one or more views and, while making assumptions about lumen shape, they require fewer assumptions about the image formation process. Perhaps accordingly, more research has focused on development of automated border detection methods than on videodensitometric methods. It is, of course, possible and even advantageous to combine border detection and videodensitometric approaches 1121, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, [ 141.</p><p>The substantial research on quantitative coronary angiography has been motivated by two factors. The first is the extremely important role that assessment of coronary arterial geometry plays in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. In the 35 years since 1959 when Sones introduced selective catheterization of the coronary arteries, coronary angiography has achieved a preeminent position in the armamentarium of the physician caring for the cardiac patient <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Coronary angiography is the definitive method for determining the anatomic basis for patients' symptoms and for guiding decisions about medical or surgical treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. With the dramatic expansion of interventional procedures for treating coronary disease in the catheterization laboratory, the need for robust and readily available measures of lumen geometry has become even more pressing <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Finally, reproducible assessment of coronary anatomy is essential for study of the natural history of the progression and regression of coronary atherosclerosis and the effectiveness of mechanical, dietary, and pharmacologic interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</p><p>The second factor motivating research on quantitative coronary angiography is the severe limitations of the traditional visual approach to assessing lesion severity. Visual assessment of percent stenosis is plagued by high intra-and interobserver variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. The standard deviation in estimation of percent stenosis is about 18%, and a major disagreement occurs between readers in about 31% of vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Illustrative of the poor reproducibility of visual analysis is the finding in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study that when one angiographer reported a stenosis of 50% diameter narrowing or more in the left main coronary artery, a second angiographer reported no lesion in 19% of cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. Moreover, visual assessments are often inaccurate, as demonstrated by comparisons with postmortem anatomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. Lesions with greater than 50% narrowing are overestimated by 15% to 30% diameter stenosis units [2], [4], <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Lesions below 50% narrowing tend to be underestimated. This leads to very substantial overestimation of the improvement in lumen diameter resulting from angioplasty <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Gould calls attention to the 189% error in assessing the average benefit of coronary angioplasty that results from inaccurate visual assessment of pre-and postangioplasty percent stenosis <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Finally, visual estimates of percent diameter stenosis correlate poorly with direct measures of the physiologic significance of coronary obstructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</p><p>As a result of the shortcomings of visual analysis of coronary angiograms, use of quantitative coronary angiography in scientific studies and clinical trials has become the accepted standard. However, quantitative coronary angiography has not achieved widespread acceptance or use in routine patient care [2], <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. There are several explanations for the lack of acceptance of quantitative coronary angiography methods. Some methods are time consuming and require specialized equipment and/or expertise. This is a serious obstacle to routine clinical use since ease and speed of use are essential in a clinical setting <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. No consensus has developed as to the best analysis algorithms [4], <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. Only a few border detection methods have been carefully validated in vivo by comparison to independent geometric and physiologic standards [ 121, [ 141, [ 151, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. While automated border detection methods yield excellent results in investigational settings when applied to high quality images of vessel segments free of vessel overlap and other confounding variables, they often fail when applied to unselected vessel segments in a clinical setting. The limited reliability of quantitative coronary angiography methods in the clinical setting has severely impeded the routine use of these techniques.</p><p>As failure rates for automated border detection techniques are rarely reported in the literature, it is difficult to assess the precise degree to which reliability problems have slowed the clinical acceptance of quantitative coronary angiography. We have previously reported a border detection method that separately identified the left and right coronary borders <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. This method used 2-D graph searching to identify an optimal border based on both local and global image characteristics. We evaluated the performance of this algorithm across a range of image quality by comparison to independent geometric and physiologic standards. Although we believe the method to be representative of the state-of-the-art in coronary border detection, the method failed to find acceptable borders in 6 of 49, or 12%, of images. Our earlier study, like most studies of automated border detection techniques, was based on the analysis of carefully selected images. We analyzed vessels that had a single proximal stenosis or that were normal or nearly normal. Although nearly half of the images we analyzed were judged to have very little contrast or extreme amounts of noise, the failure rate we observed likely underestimates the failure rate of the method in a clinical setting. Gurley et al. recently examined the suitability of quantitative coronary angiography for routine clinical use <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. They analyzed 38 stenoses in digital angiograms from 25 consecutive patients using a commercially available analysis system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. Only definite lesions, defined as vessel segments visually determined by four independent observers to have lumen diameter reductions exceeding 50%, were analyzed. Quantitative coronary angiography successfully traced 20 stenoses but failed in 18/38 stenoses, or 48%. The failures were attributed to stenosis at a bifurcation (72%), diffuse disease with no normal reference segment (44%), excessive vessel tortuosity or overlap (22%), and poor image contrast or under penetration (28%). Gurley et al. concluded that quantitative coronary angiography is unsuitable for routine clinical use and that a practical method of objectively assessing stenosis severity in the clinical setting remains to be developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. Although details as to what constituted an analysis failure were not given and their results may not generalize to other quantitative coronary angiography techniques, clearly the reservations about quantitative coronary angiography expressed by these authors are shared by many clinicians. The critical need for robust quantitative coronary angiography methods and the substantial failure rate of current border detection methods form the impetus for our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">SI~WLTANEOUS CORONARY BORDER DETECTION</head><p>The basic steps in the simultaneous border detection algorithm are: 1) image preprocessing and 3-D graph construction; 2) cost function calculation; 3) multistage identification of the optimal border pair; and 4) calculation of a diameter function. The simultaneous coronary border detection method reported here builds on our previously reported methods for identifying individual coronary borders <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> and pairs of borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. These earlier border detection methods employed preprocessing, graph construction, and diameter function calculation and some cost function calculation steps similar to those described below, and a complete description of these aspects of our new method is available elsewhere [15], 1211. We include here a brief description of these aspects of our current algorithm in order to facilitate understanding of the method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Image Preprocessing and 3-0 Graph Construction</head><p>Using a custom cine-to-film converter, optically magnified cine frames were digitized into a 5 12 x 5 12 image matrix with eight bits of gray scale. The digitization resolution in the object plane was about 60 pdpixel. The vessel segment of interest was manually identified by an observer who traced the vessel segment centerline and entered a point on each side of the vessel to define the width of the region of interest. The traced centerline needed only to approximate the actual centerline and was heavily smoothed using a 5 1-point averaging filter. An edge operator consisting of a weighted combination of a 1 1 x 11 Sobel operator and a 21 x 21 Marr-Hildreth operator was applied to the digitized image (or to the ROI depending upon the computer used) to produce an edge image. The mask sizes and weighting factor were determined empirically from phantom studies [ 151. To facilitate border identification and allow accurate border detection in curved vessels, the resulting "edge image" was resampled along profiles perpendicular to the centerline so as to straighten the artery. The profiles were spaced at intervals of one pixel along the centerline. The resampling process may introduce inaccuracies in the setting of very highly curved vessels with stenoses. The straightened edge image was smoothed in the direction parallel to the vessel centerline.</p><p>A 3-D directed graph was constructed and searched for the optimal coronary borders or path (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Conceptually, an optimal path was defined as the pair of borders that in an overall sense has the greatest probability of corresponding to the actual coronary border pair. In the 3-D graph, nodes in an 2, y plane corresponded to possible positions of the left and right coronary borders for a profile along the centerline defined by the z-coordinate. A node with coordinates ( X I , y1, zl) Three-dimensional graph in which paths correspond to pairs of corresponded to a left border that was 2 1 pixels to the left of the centerline on the profile at z1 and a right border that was y1 pixels to the right of the centerline. A sequence of nodes, one for each z-coordinate, formed a path in the 3-D graph that corresponded to a possible pair of borders. Costs were assigned to each node in the 3-D graph and used to calculate a path cost function that depended on local edge gradient magnitudes and directions in a way that allowed the position of one border to influence the position of the other border. The optimal path was defined as the path with lowest cost.</p><p>The uniform cost search algorithm 1411, 1421 was used to search the 3-D graph for the path with lowest cost. The search process began with a set of start nodes corresponding to the first profile (plane in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) on a list. Each node on the list had an associated partial path cost that depended on the costs of nodes on the path between the start node and the node in question. The node with the smallest partial path cost was removed from the list and checked to see if it was a goal node, i.e., node on the last profile. If it was a goal node, the optimal path had been determined and the search ended. Otherwise, the partial path was extended by adding the possible successors of the node, the partial path costs to the successor nodes were calculated, the successor nodes were placed on the list, and the process repeated. The successors of a node in the 3-D graph were defined as the nine nodes on the adjacent plane corresponding to nine combinations of changes in the positions of the left and right borders with respect to the centerline. Each border could remain at the same distance from the centerline or increase or decrease its distance from the centerline by one pixel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B . Cost Function Calculation</head><p>Central to our approach to identifying optimal borders is the assignment of costs to pairs of candidate borders. The cost of a path in the 3-D graph was defined as the sum of the costs of the nodes forming the path. Costs were assigned to nodes </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">&amp;(z, z ) =EL(Z, z ) -DPL(2, 2 ) f i R ( Y , 2 ) =ER(Y, -DpR(Y, 2 ) ( 3 )</formula><p>where EL(z, 2 ) and ER(^, z ) are straightened edge image values and DPL(x, z ) and D p ~( y , z ) are edge direction penalties (discussed below). X and Y are sets of integers ranging from one to the length of the left and right halves of the vessel profiles, and 2 is the set of integers ranging from one to the length of the vessel centerline.</p><p>The Cs term in the cost function is the sum of the edge costs for the left and right edge candidates and causes the detected borders to "follow" image positions with large gradient values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>It is given by</head><p>The Cpp term in the cost function is useful in cases where one border has higher contrast than the opposite border and serves to cause the position of the low contrast border to be influenced by the position of the high contrast border. It is given by where The w(z, y) component of the cost function incorporates a model of the vessel boundary in a way that causes the positions of the left and right borders to follow certain preferred relative directions with respect to the vessel centerline. This component has the effect of discriminating against borders that, when considered as a pair, are unlikely to correspond to the actual coronary borders. This is accomplished by including a weighting factor that depends on the direction by which a node is reached from its parent. The weighting factor is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">4 x 3 Y) = 1 for ( 2 , Y) E -1, Y -11, (2, a), ( 2 + 1 , $+I)) = a for ( 2 , y) E {(i -1, y), (i + 1, y), ( 2 , b -11, ( 2 , Y + 1)) = P for ( 2 , y) E {(? -1, 5 + l), ( 2 + 1, Y -1))<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where the node at coordinates (z, y) is the successor of the node at (2, 5.) The influence of the vessel model is determined by the values of (Y and p. The larger the values of cx and P, the stronger is the model's influence on the detected borders.</p><p>The PL(z) + PR(z) term in the cost function does not influence the detected border but does substantially improve search efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">) Prior Knowledge About Local Edge Directions:</head><p>To help avoid detection of vessels adjacent to the vessel of interest, we incorporated knowledge about the probable direction of the actual border into the cost function. Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref> shows an example of a straightened coronary image that is divided into top and bottom halves by the straightened centerline. The left and right vessel borders are located in the top and bottom halves, respectively. Most, but not all, of the pixels along both borders have local edge directions that are horizontal and oriented from left to right for the left coronary border and right to left for the right coronary border (Fig. <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref>). Thus, it is appropriate to discriminate in the cost function calculation against pixels whose directions are inconsistent with the known orientation of the vessel borders of interest. Local edge directions ( ( p ~( x , z ) for the top half or left border region and ( p ~( y , z ) for the bottom half or right border region) were calculated using a 3 x 3 Prewitt compass operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. For computational efficiency, the Prewitt operator was applied to the straightened and smoothed edge image. This operator quantizes edge direction into one of eight possible values (Fig. <ref type="figure">2(c)</ref>). Local edge directions may depart from horizontal for a variety of reasons. Vessel borders are rarely straight, stenoses may be present, the centerline may not be positioned precisely at the lumen midline, and the images contain noise. Thus, only those pixels with edge directions outside a range of preferred directions were discriminated against. Empirically, we obtained good results by defining the preferred direc- where penalty was a constant. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a) shows an example of edge costs computed from edge strengths without correction for edge direction in an image of a branching vessel. Shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b</ref>) is the cost image with the edge direction penalty included. Note that the black "islands" of high cost in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b</ref>) correspond to borders of the vessel branch with inappropriate orientation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Multistage Border Detection</head><p>To enhance border detection accuracy, a multistage border identification process was implemented. The goal of the first stage was to reliably identify the approximate borders of the vessel segment of interest while avoiding detection of other structures. Having identified the approximate border positions, the second stage was designed to accurately localize the actual coronary borders. In the first stage, four adjacent pixels in the full-resolution straightened edge image were averaged to produce a half-resolution edge image. The 3-D simultaneous border detection algorithm was then used to identify approximate coronary borders. Since this first stage was designed, in part, to avoid detection of structures other than the vessel of interest, we used a relatively strong vessel model. Vessel boundaries identified in the low-resolution image were mapped into the full-resolution image. The approximate borders were then used in the second stage to guide the search for the optimal borders in the full-resolution cost image. This was accomplished by increasing the edge costs for nodes corresponding to pixels outside a strip of width w centered on the position of the preliminary borders. More formally, C L ( X , z ) and CR(Y, z ) were calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W W CL(z, z ) := CL(z, z ) for x g ( z ) --&lt; x 5 x g ( z ) + 2 - := CL(Z, z ) + s otherwise CR(Y, 2) := CR(Y, z ) for Y B ( ~) --&lt; Y 5 YB(Z) + 2 := CR(Y, z ) + s otherwise</formula><p>where the coordinates ( X b ( z ) , Yb (2)) define the approximate left and right border positions identified in the first stage, s is the cost adjustment value for pixels distant from the firststage borders, and the symbol := represents value assignment.</p><p>A somewhat weaker vessel model (smaller values of (Y and p)</p><p>was used in the second stage.</p><p>W W</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Diameter Function Calculation</head><p>After the optimal border pair was identified in the straightened image space, the detected borders were mapped back into the original image space and smoothed. A diameter function depicting serial diameters along the length of the vessel was calculated and expressed in units of mm by reference to a catheter of known size <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. The minimal lumen diameter and the location of the minimum were automatically determined from the diameter function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS</head><p>To evaluate the reliability of our simultaneous border detection algorithm, we assessed the frequency with which the method failed to yield reasonable borders in complex images in which automated border detection might be expected to fail. We compared the failure rate of our method to the failure rate of a conventional border detection method. In the experiments reported here, we used the following parameters for the simultaneous detection algorithm. To implement multistage border detection, we used 0: = 1.8, /? = 2.2 in the first stage, Q = 1.2, /? = 1.4 in the second stage, a search width of w = 8 pixels, and cost adjustment value s = 20. For incorporating information about edge direction, we set the parameter penalty = 50 in both stages of the search procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Conventional Coronary Border Detection</head><p>Coronary borders were determined using our previously validated method for coronary border detection based on 2-D graph searching principles <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. This method is conventional in that it identifies the left and right coronary borders separately. This method was demonstrated to yield accurate borders by comparison to independent geometric (Brown-Dodge quantitative coronary arteriography) and physiological (intracoronary measures of coronary vasodilator reserve) standards [15]. Moreover, the accuracy of the method was similar in good images and in images with poor contrast or high levels of noise. To allow direct comparison of the conventional and simultaneous border detection methods in the current study, the same vessel centerline and image region of interest were used for both methods. These images were selected from 439 angiograms analyzed in a previous angioplasty restenosis trial. The angiograms in this previous study were acquired before, immediately after, and six months following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). As a part of this trial, all angiograms were analyzed using our previously reported conventional border detection method [ 151, reviewed by an angiographer, and edited as necessary. The 130 images in which some portion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Assessment of Border Detection SuccessJFailure</head><p>An expert angiographer reviewed the digitized cine images with coronary borders detected by one of the two computer methods superimposed. For any given image, the angiographer was unaware of the border detection method employed. The angiographer identified images where automated analysis failed to produce acceptable borders. In this subjective evaluation, a border detection method was considered to have failed in a given image if 1) a portion of the detected border corresponded to a structure other than the vessel segment of interest: 2 ) the presence of a sidebranch caused unacceptable distortion of the detected vessel border; or 3) the detected borders were clinically unreasonable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Objective Measures of Border Detection Accuracy</head><p>To objectively compare coronary borders, we calculated minimal lumen diameters together with three indices of overall border configuration. For comparison with stenosis diameters determined by computer-detected methods in complex images, we measured stenosis diameters from observer-edited coronary borders. These observer-edited borders were defined in a previous clinical study in which our conventional border detection method was used to measure percent diameter stenosis. When the results were reviewed and determined to be in need of correction in that study, the angiographer manually edited portions of the automatically detected borders. The stenosis diameter was automatically determined as the minimal lumen diameter and the stenosis location was defined as the position along the centerline of the minimal lumen diameter.

We also calculated a similarity index defined as the correlation coefficient between individual points on a pair of diameter functions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Study Protocol and Data Analysis</head><p>To evaluate the reliability of our border detection algorithm, coronary borders were identified in 130 complex images using both simultaneous and conventional border detection methods. Although the programs implementing the two border detection methods provide for observer editing of detected borders, no editing was permitted in this study. An experienced angiographer, who was unaware of the analysis method, visually evaluated computer-detected borders to identify those images in which the automated method failed to identify acceptable borders. The detected borders were reviewed in two sets with the analysis method randomly determined for each image in each set. Differences in analysis failure rates for simultaneous and conventional border detection were tested for significance using McNemar's test with Yates correction for continuity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>.</p><p>To examine the accuracy of border detection in complex images, stenosis diameters obtained using the simultaneous and conventional border detection methods were compared to stenosis diameters obtained from observer-edited borders using linear regression analysis. The difference between the correlation coefficients obtained with the two border detection methods was tested for statistical significance using the Fisher's z -transformation and a t-statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. Differences in the regression slopes and intercepts obtained with the two automated methods were tested for statistical significance using a t-statistic. Absolute differences in stenosis diameters derived from computer-determined and observer-defined borders were calculated for the two automated methods and compared using a paired t-test.</p><p>Serial vessel diameters obtained from coronary borders identified by the simultaneous and conventional border detection methods were compared in 43 uncomplicated images. Conventional border detection was previously demonstrated to be accurate in these uncomplicated images by comparison to independent standards [ 151. Pairs of diameter functions were compared using the mean absolute difference, rms difference, and similarity indices. Minimal lumen diameters obtained in uncomplicated images with the two border detection methods were compared using a paired t-test. V. RESULTS</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> summarizes the results of evaluation of the reliability of simultaneous and conventional border detection in complex images. Conventional coronary border detection failed to yield acceptable borders in 65/130, or 50%, of images. Simultaneous border detection failed in only 15/130, or 12%, of images.</p><p>In interpreting these failure rates, it should be noted that they were determined from the analysis of images that were selected because automated analysis was likely to be difficult. Simultaneous border detection was significantly more robust in the analysis of complex images than was conventional border detection (p &lt; .OOl).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows an example of coronary borders detected with our conventional and simultaneous border detection methods in a vessel segment with a closely adjacent vessel with higher contrast. Conventional border detection failed to identify acceptable borders of the vessel of interest while our simultaneous border detection algorithm yielded accurate borders. An example of a vessel with a stenosis located distal to a vessel branch is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. Although conventional border detection was not considered to have failed in this case, simultaneous border detection produced borders that were less influenced by the presence of the vessel branch and that accurately defined the stenosis.</p><p>Stenosis diameters obtained using simultaneous border detection in complex images correlated well (T = 0.89, y = 0.89x+ 0.37) with stenosis diameters derived from observeredited borders (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7(a)</ref>). Stenosis diameters obtained using conventional border detection correlated modestly (T = 0.73, y = 0.68x+ 0.84) with stenosis diameters derived from observer-edited borders (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7(b)</ref>). The difference in the correlation coefficients was highly significant (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Moreover, simultaneous border detection yielded a regression intercept and slope that more closely approximated zero and one, respectively, than did the intercept and slope obtained with conventional border detection (p &lt; 0.005 for both parameters). The mean absolute difference in stenosis diameters calculated from computer-determined and observer-defined borders was 0.26 f 0.32 mm for simultaneous border detection and 0.43 f 0.49 mm for conventional border detection (p &lt; .OOl).</p><p>The overall configuration of borders identified in uncomplicated images using simultaneous border detection closely approximated that obtained with conventional border detection.

Simultaneous border detection produced minimal lumen diameters in uncomplicated images that correlated well (T = 0.98, y = 1.06s-0.10) with those obtained with conventional border detection. The mean difference in minimal lumen diameters was 0.01 f 0.15 mm ('p = 0.69). The mean absolute difference in minimal lumen diameters was 0.08 f 0.12 mm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head><p>A method for simultaneous detection of left and right coronary borders has been presented. The method is highly robust in the analysis of complex images with poor contrast, nearby or overlapping structures, or branching vessels. Simultaneous border detection is much more robust than conventional border detection that relies upon separate identification of left and right coronary borders. This discussion will focus on three areas: 1) reliability of simultaneous coronary border detection; 2) limitations of simultaneous border detection; and 3) experimental design issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Reliability of Simultaneous Coronary Border Detection</head><p>Conventional coronary border detection methods fail in part because they separately identify the left and right coronary borders. Thus, even though the detected position of each border may be quite consistent with local and even global image pattems, the borders when considered as a pair may  Coronary borders identified with conventional (a) and simultaneous be nonsensical. We have formulated the border detection problem in a way that allows both borders to be identified simultaneously. This approach is intended to mimic the border detection strategy of a human observer who will use the position of one border to create and/or confirm hypotheses about the position of the other border. Our simultaneous border detection approach is based on 3-D graph searching principles and detects borders that are optimal when taken as a pair. The approach is based on the premise that there is information in the position of one border that can be exploited to help localize the position of the other border. In an initial report, we showed the potential of this approach to improve the reliability of automated coronary analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. The current study was intended to develop the approach into a robust border detection method and to test the hypothesis that simultaneous detection of both coronary borders would be more robust than would conventional border detection in the analysis of complex images.</p><p>The reliability of our simultaneous border detection method results from two key characteristics of the algorithm. The first is the use of a multistage strategy for identifying coronary borders that is both model-and data-driven. One of the limitations of model-driven image analysis procedures is that the analysis may be influenced to too great an extent by an imperfect model, and thus yield inaccurate results.</p><p>Giving less weight to the model resolves this problem but the analysis may fail completely in complex images where the information in the image data is insufficient to yield an accurate analysis. Thus, selection of model parameters and the relative influence to assign to the model and the image data is often a trade-off between the desire for high reliability and good accuracy. We sought to achieve both goals by using a two-stage analysis procedure. The first stage was intended to identify approximate coronary borders while discriminating against potential borders that were unlikely to correspond to the actual coronary borders. Having identified the approximate positions of the borders, the second stage was designed to accurately localize the coronary borders. To achieve computational efficiencies, and given that the first stage was not designed to identify borders with high accuracy, we used a low-resolution edge image in the first stage. Because the goals of the two processing stages differed, we employed somewhat different cost functions in the two stages in order to obtain both good reliability and good accuracy. The influence of the model was greater in the first stage, while the influence of the image data was greater in the second stage.</p><p>The second characteristic contributing to the reliability of our border detection method is the nature of the cost function used to define the optimal border pair. The cost function we used resulted from considerable experimentation and was a nonlinear combination of the edge costs associated with image pixels on the left and right vessel borders. The edge costs were related to local edge strength corrected for edge direction. The correction for edge direction was designed to help address a particularly vexing problem in the analysis of coronary angiograms-the presence of structures with high contrast adjacent to the vessel segment of interest. In effect, we took advantage of prior knowledge about the expected orientation of the border to be detected. This was accomplished by reducing the edge strength of pixels with "inappropriate" edge directions by subtracting an edge direction penalty. We used a Prewitt compass operator to calculate local edge direction. Because of the influence of image noise and since the actual border orientation varies somewhat about its general direction, we reduced the edge strength only when the associated edge direction fell outside a range centered on the expected border direction. The effectiveness of this approach was determined empirically to be insensitive to the exact value of the edge direction penalty.</p><p>One method of avoiding the detection of parallel vessels is to carefully define a vessel region of interest that excludes adjacent structures. While this approach is generally effective, it may require additional operator time and/or experience and may increase inter-and intraobserver variability. It clearly is unworkable for vessel segments of the type depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Finally, this approach is unsatisfactory in the presence of branching vessels since a variable amount of the branch vessel will always be included in the region of interest, no matter how narrowly the region is defined. It has been our experience that the reliability of conventional border detection methods is very sensitive to the inclusion of adjacent structures, and thus quite dependent upon the precise definition of the region of interest. Although we have not conducted a formal study of the matter, our experience demonstrates that simultaneous border detection approach is quite insensitive to the care with which vessel regions of interest are defined.</p><p>The principal advantage of simultaneous border detection relates to its improved reliability compared to conventional methods in images where the information contained in local edge gradients is not sufficient to identify border positions. Images with very poor contrast, high levels of noise, nearby or overlapping structures, or branching vessels all present particular difficulties for conventional border detection methods that separately identify the left and right borders. In this study, we examined the relative performance of simultaneous and conventional border detection in a large set of such images. While conventional analysis failed in 50% of the images, our simultaneous border detection method failed in only 12%. The reduction in failure rate was highly significant. It is worth remembering that the images we analyzed were selected because they were expected to be difficult to analyze. Thus, the failure rates of both conventional and simultaneous border detection should both be less in an unselected set of images. The relative advantage of simultaneous border detection is likely to remain, however, since simultaneous and conventional border detection yield similar results in uncomplicated images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Limitations of the Simultaneous Border Detection Method</head><p>The simultaneous border detection algorithm has a number of limitations. In its current implementation, the operator must define two points within the vessel, one at the proximal end and the other at the distal end of the vessel segment of interest. In curvilinear vessel segments, entry of an additional point or two might be required. An additional two points, one on either side of the vessel, serve to define the width of the vessel region of interest. Even though the centerline is heavily smoothed, the use of an observer-defined centerline contributes to inter-and intraobserver variability. Some manual interaction is inevitable, if for no other reason than to define the vessel segment of interest. More fully automated centerline definition methods than the one we use exist and might be incorporated into the simultaneous detection algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. The reliability of automated centerline detection methods in complex images is unknown.</p><p>Automated coronary border detection methods use the vessel centerline for a number of purposes beyond defining the region of interest. Most commonly, these include defining profiles perpendicular to the centerline for calculation of 1 -D edge gradients, insuring that only a single border point per profile is detected, enforcing border continuity, and for calculation of vessel diameters [ 113, [20], <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Our border detection method uses the centerline for the latter three purposes, but does not depend upon the centerline for calculation of edge gradients. It thus has the advantage of including edge information from borders of all orientations. This information is particularly useful in detecting irregular borders. In general terms, the dependence of our border detection method upon the observer-defined centerline is similar to that of other automated methods. However, our method incorporates a vessel model that specifies preferred relative directions of the left and right borders. As these directions are defined with respect to the centerline, our border detection method depends on the centerline in a way that other methods do not. The influence of this potential problem on the detected borders is diminished by use of a two-stage search process with differing cost functions in the two stages. In practical terms, the sensitivity of our method to the exact position of the centerline is slight and the benefits of using the vessel model far outweigh the drawback of slightly increased sensitivity to centerline position.</p><p>Another limitation of our simultaneous border detection method is the difficulty in identifying accurate lumen borders when abrupt or "shelf' stenoses are present. Such lesions are thought to be due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaque or partially occlusive intraluminal thrombi and are common in patients with unstable angina <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. The requirement that a single border point be identified on each profile perpendicular to the centerline is the basic source of the difficulty in identifying abrupt and shelf lesions. However, in other types of lesions, this requirement is very useful in facilitating accurate border detection and improving both the speed and reliability of analysis. Our method shares this requirement with the great majority of other border detection methods [ 101, <ref type="bibr">[ 113, [ 151, 1161, [20]</ref>, 1441, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, 1471. Several approaches that do not define the coronary border as a sequence of points, one per profile, have been reported <ref type="bibr">[171, [481, [491.</ref> In comparison to conventional approaches, simultaneous border detection provides particular advantages in the anal-ysis of vessel segments that include a branch. Nonetheless, branching vessels remain difficult to analyze and give rise to analysis failures when stenoses are located at the junction of a branch with the parent vessel. Unfortunately, the alterations in blood flow pattems in the vicinity of branch points frequently result in stenoses being located just distal to a branch point. Thus, improvement in border detection in vessel segments with branches is an area that requires further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C . Experimental Design Issues</head><p>There are several aspects of our experimental design that deserve mention. The principal motivation for our work has been to improve the reliability of automated border detection in complex images with poor contrast, nearby or overlapping structures, or branching vessels. In such images, simultaneous border detection offers substantial advantages in comparison to conventional border detection. In uncomplicated images with good vessel contrast and low noise, simultaneous border detection yields borders that are very similar to those obtained with conventional methods. In the current study, we focused on demonstrating the improved reliability of simultaneous border detection. Accordingly, we evaluated the analysis failure rates of simultaneous and conventional border detection in a large set of complex images. Although it was not our purpose to rigorously assess the accuracy of simultaneous border detection in comparison to independent standards, we did compare stenosis diameters obtained with simultaneous and conventional border detection to stenosis diameters derived from observer-edited borders. As one would expect given its much reduced failure rate, simultaneous border detection yielded stenosis diameters that correlated much better with observer-derived stenosis diameters than did conventional border detection. It is worth noting in this regard that the observer-edited borders do not represent a completely independent standard since they consist, in part, of unedited portions of borders that resulted from conventional border analysis. Moreover, when asked to review computer-detected borders, observers are often inclined to presume that the computer borders are correct and to only edit borders that are clearly unreasonable.</p><p>Our comparison of the reliability of simultaneous and conventional border detection was based on the assessment of analysis failure rates. Recognizing that in this context the word "failure" is a fairly imprecise term, we took care while designing the study to develop specific written criteria for an analysis failure. To avoid any possible bias, images were randomized by analysis method and the angiographer was "blinded" to the analysis method. The specific definition of failure we used undoubtedly influenced the absolute failure rates we obtained with simultaneous and conventional border detection. However, our conclusion that simultaneous border detection is significantly more robust than conventional border detection should be relatively insensitive to the precise definition of an analysis failure.</p><p>In interpreting the results of our study, it should be noted that analysis failure rates depend on the definition of the vessel segment region of interest. As the region of interest becomes larger and includes additional structures besides the vessel segment of interest, failure rates will increase. Conventional border detection is particularly sensitive to the size of the region of interest. To control for this factor, we used the same region of interest for both simultaneous and conventional border detection. To avoid biasing our study in favor of simultaneous border detection by using "large" regions of interest, we used regions of interest defined in an earlier restenosis study that employed conventional border detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>Even though the shortcomings of visual assessment of coronary obstruction severity from angiograms are widely recognized, quantitative coronary angiography methods are rarely employed in routine patient care. This is due, in substantial part, to the fact that automated border detection methods too frequently fail to identify accurate borders, particularly in complex images. Existing border detection methods fail, in part, because they separately identify the left and right coronary borders. The method presented here for simultaneous identification of both coronary borders takes advantage of a priori clinical knowledge about border pairs. The method is highly robust and has substantial promise for enhancing the utility of quantitative coronary angiography in the routine care of patients.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>t x 4 Fig. 1 .</head><label>41</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. coronary borders.</figDesc></figure>
