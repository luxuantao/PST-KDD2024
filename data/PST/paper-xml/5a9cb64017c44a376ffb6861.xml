<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In order to find effective solution methods to optimization problems, many researchers have tried to propose new algorithms and/or improve the existing methods. There are many optimization problems, which are extremely difficult to solve, and scholars and researchers have investigated new methods to deal with them. To cope with these problems, useful strategies have been implemented in numerical optimization algorithms to obtain the global optimum.</p><p>If an optimization problem has an unknown search space, the resulting solution may depend on the selection of an initial point <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In these kinds of problems, search space grows rapidly while the dimensions of the problem are increased. Hence, it is widely debated that classical optimization methods do not determine an optimum solution in reasonable time. Mirjalili <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> discussed the reasons why metaheuristic algorithms have become notably common.</p><p>Plainness, flexibility, derivative-free mechanism, and local optima avoidance are the four main reasons, which motivate scholars to use metaheuristic algorithms. There are many metaheuristic algorithms proposed to solve optimization problems. A wide range of complex problems such as scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, data clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, image and video processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, tuning of neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, bin packing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, portfolio selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> have been efficiently solved using metaheuristic algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>The growth in the number of evolutionary optimization techniques and metaheuristic algorithms have been impressive. Metaheuristic algorithms combine some deterministic and random behavior to emulate natural phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. One of the most common evolutionary optimization techniques is the genetic algorithm (GA) proposed by Holland <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and further developed by Goldberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. There are many other evolutionary optimization methods proposed in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Metaheuristic algorithms have been classified in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. The main branch of metaheuristic algorithms can be classified into four categories including stochastic, evolutionary, physical, and swarm algorithms.</p><p>Stochastic optimization algorithms use randomness to perform non-deterministic behaviors, generally different from purely deterministic procedures. The well-known algorithms in this category are local search (LS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, random search <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, adaptive random search (ARS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, stochastic hill climbing (SHC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, hill climbing (HC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, iterated local search (ILS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, guided local search (GLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, variable neighborhood search (VNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, tabu search (TS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, reactive tabu search (RTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and vortex search algorithm (VSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, researchers try to embed local search mechanism into the framework of populationbased evolutionary algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Evolutionary algorithms concerned with computational methods belong to the evolutionary computation field of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The most famous algorithm in this category is Genetic Algorithm, which is known as the basis of many other metaheuristic algorithms. The other algorithms in this category are evolution strategies (ES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, evolutionary programming (EP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, differential evolution (DE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, fast evolutionary programming (FEP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, grammatical evolution (GE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, gene expression programming (GEP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, adaptive dimensional search (ADS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, adaptive differential evolution (ADE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, interior search algorithm (ISA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, opposition-based algorithm (OBA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and stochastic fractal search (SFS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Physical algorithms are those inspired by a physical process <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The inspiring physical systems range from metallurgy, music, the interplay between culture and evolution, science (chemistry, physics, mathematics), and complex dynamic systems. In general, a physical algorithm is a combination of local (neighborhood-based) and global search techniques. The most famous algorithm in this category is simulated annealing (SA). This algorithm is also called the threshold algorithm which belongs to the category of local search algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p><p>It is believed that SA is generally adapted from the Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo algorithm. Similar to the GA, a large variety of extensions and specialization of methods, not limited to parallel simulated annealing, fast simulated annealing, and adaptive simulated annealing, is branched from the SA which are extensively used in different optimization problems. The other algorithms of this category include fields of forces (FOF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, charged system search (CSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, ray optimization algorithm (ROA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, optics inspired optimization (OIO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, galaxy-based search algorithm (GbSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, electromagnetism algorithm (EMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, BB-BC <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, colliding bodies optimization (CBO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, and harmony search (HS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.

The most well-known algorithm in the area of swarm intelligence is particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is based on the behavior of the flock of birds <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. From the viewpoint of initializing with a population of random solutions, PSO is similar to GA. Another well-known algorithm in this category is ant colony optimization (ACO) introduced by Dorigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Based on group behavior and some artificial physical processes, in this paper, an optimization algorithm namely Volleyball Premier League (VPL) is introduced. Moosavian <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref> and Kashan <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[109]</ref> proposed two algorithms inspired by characteristics of sport. We have been inspired by the general ideas and rules defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[109]</ref>. We have also specified some new metaphors and terms, which are related to volleyball. Our novel algorithm is inspired, in its core concept, by simulation of activities in a volleyball game. The proposed algorithm is truly different from the other algorithms in the literature.</p><p>The remaining structure of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Volleyball Premier League (VPL) algorithm. Section 3 covers experiments and results of comparing VPL with other well-known algorithms. Section 4 is devoted to experiments with test functions and applications from engineering design problems. Finally, the article is summarized and concluded in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The VPL Algorithm</head><p>The proposed VPL algorithm mimics the interactive behavior among teams in a volleyball league. It also captures the coaching decisions during a match. The main inspiration of the proposed algorithm is expressed first, and then, the mathematical model is presented.</p><p>Over one hundred years ago, in 1895, William G. Morgan introduced a new game called Mintonette. In 1896, this game changed its name to volleyball because of the volleying nature of the game <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[110]</ref>. In a match, a net separates two teams of six players. In order to gain a point, each team must ground the ball on the other team's court under some regulated rules.</p><p>The match progressed as follows: a player on one side starts a rally by trying to serve the ball over the net and other team's court. The rally will continue until a team performs a fault, and then a point will be awarded to another team.</p><p>The head coach of a team submits the team's starting lineup to the second referee. To start a rally, all players are set on the court. Typically, three players are assigned to the front-row and the others are placed in the back-row. The typical position of members of teams in the court is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.</p><p>Each team can form its own special lineup according to its players. The coach usually stands near the court to lead players during the match. Substitutes sit on the bench while they are informed and trained by the coach and analysts. They are also ready to play in the match if needed. As it is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>, there are three different interactions between team</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>members and the coach. In order to capture these interactions, novel operators are implemented in the proposed algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Solution Representation</head><p>As it was mentioned before, team members are grouped as players, substitutes, and the coach.</p><p>The special feature of the proposed algorithm is the solution representation structure, which is generally different from any other metaheuristic algorithms. The solution representation consists of two segments named the active and the passive parts. The active part represents the main formulation of each team, which includes six active players. The fitness function for each solution is computed according to this part. The passive part holds some variables, to present special inspiration rules, like substitution strategy. In reality, a substitute can occupy the position of the player who is leaving the court according to the head coach's decision. This action is called substitution that is authorized by referees.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2</ref> shows the relationship between the special structure of the team and the solution representation of the algorithm. As it can be seen, the active part is defined based on the team formation, while the passive part of the solution is determined based on the substitutes. The team leader (coach) decisions can manipulate, directly or indirectly, both active and passive parts of the solution representation.</p><p>A team formation determines the general style of the team on the court. Generally, three standard formations are used in volleyball, namely the "4-2", "2-4" and "5-1" formations. A formation "H-S" refers to the number of hitters (H) and setters (S) players, respectively. The coach decides the formation in accordance with the team circumstances. Rationally, different formations can be used depending on whether a team wants to play more offensive or defensive. Therefore, a coach must find the best formation, which is the outcome of the type and the quality of available active players and substitutes. Hence, the formation and substitutes may be changed during a match, based on the coach approach and knowledge. In VPL, it is assumed that a team has the same number of active players and substitutes. The structure of the solution representation is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>In a regular volleyball league, many factors affect the match results. To reach a general idea to implement the algorithm, the following assumptions are made in the algorithm design process:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p> The result of each match is not foreknown. It means that any result can be seen at the end of a match. Therefore, it is possible that one of the weakest teams beats the top team in the league.</p><p> The term ''team power" is defined to emphasize the fact that it is more likely that the stronger team defeats its opponent.</p><p> A team pays attention to its forthcoming game and does not consider any other future games. In respect to the previous results, the new lineup of each team in the court is based on the analysis of the current team power and the chance to win the match.</p><p> When team i defeats team j, any strength that helped team i to win will be considered as the weakness of team j. This means a weakness is defined as the lack of a special strength.</p><p>The main steps of the Volleyball Premier League (VPL) are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>We use the term "league" to represent the population concept. In addition, the term "number of seasons" is used as the current iteration number. A team represents a solution, such that team i represents the ith member of the population (league). The term "week" is used to represent league schedule, which will be explained in the next sub-section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Initialization</head><p>Similar to the other optimization algorithms, VPL algorithm starts with the initialization of the teams which represents the set of initial solutions to the problem. As we mentioned above, each team has two main properties, formation and substitutes. The initial set of teams is defined by 𝑇𝐸𝐴𝑀 0 with the population of 𝑁𝑇 teams, where 𝑁𝑇 denotes the number of teams (population size) in each season. Initially, let 𝑋 𝑗 𝑓 and 𝑋 𝑗 𝑠 be the formation and the substitute properties of the 𝑗th variable which are assigned random numbers between lower and upper bounds of each variable using Eqs (1) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑋 𝑗 𝑓 = 𝑙𝑏 𝑗 + 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑() × (𝑢𝑏 𝑗 -𝑙𝑏 𝑗 )<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑋 𝑗 𝑠 = 𝑙𝑏 𝑗 + 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑() × (𝑢𝑏 𝑗 -𝑙𝑏 𝑗 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>𝑙𝑏 𝑗 and 𝑢𝑏 𝑗 are lower bound and upper bound of the variable 𝑗, respectively. 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑() is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1. The main properties of initial solutions are demonstrated with matrices 𝐹 and 𝑆, where the number of rows and columns indicate the number of teams (𝑁𝑇) and the number of dimensions, respectively. The value</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>for 𝑁𝑇 can be set wisely, while the number of dimensions is identical to the number of variables. The matrices representing formation and substitutes properties of teams are defined according to Eq (3) Eq (4), respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝐹 = [ 𝑋 1,1 𝑓 𝑋 1,2 𝑓 ⋯ 𝑋 1,𝑗 𝑓 𝑋 2,1 𝑓 𝑋 2,2 𝑓 … 𝑋 2,𝑗 𝑓 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 𝑋 𝑖,1 𝑓 𝑋 𝑖,2 𝑓 … 𝑋 𝑖,𝑗 𝑓 ] (3) 𝑆 = [ 𝑋 1,1 𝑠 𝑋 1,2 𝑠 ⋯ 𝑋 1,𝑗 𝑠 𝑋 2,1 𝑠 𝑋 2,2 𝑠 … 𝑋 2,𝑗 𝑠 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 𝑋 𝑖,1 𝑠 𝑋 𝑖,2 𝑠 … 𝑋 𝑖,𝑗 𝑠 ]<label>(4)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Match Schedule</head><p>In a typical sports tournament, there is a need for a games schedule. In recent years, sports scheduling has become a research area in operations research and computer science communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[111]</ref>. In order to have an optimized solution, it is required for a metaheuristic algorithm to generate game schedules. We use the single round robin (SRR) method to generate the league's schedule, artificially. In this step, each team faces the other teams exactly once in a single round. There is a reiteration of action whenever the same pair of teams face each other twice in two consecutive rounds. If the number of teams is not even, then in each round, one team does not play. In order to have an even number of teams, we can add a dummy team.</p><p>In an SRR tournament, a team plays against all the other teams. There is a systematic approach to schedule a round robin tournament. We use a simple procedure named the polygon method. Let 𝑁 be the number of teams in the tournament and each team plays 𝑁 -1 games. Totally, (𝑁 -1)𝑁/2 games will be played during a tournament. Suppose we have eight teams in the league. In order to run SRR, we draw a regular 𝑁 -1 sided polygon, so that each vertex and the center point symbolize a team. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, horizontal lines link two vertices on the opposite sides of the polygon. Another line is used to link the center point to the vertex on the top. Each line represents a match between the two teams represented by the vertices on the ending point of the line and they will be playing in the first round.</p><p>According to Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, (𝐴, 𝐻), (𝐵, 𝐺), (𝐶, 𝐹) and (𝐶, 𝐹) play in the first round. In order to determine the league schedule in the next round, the polygon is rotated clockwise. The new pairings define round two. This procedure will continue until the polygon returns to its original position (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the typical league schedule for eight teams is shown in </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A-H A-G A-F A-E A-D A-H A-B B-G B-E B-C B-H B-F B-G C-H C-F C-D D-H C-G C-E C-F D-G D-E F-H E-G D-F G-H D-E E-F</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Competition</head><p>Regularly, each team plays one match a week. In a volleyball match, there is no draw and the results for a team is either win or lose. To determine the winning team, 3 to 5 sets are played.</p><p>A set is played until a team gains 25 points, on the condition that there is at least a two-point margin of victory. The winning team is chosen by acquiring three-out-of-five sets in the match. If a fifth set is played, the team that scores 15 points first is the winner, in the similar condition of sets with 25 points.</p><p>In order to determine the winning team in a competition, we present mathematical equations expressing for a team the chance of winning and the power to win the match. We suppose that the relationship among power of each team resulted from linear equations. Here we suppose that competitions among teams are idealized, and there are no unpredictable factors that have an effect on the match result. In order to determine the strength of each team in a week and the formation of the team 𝑖 defined as 𝑋 𝑖 𝑓 , we introduce team power index as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝜑(𝑖) = 𝑓(𝑋 𝑖 𝑓 ) 𝑍<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝑍 = ∑ 𝑓(𝑋 𝑖 𝑓 ) 𝑛 𝑖=1<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Where 𝜑(𝑖) indicates the power index for the team 𝑖, 𝑓(𝑋 𝑖 𝑓 ) the fitness value of team 𝑖 is computed from its formation and 𝑍 indicates the total sum of fitness values in a week. Eq <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> implies that the team power is proportional to the fitness value of all teams. The stronger the team, the higher the value of 𝜑(𝑖). Since each team is measured according to its weight, the chance of winning a match can be calculated using the fitness value. Let us consider two</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>teams 𝑗 and 𝑘 playing in a match, with their formations 𝑋 𝑗 𝑓 and 𝑋 𝑘 𝑓 , respectively. So, the power index for teams are computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">𝜑(𝑗) = 𝑓(𝑋 𝑗 𝑓 ) 𝑍<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">𝜑(𝑘) = 𝑓(𝑋 𝑘 𝑓 ) 𝑍<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Let 𝑝(𝑗, 𝑘) indicates the probability that team 𝑗 wins the match.

After determining the winner of the match, to set a new formation, strategies for winner and loser teams are applied. Knowledge sharing, repositioning, and substitution are the three strategies which can be considered for a losing team, whilst the winning team can use the leading role strategy.</p><p>According to the aforementioned explanation in analyzing each match, the procedure of competition is as shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Knowledge Sharing Strategy</head><p>The volleyball coach has a remarkable effect on the team performance during a match. He is responsible for coaching players. He usually assesses players' skills during a match and assigns team positions. One of the most prominent tasks of a coach is to analyze the performance of his team members and the opposing players during a match. Based on the analysis, he makes an update on the teams technical and tactical knowledge related to the match. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>, a coach shares his knowledge with players and substitutes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>Coaches usually use a temporal analysis concerning the duration of the rallies, breaks and sets and train players and substitutes during the match. We named these activities as knowledge sharing which may help a losing team to perform better in the match. The mathematical formulations of this strategy are shown below: </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">𝑋 𝑗 𝑓 (</formula><p>Where 𝜆 𝑓 and 𝜆 𝑠 are coefficients of formation and substitutes, respectively. 𝑟 1 and 𝑟 2 are random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. 𝛿 𝑘𝑠 indicates the rate of knowledge sharing in each team.

Having all the notations and formulas of knowledge sharing strategy been defined, pseudo-code for knowledge sharing strategy is shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.</p><p>Coaching for a game can be done in two ways: match coaching and developmental coaching.</p><p>Obviously, the main goal of a coach is to win a match. Developmental coaching emphasizes on the players development through the reinforcement of basic skills during exercises known as drills. A coach designs drills that simulate match situations thereby encouraging speed of movement, anticipation, timing, communication, and team-work, aiming to meet the strategic requirements of the team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Repositioning Strategy</head><p>In the volleyball game, each position determines what a player should to do on the court during a match. Players have a list of duties and they are going to make the highest possible of coordination to make the best result. Roles include middle blocker, outside hitter, libero, setter, and opposite. Coaches try to put the most suitable player in each role in order to gain the best performance in the league. Because of some difficulties, such as shortage of financial resources, teams may not afford to recruit all the desired players. So they have to use current</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>players and attempt to enhance their performance during league matches. Players are trained under the coaching leadership so that they are skilled to play various roles. Hence, players can be assigned to different positions during a match. We call this procedure as repositioning strategy such that a team changes positions of active players to gain a better performance. A possible use of repositioning strategy is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref> where the left team swaps the positions of the players 2 with 4. As it is shown, this strategy can be applied on substitution bench, as well.</p><p>For each losing team, we will perform this procedure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Substitution Strategy</head><p>Substitution is a special process in volleyball games in which the head coach replaces players on the bench with ones on the court. Contrary to a game like football, there is no limitation on the number of substitution, so this process can be chosen after each rally. Coaches must analyze players who can play well and the combinations that play well together to maximize the team success. During the match, a substitute may be swapped by another substitute or by a player who is currently a member of substations. One of the most important duties of a</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>coach is to choose a good substitution strategy which makes different formation by changing players' positions in the substitution process.</p><p>We will use substitution process to have a better search in the algorithm.

In the original version of volleyball rules, there were no regulations concerning the number of players coming into the game to substitute for other players. Today, teams are limited in the number of substitutions they can make in a match, but we commit the algorithm to follow the original version of volleyball rules, so the number of substitutions is not limited. Let 𝑟 indicates a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1. Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Effects of Various Parameter Settings in VPL</head><p>Many parameters of evolutionary algorithms are defined as static, which means they are not altered while the optimization process is running. An important static parameter is the population size, which is a core concept in many evolutionary algorithms. The disadvantage of setting the parameters static is the lack of flexibility during the search process. So, one of the most challenging stages of implementing an evolutionary algorithm is parameters tuning.</p><p>In this section, we investigate the effect of various settings of control parameters on the performance of VPL. Since it is difficult to analyze and manipulate the effect of all input parameters on the performance of VPL concurrently, we will focus on the main parameters.</p><p>We first examine the effect of different levels of 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 , and then the effects of 𝑁, 𝛿 𝑠𝑡 and 𝛽 will be investigated. In order to evaluate the performance of VPL extensively, an empirical study based on a set of 6 benchmark functions, selected from different categories (F1, F2, F8, F10, F12, F14, and F18) will be discussed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>The promotion and relegation rate are the first two parameters, which are analyzed in this section. To understand how different settings for 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 influence on the performance of VPL, different levels of these parameters are considered. Results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">14</ref>.</p><p>As it is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">14</ref>, different levels of 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 are ranked, such that any level with the best value gets the highest rank. The resulting rankings of different levels of 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 in different test functions are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>.</p><p>Here, most settings make VPL capable to find the global optimum and there is no significant gap in the obtained results. It seems that 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 = 0.05 is the most efficient setting since it has gained the best rank for F8 and F10 and the second rank for F2 and F18 twice. If we calculate the average ranks for all levels, results demonstrate that 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 = 0.5 has the best performance in most cases. It could be seen that 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 = 0.05 and 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 = 0.5 are the proper settings which have better performance, compared with the other settings.</p><p>In order to analyze whether the number of teams has an important effect on the performance of VPL; different levels of the parameter are considered. The obtained results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">15</ref>.</p><p>As it can be clearly seen that 𝑁 = 10 provides efficient results in most cases. According to Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, 𝑁 = 10 has the best ranking in F1, F2, F12 and F18 test functions.

Even though this parameter setting is not simply extracted from this figure, but as it justifies that the average rank indicates a superior performance than the others.</p><p>At the end of this section, we analyze the constant value 𝛽 which indicates the learning phase of the proposed algorithm. We set this constant different levels 1 to 10. It can be simply observed from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">17</ref> that 𝛽 is constant for functions F10 and F14. Ranking of different levels of this parameter for all test functions is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13</ref>.</p><p>The irregular behavior for different levels of 𝛽 can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13</ref>. Apart from the test functions F10 and F14, all levels of the 𝛽 result in obtaining optimum solutions. Results for test functions F8, F12 and F18 are surprisingly similar. There is no special pattern in test functions F1 and F2. However, if we calculate the average ranking of different levels, 𝛽 = 7</p><p>has the best performance.</p><p>Following the above discussion, we can determine the best parameter settings for the proposed algorithm. We use L = 60 and pc = 0.5 in our experiments. It would be generally concluded that proper parameter settings are 𝛿 𝑝𝑟 = 0.05, 𝛿 𝑠𝑡 = 0.54, 𝑁 = 10, and 𝛽 = 7.</p><p>We performed a simple method to tune our algorithm. Therefore, a comprehensive study may be required to find the best parameter setting, which is not the main concern of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Results from Test Functions</head><p>As it was mentioned before, we employ three sets of different problems explained above. In  In order to perform a pairwise comparison, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[114]</ref> was used.</p><p>To this aim, hypothesis test can be used to determine how the algorithm performs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>As shown in</head><formula xml:id="formula_50">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>convergence patterns. In the first pattern, the convergence curve of VPL decreases gradually over the solution process. This behavior is evident in F1 and F6. On the other hand, the algorithm tends to be accelerated while the number of iterations increases, then it sharply dropped. This special pattern is caused by the use of an adaptive mechanism in the learning phase of VPL algorithm. This mechanism leads the algorithm to explore unexplored regions of the search space at the beginning of the solution process and converges toward the optimum point very quickly. This behavior can be seen in F10, F14, F18, and F23.</p><p>In order to show how all search agents (teams) improve their results, the average fitness of all search agents during the optimization process is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">15</ref>. As it is seen, the behavior of average fitness of all agents is remarkably similar to convergence curve (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">14</ref>). The descending trend is quite evident in the convergence curve of VPL. It shows the capability of VPL algorithm in achieving very good results during the solution process.</p><p>The behavior of the search agents in solving test problems is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16</ref>. There are abrupt fluctuations in the early steps of the process, and then it converges toward the best solution. This behavior clearly shows that each team first explores different points in the search space and then moves towards the best solution. It justifies the exploration power of the algorithm. It worth noting that in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">15</ref> all search agents (teams) are remarkably improved despite many fluctuations illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16</ref>.</p><p>Even though this section shows that VPL algorithm is promising to find the global optima of test functions, but there are some differences between benchmark functions and real-world optimization problems. The search space of these two classes of problems is completely different. There is a large number of constraints, both equality, and inequality, in real world problems. Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine the performance of VPL algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems in which the global optimum and search space are complex.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>As an alternative method for solving optimization problems, a novel population-based optimization algorithm is proposed in this research. In the proposed VPL algorithm, each solution is presented as a team in volleyball premier league, where each team tries to achieve the best position in the league table. To achieve that, each team requires updating its position using some special procedures related to the volleyball game. We formulated these behaviors as mathematical expressions. The formation of each team is updated based on its power index. The coach of the team arranges team members according to the situation of the team and the rival arrangement. This is the main point of this algorithm in which exploitation and exploration mechanisms are taken into account using the coaching concept. Another step of this algorithm mimics the competition process where two teams compete to achieve a better position in the league table. The coach also investigates the rival team's strengths and weaknesses, and usually, focuses on the best teams in the league to try to learn from their capabilities. We use this concept as the learning phase of the algorithm, in which teams update their properties according to top teams.</p><p>Additionally, two new mechanisms, namely season transfer, and promotion and relegation process, have been embedded in the algorithm to enhance similarity of VPL algorithm with its original concept. These two mechanisms improve the algorithm performance. Moreover, the effect of the control parameters on the performance of VPL was examined via implementing a comprehensive computational experiment, and then several experiments were done in order to verify the performance of VPL algorithm. Firstly, the set of well-known test problems including unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimension multimodal were employed As we mentioned before, our proposed approach has been inspired by the general ideas and rules defined by two recently algorithms named LCA and SCL. In those algorithms, some common operators used to achieve better exploitation and exploration. To determine how these methods compete against each other, we investigate the main differences between operators.</p><p>All the other algorithms (except VPL) use similar solution structure, which is very different from the structure used in VPL. In addition, the other two algorithms use league size as one of the main parameters to determine typical population size as used in many population-based meta-heuristic algorithms. Similarly, they perform the same procedure, single round robin (SRR), to obtain league schedule. With regard to enhancing the exploitation and exploration in search space, promotion and regulation are also performed in all considered algorithms with the general framework known in sports. In VPL, we designed a winner strategy process to determine winner team while imitation an SWOT analyses applied in SCL and LCA, respectively. The authors of this article strongly believe that main advantage of the proposed algorithm comes from the learning phase, making all teams follow the top three teams. This operator mimics the analysis that the coach uses to determine what the leading teams in the league do to have an ideal performance. To our best of knowledge, the concept of this operator has not been applied in any other metaheuristic algorithm, yet. The learning phase creates an extensive searching range for the proposed algorithm in comparison with its rivals.</p><p>The source code of VPL is publicly available at bitbucket.org/salimifard/vpl.</p><p>The authors would like to extend VPL theory and applications in the future researches.    . . .    <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) F( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">10</ref>) F( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">14</ref>) F( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">18</ref>) F( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">23</ref>) Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16</ref>: Trajectory of the first variable of the first search agent when solving the test problems   </p><formula xml:id="formula_62">A-H A-G A-F A-E A-D A-H A-B B-G B-E B-C B-H B-F B-G C-H C-F C-D D-H C-G C-E C-F D-G D-E F-H E-G D-F G-H D-E E-F</formula><formula xml:id="formula_63">A-H A-G A-F A-E A-D A-H A-B B-G B-E B-C B-H B-F B-G C-H C-F C-D D-H C-G C-E C-F D-G D-E F-H E-G D-F G-H D-E E-F Table 4</formula><p>: pseudo-code of competition between team i and team j Function Competition (i, j) Calculate 𝜑(𝑖) and 𝑍 using Eqs ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>), Calculate 𝑝(𝑖, 𝑗) using Eq (9), Generate 𝑟 ∈ [0, 1], If 𝑝(𝑖, 𝑗) ≤ 𝑟 team 𝑖 is the winner and team 𝑗 is the loser, Else team 𝑗 is the winner and team 𝑖 is the loser, End if apply winning strategy for the winner, apply losing strategies for the loser, End Table <ref type="table">5</ref>: pseudo-code for knowledge sharing strategy For k=1 : 𝑁 𝑘𝑠 Select randomly a position For j=1 to 𝐽 Update position j of formation property using Eq <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, Update position j of substitutes property using Eq (13), End For End For                  </p><formula xml:id="formula_64">(𝑥) = ( 1 500 + ∑ 1 𝑗 + ∑ (𝑥 𝑖 -𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ) 6 2 𝑖=1 25 𝑗=1 ) -1 2 [-65,65] 1 𝑓 15 (𝑥) = ∑ [𝑎 𝑖 - 𝑥 1 (𝑏 𝑖 2 + 𝑏 𝑖 𝑥 2 ) 𝑏 𝑖 2 + 𝑏 𝑖 𝑥 3 + 𝑥 4 ] 2 11 𝑖=1 4 [-5,5] 0.00030 𝑓 16 (𝑥) = 4𝑥 𝑖 2 -2.1𝑥 1 4 + 1 3 𝑥 1 6 + 𝑥 1 𝑥 2 -4𝑥 2 2 + 4𝑥 2 4 2 [-5,5] -1.0316 𝑓 17 (𝑥) = (𝑥 2 - 5.1 4𝜋 2 𝑥 1 2 + 5 𝜋 𝑥 1 -6) 2 + 10 (1 - 1 8𝜋 ) 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥 1 ) + 10 2 [-5,5] 0.398 𝑓 18 (𝑥) = [1 + (𝑥 1 + 𝑥 2 + 1) 2 (19 -14𝑥 1 + 3𝑥 1 2 -14𝑥 2 + 6𝑥 1 𝑥 2 + 3𝑥 2 2 )].
