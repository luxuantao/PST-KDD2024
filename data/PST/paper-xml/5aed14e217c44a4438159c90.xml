<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Business to Business (B2B) marketing aims at meeting the needs of other businesses instead of individual consumers, and thus entails management of more complex business needs than consumer marketing. The buying processes of the business customers involve series of different marketing campaigns providing multifaceted information about the products or services. While most existing studies focus on individual consumers, little has been done to guide business customers due to the dynamic and complex nature of these business buying processes. To this end, in this paper, we focus on providing a unified view of social and temporal modeling for B2B marketing campaign recommendation. Along this line, we first exploit the temporal behavior patterns in the B2B buying processes and develop a marketing campaign recommender system. Specifically, we start with constructing a temporal graph as the knowledge representation of the buying process of each business customer. Temporal graph can effectively extract and integrate the campaign order preferences of individual business customers. It is also worth noting that our system is backward compatible since the participating frequency used in conventional static recommender systems is naturally embedded in our temporal graph. The campaign recommender is then built in a low-rank graph reconstruction framework based on probabilistic graphical models. Our framework can identify the common graph patterns and predict missing edges in the temporal graphs. In addition, since business customers very often have different decision makers from the same company, we also incorporate social factors, such as community relationships of the business customers, for further improving overall performances of the missing edge prediction and recommendation. Finally, we have performed extensive empirical studies on real-world B2B marketing data sets and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of the campaign recommendations for challenging B2B marketing tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>B USINESS-TO-BUSINESS (B2B) marketing involves market- ing of one company product or service to another company, the business customers. The B2B market is the largest of all the markets, and exceeds the consumer market in dollar value. These marketing campaigns help in every layer of the sales funnel, all the way to the final goal of increasing and expediting conversions and boosting profits. Success of the B2B marketing always lies in choosing the right campaigns and the right timing. Today most of such decisions are made by marketers based on experience. However, as business grows, number of marketing campaigns as well as business customers could increase to a daunting level for humans to handle. For example, in our collected B2B marketing data from a Fortune 500 software company, one business marketer offered 24,125 marketing campaigns to 2,119 customers, each with a unique series of campaigns, from January 2013 to December 2014. Offering and managing campaigns at such volume on such a large customer base poses a significant labor and financial burden on the marketers. There is a critical need for an automated process to provide guidance and improve efficiency. Therefore, we propose a B2B marketing campaign recommender system, which can not only reduce the burden and cut costs, but also better serve customer needs and lead to better marketing performance.</p><p>Developing such a B2B marketing campaign recommender system, however, is a nontrivial task. The buying processes in B2B markets usually involve series of different marketing campaigns providing multi-faceted information to multiple decision makers with different focal points and motivations. These processes are naturally dynamic and complex. As a result, to recommend the right campaign at the right time, it is important to identify the customer behavior patterns hidden in the buying processes, so as to meet the dynamically changing information needs of the business customers. More specifically, we summarize the unique challenges for providing recommendation for "Next Campaign To Run" (NCTR) in B2B marketing as follows:</p><p>Temporal Dynamics. During the different stages of the buying process, the business customers often engage in different campaigns for information most relevant to them at that particular point of time. This information is then necessary for them to make further decisions and possible move on to the next stage.</p><p>Therefore the temporal information, especially the temporal correlation/dependency among the marketing campaigns, is very useful for understanding the needs of the customers and modeling the customer behaviors. In other words, temporal-aware models are essential for providing effective marketing campaign recommendations. However, the implicit temporal information is hidden in the noisy buying processes and we need robust statistics to capture the temporal dynamics. Backward Compatibility. By backward compatibility, we mean that the 'latent interest' of each decision maker should still be modeled as in the conventional static recommender system. In conventional movie/product recommender systems, the interaction frequency between the user and item (e.g., movie, product) is often used as the interest indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. We would like to keep this backward compatibility in our B2B marketing campaign recommender system. Therefore, the campaign participating frequency of the business customers should also be modeled, together with temporal dynamics in the buying process. Multiple Decision-Makers. For B2B marketing, there are usually multiple decision makers from the same business/company evaluating the potential products or services from different aspects. Accordingly, the individuals/customers from the same company can form a community, where each individual can have impacts on the behavior preferences of others in the same community. Thus, to provide recommendations potentially expediting the overall conversion cycle, we need to consider not only each individual's own status, but also the overall behavior preferences of his/her colleagues in the same community. In the literature, there have been some related work on the "next-item" recommendation making attempts at some of these challenges we are facing, though mostly from B2C marketing perspective. For example, a factorization framework of Markov chains (FPMC) is proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The idea is to transform the sequential data of each user into a transition matrix and then predict the users next action by factorizing the matrices. Yap et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> search the personalized sequential patterns for next-item recommendation. In addition, Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> consider the temporal intervals between the purchase behaviors to increase the temporal diversity in the recommendations. Generally speaking, these approaches first extract the temporal knowledge to capture the temporal dynamics of user's preference and then integrate the knowledge in the recommender system. Although these methods have been successfully applied in the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) markets, they are not designed for our B2B marketing scenarios: First, the temporal dynamics of individual consumer's preferences on different products are different from the business customers' need on B2B campaigns. In particular, in B2B buying process, different campaigns reveal different levels/facets of information about the same buying process, while such evolution of levels/facets is rare in campaigns for consumer products.</p><p>Second, the existing temporal knowledge representations, such as Markov transition matrix and personalized sequential patterns, are not resistant to noisy behavior records in the complex buying processes. For example, the business customer may occasionally participate in campaigns irrelevant to the current context in the process. This kind of random behavior is sometimes strategic and necessary in B2B marketing but may dramatically affect the recommendation system if we adopt simple Markov transitions or sequential patterns as frequently used in B2C recommendation. Third, the multiple decision-makers scenario in B2B marketing makes community structure crucial to recommending a holistic solution for the company as a whole. However, only a scarce of studies have integrated both the individual behavior records and the community structures within a unified recommender system. Our integration of the community structures in the B2B campaign recommender system is motivated by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. To address all the challenges and solve the Next Campaign To Run (NCTR) problem for B2B marketing campaign recommendations, we did some preliminary work in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. First, we adopted the temporal graph as the temporal knowledge representation of the buying process of each business customer. The key idea is to extract and integrate the campaign order preferences of the customer using the temporal graph. Next, we developed the low-rank graph reconstruction framework to identify the common graph patterns and predict the unobserved edges in the temporal graphs. We showed that the prediction of the unobserved graph edges is effective to recommend the marketing campaigns to the business customers during their buying processes. In addition, to exploit the community structure of the business customers for marketing campaign recommendation, we formulated effective regularizers for the low-rank temporal graph reconstruction, which approach was named as NCTRC.</p><p>In this paper, we further improve our NCTR framework and propose the graphical model approach-NCTRG. First, we present the low-rank temporal graph reconstruction as a probabilistic graphical model. The graphical model intuitively demonstrates the components (and their statistical relationship) in the graph reconstruction framework. The graphical model also incorporates appropriate distribution priors to avoid over-fitting issues. Second, although the temporal graph used in our preliminary work naturally embedded the campaign participating frequencies of the business customers, our preliminary work factorized these frequencies without careful probabilistic justification. In this paper, we factorize the campaign participating frequencies with Poisson distribution and integrate the frequency factorization with the low-rank reconstruction of the temporal graphs. In other words, our recommender system based on the temporal graph is backward compatible with the conventional static recommender systems. Finally, the experimental results on real-world B2B marketing data show that the proposed method can capture the unique characteristics of B2B marketing campaign behaviors and effectively improve the quality of the campaign recommendations for challenging B2B marketing tasks.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the problem of "Next Campaign To Run" (NCTR) with intuitive examples. In Section 3, we introduce the main framework of NCTRG with Section 3.1 defining the temporal graph to represent the buying process, Section 3.2 giving an overview on recommendation process, and Section 3.3 predicting the unobserved graph edges with low-rank graph reconstruction as a probabilistic graphical model. Then, the graph reconstruction is regularized in Section 4 with community structure of the business customers. The details of the learning algorithm for the regularized low-rank graph reconstruction are presented in 5, after which we present the experimental results in Section 6 on several real-world B2B marketing data sets. In addition, we provide an overview of the related works in Section 7 and a discussion of the results in the Section 8. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>We recommend the "Next Campaign To Run" (NCTR) for the business customers by modeling their historical behavior records in the buying processes. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows some examples of the behavior records. Specifically, there are three campaign sequences for three customers C1; C2, and C3 from two companies. For the campaign sequences, we also have the eventhappening time when the customer participated in the campaign, therefore we are able to compute the intervals between consecutive events. The intervals can reveal interesting relationship (e.g., the temporal correlations) between the dependent marketing campaigns. For example, both customer C1 and C2 downloaded the trial product two or three days after attending a webinar. If these similar patterns are followed by the majority of the customers, we could recommend to download trial products to the customers who attended webinars about 2-3 days ago. Intuitively, recommending the dependent campaigns according to the customer's current context in the decision-making process will expedite the buying cycle. Therefore, our main objective is to exploit the temporal patterns in the behavior records of all customers for providing accurate marketing campaign recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A NCTR RECOMMENDER SYSTEM</head><p>This section presents our NCTR recommender system, including: 1) A novel graph-based representation to encode the temporal information in the customer buying process; 2) A low-rank graph reconstruction approach to predict the unobserved graph edges which can be used for NCTR recommendations; 3) A regularization of the graph reconstruction to incorporate the community structure of the customers; 4) A stochastic gradient descent learning algorithm to optimize the regularized graph reconstruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Temporal Knowledge Representation</head><p>Our first step to develop the NCTR recommender system is to design the informative representation of the temporal knowledge hidden in the behavior records of each customer. Inspired by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we propose the personalized temporal graph which effectively encodes the temporal relationships of the campaigns participated in by each customer.</p><p>Suppose we have M campaigns under study. For one specific customer, e.g., the nth customer, we have his/her behavior records which are represented as a sequence of campaigns s n ? ?s n 1 ; s n 2 ; . . . ; s n Ln ?, where s n l 2 f1; 2; . . . ; Mg is the lth campaign in the sequence. We also record the campaign-participating time t n l for s n l . With these notations, we define the personalized temporal graph G n for the nth customer, with all the M campaigns as graph nodes. The direct edge from the ith node to the jth node is weighted by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R n ij ? 1 L n X 1 p q Ln ?s n p ? i ^sn q ? jk?t n q ? t n p ?;<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where k??? is a non-increasing function.</p><p>The non-increasing property of the function k??? enables us to compute a higher edge weight R n ij if the ith and jth campaigns appear close to each other in s n . For example, we can use the simple Iverson bracket:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">k?djD? ? ?d D; (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where D is a threshold. In this way, we assume the marketing events happened within the temporal range of D are temporally related for this customer. An appropriate value of D can be thus determined with the domain knowledge in a particular application. More generally, we can also use a smooth function to further discriminate different temporal intervals between the events. In this paper, we use the truncated exceedance of the Exponential distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">k?djD; r? ? exp??d=r? d D 0 d &gt; D:<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Here, we exclude the weight computing between events with relatively large time interval, e.g., larger than D, and a scaling parameter r is used to compute the remaining weights. We use this definition for three reasons: According to the weight definition in Equation 1, the frequency of campaign i in the sequence s n is included in R n ii (i.e., ith diagonal entry), normalized by the sequence length L n . These frequencies have been used in the design of conventional static recommender systems, while the temporal graphs extend the static frequencies with temporal correlations/ dependencies. When r ! ?1, Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) are equivalent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">lim r!1 k?djD; r? ? k?djD?:</formula><p>The reason is that, when r is sufficiently large, each pair of events in the sequence s n within the temporal range of D will be equally connected and weighted in the temporal graph G n . When r ! 0?, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">lim r!0? k?djD; r? ? 1 d ? 0; 0 d &gt; 0:</formula><p>In this case, the graph weight matrix R n with k??? defined in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) is almost diagonal, since very few distinct events happened at exactly the same time.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, in the remaining of this paper, we let k?d? ? k?djD; r?. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists some of the notations used in this paper.</p><p>To provide an intuitive understanding, Example 1 shows the computation details of the personalized temporal graph. As can be seen, the graph-based representation translates the event sequences into the pairwise relationships, which captures the temporal closeness between any pair of campaigns. In the following, we utilize the personalized temporal graphs in our NCTR recommender system.</p><p>Example 1. We consider customer C1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. There are L n ? 5 behavior records. We let the scaling parameter</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r ? ?1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 2?=4 ? 2 and</formula><p>D is set to 90 days, then the personalized temporal graph R C1 can be constructed as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>. The following are the calculations for the first row of the adjacency matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R C1 AA ? 1 5 ?exp?0? ? exp?0? ? exp ? 6 2 ? 0:41; R C1 AB ? 0; R C1 AC ? 1 5 exp ? 1 2 ? 0:12; R C1 AD ? 1 5 exp ? 3 2 ? 0:05; R C1 AE ? 1 5 exp ? 8 2 ? exp ? 2 2 ? 0:08:</formula><p>Backward Compatibility. As aforementioned, R n ii includes the normalized frequency of campaign i in the sequence s n . These campaign participating frequency can be used to infer the "latent interest" of each business customer as in the conventional recommender systems. Therefore, our approach can be deemed a proper generalization of the conventional static recommender systems considering only the event frequencies as the implicit preferences/rating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Recommendation with Temporal Graph</head><p>Suppose we have constructed the personalized temporal graphs for all customers with sufficient observations. Then for a specific customer with the last campaign i in his/her behavior records s n , we can sort the campaigns j ? 1; 2; . . . ; M and j 6 ? i with respect to the values R n jj ?

The campaigns ranked at the top will be recommended to the customer. However, it is expected that the constructed temporal graphs are very sparse with many edges unobserved, and the NCTR recommendation tasks rely on accurate prediction of the unobserved edges. In the next section, we develop the collaborative low-rank graph reconstruction approach to predict these unobserved graph edges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Low-Rank Graph Reconstruction (NCTRG)</head><p>Inspired by the popular matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for predicting the unobserved customer-item ratings, we develop the low-rank graph reconstruction approach named as NCTRG for predicting the unobserved edges in the personalized temporal graphs. The assumption is that, each observed temporal graph can be reconstructed by optimally combining a set of graph basis. To be specific, suppose we have N customers and constructed the temporal graph G n for each n ? 1; 2; . . . ; N. As introduced in Section 3.1, each graph G n is associated with the adjacency matrix R n 2 R M?M , where M is the number of campaigns offered by the company. To reconstruct G n , we assume there are K graph basis and each base graph is associated with a adjacency matrix B k 2 R M?M for k ? 1; 2; . . . ; K. Then we use the graph basis to approximate the adjacency matrix R n :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R n $ X k A nk B k ;<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where A nk is the reconstruction coefficients. Note that, the number of graph basis, K, can be deemed the rank of the graph reconstruction, which is set to be much smaller than the number of observed temporal graphs, N: K ( N. More intuitively, the low-rank graph reconstruction can be demonstrated as a probabilistic graphical model shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. In the left panel, we decompose each graph edge R n ij by two factor vectors: 1) the reconstruction coefficients in A n? ; 2) the edge weights in the graph basis B ? ij , such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R n ij $ Gaussian?hA n? ; B ? ij i; s?;</formula><p>where hA n? ; B ? ij i ?</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P k A nk B k ij .</formula><p>However, the campaign participating frequencies R n jj often follows the Poisson distribution instead of Gaussian <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Therefore in the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we further distinguish the modelling for campaign participating frequency R n jj and the campaign order preferences R n ij , i 6 ? j:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R n ij $ Gaussian?hA n? ; B ? ij i; s?; 8n; i 6 ? j R n jj $ Poisson?hA n? ; B ? jj i?; 8n; j</formula><p>The graphical models are flexible to incorporate priors of the latent reconstruction coefficients and the graph basis to reduce the generalization errors (mistakes on unseen data). We use the following priors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">A nk $ Gaussian?0; s A ?; 8n; k B k ij $ Gaussian?0; s B ?; 8k; i 6 ? j B k jj $ Gamma?h; u?; 8k; j</formula><p>In particular, we use the Gamma distribution B k jj $ Gamma?h; u? since it is the conjugate one with Poisson.</p><p>With the above settings, we have the joint probability density:</p><p>Pr?RjA; B?

Now, we can formulate the (negative) log-likelihood as the objective function to compute the optimal graph basis B k for k ? 1; 2; . . . ; K, and at the same time the reconstruction coefficients in matrix A for all the temporal graphs G n , n ? 1; 2; . . . ; N: L?A; B? ? ?log Pr?RjA; B?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">COMMUNITY REGULARIZATION</head><p>Indeed, in addition to modeling the temporal relationships of the marketing campaigns in the complicated decisionmaking process of the business customers, another important factor which can be leveraged to improve the NCTR recommendations is the community network of the customers. As we mentioned in Section 1, in the B2B markets, it is often that multiple customers from the same company will make the business purchase decision together. These customers working on the same buying task or in the same company form a small community, where the members cooperate and communicate with each other. Therefore, during the reconstruction of their temporal graphs, these customers may share similar reconstruction coefficients. To integrate these constraints into our problem formulation, we adopt the so-called community regularization. Suppose we have the community network encoded in the matrix H, where H uv ? 1 if and only if the two customers u and v are from the same company, and H uv ? 0 otherwise. Then our objective function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">J ?A; B? ? L?A; B? ? ? V?A?;<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where the community regularization V?A? encourages the customers from the same company to have similar reconstruction coefficients in A:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">V?A? ? 1 2 X N u?1 X N v?1 1 2 H uv kA u ? A v k 2 ? 1 2 tr?A 0 ?D ? H?A?;</formula><p>where D is the diagonal degree matrix such that D uu ? P N v?1 H uv . The level of the community regularization is controlled by the parameter . Specifically, a large will tend to make the campaign preferences of different customers to be the same in the same community. On the other hand, a small will tend to make the community network effects insignificant. In practice, the optimal is dependent on the actual data characteristics, and it can be realized with the cross validation procedure. Moreover, the regularization V??? is quite flexible to encode different assumptions on the community networks. Generally speaking, the structure in H can also be provided by domain experts or derived from external knowledge on the customer relationships.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the performances of our approach in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods. All the experiments are performed on a GNU/Linux system with 2 CPUs (AMD 2.4 GHz) and 4 G RAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Data Description</head><p>We have collected three data sets of behavior records of the business customers interested in different products offered by a Fortune 500 company. For each customer, we collect the marketing campaigns participated in by the customer. The campaigns are ordered by the event-happening time as a marketing event sequence. A summary of all the data sets is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> with more statistics in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. One can see diverse characteristics in terms of data size (e.g., number of customers, number of companies, and number of campaigns) and event frequency (e.g., total campaign events, average time interval, and average sequence length). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>We use the following evaluation metrics to measure the recommendation performances:</p><p>Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG): The NDCG measures the ranking quality of the recommended list based on a graded relevance scale. It is widely used in researches on recommendation, information retrieval, search engine, etc. For a ranking list with K items:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">DCG@K ? X K k?1 2 rel k ? 1 log?k ? 1? ; NDCG@K ? DCG@K IDCG@K ;</formula><p>where IDCG is the maximum possible DCG for the recommended items, and rel i is the graded relevance of the list at position i. The range of NDCG is ?0; 1, with 1 representing the perfect ranking quality.</p><p>Precision and Recall: For a ranking list with K items:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Precision@K ? #relevant recommendations K ;</formula><p>Recall@K ? #relevant recommendations #all relevant items :</p><p>The value of Precision@K and Recall@K closer to 1.0 means better recommendation performances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area Under the Precision and Recall Curve (AUPR):</head><p>The AUPR usually is computed as the average of all precisions at evenly spaced recall levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The value is between 0 and 1 and higher is better. In our experiments, we use the first 65 percent of the behavior records of each customer for training and the remaining 35 percent for testing. All the metrics are computed for each customer and then the overall average is summarized to compare different methods or parameter settings. We also report the running time of all methods and the number of iterations for methods using iterative optimization, with the same level of tolerance (a lower bound on the change in the value of the objective function during an iteration) as 0.001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Benchmark Methods</head><p>We compare our approaches (NCTR, NCTRC and NCTRG) with several benchmark methods, including both conventional static recommender systems (Customer/Item Mean, NMF) and state-of-the-art methods based on temporal behavior patterns (FPMC, PIMF) or sequential rule mining (RuleGrowth). We summarize all the methods as follows:</p><p>(1) Customer Mean (CustMean): This method makes prediction based on the mean value of each customer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">b R n ij ? P ij R n ij I n ij P ij I n ij :</formula><p>(2) Item Mean: This method makes prediction based on the mean value of each item:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">b R n ij ? P n R n ij I n ij P n I n ij :</formula><p>(3) NMF: NMF is a widely used collaborative filtering approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which factorizes the customercampaign binary matrix (1 means the customer participated in the campaign, 0 otherwise). (4) FPMC: The Factorized Personalized Markov Chains model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> transforms the sequential data of each user into a transition matrix and then predict the users next action by factorizing the matrices. (5) PIMF: The Purchase Interval based Matrix Factorization model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> incorporates purchase interval into the marginal utility model to predict the most relevant items for recommendation at a given time. (6) RuleGrowth: The RuleGrowth <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> uses a patterngrowth approach for discovering sequential rules common to several sequences in the sequence databases, which containing sequences of discrete events. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">7</ref>) NCTR: This is our low-rank temporal graph reconstruction approach without any additional regularization. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">8</ref>) NCTRC: This method is our low-rank temporal graph reconstruction approach with the community regularization for customers from the same company. (9) NCTRG: This method is the extension of the NCTRC approach with separately defined temporal preferences and campaign interestingness and regularization terms in a graphical model to avoid overfitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Performance Comparison and Discussion</head><p>In the performance comparison, we are curious about two questions:</p><p>How the enhanced NCTRG framework improves baselines (CustMean, ItemMean, NMF) as well as state-of-the-art models (FPMC, PIMF, RuleGrowth)? How the enhanced NCTRG framework improves our earlier approaches (NCTR, NCTRC)? Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3,</ref><ref type="table">4</ref>, and 5 summarizes the comparison results on three B2B marketing data sets, respectively. For all methods, the parameters (if any) are tuned by the cross-validation procedure. More details on parameter selection in our method are provided in Section 6.6. From the results, we have the following observations:</p><p>1) In general, our methods (NCTR, NCTRC and NCTRG) consistently outperform other baseline methods such as Customer Mean, Item Mean, and NMF on all data sets. This observation well affirms our idea that the performance of NCTR recommendation can be improved by considering the temporal information in customer behaviors and the B2B community structures. 2) NCTR, NCTRC and NCTRG also outperform FPMC for predicting the next possible campaigns. The reason is that, the temporal graphs in our methods are more robust in representing the event sequences. For example, in our data, the events happen irregularly with varying time intervals. Meanwhile, there are missing events not recorded in the behavior logs. All of these make the simple transition probabilities of FPMC less meaningful. In contrast, our temporal graphs directly compute the temporal correlations between marketing events for recommendations. The irregular time intervals are counted with robust smooth functions and the missing events cannot affect the construction of graph edges between observed events. 3) Moreover, NCTR, NCTRC and NCTRG outperform PIMF which considers the diminishing product's utility and user's satisfaction. In our data, the diminishing marginal utility pattern does not fit into the B2B marketing events. For example, a customer might participate in the same campaign (such as 'Webinar') several times consecutively. Our temporal graphs can model not only this kind of repeatability using self-connecting edges but also temporal correlations between campaigns in the evolving buying processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) In addition, NCTR, NCTRC and NCTRG outperform</head><p>RuleGrowh by a large margin in terms of precision, recall and AUPR. Note that NDCG metric is not applicable for RuleGrowh due to the lack of the graded relevance score for the sequential rules.</p><p>Although RuleGrowh as a sequential rule mining approach could find out the most frequently cooccurred campaign sequences, it is less suitable for the B2B marketing scenario than our approaches. This may be due to the reason that RuleGrowth is less personalized by not taking into account the individual customer's campaign interests nor the B2B community structure among the customers. 5) NCTRC and NCTRG achieve higher recommendation quality than NCTR, which shows the benefits gained by incorporating the community information when computing the low-rank graph reconstruction. Moreover, our proposed NCTRG further improves NCTRC significantly. From the results in the three tables, we can observe an average of 0.0660 improvement in terms of all the measures for NCTRG over NCTRC. This improvement can be attributed to the following reasons. First, the Poisson-based enhanced method is more appropriate for modeling the campaign frequency to capture the campaign interestingness preference. Second, the NCTRG separately models the campaign frequency and the temporal preference in the temporal graph, in which providing a more rigorous model than the NCTR and NCTRC applied an approximation solution. Moreover, the added regularization terms in the model also help to avoid overfitting thus to improve the overall performance. Comparisons across different datasets. In general, we find that consistent improvements of the proposed extension over all the baseline methods, even though these three datasets differ in terms of data size, campaign sequence length, and community density. We also notice some interesting different results of these three datasets. First, we find that in Data A and B, the method CustomerMean outperforms ItemMean, while in Data C, the method ItemMean outperforms CustomerMean. This can be explained by the statistics in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In Data C, the average sequence length is much longer than those in Data A and Data B. In this case, campaign-based approach can generally generate better results since more campaign information has been utilized. In contrast, Data A and Data B have relatively shorter sequence length, this is the possible reason that the ItemMean performed worse than CustomerMean. Second, the average size of the B2B community varies in these datasets. Specifically, dataset B has the smaller size of average 2-3 contacts for each company, which dataset C has the larger size with above 6 contacts for each company. Due to the diverse size of community, the improvement of the methods with community regularization also varies. From the results we find that, the smaller size of the community, the better improvements of the approach. The possible reason for the finding is that the smaller community means tighter connection among the community members, thus more significant influences on each others' behavior.</p><p>Summary. The temporal preference, community relationships and the campaign interesting frequency are three of the most important characteristics for B2B marketing data, and play an important role in the B2B campaign recommendation. The NCTRC which fuses the first two factors-the temporal preference and the community relationships into the B2B customer overall preferences can improve the NCTR and other baselines. However, an integrated and enhanced of all three characteristics for the B2B campaign recommendation lead to further improvements. The proposed NCTRG not only considers the temporal preferences from the behavior sequence and the community relationship for recommendation, but also constructs the temporal graph by considering the campaign visiting frequency as the campaign interestingness. As a result, we can observe significant improvements over all the baseline algorithms. Also, as shown in the performance comparison between NCTRC and NCTRG, we observe improvements by NCTRG, as Poisson distribution is more suitable for modeling the campaign frequency data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Case Study</head><p>To provide a better understanding, we demonstrate some detailed recommendation results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> for 5 customers from two companies. With different last behavior records, our approach recommends to each customer a list including distinct contents. For example, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the last record of customer C1 is "Search", which indicates that C1 is still in the primitive decision-making stage. Therefore, the recommended campaigns for C1 include first "Email Campaign" and "Web Advertising" to enhance the product awareness, and later "Webinar", "Seminar", and "Trial Download" to boost the interest level of the customer C1. In comparison, with "Trade Show" as the last record, C3 is currently in a more mature status toward purchase. Thus, this customer is provided with some late-stage marketing campaigns such as "Training", "Corporate Event", and "Outbound Telemarketing", which can accelerate the buying process for final purchase decision.</p><p>Another interesting observation is that, although customer C5 has the same last record with C1, the customer C5 is provided with very different recommendations. This becomes natural with the consideration of the community relationships. Specifically, we investigated the historical records of other community members and found that the customers from this company are more proactive. They are already well aware of the products without those advertisement related campaigns. Therefore, some latestage campaigns such as "Trade Show" and "Training" are recommended to C5 for further information.</p><p>Furthermore, by separately modeling the temporal preferences and the campaign interestingness and especially using Poisson distribution to model the campaign participating frequency, NCTRG can better capture customers' preferences and recommend the campaigns with consideration of both time relevance and interestingness. For example, "Webinar" is recommended again to C2 even though it is same as the last record. This is due to the fact that "Webinar" is one of the most popular B2B marketing campaign types and C2 attended webinars several times.</p><p>These observations clearly show that, for recommending the next campaign to run, our approach can model not only the customer-specific behavior preferences but also the community-related behavior commonalities. Moreover, both campaign interestingness and temporal relevance are carefully taken into consideration for recommendation. All these perspectives are effective to improve the recommendation performances in terms of various measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Parameter Selection</head><p>Now we consider the important parameters (D; r; K; ; s A ; s B ; u; h) in our NCTR recommender system and provide detailed discussion on the impacts of parameter changing values on the model performance, which can also provide some guidance for the parameter value selection. Specifically, we optimize the parameters following a nature order, which first decides temporal graph parameters with domain knowledge, then the number of graph bases, the degree of regularization, finally probability prior parameters. This procedure is computationally efficient and produces superior results on our data sets. In general case, an iterative optimization of parameters or an exhaustive grid search should be used for the best performance in practice. For the sake of simplicity, we only show the results for the validation dataset of Data B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.1">The Temporal Graph Parameters</head><p>The values of two parameters (D and r) for constructing the temporal graphs can be chosen according to the domain knowledge. For example, the thresholding parameter D in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) is set to be 90 days in our data sets. The reason is that the customer will make decisions hardly based on actions taken three months ago. Moreover, to make the numerical computing stable in the function exp???, the scaling parameter r for computing the temporal correlation in Equation (3) can be chosen as the average time interval between all the consecutive marketing events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.2">The Number of Graph Basis K</head><p>Second, we show how the value of graph basis K for reconstructing the temporal graphs impact on model performances in Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>, we plot the recommendation performances with increasing number of graph basis. As can be seen, the performances in terms of different measures vary significantly with the different numbers of graph bases. It is worthy to note that the performances might not increase with more bases. The reason is that, more bases imply higher modeling complexity and may lead to overfitting in the training data and decreasing generality of the identified graph bases. Based on Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>, we see that K ? 30 is a feasible trade off between the modeling complexity and the empirical accuracy, with which we achieve the optimal performance consistently in terms of all measures. Therefore we choose K ? 30 for this data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.3">The Community Regularization Parameter</head><p>Third, we discuss the set of regularization parameter , which controls the degree of the regularization using the community network in Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The appropriate values of these parameters can also be chosen according to the recommendation performance. Intuitively, if we use a small value of , then we only employ the temporal graphs encoding the customer behavior preferences for making recommendations. On the other hand, if is larger, the community network information will have a stronger impact on the reconstruction of the temporal graphs. To choose the optimal value for , Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref> shows the recommendation performances with different increasing values of . When is greater than 0, it becomes stable and gives the optimal results in terms of Precision, Recall and NDCG. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we reviews several categories of the existing work that are closely related to the proposed research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Traditional Recommender Systems</head><p>The research of recommender systems have been an active topic in recent years. In general, there are three major recommendation approaches including content-based methods, collaborative filtering (CF), and hybrid methods Adomavicius and Tuzhilin <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Breese et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. One of the most widely used approaches is the collaborative filtering, which provides </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Temporal Recommender Systems</head><p>Another type of useful information in the design of recommender systems is the temporal pattern, which is still under-explored yet. For example, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Lathia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Koren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Xiong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> showed that the temporal dynamics can be considered in the collaborative filtering model to learn the dynamic characteristics of the users and items. Also, Tang and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed to extract dynamic features using time-series analysis and apply the adaptively weighting algorithm to make recommendations. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed to combine explicit and implicit user feedbacks to learn the seasonality or shortterm preferences for movie recommendations. Xiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proposed to combine the user similarity as the longterm preference and the product similarity as the shortterm bias to make recommendations. Another research direction of the temporal recommender system is to exploit the time factors for short-term "nextitem" recommendations. To this end, Rendle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> integrates the latent factor model and Markov chain model for next-basket recommendation. Wang and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed an opportunity model to estimate the follow-up purchase probability of a user at a specific time. Yap et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed to learn user-specific "sequence important knowledge" through personalized sequential pattern mining. Recently, to improve the next-product recommendations in e-commerce, the time interval between purchase behaviors has been modeled by Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Similar ideas have also been used in other applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, such as the recommendation of the next-POI (Point-of-Interest) to check-in in location-based services Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. We implemented the closely related and applicable methods in these researches and discussed more details in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Recommender Systems with Social Information</head><p>Finally, the social information has been used to improve the recommendation performances. In particular, Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed to integrate the social network with the matrix factorization method to learn the latent factors for both users and items with different applications. To improve review quality prediction, Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> developed a generic framework for incorporating social context information by adding regularization constraints in the text-based predictor. To better utilize user's social trust information, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> developed a category-specific social trust circle based model with the user-item rating data combined with social network data. Moreover, in Chua et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the social correlation is used with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the users' adoption of items. The authors further devised a hybrid model that combines a user's own latent factors with her friends' for adoption prediction. In Shen and Jin <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, a joint personal and social latent factor (PSLF) model is used for social recommendation by explicitly expressing the varieties of the social relationships for each user. In this paper, we have a simple community structure of the business customers. We observed that the individuals in the same community collaborate with each other and thus we incorporate a community regularization to reflect the relationship in our NCTR approach to improve the marketing campaign recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">DISCUSSION</head><p>Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this study. From the experimental results, we can see that the proposed NCTR framework works very well for predicting the B2B customers campaign preferences by exploiting the temporal and community characteristics of the B2B marketing campaign data. Also, in this paper, we describe the work in a domain depended (i.e., B2B marketing) way where users are B2B contacts from different companies, items are various marketing campaigns, and features of items are extracted from the campaign behavior sequences and so on. However, it is worth noting that the idea of integration the temporal factors and the relationships of the users into a recommendation framework should be generally applicable to other recommendation scenarios.</p><p>In the meantime, the NCTR framework has some limitations. First, we focus on designing the recommendation algorithm for the next possible campaign based on the customer's past behavior records. So there are maybe some cold-start problems for a new customer come in and without any behavior records. Thus, our approach may be more useful are existing customers with a few behavior records. Also, if we want to deploy this work for real-world services, we have to incorporate more practical functions. Second, there are some limitations with the performance evaluation, which is justified based on the three test data and a simple user study. For instance, preferred and relevant campaigns in the test set may be just a small fraction of the entire relevant ones that are actually favored by the customers. For real-world applications, more sophisticated experiments are required. In addition, note that, currently we define the communities for customers from the same company. In the future, we may identify more fine-grained community structures among customers, e.g., customers can form different groups for different buying tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we developed a novel recommender system to combine the temporal and social factors captured in customer behavior records and the customer community networks for B2B marketing campaign recommendations. The goal is to provide the marketers with a better marketing strategy to expedite the customer conversion cycle and boost the customer conversion ratio. The proposed B2B marketing campaign recommender system strategically integrates the temporal preferences, community relationships and the campaign interestingness in the framework. Specifically, we first represented the rich temporal content in customer behavior records using the temporal graphs. Next, with the personalized temporal graphs, we computed the low-rank graph reconstruction to predict the unobserved graph edges. Moreover, we regularized the graph reconstruction with the community network of the business customers. Furthermore, the proposed approach extended the preliminary work by considering the skewed campaign frequency data characteristic of B2B marketing data, to incorporate the campaign interestingness information in the model. Finally, we developed efficient algorithms to compute the optimal solutions, which we have applied on several real-world B2B marketing data sets. The experiments clearly validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
