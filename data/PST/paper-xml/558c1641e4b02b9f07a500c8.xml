<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Spatial modulation (SM), in which multiple antennas are used to convey information besides the conventional 𝑀 -ary signal constellations, is a new multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) transmission technique, which has recently been proposed as an alternative to V-BLAST (vertical Bell Labs layered space-time).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>MIMO link. Despite the high spectral efficiency provided by V-BLAST, a major drawback is its very high maximum likelihood (ML) decoding complexity which is caused by inter-channel interference (ICI) at the receiver. Instead of a high complexity ML decoder, one can use a low complexity suboptimum decoder such as a minimum mean square error (MMSE) decoder; however this results in a significant degradation in error performance. As an alternative to V-BLAST transmission, a novel MIMO transmission scheme known as spatial modulation (SM) has been introduced by Mesleh et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref> to remove the ICI completely between the transmit antennas of a MIMO link. The basic principle of SM is to use the indices of multiple antennas to convey information in addition to the conventional two dimensional signal constellations such as M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), where M is the constellation size. Consequently, the task of an optimal SM decoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> is to jointly search for all of the M-ary constellation points and transmit antennas to decide on both the transmitted symbol and the index of the transmit antenna over which this symbol is transmitted. SM provides some advantages compared to classical MIMO transmission systems in which all antennas transmit simultaneously. Since only one transmit antenna is active during each symbol transmission, ICI is completely eliminated in SM and this results in much lower (linear) decoding complexity. Furthermore, SM does not require synchronization between the transmit antennas of the MIMO link and only one radio frequency (RF) chain is needed at the transmitter.</p><p>In recent studies, inspired by SM, a space-shift keying (SSK) modulation scheme in which only antenna indices are used to transmit information has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. In addition to the advantages of SM over V-BLAST, SM has been combined with space-time block coding (STBC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> to provide transmit diversity.</p><p>The inventors of SM have proposed a trellis coded spatial modulation scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>, where the key idea of trellis coded modulation (TCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> is partially applied to SM to improve its performance in correlated channels. In this scheme, a group of information bits is first split into two sequences, where the second sequence directly enters the SM mapper while the first sequence enters the SM mapper after passing through a four-state convolutional encoder and then a random block interleaver. The SM mapper chooses the active transmit antenna by modulating the coded bits of the first sequence and the constellation symbol by modulating the uncoded bits of the second sequence. In other words, the TCM technique is used in conjunction with SM to partition the transmit antennas into subsets by maximizing the spacing between antennas of the same subset and only the information bits that determine the transmit antenna number are convolutionally encoded. At the receiver, with an optimal SM decoder, a hard decision Viterbi decoder is employed for the coded bits; then combining with the demodulated uncoded bits gives an estimate of the original information bit sequence. It has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> that this scheme does not provide any error performance advantage compared to uncoded SM in uncorrelated channel conditions; on the other hand, the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> does exhibit improved performance in correlated channels. The reason for this behavior can be explained by the trellis coding gain which does not have an impact on the performance when all the channel paths are uncorrelated. Here, we propose a different design method to construct a trellis coded SM scheme which benefits from the advantages of trellis coding in both uncorrelated and correlated channels.</p><p>In this paper, a novel MIMO transmission scheme, called spatial modulation with trellis coding (SM-TC), which directly combines trellis coding and SM, is proposed. Similarly to conventional TCM, the trellis encoder and the SM mapper are jointly designed and a soft decision Viterbi decoder which is fed with the soft information supplied by the optimal SM decoder, is used at the receiver. The SM-TC mechanism, which switches between transmit antennas of a MIMO link, provides a type of virtual interleaving and offers an additional diversity gain, known as time diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. First, we derive the general conditional pairwise error probability (CPEP) for SM-TC and then, for quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels, by averaging over channel coefficients, we obtain the unconditional pairwise error probability (UPEP) of SM-TC for error events with path lengths two and three. Code design criteria are given for the SM-TC scheme, which are then used to obtain the best codes with optimized distance spectra for error events with path lengths two and three. New SM-TC schemes with 4, 8 and 16 states are proposed for 2, 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz spectral efficiencies. It is shown via computer simulations that the proposed SM-TC schemes for uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels provide significant error performance improvements over space-time trellis codes (STTCs), coded V-BLAST systems and the scheme given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> in terms of bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER) yet with a lower decoding complexity. In addition to this, from an implementation point of view, unlike the STTCs, our scheme requires only one RF chain at the transmitter, even if we have a higher number of transmit antennas, and requires no synchronization between them.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we give our system model and introduce the new SM-TC scheme. In Section III, the PEP upper bound for the SM-TC scheme is derived. Design criteria and design examples for SM-TC are presented in Section IV. Bit error probability (BEP) analysis of the new scheme is given in Section V. Simulation results and performance comparisons are given in Section VI.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>The considered SM-TC system model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary information sequence u is encoded by a rate 𝑅 = 𝑘/𝑛 trellis (convolutional) encoder whose output sequence v enters the SM mapper. The spatial modulator is designed in conjunction with the trellis encoder to transmit 𝑛 coded bits in a transmission interval by means of the symbols selected from an 𝑀 -level signal constellation such as 𝑀 -ary phase-shift keying (𝑀 -PSK), 𝑀 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (𝑀 -QAM), etc., and of the antenna selected from a set of 𝑛 𝑇 transmit antennas such that 𝑛 = log 2 (𝑀 𝑛 𝑇 ). The SM mapper first specifies the identity of the transmit antenna determined by the first log 2 𝑛 𝑇 bits of the coded sequence v. It than maps the remaining log 2 𝑀 bits of the coded sequence onto the signal constellation employed for transmission of the data symbols. Due to trellis coding, the overall spectral efficiency of the SM-TC would be 𝑘 bits/s/Hz. The new signal generated by the SM is denoted by 𝑥 = (𝑖, 𝑠) where 𝑠 ∈ 𝜒 is the data symbol transmitted over the antenna labeled by 𝑖 ∈ {1, 2, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑛 𝑇 }. That is, the spatial modulator generates an</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1×𝑛 𝑇 signal vector [ 0 0 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝑠 0 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 0 ]</formula><p>whose 𝑖th entry is 𝑠 at the output of the 𝑛 𝑇 transmit antennas for transmission. The MIMO channel over which the spatially modulated symbols are transmitted, is characterized by an 𝑛 𝑇 × 𝑛 𝑅 matrix H, whose entries are i.i.d. r.v.'s having the 𝒞𝒩 (0, 1) distribution, where 𝑛 𝑅 denotes the number of receive antennas. We assume that H remains constant during the transmission of a frame and takes independent values from one frame to another. We further assume that H is perfectly known at the receiver, but is not known at the transmitter. The transmitted signal is corrupted by an 𝑛 𝑅 -dimensional additive complex Gaussian noise vector with i.i.d. entries distributed as 𝒞𝒩 (0, 𝑁 0 ). At the receiver, a soft decision Viterbi decoder, which is fed with the soft information supplied by the optimal SM decoder, is employed to provide an estimate û of the input bit sequence.</p><p>Let us introduce the concept of SM-TC by an example for 𝑘 = 2 bits/s/Hz with 𝑛 𝑇 = 4. Consider an 𝑅 = 2/4 trellis encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> with the octal generator matrix [ 0 3 0 1 1 0 2 0 ], followed by the SM mapper. At each coding step, the first two coded bits determine the active transmit antenna over which the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) symbol determined by the last two coded bits is transmitted. The corresponding trellis diagram is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, where each branch is labeled by the corresponding output bits and SM symbol (𝑖, 𝑠), where 𝑖 ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} and 𝑠 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}. Although this scheme can be considered as a generalization of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, it differs from that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> in three basic ways. Firstly, to provide coding as well as diversity gain, all information bits are convolutionally encoded unlike in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, in which only the information bits determining the corresponding antenna index are encoded. Thus, our joint encoding allows the operation of an optimum soft decoder at the receiver, and consequently improves the error performance of the system significantly. Secondly, an interleaver is not included in our scheme; however, we benefit from the SM-TC mechanism which acts as a virtual interleaver by switching between transmit antennas of a MIMO link to provide additional time diversity. Finally, a soft decision Viterbi decoder is employed at the receiver opposite to the hard decision Viterbi decoder of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. From these major differences in the operation of two schemes, we conclude that our scheme can be considered as being more directly inspired by Ungerboeck's TCM, in which the conventional 𝑀 -PSK or 𝑀 -QAM mapper of TCM is replaced by an SM mapper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PAIRWISE-ERROR PROBABILITY (PEP) DERIVATION</head><p>OF THE SM-TC SCHEME In this section, first, the CPEP of the SM-TC scheme is derived, and then for quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels, by averaging over channel fading coefficients, the UPEP of the SM-TC scheme is obtained for error events with path lengths two and three. For the sake of simplicity, one receive antenna is assumed; however, all results can be easily extended to any number of receive antennas. A pairwise error event of length 𝑁 occurs when the Viterbi decoder decides in favor of the spatially modulated symbol sequence x = (x 1 , x2 , . . . , x𝑁 ) when x = (𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , . . . , 𝑥 𝑁 ) is transmitted, where 𝑥 𝑛 = (𝑖 𝑛 , 𝑠 𝑛 ), 𝑠 𝑛 ∈ 𝜒 is the transmitted symbol over the 𝑖 𝑛 th antenna (1 ≤ 𝑖 𝑛 ≤ 𝑛 𝑇 ) at the 𝑛th transmission interval.</p><p>Let the received signal is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑦 𝑛 = 𝛼 𝑛 𝑠 𝑛 + 𝑤 𝑛 (1)</formula><p>for 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑁 , where 𝛼 𝑛 is the complex fading coefficient from the 𝑖 𝑛 th transmit antenna to the receiver at the 𝑛th transmission interval, and 𝑤 𝑛 is the noise sample with the 𝒞𝒩 (0, 𝑁 0 ) distribution. Let 𝜶 = (𝛼 1 , 𝛼 2 , . . . , 𝛼 𝑁 ) and 𝜷 = (𝛽 1 , 𝛽 2 , . . . , 𝛽 𝑁 ) denote the sequences of fading coefficients corresponding to transmitted and erroneously detected SM symbol sequences, x and x, respectively. The CPEP for this case is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Pr ( x → x| 𝜶, 𝜷) = Pr { 𝑚 (y, x; 𝜷) ≥ 𝑚 (y, x; 𝜶)| x} (2)</formula><p>where 𝑚 (y,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x; 𝜶) = ∑ 𝑁 𝑛=1 𝑚 (𝑦 𝑛 , 𝑠 𝑛 ; 𝛼 𝑛 ) = - ∑ 𝑁 𝑛=1 |𝑦 𝑛 -𝛼 𝑛 𝑠 𝑛 | 2 is the decision metric for x, since 𝑦 𝑛</formula><p>is Gaussian when conditioned on 𝛼 𝑛 and 𝑠 𝑛 .

Since, w𝑛 is Gaussian with distribution 𝒞𝒩</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">( 0, 𝑁 0 |𝛽 * 𝑛 ŝ * 𝑛 -𝛼 * 𝑛 𝑠 * 𝑛 | 2 ) , it is straightforward to show that 𝑑 is also Gaussian with dis- tribution 𝒩 ( 𝑚 𝑑 , 𝜎 2 𝑑 )</formula><p>where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">𝑚 𝑑 = - ∑ 𝑁 𝑛=1 |𝛼 𝑛 𝑠 𝑛 -𝛽 𝑛 ŝ𝑛 | 2 and 𝜎 2 𝑑 = 2𝑁 0 ∑ 𝑁 𝑛=1 |𝛼 𝑛 𝑠 𝑛 -𝛽 𝑛 ŝ𝑛 | 2 .</formula><p>Finally, the CPEP of the SM-TC scheme is calculated from (4) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Pr ( x → x| 𝜶, 𝜷) = 𝑄 ( -𝑚 𝑑 𝜎 𝑑 ) = 𝑄 ⎛ ⎝ √ ∑ 𝑁 𝑛=1 𝐴 𝑛 2𝑁 0 ⎞ ⎠<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝐴 𝑛 = |𝛼 𝑛 𝑠 𝑛 -𝛽 𝑛 ŝ𝑛 | 2 .</formula><p>An error event with path length 𝑁 is defined as an error event satisfying 𝐴 𝑛 ∕ = 0 and 𝐴 𝑛 ∕ = 𝐴 𝑚 for 1 ≤ 𝑛, 𝑚 ≤ 𝑁 , where it is possible to have 𝛼 𝑛 = 𝛽 𝑛 or 𝑠 𝑛 = ŝ𝑛 for some values of 𝑛 due to the use of SM. Note that, during the SM-TC code design, for considered 𝑁 values, we allow only the error events satisfying these conditions. This constraint, which will be explained in the sequel, is crucial for good code design. Using the bound 𝑄 (𝑥) ≤ 1 2 𝑒 -𝑥 2 /2 , the CPEP of the SM-TC scheme can be upper bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Pr ( x → x| 𝜶, 𝜷) ≤ 1 2 exp ( - 𝛾 4 ∑ 𝑁 𝑛=1 |𝛼 𝑛 𝑠 𝑛 -𝛽 𝑛 ŝ𝑛 | 2 )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where 𝛾 = 𝐸 𝑠 /𝑁 0 = 1/𝑁 0 is the average received signal-tonoise ratio (SNR).

Considering DOF with 𝑛 (𝜂) and 𝑛 (η) values, we observe 18 different types of error events. In Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, we give resulting UPEP upper bounds of SM-TC from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>, for these different types where 𝑐 = cos(±Δ𝜃</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">1 ± Δ𝜃 2 ) + cos(±Δ𝜃 1 ± Δ𝜃 3 ) + cos(±Δ𝜃 2 ± Δ𝜃 3 ), θ = ±Δ𝜃 1 ± Δ𝜃 2 ± Δ𝜃 3 , 𝑑 1 = 𝑑 2 𝐸𝑛 + 𝑑 2 𝐸𝑚 , 𝑑 2 = 𝑑 2 𝐸1 + 𝑑 2 𝐸2 + 𝑑 2 𝐸3</formula><p>and 𝑛, 𝑚 ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 𝑛 ∕ = 𝑚. The asterisk for DOF values means the considered error event includes a sub-error event with length two of Type 5, and therefore, the resulting UPEP upper bound is dependent on 𝜃 which is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>. As seen from Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, a diversity order of three is achieved by the SM-TC scheme when DOF ≥ 3. We give the following theorem, which generalizes the concepts developed above. Theorem 1: In case of an error event with path length 𝑁 , in order to achieve a diversity order of 𝑁 (a UPEP upper bound of 𝑎/𝛾 𝑁  ) 𝑏 ∏ 𝑏 𝑖=1 𝜆 S</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝑖</head><p>) -1 which states that the diversity order of the system is determined by the rank of S since 𝛾 decays with -𝑏. According to the subadditivity of rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, 𝑏 = rank (S) ≤ ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 rank (S 𝑖 ) = 𝑁 , since rank (S 𝑖 ) = 1 for all 𝑖. Since DOF is the total number of columns (or rows) of S with not all zero entries, we also have 𝑏 ≤ DOF. In order to prove the theorem, we have to show that 𝑏 = 𝑁 only for DOF ≥ 𝑁 . To satisfy 𝑏 = 𝑁 , we have to show that the rank subadditivity inequality given above holds. It can be shown that only for DOF ≥ 𝑁 , can the intersection of column (or equivalently row) spaces of S = ∑ 𝑀 𝑖=1 S 𝑖 and S 𝑗 , 𝑗 = 𝑀 + 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑁 be the null space, i.e., 𝐶( S) ∩ 𝐶 (S 𝑗 ) = ∅ for all 𝑀 &lt; 𝑁 (see the example below), which is a sufficient condition for rank additivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. This completes the proof.</p><p>Note that if an error event of path length 𝑁 includes a critical sub-error event, which is defined as an error event with path length 𝑁 ′ ≤ 𝑁 and DOF ′ ≤ DOF such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">𝑛 (η) = 𝑁 ′ = DOF ′ , then the UPEP is upper bounded by 𝑎/[(1 -cos θ)𝛾 𝑁 ] for 𝛾 ≫ 1 where θ = ±Δ𝜃 1 ± Δ𝜃 2 ± ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ± Δ𝜃 𝑁 ′ .</formula><p>Therefore, for the values of θ = 0, the diversity order 𝑏 becomes smaller than 𝑁 (which can be shown to be 𝑏 = 𝑁 -1) since the rank additivity does not hold. This is why the condition in Theorem 1 is only necessary but not sufficient. Type 5 of Section III.A and the second type given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> are the critical error events for 𝑁 = 2 and 𝑁 = 3, respectively. Our code design ensures θ ∕ = 0 for 𝑁 ′ = 2 and 3 since we deal with error events with path lengths 𝑁 = 2 and 3, while it is rare to have such error events including critical sub-error events with higher 𝑁 ′ and 𝑁 values, for which even if θ = 0 could not destroy the overall diversity order of the SM-TC system. Therefore, in our code design, we always aim to guarantee DOF ≥ 𝑁 .</p><p>According to Theorem 1, to achieve a diversity order of 𝑁 , DOF could not be smaller than 𝑁 . The following example illustrates this fact. Example 1: Suppose we have S 1 and S 2 for 𝑁 = 2 with DOF = 2 and 𝑖 1 , 𝑗 1 , 𝑖 2 , 𝑗 2 ∈ {1, 2}. Since rank (S 1 ) = rank (S 2 ) = 1, the columns of S 1 and S 2 span two disjoint subspaces of ℂ 𝑛𝑇 with dimension one (when 𝜃 ∕ = 0 if this error event belongs to Type 5). Consequently, rank( S) = 2, where S = S 1 + S 2 , and the columns of S span a subspace of ℂ 𝑛𝑇 such that the vectors in this column space all have the form (𝑥, 𝑦, 0, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 0)</p><p>𝑇 ∈ ℂ 𝑛𝑇 . Therefore, to achieve a diversity order of three, we not only need a third matrix S 3 , but also this matrix must satisfy DOF ≥ 3 by using at least one new row (and column) in S where S = S 1 + S 2 + S 3 , and in this way, we ensure 𝐶 (S 3 ) ∩ 𝐶( S) = ∅ and according to the rank additivity we obtain rank( S) = ∑ 3 𝑖=1 rank (S 𝑖 ) = 3. If we assume that DOF = 3 with S 3 , the same procedure is applied for S 4 , and so on. On the other hand, if we have DOF = 4 with S 3 , with the matrix S 4 , we not need to increase DOF, since the dimension of 𝐶( S) is again equal to three and therefore, 𝐶 (S 4 ) ∩ 𝐶( S) = ∅ when 𝐶 (S 4 ) ∩ 𝐶( S) = ∅ and rank additivity holds.</p><p>The following remark generalizes the UPEP upper bound of SM-TC for any number of receive antennas.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SM-TC CODE DESIGN CRITERIA AND DESIGN EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section, we give design criteria for SM-TC and provide some code design examples for spectral efficiencies 𝑘 = 2, 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz.</p><p>By considering the UPEP analysis of the previous section, the following design criteria are derived for the SM-TC scheme:</p><p>1) Diversity gain criterion: For a trellis code with minimum error event length 𝑁 , to achieve a diversity order of 𝑁 , DOF must be greater than or equal to 𝑁 for all error events with path length greater than or equal to 𝑁 . 2) Coding gain criterion: After ensuring maximum diversity gain, the distance spectrum of the SM-TC should be optimized by considering the UPEP values calculated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>. As an application of the SM-TC design criteria, we consider two 4-state trellis codes for 𝑘 = 2 bits/s/Hz. The first code, called Code A, is chosen as the trellis code shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>   State 𝑘 = 2 bits/s/Hz 𝑘 = 3 bits/s/Hz 𝑘 = 4 bits/s/Hz 4</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">[ 0 3 0 1 1 0 2 0 ] - - 8 [ 0 2 4 2 3 4 0 1 ] ⎡ ⎣ 0 2 1 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 ⎤ ⎦ - 16 [ 5 1 3 0 1 4 0 3 ] ⎡ ⎣ 0 4 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 4 0 2 3 0 5 0 1 1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦</formula><p>with the generator matrix [ 0 3 0 1 1 0 2 0 ]. This code has 96 different error events with 𝑁 = 2. The second code, called Code B, has the generator matrix [ 3 1 1 0 1 2 0 1 ]. The distance spectra of these two codes are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">II</ref> for 𝑁 = 2 for high SNR values (𝛾 ≫ 1) with corresponding multiplicity values. Both of the codes are designed to optimize the UPEP of the error events with 𝑁 = 2. However, they cannot guarantee to satisfy DOF ≥ 3 for 𝑁 = 3, while they always ensure DOF ≥ 2. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the BER and FER performance of these two codes, obtained by Monte Carlo simulations, is compared for a frame length of 40 bits with respect to the received SNR for one and two receive antennas. As seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, although the worst case UPEP of Code A is higher than that of Code B, there is substantial error performance gap between these two codes in favor of Code A, due to its improved distance spectrum.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>, we give the octal generator matrices of the SM-TC codes for 𝑘 = 2, 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz spectral efficiencies and different numbers of states. All codes are designed manually according to the SM-TC design criteria given above. For 2 bits/s/Hz transmission, we use four transmit antennas with a QPSK constellation, while for 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz, we use eight transmit antennas with an 8-PSK constellation since, 𝑅 = 2/4, 𝑅 = 3/6 and 𝑅 = 4/6 trellis encoders are employed to obtain 𝑘 = 2, 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz, respectively. For 2 bits/s/Hz, we extended our 4-state code to eight states and optimized its distance spectrum to maximize the number of error events with DOF &gt; 2. On the other hand, our 16-state code is designed such that the error events with 𝑁 ≥ 3 ensure DOF ≥ 3, and therefore, diversity order of three is achieved. For 3 bits/s/Hz, in the same manner as performed previously, we optimized the distance spectra of 8and 16-state codes, guaranteed DOF ≥ 2 and maximized the number of error events with DOF &gt; 2. Finally for 4 bits/s/Hz, we constructed a 16-state code that also guarantees DOF ≥ 2. In all of our SM-TC constructions, we assigned SM symbols to the branches of the trellis in such a way that a catastrophic code is avoided. We also guarantee DOF ≥ 2 for higher values of 𝑁 to maintain the diversity order of the system.</p></div>

SIMULATION RESULTS AND COMPARISONS</head><p>In this section, we present simulation results for the SM-TC scheme with different configurations and make comparisons with corresponding reference systems. The BER and FER performance of these schemes was evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations for various spectral efficiencies and numbers of states as a function of the average SNR per receive antenna. In all cases, we assumed that channel fading coefficients remain unchanged for 20 consecutive transmissions, which corresponds to a frame length of 20𝑘 bits for both the SM-TC and the reference systems operating at 𝑘 = 2, 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz spectral efficiencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Comparisons with the STTCs</head><p>In this subsection, we compare via computer simulations, the error performance of the proposed SM-TC scheme with that of STTCs for 2 and 3 bits/s/Hz spectral efficiencies. Note that STTCs have been designed and optimized for quasi-static fading channels and can be considered as TCM schemes for MIMO systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. We first performed simulations for 2 bits/s/Hz transmission with one and two receive antennas. In Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, the BER and FER performance of the proposed 4-, 8and 16-state SM-TC schemes is compared with 4-, 8and 16-state optimal QPSK STTCs with two transmit antennas, respectively. As seen from Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, the SM-TC schemes provide significant improvements in both BER and FER performance compared to the STTCs. It is also observed that with increasing number of states, the performance gap between SM-TC and STTC schemes increases since SM-TC provides higher coding gains with increasing complexity. Note that our 16-state code offers the highest improvement in both BER and FER performance over the 16-state STTC due to its third order time diversity compared to the second order diversity of the STTC. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> that a substantial amount of improvement is achieved in the FER performance especially for 8 and 16 states. Although the </p><formula xml:id="formula_74">SM-TC,4-st,n R =1 SM-TC,4-st,n R =2 STTC,4-st,n R =1 STTC,4-st,n R =2 SM-TC,8-st,n R =1 SM-TC,8-st,n R =2 STTC,8-st,n R =1 STTC,8-st,n R =2 SM-TC,16-st,n R =1 SM-TC,16-st,n R =2 STTC,16-st,n R =1 STTC,16-st,n R =2</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. BER performance for 4-,8and 16-state SM-TC and STTC schemes at 2 bits/s/Hz. worst case UPEP values of STTCs given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, are lower than those of SM-TC schemes for 4 and 8 states, the better FER performance of the SM-TC may be explained by two facts. First, we have optimized the distance spectra of SM-TC schemes; then, we conclude from Theorem 1 that error events with higher lengths can contribute UPEP values at higher time diversity orders.</p><p>Second, we carried out our simulations for 3 bits/s/Hz transmission. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">7</ref>, the BER performance of the proposed 8and 16-state SM-TC schemes is compared with that of 8and 16-state optimal 8-PSK STTCs for two transmit antennas. From Theorem 1 it follows that, for 3 bits/s/Hz transmission, the error performance gap between SM-TC schemes and STTCs becomes greater than that of the 2 bits/s/Hz case in favor of the SM-TC, since we employ eight transmit antennas in this case. B. Comparisons with the SM, coded V-BLAST and the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> In this subsection, we compare the BER performance of the proposed SM-TC scheme with that of uncoded SM, coded V-BLAST and the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. We have considered two types of coded V-BLAST systems. The first system, coded V-BLAST-I, was the vertically encoded (single coded) V-BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, where the incoming bits were first encoded by a single convolutional encoder, then the coded bits were demultiplexed into 𝑛 𝑇 parallel substreams, and each substream was interleaved and finally modulated. At the receiver, the transmitted symbols for all layers were detected, demodulated and deinterleaved. The bits of all layers were then multiplexed and given to the hard decision Viterbi decoder. In the second system, coded V-BLAST-II, we replaced the SM mapper block of our SM-TC scheme by a V-BLAST encoder. Similar to STTCs, a soft decision Viterbi decoder, which performs ML decoding by using the corresponding branch metrics, was considered. The scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> and coded V-BLAST-I employ 𝑅 = 1/2 convolutional codes with generator sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, respectively, while coded V-BLAST-II systems use the same convolutional codes as that of SM-TC schemes. In all simulations, we considered four receive antennas and the size of interleavers was chosen equal to 10000. For the simulations under correlated channel conditions, the SC model given in Section III was considered.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, simulation results are given for 3 bits/s/Hz transmission. In order to reach this efficiency, the SM employs four transmit antennas with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), coded V-BLAST-I and II systems employ three transmit antennas with QPSK, and the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> employs four transmit antennas with QPSK. As seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, when compared with the reference systems, our 8-state SM-TC scheme achieves the best BER performance for both uncorrelated (𝑟 = 0) and correlated (𝑟 = 0.7) channels due to its high diversity and coding gains. Note that spatial correlation only affects the asymptotic coding gain of our scheme which is consistent with the result of (27). As reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>, the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> outperforms coded V-BLAST-I under correlated SM, r=0 SM, r=0.7 coded V-BLAST-I, r=0 coded V-BLAST-I, r=0.7 scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, r=0 scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, r=0.7 coded V-BLAST-II, r=0 coded V-BLAST-II, r=0.7 SM-TC, r=0 SM-TC, r=0.7 Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. BER comparison at 3 bits/s/Hz for uncorrelated and correlated channels.</p><p>channel conditions, however it is outperformed by coded V-BLAST-I and SM for uncorrelated case. Simulation results for 4 bits/s/Hz transmission are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. For this spectral efficiency, the SM and coded V-BLAST-I employ four transmit antennas with QPSK, coded V-BLAST-II uses three transmit antennas with QPSK, and the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> uses four transmit antennas with 8-QAM. Similarly to the 3 bits/s/Hz case, our new 16-state code outperforms all of the reference systems. From Figs. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure">9</ref>, we conclude that our scheme and coded V-BLAST-II provide time diversity when compared with the SM, the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> and coded V-BLAST-I, at the price of increased complexity.</p><p>For a given spectral efficiency and number of trellis states, it is observed that the number of metric calculations performed by the soft decision Viterbi decoder is the same as SM-TC codes and STTCs. However, since only one transmit antenna is active in our scheme, contrary to the reference STTCs with the same trellis structure in which two antennas transmit simultaneously, SM-TC provides 25% and 33% reductions in the number of real multiplications and real additions per single branch metric calculation of the Viterbi decoder, respectively, for 2 bits/s/Hz, and these values increase to 30% and 37.5% for 3 bits/s/Hz. Similarly, the trellis decoding complexities of our scheme and coded V-BLAST-II are the same; however, per single metric calculation, our scheme provides 30% and 37.5% reductions in the number of real multiplications and real additions, respectively, for 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz. On the other hand, comparison of our scheme with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> in terms of the computational complexity does not seem to be fair, since as our scheme employs a soft decision decoder, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> employs a hard decision decoder. As far as the Viterbi decoding complexity is concerned, the complexity of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> is lower than our scheme because of the fact that the uncoded bits are employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> along with the coded bits, whereas all the bits are encoded in our scheme. However, as seen from the BER performance results shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">8</ref><ref type="figure">9</ref>, this complexity difference is compensated by a significant performance improvement provided by our scheme.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we have introduced a novel coded MIMO transmission scheme that directly combines trellis coding and SM. Although one transmit antenna is active during transmission, for quasi-static fading channels, we benefit from the time diversity provided by the SM-TC mechanism, which is forced by our code design criteria to create a kind of virtual interleaving by switching between the transmit antennas of a MIMO link. We have derived a general expression for the CPEP of the SM-TC scheme, and then, UPEP bounds for the SM-TC scheme have been obtained and resulting design criteria have been derived for quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. According to the SM-TC design criteria, we have proposed some new SM-TC codes which offer significant error performance improvements over alternatives while having a lower decoding complexity for 2, 3 and 4 bits/s/Hz transmissions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Type 4 :</head><label>4</label><figDesc>DOF = 3 and 𝑛 (𝜂) = 1, 𝑛 (η) = 1.
