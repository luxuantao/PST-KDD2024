<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In a world strongly dependent on distributed data communication, the design of secure IT infrastructures is a crucial task. At the core of computer security-sensitive applications are security protocols i.e., communication protocols aiming at providing security guarantees (such as authentication of principals or secrecy of some piece of information) through the application of cryptographic primitives. The problem is that-in spite of their apparent simplicity-the design of security protocols is notoriously error-prone. Many published protocols have been implemented and deployed in real applications only to be found flawed years later. (See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for a survey.) Quite interestingly, many attacks can be carried out without breaking cryptography. These attacks exploit weaknesses in the protocol that are due to the complex and unexpected interleavings of different protocol sessions as well as to the possible interference of malicious agents. Since these weaknesses are very difficult to spot by simple inspection of the protocol specification, security protocols are considered a new, promising application domain for formal methods.</p><p>In the last decade we have witnessed a dramatic speed-up of SAT solvers: problems with several thousands variables are now solved routinely in milliseconds by state-of-the-art SAT solvers. This has led to breakthroughs in important areas such as planning and model-checking of hardware. An interesting question is whether SAT solvers can lead to similar results also in security protocol analysis. In this paper we try to answer this question and we do this by presenting and evaluating (both theoretically and experimentally) a model checking technique for security protocols based on a reduction to propositional logic.</p><p>We model the problem of determining whether a security protocol fails to meet the security properties it is expected to enjoy as a reachability problem (called protocol insecurity problem) of a transition system specifying all the possible actions of the participating agents. Among the participating agents we include an active intruder that, besides overhearing and intercepting messages exchanged by honest participants, can also forge and send new messages. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> we specify protocol insecurity problems using a rule-based specification framework based on (order-sorted) multi-set rewriting. The state of the transition system is represented by a set of ground (i.e., variable-free) first-order atomic formulae called facts, while the allowed transitions are specified by rewrite rules modelling the abilities of the agents. Each rewrite rule is a declarative specification of the applicability conditions of the associated action (in terms of the facts that must hold in a state for the action to be applicable in it) and of its effects (namely, the facts that must be replaced from and added to the current state in order to obtain the next state).</p><p>It is well-known that solving protocol insecurity problems is undecidable in the general case <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. However, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, solving protocol insecurity problems with a bounded number of acyclic sessions (BNAS problems, for short) is NP-complete and hence decidable. In this paper we focus on the bounded protocol insecurity problem, i.e., the problem of determining whether any given security protocol is vulnerable to attacks of length k, for any given bound k &gt; 0. This problem is obviously decidable. Building decision procedures for the bounded protocol insecurity problem is important. In fact, any decision procedure for this problem can be used to build a semi-decision procedure for (unrestricted) protocol insecurity problems by simply doing iterative deepening on the value of k. Moreover it can be shown (by using the polynomial bounds on normal attacks discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>) that any given BNAS problem can be safely reduced to a bounded version of the problem with a value of k quadratic in the size of the protocol specification. Thus any decision procedure for the bounded protocol insecurity problem can be used as a decision procedure for BNAS problems.</p><p>Given a protocol insecurity problem and a positive integer k, i.e., given a bounded protocol insecurity problem, we show how to build a propositional formula whose models (if any) correspond to sequences R 1 , . . . , R k of sets of rules representing partial order attacks (of length k) on the protocol. (The idea is that rules in the same set R i , for i = 1, . . . , k, can be executed in any order, but all the rules in R i must be executed after the rules in R h , for all h &lt; i, and before the rules in R j , for all j &gt; i. Thus a partial order attack is a concise representation of all the attacks obtained by imposing a total ordering on the rules in R i for i = 1, . . . , k.) Thus, by using the approach described in this paper, finding attacks of bounded length boils down to generating and checking for satisfiability a propositional formula. Since for the solving phase we can rely on the efficiency of modern SAT solvers, in this paper we will focus on the issue of generating a propositional formula corresponding (in the sense specified above) to the bounded protocol insecurity problem given as input. This activity requires some ingenuity, as a naive approach to the problem leads to propositional formulae of unmanageable size even for relatively simple problems. The following techniques make our approach not only viable but also effective of many problems of practical interest:</p><p>Optimisations. We apply a number of optimising transformations on the input problem. The effect of these transformations is to reduce considerably the number of messages and the number of actions performed by the participating agents that need to be considered during the analysis. Quantifier-elimination. Existential quantifiers are used in our multi-set specification formalism to model the generation of fresh data. We provide two methods, that by eliminating the quantifiers from the protocol specification, remove the non-determinism associated with the generation of fresh data. Propositional encoding. We generate a propositional formula that encodes all possible partial order attacks of bounded length on the resulting protocol insecurity problem. We have adapted two encoding techniques originally developed for planning to the domain of security protocol analysis.</p><p>We have built a SAT-based model-checker (SATMC) for security protocols based on the above ideas. An abstract account of the internal functioning of SATMC is given by the procedure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. Given as input a protocol insecurity problem Ξ specified in our multi-set rewriting specification formalism and a bound k &gt; 0 (which can be set also to ∞), the procedure starts by optimising and removing the existential quantifiers from Ξ (lines 3 and 4 respectively) and then enters a loop (with increasing values of a counter i, initially set to 0) in which it builds a propositional formula [[Ξ ]] i representing all possible partial order attacks on Ξ of length ≤ i and stops as soon as (i) an attack is found (line 8) or (ii) the bound is reached (lines 5 and 10). If k is set to a positive number, then the procedure is a decision procedure for the corresponding bounded protocol insecurity problem. If k is set to ∞, then the procedure may not terminate and is a semidecision procedure for the corresponding protocol insecurity problem.</p><p>The approach neatly separates the encoding phase from the search activity that (if we neglect the external loop implementing the iterative deepening) is completely delegated to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> SAT-based model checking of security protocols the SAT solver. This is a very attractive feature as state-ofthe-art SAT solvers are very powerful search engines that combine the sheer speed ensured by finely tuned data structures and algorithms with the high sophistication of advanced search strategies which often lead to a dramatic pruning of the search space. Moreover, virtually all state-of-the-art SAT solvers accept propositional formulae in the same common format. This makes their integration immediate and their replacement (as soon as new, faster SAT solvers become available) almost effortless.</p><p>The encoding techniques we present in this paper are based on the idea to add a time-index to the facts and rules to indicate the time step in which the facts hold and the rules apply respectively. (Rules are ground first-order atomic formulae used to unambiguously refer to the ground instances of the rewrite rules.) Facts are thus indexed by 0 through k and rules by 0 through k -1. The propositional formula [[Ξ ]] i is obtained by conjoining (i) a set of 0-indexed facts specifying the initial state, (ii) a propositional combination of (k + 1)-indexed facts representing the set of states whose reachability implies the violation of the security property that the protocol is expected to guarantee, (iii) a set of formulae specifying the applicability conditions of the actions at time step i as well as their effects on the state at time step i + 1, for i = 0, . . . , k -1, (iv) a set of frame axioms stating that actions are the only cause of change, and (v) some further formulae whose form and meaning depend on the specific encoding technique employed.</p><p>As we will see, the size of the resulting propositional formula grows linearly in the number of facts and quadratically in the number of rules in the worst case. Unfortunately both the number of facts and rules (and hence also the size of the propositional formula) are in the worst case exponential in the size of the input security protocol specification. This result seems to limit the applicability of the approach to small protocols. However computer experiments, obtained by running SATMC on complex, industrial strength security protocols, show that our approach generates formulae of manageable size in most cases and exhibits performance comparable with (and in some cases better than) that of other state-of-the-art protocol analysers. We believe that this result is due to (i) the proper use of sort declarations in the protocol specifications, (ii) the effectiveness of the optimising transformations and of the encoding techniques, and (iii) the ability of the SAT solver to quickly solve complex combinatorial problems. The combined effect of (i) and (ii) makes the approach generate remarkably compact encodings, while (iii) allows SATMC to scale up smoothly as the number of sessions in the problem considered increases.</p><p>The technical contribution of the paper is fourfold:</p><p>-We provide an operational semantics for multi-set rewriting systems that takes into account the non-determinism associated with the generation of fresh data and show that this form of non-determinism can be safely eliminated. In most accounts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>) this is either taken for granted or abstracted away. -In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> we showed how encoding techniques originally developed for planning can be adapted and successfully applied to security protocol analysis. In this paper we provide a detailed account of these techniques and prove their soundness and completeness. -We provide a detailed and comprehensive account of our SAT-based model checking procedure for security protocols. We show that our procedure can be turned into a decision procedure for BNAS problems. -We provide a thorough experimental assessment of our approach obtained by running SATMC and two other state-of-the-art tools against a large set of protocol insecurity problems drawn from two publicly available libraries of security protocols. The experiments indicate that SATMC is more sensitive to the size of messages exchanged by the protocols than the other two tools considered but also that it scales better as the number of sessions increases. This is an interesting result that indicates that our approach is complementary to other state-of-theart techniques.</p><p>Structure of the paper. In Sect. 2 we give a brief presentation of the Needham-Schroeder Public-Key Protocol (NSPK) that will be used as a running example throughout the rest of the paper. (This section can be skipped by readers who are familiar with this protocol.) In Sect. 3 we show how the notion of protocol insecurity problem can be expressed as a reachability problem in a multi-set rewriting formalism. In Sect. 4, we focus on the problem of encoding bounded protocol insecurity problems into propositional logic. In Sect. 5 we discuss how the previously presented techniques can be put together to obtain a decision procedure for BNAS problems and, more in general, a semi-decision procedure for protocol insecurity problems. In Sect. 6 we present and analyse the experimental results. The related work is discussed in Sect. 7. We conclude in Sect. 8 with some final remarks. Proofs of the main results are given in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">An example: the NSPK protocol</head><p>We will use the well-known NSPK protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> as a running example throughout the paper. The NSPK protocol is intended to ensure the mutual authentication of the participating agents Alice and Bob through a challenge-response mechanism which is succinctly represented by following three protocol steps:</p><p>(1) Unfortunately the above argumentation (and hence the protocol) is flawed. While it is correct for Bob to conclude at the end of the protocol that N a has been generated by Alice, it might be the case that N a has been generated by Alice with a different purpose than authenticating with Bob. In the scenario of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> (corresponding to Lowe's attack on the NSPK protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>) nonce na is generated by Alice with the purpose of authenticating with Ives, but Ives mischievously reuses na by forging and sending the message {a, na} kb . In this way Ives tricks Bob into believing that Alice wishes to initiate the protocol with him. As a consequence of this, at the end Bob concludes he has successfully authenticated Alice and that they both agree with values of N a and N b, but this is obviously not the case. We model protocol insecurity problems as reachability problems associated with an order-sorted multi-set rewriting system specifying the behaviour of the honest agents as well as that of the intruder.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A → B : {A, N a} K b 123 (2) B → A : {N a, N b} K a (3) A → B : {N b} K b</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Order-sorted language</head><p>An order-sorted signature is a triple S, ≤, such that S, ≤ is a partially ordered set of sorts and is a set of function symbols, each equipped with a set of arities, i.e., a set of sequences of sorts s 1 , . . . , s n , s for some n ≥ 0. (We call individual constants the function symbols with n = 0.) We write f : s 1 , . . . , s n → s to indicate that s 1 , . . . , s n , s is an arity of f . Let V = V s s∈S be an S-indexed family of variables and let s ∈ S. We assume the usual inductive definition of -terms of sort s over V (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>). By T s ( , V ) we indicate the set of all -terms of sort s over V . A term without variables is said to be ground and we abbreviate T s ( , ∅) with T s ( ). Let X be a set, by |X | we denote the cardinality of X . If s is a sort, then we write |s| in place of |T s ( , V )| and we say that the cardinality of s is |T s ( , V )|.</p><p>We assume that S has sorts for messages (Msg), agent names (Agent), (a subset of the) natural numbers (Num), asymmetric cryptographic keys (Key), protocol steps (StepId), data identifiers (Id), and session identifiers (SessId). Furthermore, Agent ≤ Msg, Num ≤ Msg, Key ≤ Msg, StepId ≤ Num, and SessId ≤ Num. (Numbers are used to represent nonces, protocol steps, and protocol sessions.) Moreover we assume that has -individual constants for agents (e.g., a, b, i), for cryptographic keys (e.g., ka, kb, ki), for numbers, protocol step identifiers and session identifiers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, …); -function symbols for pairing ( _, _ : Msg, Msg → Msg), for symmetric encryption ({_} s _ : Msg, Msg → Msg), for asymmetric encryption ({_} _ : Msg, Key → Msg), and for denoting the inverse key (_ -1 : Key → Key). (Symbols for other cryptographic operators, e.g., hash functions, can be also included if needed.) Notice that any message can be used as a symmetric key: this allows us to model protocols of real-world complexity (e.g., TLS) in which symmetric keys are built out of several pieces of information.</p><p>We also assume that S contains two sort symbols Fact and Rule. We call fact terms and rule terms the terms in T Fact ( , V ) and T Rule ( , V ) respectively. (We call facts and rules the terms in T Fact ( ) and T Rule ( ) respectively.) Finally we call rule names the function symbols f such that f : s 1 , . . . , s n → Rule for some s 1 , . . . , s n ∈ S and n ≥ 0. We assume that fact terms are of the forms shown in the left column of  The informal meaning of these facts is explained in the right column. (Notice that, the last four rows describe fact terms used to express security properties and they will thus be discussed again only at the end of Sect. 3.4.) Finally we assume that S has sorts for freshly generated entities. For instance, fresh(Num) is the sort for nonces and fresh(Key) is the sort for session keys. In general if s is a basic sort, then fresh(s) is the corresponding sort of fresh elements and fresh(s) ≤ s. We assume that is extended with an enumerable set of individual constants (called fresh constants) for each sort of type fresh(s). We require that if c is a constant of sort fresh(s) for some s ∈ S, then fresh(s) is the only sort of c. If v ∈ V fresh(s) for some s ∈ S, then we say that v is a fresh variable. By -and V -we denote the result of dropping from and V the fresh constants and the fresh variables respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multi-set rewriting systems</head><p>Let O be a set of terms. By vars(O) we denote the set of variables occurring in O. Moreover we write x to denote a sequence of expressions x 1 , . . . , x n . With abuse of notation in the sequel we use x also to denote the set of the expressions in x. Context will disambiguate what is meant.</p><p>A multi-set rewriting system of signature S, ≤, over V is a pair Γ = I, R where I ⊆ T Fact ( -) is a multiset of facts representing the initial state of the system and R is a function mapping rule names into triples of the form L , x, ∃y.R called rewrite rules, where x is a sequence of the variables occurring in L, y is a sequence of fresh variables occurring in R, and L and R are multi-sets of terms in T Fact ( -, V -) and T Fact ( -, V ) respectively with (vars(R)\y) ⊆ vars(L). In this paper we will restrict our attention to the simpler class of multi-set rewriting systems in which all the multi-sets are just sets. We will write (L</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r (x) --→ ∃y.R) ∈ R (or even (L r (x)</formula><p>--→ ∃y.R), when R can be inferred from the context) in place of R(r ) = L , x, ∃y.R . If y is the empty sequence of variables, then we will abbreviate ∃y.R with R. Moreover if f and f s are a fact term and a set of fact terms respectively, then we write f f s in place of { f } ∪ f s and f in place of { f }.</p><p>A possible initial state S 0 for the intruder i and two honest agents a and b involved in two concurrent sessions of the NSPK is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">state(0, a, a, [a, i, ka, ka -1 , ki], 1)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>state(0, a, a, [a, b, ka, ka</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">-1 , kb], 2) state(1, a, b, [b, a, kb, kb -1 , ka], 2)<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">ik(i) ik(a) ik(b) ik(ki) ik(ki -1 ) ik(ka) ik(kb)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Fact (1) represents the initial state of the honest agent a playing the role of initiator in session 1 and knowing her own identity, the identity of the intruder (the agent she would like to talk with), her own public and private keys, and the public key of the intruder. Facts (2) represent the initial state of the honest agents a and b involved as initiator and responder (respectively) in session 2. Facts (3) represent the terms initially known by the intruder. Rewrite rules modelling the behaviour of the honest agents in the NSPK protocol are given in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Rewrite rule (4) is applicable to the state comprising facts (1) and (2) when in the substitution the variables A, B, Ka, Kb, and S are instan-Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Rewrite rules for the honest agents in the NSPK protocol Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Rewrite rules for the intruder tiated with a, i, ka, ki, and 1 respectively, possibly leading to the state:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">state(2, i, a, [na, a, i, ka, ka -1 , ki], 1) msg(1, a, i, { a, na } ki ) state(0, a, a, [a, b, ka, ka -1 , kb], 2) state(1, a, b, [b, a, kb, kb -1 , ka], 2)</formula><p>where na is an individual constant of sort fresh(Num). As effect of the application of the rule, agent a (i) has sent message { a, na } ki to the intruder i, (ii) has extended her knowledge with the nonce na, and (iii) is ready to execute step 2 of the protocol as witnessed by the fact state(2, i, a, [na, a, i, ka, ka -1 , ki], 1) occurring in the state. Notice that all the other facts occurring in the initial state are automatically inherited by the new state. The second step of the NSPK protocol in which the responder receives the challenge generated by the initiator and replies with his own nonce, is modelled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The state of the responder is updated by incrementing the protocol step and by extending the knowledge with the acquired information, namely the nonce sent by the initiator and the nonce freshly generated by the responder itself. Moreover, the message { Na, Nb } Ka is sent to A. The remaining steps of the protocol are modelled by ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>We consider the Dolev-Yao model of the intruder <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The Dolev-Yao intruder has complete control of the network: he can overhear and divert messages, and by using the knowledge gleaned from the observed traffic he forges and sends fraudulent messages to the honest participants. These abilities are modelled by the rules of Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Rewrite rule (8) models the ability of the intruder of diverting the information exchanged by the honest participants. It states that, if a message has been sent on the communication channel, then the intruder can read its content and remove it from the channel. The rules (9), <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and (11) model the ability of composing messages by encrypting with a known key and by pairing known messages. The deduction of new knowledge by decryption (via known keys) and pair decomposition is modelled by the rules (12), <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Finally, the ability to send arbitrary messages (possibly faking somebody else's identity in doing so) is modelled by the rewrite rules of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, for all terms j of sort StepId:</p><p>Notice that the decryption key must be known in order to extract the plaintext from the cyphertext. This is commonly known as the perfect cryptography assumption. This assumption is important as it allows us to abstract from the cryptosystem and focus on the logic of the protocol.</p><p>We also make the so called strong typing assumption that rules out type-flaw attacks, i.e., attacks where a field that was originally intended to have one type is subsequently interpreted as having another type. A tagging mechanism that allows for the implementation of protocols enjoying the strong typing assumption is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Operational semantics</head><p>A multi-set rewriting system defines a state transition systems whose states are represented by sets of facts. If S is a set of facts, then we interpret the facts in S as the propositions holding in the state represented by S, all other facts being false in that state (closed-world assumption). A (ground) substitution is a total function mapping the variables in V in (ground, resp.) terms of the same sort. Let (L ρ -→ ∃y.R) ∈ R, σ be a ground substitution, and S be a set of facts. If Lσ ⊆ S, then we say that rule instance ρ, σ is applicable in S and that S = app ρ,σ (S) = (S\Lσ ) ∪ Rσ is the state resulting from the execution of ρ, σ in S. Under the same hypotheses we say that rule ρσ is applicable in S and that S is a state resulting from an execution of ρσ in S.</p><p>Thus a rule models an action that may non-deterministically lead to many (possibly infinite) successor states. For example, all the rule instances corresponding to the rewrite rule (4) are of the form ρ, σ with σ = {a/A, b/B, ka/Ka, kb/Kb, 1/S, n/Na} for any constant n of sort fresh(Num) and all of them correspond to the rule step 1 (a, b, ka, kb, 1). Thus starting from a given state, the execution of a rule may nondeterministically lead the system into different (possibly infinitely many) successor states. At a first sight this seems a serious problem for automatic analysis as each rule application seems to lead to an infinite branching. However, as we will see below, this is a form of "don't care non-determinism". This means that no branching at all is needed when considering the application of a rule during the analysis as any (arbitrarily chosen) rule instance will serve as representative of all the others.</p><p>A path is an alternating sequence of states and rule instances S 0 ρ 1 , σ 1 S 1 • • • S n-1 ρ n , σ n S n such that, for i = 1, . . . , n, 1. S i = app ρ i ,σ i (S i-1 ), i.e., S i is a state resulting from the execution of ρ i σ i in S i-1 ; 2. if y and y are existentially quantified variables of ρ i and ρ j (resp.) and σ i (y) = σ j (y ), then i = j and y = y for all i, j = 1, . . . , n, i.e., the substitutions σ 1 , . . . , σ n not only associate different existentially quantified variables with different terms but also associate occurrences at different execution steps of the same existentially quantified variable with different fresh constants.</p><p>If, additionally, S 0 ⊆ I, then we say that the path is initialised. Condition (2) ensures that existentially quantified variables are replaced by fresh terms representing newly generated data (e.g., nonces and session keys). Notice also that the above definition-by excluding the simultaneous execution of two (or more) rules-enforces an interleaving semantics. This is a common assumption in security protocol analysis as it rules out execution paths (and hence attacks) that are difficult to reproduce in practice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 1</head><p>The protocol insecurity problem associated with the NSPK protocol that we presented in Sect. 3.2 consists of two sessions only: one between agent a and the intruder with session identifier 1 (cf. fact (1) in the initial state) and one between agents a and b with session identifier 2 (cf. fact <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> in the initial state). It is possible to add the ability to generate an unbounded number of sessions, each involving two new agents, by extending the protocol insecurity problem with the following rewrite rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">new_session(X,Y,KX,KY,NS) ------------------→ ∃X.Y.KX.KY.NS. state(0, X, X, [X, Y, KX, KX -1 , KY], NS) state(1, X, Y, [Y, X, KY, KY -1 , KX], NS)</formula><p>Notice that this rewrite rule has an empty left-handside and therefore it can be applied in any state. For each execution of the rewrite rule two new agents (X and Y), their public (KX, KY) and private keys (KX -1 , KY -1 ), and a session identifier (NS) are freshly generated. These values define a new session of the NSPK protocol played by agents X and Y.</p><p>Not surprisingly, because of this expressiveness solving a protocol insecurity problem is undecidable in the general case. (As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> the Post Correspondence Problem can be recast as a protocol insecurity problem.) However, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, in some cases it is possible to reduce the general protocol insecurity problem to a protocol insecurity problem for the same protocol but comprising a small number of acyclic sessions (i.e., it can be reduced to a BNAS problem). Moreover violations of the security properties often exploit only a small number of sessions. (This claim is substantiated by the empirical observation that all flawed protocols in the Clark-Jacob's library <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> suffers from attacks that exploit at most two sessions.)</p><p>Since BNAS problems are an important, decidable class of protocol insecurity problems we now provide a syntactic characterisation of this class of problems inspired by the definition of bounded role theory given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Let Ξ be a protocol insecurity problem. We say that Ξ is a protocol insecurity problem with a bounded number of acyclic sessions (BNAS problem, for short) if, and only if, there exists an anti-reflexive and transitive relation ≺ over a finite set {S 0 , S 1 , . . . , S t } of state facts such that (i) if S i ≺ S j , then S i σ ≺ S j σ for each substitution σ and (ii) for each rewrite rule (L</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">r (x)</formula><p>--→ ∃y.R) of an honest agent there is exactly one occurrence of a state fact in L and R, say S i and S j resp., and it must be the case that S i ≺ S j . The definition basically states that in each execution path the number of applications of the rules of the honest agents is finite and that each rule instance can be applied at most once. This justifies the name BNAS since it guarantees that the number of sessions associated to a BNAS problem is finite and that the sessions are acyclic. Notice that the number of sessions (in general defined as the number of different session identifiers occurring in the state facts of the reachable states) can be easily computed for BNAS problems by a static inspection of the input specification. (This usually amounts to counting the number of different session identifiers occurring in the state facts of the initial state.)</p><p>It is immediate to see that the protocol insecurity problem previously specified for the NSPK protocol is a BNAS problem with two sessions. To show this it suffices to collect the state facts occurring in the rules of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and define state(i, _, A, _, S) ≺ state( j, _, A, _, S) if, and only if, i &lt; j. Moreover, since the application of every rule of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> just advances the state of an agent by leaving him in the same session he was involved in, then the number of sessions is given by the number of different session identifiers (namely 1 and 2) occurring in the state facts of the initial state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Optimising transformations on protocol insecurity problems</head><p>The notion of protocol insecurity problem we have outlined so far is accurate but not adequate to carry out automatic analysis in an efficient way. The main problem rests with the specification of the intruder that allows to forge messages that cannot be possibly used to mount an attack on the protocol. This can be avoided by providing a refined model of the intruder that forges a message only if it can be accepted by a honest participant. Moreover it is possible to drastically reduce the number of transitions (while retaining all the possible attacks on the protocol) by merging some intruder rules with protocol steps carried out by the honest participants. We now discuss in more details these optimisations.</p><p>Step compression. An effective optimisation, called step compression has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The key idea is to replace the rewrite rules of the honest agents and those modelling the ability of the intruder to fake and divert messages with a new set of rewrite rules obtained by merging these rewrite rules. This amounts to changing the model of the problem by regarding the intruder and the network as a single entity and by assuming that (i) every message sent by a honest agent is received by the intruder and that (ii) every message received by a honest agents has been generated by the intruder. The step compression optimisation removes the intruder rules ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and replaces every rule of the honest agents, i.e., msg( j, s, r, m) state( j, s, r, ms, c)</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">r (x) --→ ∃y. msg( j , r, r , m ) state( j , s , r, ms , c)<label>(16)</label></formula><p>with ik(m) state( j, s, r, ms, c)</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">sc_r (x) ----→ ∃y. ik(m) ik(m ) state( j , s , r, ms , c)<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Notice that the above transformation has to be slightly adapted for those rules that do not have a message fact in either the left hand side or the right hand side (cf. rules ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). More specifically: when msg( j, s, r, m) does not occur in the left-hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">16</ref>), then ik(m) will not occur in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>; when msg( j , r, r , m ) does not occur in the right-hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">16</ref>), then ik(m ) will not occur in the right-hand side of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. We say that m is the reception pattern of the rule. For instance, the step compressed rewrite rule corresponding to ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ik({ Na, Nb } Ka ) state(2, B, A, [Na, A, B, Ka, Ka -1 , Kb], S) sc_step 3 (A,B,Ka,Kb,Na,Nb,S) -------------------→ ik({ Na, Nb } Ka ) ik({Nb} Kb ) state(4, B, A, [Nb, Na, A, B, Ka, Ka -1 , Kb], S)<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Specialisation of the composition rules. Let us assume that the step compression optimisation has been applied to the input protocol insecurity problem. The intuition behind our second optimisation is to build in the left-hand side of the rewrite rules of the honest agents the ability to compose all the possible messages matching their reception patterns. This gives us a new version of these rules and allows us to remove the composition rules of the intruder, namely ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. The rationale for this optimising transformation rests on the following fact borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>: we can safely restrict our attention to those intruder knowledge derivations in which all the decomposition rules are applied before all the composition rules.</p><p>Let m ∈ T Msg ( , V ), M be a set of subsets of</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">T Msg ( , V ), and c * -→ ( d *</formula><p>-→) be the reflexive and transitive closure of the rewrite relation defined by the rewrite rules ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) (( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), resp.).

For instance, both M 1 = {ik({ Na, Nb } Ka ), ik(Na) ik(Nb) ik(Ka)} and M 2 = {ik({ Na, Nb } Ka ), ik(Na) ik(Nb) ik(Ka), ik( Na, Nb ) ik(Ka)} are generators of { Na, Nb } Ka , while M 3 = {ik(Na) ik(Nb) ik(Ka)} is not, as ik({ na, nb } ka ) c * -→ ik({ na, nb } ka ), but ik({ na, nb } ka ) d * --→ik(na) ik(nb) ik(ka).</formula><p>The optimisation amounts to removing all the composition rules of the intruder and then to replacing each step compressed rewrite rule of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> by a new set, say RC(sc_r ), of rewrite rules ik(M) state( j, s, r, ms, c)</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">sc_r l (x) -----→ ∃y. ik(M) ik(m ) state( j , s , r, ms , c)</formula><p>for each ik(M) ∈ M, where M is a generator of the reception pattern m. Notice that each path of the resulting protocol insecurity problem contains at most one application of the rules in RC(sc_r ). In fact, all the rules in RC(sc_r ) have the same state fact in the left hand side, namely state( j, s, r, ms, c), and this very same fact is deleted from the state by applying any such rule.</p><p>A simple way to compute a generator of a given reception pattern m is M = {ik(M) | M ⊆ T Msg ( , V ) and ik(m) → * ik(M)}, where → * is the reflexive and transitive closure of the rewrite relation defined by the rewrite rules of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>. (Notice that these rewrite rules model the backward representation of the composition rules of the intruder.) It must be noted that in the worst case, i.e., when the tree representation of m is a complete binary tree with n nodes all labelled by the pairing operator, the cardinality of M is exponential in n. (This follows from (i) the observation that there exists a bijection between the elements of M and the set of strongly binary trees of depth d = log 2 n and (ii) the fact that the number of strongly binary trees of depth d is equal to c 2 d , where c 1.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.) However a dramatic reduction of the cardinality of M may be obtained by dropping from M all the Let us now consider the application of the optimisation to the rewrite rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. The reception pattern is is m = { Na, Nb } Ka }. By applying the above method, we obtain M 1 = {ik({ Na, Nb } Ka ), ik(Na) ik(Nb) ik(Ka)} as generator of m and thus we can generate the following two specialised rewrite rules:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ik({ Na, Nb } Ka ) state(2, B, A, [Na, A, B, Ka, Ka -1 , Kb], S) sc_step 1 3 (A,B,Ka,Kb,Na,Nb,S) -------------------→ ik({ Na, Nb } Ka ) ik({Nb} Kb ) state(4, B, A, [Nb, Na, A, B, Ka, Ka -1 , Kb], S) ik(Na) ik(Nb) ik(Ka) state(2, B, A, [Na, A, B, Ka, Ka -1 , Kb], S) sc_step 2 3 (A,B,Ka,Kb,Na,Nb,S) -------------------→ ik(Na) ik(Nb) ik(Ka) ik({Nb} Kb ) state(4, B, A, [Nb, Na, A, B, Ka, Ka -1 , Kb], S)</formula><p>Since each rewrite rule is replaced by |M| new rewrite rules, for the effectiveness of the optimisation it is necessary that the generators have finite cardinality. For this reason we apply this optimisation only to those problems in which the size of all the ground instances of the reception patterns is bounded. Although this requirement is apparently quite restrictive, many complex protocols (e.g., Kerberos, AAA Mobile IP, and Fair ZG) meet this condition provided that their implementation adds enough redundancy to the messages to allow the agents to check the well-formedness of the received messages. (A tagging mechanism that achieves this is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.) The following example illustrates the point.</p><p>Example 2 Let us consider the following protocol fragment where a server S generates and then secretly distributes a nonce N to agents A and B.

A first, general approach to quantifier elimination amounts to extending the state of the system with a counter whose value is used and incremented every time a fresh term is built. More in detail, a fact of the form c(0) is added to the initial state of the system and then every rule (L r (x) --→ ∃y.R) where y = y 1 , . . . , y n is replaced with</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">c(z) L r (x,z) ---→ c(s(z)) R</formula><p>where z is a variable of sort Num that does not occur in R and R is obtained from R by substituting every occurrence of y i with f i (z) where f i is a new function symbol (of the appropriate arity) for i = 1, . . . , n. Intuitively the term f i (z) denotes the fresh value generated by the execution of the rule and associated with the existentially quantified variable y i . For example, the rewrite rule ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is transformed into:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">c(C) state(0, A, A, [A, B, Ka, Ka -1 , Kb], S) step 1 (A,B,C,Ka,Kb,S) -------------→ c(s(C)) state(2, B, A, [f 1 (C), A, B, Ka, Ka -1 , Kb], S) msg(1, A, B, { A, f 1 (C) } Kb )</formula><p>It is easy to see that this simple transformation guarantees the uniqueness of fresh terms and hence that the resulting protocol insecurity problems is attack-equivalent to the original one.</p><p>An alternative approach to quantifier elimination, which can be applied effectively to BNAS protocol insecurity problems, amounts to determining in advance a set of ground terms U representing all fresh values that can possibly be generated during execution and transforming the protocol insecurity problem in the following way. (Notice that for BNAS protocol insecurity problems the set U has necessarily finite size.) The initial state is extended with a fact of the form fresh(t) (stating that the value denoted by t has not been used before) for each t ∈ U . Every rule of the form (L state( j, s, r, w, c) ρ -→ ∃y.R), where y = y 1 , . . . , y n and w is a term representing the messages known by agent r , is then replaced with L state( j, s, r, w, c) fresh(t 1 ) . . . fresh(t n ) ρ -→ R where t i = f i (r, j, c) (with f i a new function symbol of the appropriate arity) and R is obtained from R by substituting y i with t i for i = 1, . . . , n.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Partial order solutions</head><p>Even though we are assuming an interleaving semantics for protocol insecurity problems, considering the parallel execution of rewrite rules may have significant advantages. In fact the parallel execution of two (or more) rules often leads to a state which would be anyway reachable by applying the same rules sequentially in some order. To illustrate, consider the situation in which you want to execute the rewrite rules in {off i act i ---→ on i : i = 1, . . . , n} so to activate n alarm devices through n different switches. It is immediate to see that the parallel execution of act 1 , . . . , act n leads (in a single step) to the same state obtained by applying the rules in sequence and in any order. Thus by enabling parallelism we may obtain shorter solutions and, as it will be clear in the next section, smaller encodings. However, in some cases the parallel execution of two (or more) rules leads to a state which is not reachable by applying the same rules sequentially in any order. For instance, the parallel execution of the rewrite rules a We are thus interested in enabling a restricted form of parallelism which ensures that all the parallel executions of the rules lead to a state which is reachable by applying the same individual rules sequentially in some order.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity from here on we focus on ground reachability problems, i.e., reachability problems of a given signature S, over the empty set of variables. This is without loss of generality as any given quantifier-free protocol insecurity problem Ξ = Γ, G, C can be thought as a concise representation of the protocol insecurity problem obtained from Ξ by replacing (i) the rewrite rules of Γ with the corresponding ground instances, (ii) G with the disjunction of all its instances satisfying the constraints in C, and (iii) C with the empty set.

If the attack is spurious, then a set of pairs of interfering rules are extracted from the attack, a set of clauses excluding the simultaneous execution of interfering rules is added to the formula, and the whole procedure is iterated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">The graphplan-based encoding</head><p>We recall that by using the linear encoding the formula representing the transition relation, namely T (f i , ρ i , f i+1 ), is independent from the time step i. From this it follows that important simplifications are possible on this formula. For instance, not all the rules are applicable at time step 0, yet the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">T (f 0 , ρ 0 , f 1 ) (36)</formula><p>encodes the effects of all possible rules, also those that are not applicable in the initial state. By looking at the initial state it is possible to build a simpler version of (36), say T 0 (f 0 , ρ 0 , f 1 ), specifying the effect of only those rules that are applicable in the initial state. The same line of reasoning can be applied at the subsequent steps: by computing an over-approximation of the reachable states at time step i we can then determine a simplified encoding of the transition relation at time step i, say T i (f i , ρ i , f i+1 ), for i = 0, . . . , k -1. Formally, the simplified encoding of such an over-approximation will be such that for every j = 0, . . . , k the formulae encoding the (multi)-set rewriting system by means of the linear encoding, i.e., I (f 0 )∧ j-1 i=0 T (f i , ρ i , f i+1 ), and by means of the graphplan-based encoding, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">I (f 0 ) ∧ j-1 i=0 T i (f i , ρ i , f i+1 ), are logically equivalent.</formula><p>The graphplan-based encoding is defined on the basis of the above ideas. Preliminary to the generation of the encoding is the construction of a data structure, called planning graph, used to determine for each time step an over-approximation of the reachable states. More in general, the planning graph concisely represents an over-approximation of the forward search tree and the encoding of the transition relation can be drastically simplified by exploiting this information.</p><p>In the rest of this section we will first describe how to construct a planning graph representing the over-approximation of the reachable states for the time step k, and then we will present how to exploit such an over-approximation while building the propositional formula I (f 0 ) ∧ k-1 i=0 T i (f i , ρ i , f i+1 ) that encodes the unfolding of the transition relation up to k steps.</p><p>The k-planning graph for Γ is a directed acyclic graph</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">([Γ ]) k = N f , N ρ , --→ pre , --→ add , -→ del , ⊕ f , ⊕ ρ</formula><p>where N f is a time-indexed family of sets of fact nodes, i.e., N i f ⊆ F is the set of fact nodes of layer i, for i = 0, . . . , k; similarly N ρ ⊆ L is a time-indexed family of sets of rule nodes, i.e., N i ρ is the set of rule nodes of layer i for i = 0, . . . , k -1; --→ pre , --→ add , and -→ del are time-indexed binary relations between rule nodes and fact nodes, i.e., --→</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">pre i ⊆ N i ρ × N i f , --→ add i ⊆ N i ρ × N i+1 f , and -→ del i ⊆ N i ρ × N i+1</formula><p>f , whose instances are called preconditions, add, and delete edges respectively, for i = 0, . . . , k -1; finally ⊕ f and ⊕ ρ are time-indexed (irreflexive and commutative) relations of mutual exclusion (mutex for short) between facts (i.e., ⊕ i f ⊆ N i f × N i f ) and rules (i.e., ⊕ j ρ ⊆ N j ρ × N j ρ ) respectively, for i = 0, . . . , k and j = 0, . . . , k -1.</p><p>As a preliminary step to the construction of the k-planning graph for Γ the sets L and R are extended with the nooperation rule labels and rules of the form nop( f ) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">( f nop( f )</formula><p>----→ f ) respectively, for all f ∈ F.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SAT-based model checking for security protocol analysis</head><p>The techniques presented in the previous sections are the fundamental building blocks of the SAT-based model checking procedure outlined in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. In particular -the optimising transformations on the input protocol insecurity problem described in Sect. 3.5 are applied at line 3 of the procedure, -the techniques for the elimination of quantifiers presented in Sect. 4.1 are applied at line 4, and -the encoding techniques described in Sect. 4.3 are applied at line 6. Notice that [[Ξ ]] i needs not be computed from scratch at each iteration. When building [[Ξ ]] i it is in fact possible to reuse (selected parts of) the formula generated at the previous step thereby speeding up significantly the whole procedure.</p><p>We recall that (by setting k to ∞) the procedure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> can be used as a semi-decision procedure for the input protocol insecurity problem Ξ , i.e., the procedure halts with a solution when it exists, but it may not terminate otherwise. In the rest of this section we discuss the termination and the complexity of the procedure when applied to a BNAS protocol insecurity problem Ξ . Let n be the DAG size of Ξ .</p><p>Termination. We know from <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> that for every attack on Ξ there exists an attack on Ξ such that between the consecutive application of two rules of the honest agents there are at most 3n 2 applications of the intruder rules. Since sessions are acyclic, the maximal number of rules of the honest agents occurring in an attack is r * s, where r and s are the number of rules of the honest agents and the number of sessions in Ξ . Therefore we can restrict our attention to attacks of length ≤ k max , where k max = 3n 2 (r * s + 1). Thus the procedure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> is a decision procedure for BNAS problems provided that we add the following line between lines 8 and 9:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">. If [[Ξ ]]</head><p>i is unsatisfiable and i ≥ k max , then print "No attack exists for the BNAS input problem" and then halt.</p><p>A smaller value for k max can be computed whenever the specialisation of the composition rules of the intruder described in Sect. 3.5 is applicable. Let Ξ be the result of applying this optimisation to Ξ . Since the composition rules of the intruder are built into the rules of the honest agents, the only possible activity that the intruder can do in between two applications of rules of the honest agents is to apply a sequence of decomposition rules. It is easy to see that this sequence can comprise at most d -1 applications of decomposition rules, where d is the maximal depth of the messages occurring in the right hand side of the rewrite rules of Ξ . Thus k max = (d -1)(r * s + 1) suffices. In fact the application of the optimising transformation to Ξ does not change the number of sessions and, although the number of rules in Ξ is usually greater than that of Ξ , each path will contain at most r application of the (specialised) rules of the honest agents. (We recall from Sect. 3.5 that each path of Ξ contains at most one application of the rules in RC(sc_r ) for each step compressed rule sc_r of Ξ .) For the two-sessions variant of the NSPK protocol with the Lowe's fix <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, well-known to be not flawed when type-flaw attacks are neglected, we can thus safely bound our analysis to k max = (3 -1)(4 * 2 + 1) = 18 steps.</p><p>Under the same hypotheses, there is another, usually very effective approach to determine whether [[Ξ ]] i covers all possible attacks of Ξ , and thus to enforce an early (but still safe) termination of the procedure when the graphplan-based encoding is applied. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> we say that a planning graph ([Γ ]) i has levelled-off when two adjacent fact levels are identical. The following result, which applies to BNAS problems obtained by specialising the composition rules of the intruder as described in Sect. 3.5, ensures that when the planning graph has levelled off, if the current formula [[Ξ ]] i is unsatisfiable then there is no attack on Ξ . (Notice that for BNAS problems obtained by specialising the composition rules of the intruder, the planning graph is always guaranteed to reach the levelled-off.) Theorem 7 Let Ξ = Γ, B be a BNAS problem obtained by specialising the composition rules of the intruder as described in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.5. When ([Γ ]) i has levelled-off, if [[Ξ ]]</head><p>i is unsatisfiable, then there is no attack on Ξ . By using the above result we can thus further improve the procedure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> by adding the following line just after line 8:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">. If the planning graph has levelled off and [[Ξ ]</head><p>] i is unsatisfiable, then print "No attack exists for the BNAS input problem" and then halt.</p><p>Notice that in this way the procedure can conclude that the protocol is secure without reaching k max . For the two-sessions variant of the NSPK protocol with the Lowe's fix the procedure halts at i = 7, thereby saving 11 iterations.</p><p>Complexity. We now discuss the complexity of our model checking procedure when used as a decision procedures for BNAS problems. We start by first looking at the complexity of the individual steps of the procedure and then we discuss the complexity of the overall procedure. We consider both variants of the procedure we have just outlined.</p><p>-Optimising transformations (line 3 As we previously said, the iterations of the while loop of the procedure is bound by k max , where k max is polynomial in n.</p><p>To summarise, in the worst case, our decision procedure generates and solves polynomially many propositional formulae whose size is at most exponential in the size of the input specification. Though this complexity result seems to limit the applicability of the approach to small size protocols, in the next section we will see that our approach generates formulae of manageable size which are quickly solved by the SAT solver in many cases of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experimental results</head><p>We have implemented the above ideas in SATMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a SAT-based Model Checker for the automatic analysis of security protocols. SATMC is available at http://www.ai.dist. unige.it/satmc. SATMC is also integrated in the AVISPA Tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, a push-button tool for the automated validation of Internet security-sensitive protocols and applications, and can be used on-line via the AVISPA graphical user interface available at http://www.avispa-project.org.</p><p>We thoroughly assessed our approach by running SATMC on a large set of protocols drawn from so-called Clark-Jacob library and the AVISPA Library. The Clark-Jacob library <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is a collection of small and medium-sized authentication protocols. The AVISPA Library (available at http:// www.avispa-project.org) is a selection of practically relevant, industrial protocols that have recently been standardised or are currently undergoing standardisation, especially at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). For each protocol we consider a BNAS problem modelling a scenario consisting of a bounded number of sessions in which the involved principals exchange messages over a channel controlled by a Dolev-Yao intruder. These BNAS problems are automatically generated by the AVISPA Tool starting from a protocol specification in a higher level specification language called HLPSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. All the experimental results presented in this section have been obtained by setting a resource limit of 1 h CPU time and 1 GB memory, on a Pentium IV 2.4 GHz under Linux. SATMC is invoked with k set to ∞ on all the problem considered and the tool always terminates by either reporting an attack, by positively concluding that no attack is possible on the given problem, or by exhausting the available resources.</p><p>In order to fine tune our techniques and quantitatively assess the relative merits of the encoding techniques discussed in Sect. 4 we run the encoding techniques (including some variants thereof) implemented in SATMC against a selection of (flawed) security protocols drawn from the Clark-Jacob library. We found that the linear encoding performs best when used in conjunction with the abstraction/ refinement strategy discussed in Sect. 4.3.1. We also found that the graphplan-based encoding performs best if we weaken the definition of ⊕ by enforcing only static mutexes (i.e., by neglecting PG5 and by considering only case (a) of clause PG4 in the definition of the planning graph given in Sect. 4.3.2). By using this weaker version of the mutex relation we obtain a coarser over-approximation of the set of the reachable states. Our experimental results indicate that this loss of precision in the construction of the planning graph is largely compensated by a drastic reduction in the time spent to build the planning graph.</p><p>The best results obtained with each encoding are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">2</ref>. For each protocol we give the smallest value of k at which the attack is found (K) and for each encoding technique we give the number of propositional variables (A) and clauses (CL) in the SAT formula, the time spent to generate the SAT formulae (EncT) and the total time spent by the SAT solver to solve the SAT formulae (SolT). The comparison shows that, by using the graphplan-based encoding technique, we obtain (i) SAT instances whose size is up to 3 orders of magnitude smaller and (ii) significantly better encoding and solving times. Moreover by using the graphplan-based encoding SATMC succeeds in analysing protocols (e.g., the KLS rep. protocol) that otherwise are not solved with the given resources.</p><p>We have then compared SATMC against two other stateof-the-art protocol analysers integrated in the AVISPA Tool, namely CL-AtSe <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref> and OFMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, by running them against the security protocols in the AVISPA Library. The results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref>. These results are obtained by assuming that all the messages exchanged are well-typed and that they are freely generated. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> For each protocol we give the number of security problems analysed ("#Pb") and the number of problems for which attacks are detected ("#Att"), and for each back-end, the average time spent by the back-end to analyse (i.e., either to find the attacks or to report that no attack exists in the scenario considered) a single problem of the protocol. For SATMC we report only the time spent by the back-end to generate the SAT formula, since in this case the time spent by the SAT-solver-we used the Chaff solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> for these experiments-to solve the formula is negligible.</p><p>The boxed number associated with ISO-PK-3 (corresponding to the ISO Public Key Two-Pass Mutual Authentication protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>) indicates that the back-ends have found a new (i.e., previously unknown) attack on the protocol. It was already known that ISO-PK3 is vulnerable to replay attacks and hence it does not provide strong authentication <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> as nothing in the messages ensures the freshness of the messages for the responder. Our analysis, however, shows that the ISO-PK3 protocol does not even guarantee weak authentication, i.e., after successfully executing the protocol, neither the initiator nor the responder can be sure about the authenticity of the exchanged messages.</p><p>In general the experiments indicate that the time spent by SATMC and by the other tools is small for all the problems. More in particular, OFMC and CL-AtSe are very fast and performs better than SATMC in many cases whereas SAT-MC performs slightly better on some instances (namely Fair-ZG and PBK-fix-weak-auth) and on a few protocols (namely By inspecting the problems used for the experiments of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref> it possible to conclude that OFMC and CL-AtSe are less sensitive than SATMC to the size of messages exchanged by the protocols. This is not surprising since we know that the complexity of our approach depends on the size of the messages exchanged. We also noticed that SATMC is less sensitive than OFMC and CL-AtSe to the number of con- current sessions considered. To verify this we then run all the three tools against problems modelling both the flawed and the fixed variants of the NSPK-KS protocol (i.e., the Needham-Schroeder Public Key protocol including the keyserver <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>) for increasing numbers of concurrent sessions. The experimental results, summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">4</ref>, indicate that OFMC and CL-AtSe fail to analyse the problem within the given resources when more than three sessions are considered, whereas SATMC successfully analyse all the problems considered and scales very smoothly as the number of sessions increases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">SAT-based automated reasoning techniques</head><p>Planning as satisfiability. We have greatly benefited from the experience matured in the area of "Planning as Satisfiability" initiated by the seminal paper by Kautz and Selman <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. While the encoding techniques we use are adapted from those proposed for planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, their application to the automatic analysis of security protocols is new as new are the proofs of soundness and correctness of the encodings of Sect. 4. Proofs of similar results have been recently and independently developed for planning by Rintanen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>However their results apply to linear encodings only, whereas our approach is more general as it applies to graphplan-based encodings as well. In the same paper the authors propose encodings that may lead to shorter solutions than that allowed by the encodings used in our paper. This is an interesting feature, but its application may lead a number of additional clauses in the formula that grows cubically in the size of the input problem. While this may be acceptable for small problems, it does not seem very promising for our application domain.</p><p>We have also written a translator from protocol insecurity problems to planning problems and we have generated a set of planning problems corresponding to protocol insecurity problems taken from the Clark-Jacob library. We have then fed these problem to blackbox v.4.1, a state-of-the-art planner based on the planning as satisfiability paradigm. The experimental results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> indicate that SATMC performs uniformly and significantly better than blackbox on these problems. One of the problem with blackbox is the limited expressiveness of the PDDL input specification language <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. For instance only individual constants are allowed by PDDL and this can circumvented only by generating very large PDDL specifications.</p><p>Answer set programming. It is well-known that logic programming with answer sets semantics is closely related to propositional logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> and AI planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the authors present an executable specification language for security protocols based on logic programming and use an efficient model generators for logic programs to find attacks on protocols. Experimental results reported in the same paper show the feasibility of the approach on protocols in the Clark-Jacob library. SATMC performs significantly better on the same problems and-as we showed in Sect. 6-it also successfully analyses protocols of industrial complexity. A further attempt to use logic programming with answer sets semantics to analyse security protocols is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Bounded model checking. The approach described in this paper belongs to the wider area of bounded model checking <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and as such it can benefit from results obtained in this context. We are currently extending SATMC in order to support the analysis of protocols with respect to goals expressed as generic LTL formulae. This will allow for the specification of (i) different, more sophisticated intruder models (e.g., resilient and location-limited communication channels) by means of fairness constraints and (ii) more complex security properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Other techniques for security protocols analysis</head><p>Process calculi. Casper/FDR has been applied to analyse security protocols of the Clark-Jacob library in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Protocol specifications, written in the high level Casper specification language, are translated into CSP specifications which are then fed to FDR. This approach has been very successful to discover new flaws in protocols. However, some prelimi-nary experiments indicate that SATMC performs better than Casper/FDR. Besides this, Casper/FDR is not able to handle non-atomic keys and this prevents the application of the approach to the analysis of many real-world protocols. Our approach does not suffer from this limitation.</p><p>A technique for the automatic analysis of security protocols based on Non-Interference is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The approach, which is based on a slight extension of CCS, has been proved effective a large subset of protocols from the Clark-Jacob library <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The Non-Interference check provides a sufficient condition for the absence of attacks, but, whenever the Non-Interference check fails, the set of interferences returned must be (manually) inspected by the user in order to determine those corresponding to attacks. Another variant of CCS is at the core of the partial model checking technique for security protocols proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Here the protocol is modelled as an open system and therefore the analysis does not rely on a specific intruder model. The approach is currently limited to the analysis of security protocols with a bounded number of acyclic sessions and bounded message size. A decidability result has been proved when the analysis is restricted to secrecy properties. The techniques has been successfully applied against several protocol instances including NSPK and SSL, but since a systematic experimental analysis is not publicly available it is difficult to assess its scalability.</p><p>A novel static analysis technique for security protocols is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The technique, which is based on LySa (a process algebra inspired by the Spi-calculus), is fully automatic and always terminating in polynomial time. The tool builds an over-approximation of the behaviour of the protocol (including also the actions performed by a Dolev-Yao intruder). If no traces representing attacks on the protocol are in the over-approximation, then the protocol is guaranteed to satisfy the expected security property. Otherwise the over-approximation is explored in order to detect an attack on the protocol. If the search is successful then the found attack is reported to the user, otherwise the result is inconclusive. However this does not happen so frequently and the approach has been shown to be efficient on several security protocols of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. (A related static analysis technique for authentication protocols is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.) Our work is complementary to this as it is capable to detect all the attacks on the protocol for the given scenario but may fail to establish their absence in the general case.</p><p>The idea of type-checking secrecy properties of cryptographic protocols has been put forward in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The approach has been later extended to support the verification of authentication properties by using both types and effects and by annotating protocol specifications (in the Spi-calculus) with correspondence assertions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. As in the previous case, these techniques always terminate and can check the absence of attacks, but can report spurious attacks.</p><p>Blanchet's logic programming approach. Bruno Blanchet has developed a technique and a tool (called ProVerif) in which protocols and security properties are expressed as sets of Horn clauses which are then saturated by means of different strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. ProVerif allows one to prove security properties for an unbounded number of protocol sessions, in particular strong secrecy (which means that an intruder cannot see any difference when the value of the secret changes). The tool may raise some false attacks since nonces are abstracted by constants or function symbols, so that attacks have to be constructed by the user itself. (Recently, however, ProVerif has been enhanced to reconstruct automatically the attacks in some cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.) Termination of the technique (which is not guaranteed in the general case) has been proved for the restricted class of protocols in which encryption primitives are distinguished by means of a tagging mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Explicit state model checking. The general purpose state enumeration based model-checker Murphi has been applied to analyse some small cryptographic protocols such as the NSPK protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Experimental results indicate that Murphi suffers from state-space explosion. To cope with this problem the user must restrict the model in several ways. For instance, the size of the network channel as well as the size of the intruder knowledge are fixed a priori. Moreover the intruder model is not provided by the tool, but the burden is on the user to come out with an appropriate finite state machine describing the intruder behaviour. As a result, an attack on the protocol can be missed because either the bound imposed for some parameter is too small (e.g., the attack may require an intruder with more memory than that specified) or an ability of the intruder that has not been specified.</p><p>brutus combines depth-first search with a message derivation mechanism modelling the capabilities of the intruder in the spirit of the Paulson's synthesise and analyse operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. A powerful specification logic is also provided to describe a variety of security properties including secrecy, authentication, non-repudiation, and a weak form of anonymity. Similarly to other explicit state model checkers, brutus suffers from the state explosion problem, partially mitigated by some partial-order reduction techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. However the approach has been experimented only on a few protocols. Furthermore brutus supports atomic keys only.</p><p>Lazy evaluation-based approaches for protocol insecurity problems. Both OFMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and CL-AtSe <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> combine forward search exploration with constraint solving using a symbolic representation of the search space. OFMC also features a novel partial order reduction technique, called constraint differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, that leads to considerable pruning in the search space. Both tools are also capable to exploit some algebraic properties of the cryptographic operators.</p><p>Thus both OFMC and CL-AtSe use symbolic techniques to explore the search space in a demand-driven way. SATMC is dual in this respect as it eagerly expands all the terms while building the propositional formula and delegates the search to the SAT solver. It is thus not surprising that OFMC and CL-AtSe are less sensitive than SATMC to the size of messages exchanged in the protocol. On the other hand SATMC is less sensitive than OFMC and CL-AtSe to the combinatorial explosion associated with the interleaved execution of multiple sessions of the protocol.</p><p>Strand spaces approaches. Strand spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> provide an alternative approach to state-based analysis of protocol by emphasising causal interactions among protocol participants. The approach has been implemented in the Athena protocol analyser <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> which combines model checking and theorem proving techniques with the (parametric) strand space model to reduce the search space and automatically prove the correctness of or find an attack on security protocols (if it terminates). Besides the strands for honest roles, Athena uses quite prolific strands for modelling the behaviour of the Dolev-Yao intruder. Moreover, Athena supports atomic keys only. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and, later, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> these limitations have been uplifted.</p><p>These strands-based tools has been successfully experimented against the protocols in the Clark-Jacob library <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Since their input language is different from that of SATMC, a direct comparison is not possible, but according to the published material <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> the results obtained with these tools are very good and promising. However, no results are available on protocols of industrial complexity like those in the AVISPA library.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented a model checking procedure for security protocols based on a reduction to propositional logic. We have described a number of specialised techniques that are essential to make the approach not only viable but also effective on many problems of practical interest. In particular we have adapted and applied encoding techniques originally developed for planning to security protocol analysis, proving their soundness and completeness. Moreover, we have showed that our procedure can be turned into a decision procedure for BNAS problems. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach we have run our tool against a large set of complex, industrial strength security protocols and compared it with two state-of-the-art protocol analysers. The experiments indicate that our tool is more sensitive to the size of the messages exchanged by the protocol but it scales better than other state-of-the-art tools as the number of sessions increases.</p><p>In the future we would like to extend our techniques so to provide support for the specification of security properties by means of generic LTL formulae.

To this end we prove a more general fact, namely that ρ k j is applicable in S i for all j = i + 1, . . . , n and all i = 0, . . . , n -1, from which the above fact can be readily inferred by considering the cases in which j = i + 1. The proof is by induction on i. The base case (i.e., i = 0) boils down to showing that ρ k j is applicable in S 0 for all j = 1, . . . , n.

As a consequence, the union of the preconditions of the rules in Λ are contained in S = { f ∈ F : f i ∈ M} and therefore Λ is applicable in S.</p><p>To conclude the proof we must thus show that S = { f ∈ F : f i+1 ∈ M} is equal to (S\ ρ∈Λ del(ρ)) ∪ ρ∈Λ add(ρ). This boils down to proving that p ∈ (S\ ρ∈Λ del(ρ)) ∪ ρ∈Λ add(ρ) if, and only if, p i+1 ∈ M. The proof is articulated in the following two cases: Case 1 (if): Let p ∈ (S\ ρ∈Λ del(ρ))∪ ρ∈Λ add(ρ), i.e., either p ∈ S\ ρ∈Λ del(ρ) or p ∈ ρ∈Λ add(ρ), we must prove that p i+1 ∈ M. Case 1.1: Let p ∈ S\ ρ∈Λ del(ρ), i.e., p ∈ S and p ∈ del(ρ) for all ρ ∈ Λ (and thus ρ i ∈ M). Therefore every rule ρ that deletes p is not in Λ, i.e., ρi ∈ M. As a consequence the conclusion of the first explanatory frame axiom <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> for fact p is false in M. Moreover, since p ∈ S from the definition of S it follows that p i ∈ M. From this we conclude that the truth value of (26) in M requires p i+1 ∈ M. Case 1.2: Let p ∈ ρ∈Λ add(ρ), i.e., there exists a rule ρ ∈ Λ (and thus ρ i ∈ M) such that p ∈ add(ρ). Because of this, the truth of (ρ i ⊃ p i+1 ), i.e., one of the formulae <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, in M implies that p i+1 ∈ M. Case 2 (only if): Let p i+1 ∈ M, we must prove that p ∈ (S\ ρ∈Λ del(ρ)) ∪ ρ∈Λ add(ρ) i.e., either (i) p ∈ S and p ∈ ρ∈Λ del(ρ), or (ii) p ∈ ρ∈Λ add(ρ). Since p i+1 ∈ M, then for all ρ such that p ∈ del( ρ) the truth of ( ρi ⊃ ¬p i+1 ), i.e., one of the formulae <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, in M implies that ρi ∈ M. Because of this and from the definition of Λ, we derive that ρ ∈ Λ and therefore that p ∈ ρ∈Λ del(ρ). To conclude the proof we must show that either p ∈ S or p ∈ ρ∈Λ add(ρ). This is equivalent to proving that either p i ∈ M or there exists a rule ρ such that ρ i ∈ M and p ∈ add(ρ).

This is trivially satisfied in by any rule ρ that is not in Λ. Let us consider the case in which ρ ∈ Λ.

Mutexes are divided into two disjoint classes, static mutexes over rules (denoted with ⊕ and constructed by considering only part (a) of PG4) and dynamic mutexes. As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> dynamic mutexes are implied by static mutexes in the overall encoding and therefore if we prove that for all pair of rules ρ 1 , ρ 2 ∈ N i ρ such that ρ 1 ⊕ i ρ 2 M | ¬(ρ i 1 ∧ρ i 2 ) holds, then also M | (44) is proved. This amount showing that for all pair of rules ρ 1 , ρ 2 ∈ N i ρ such that ρ 1 ⊕ i ρ 2 either ρ i 1 / ∈ M (i.e., ρ 1 / ∈ Λ) or ρ i 2 / ∈ M (i.e., ρ 2 / ∈ Λ). This is a simple consequence of the facts that static mutexes are constructed by considering only part (a) of PG4 and that the rules in Λ are applicable and linearisable, i.e., their effects do not contradict each other and they are pairwise non-interfering. Proof We recall that the planning graph built at step i represents an over-approximation, in terms of reachable states and applicable rules, of the forward search tree of depth i. Notice that in the general case the unsatisfiability of [[Ξ ]] i does not allows to conclude that there is no attack on Ξ . In fact, a solution can require multiple executions of the same rule at different steps as well as the sequential execution of rules that are in mutual exclusion. Thus, it could be that i steps are not enough to execute the attack. However, if Ξ is a BNAS problem in which the intruder has no rules for composing messages and ([Γ ]) i has levelled-off, then the unsatisfiability of [[Ξ ]] i guarantees that there is no attack on Ξ . To prove this it suffices to show that if ([Γ ]) i has levelled-off then there cannot be multiple executions of the same rule nor sequential execution of rules that are in mutex.</p><p>-Let us first consider the multiple executions of the same rule. For the rules of the honest agents this is prevented by the ordering on the state facts. For the decomposition rules it is immediate to see that once one of them has been applied it is useless to repeat that rule since it would just cause stuttering. -Let us now consider the sequential execution of rules that are in mutual exclusion. For rules of the honest agents to be conflicting they must have the same state fact in the left-hand side. (Notice that the rewrite rules of the intruder cannot possibly generate conflicts.) But then there cannot be a path in which the two conflicting rules can be both executed. In fact once one of the two rules has been applied the state fact is deleted and it will never occur again in the state.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 Message sequence chart of Lowe's Attack on the NSPK protocol</figDesc></figure>
