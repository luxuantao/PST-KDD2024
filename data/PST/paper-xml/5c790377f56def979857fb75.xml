<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In recent years, there has been a proliferation of interest in resilience in the supply chain field. Even though literature has acknowledged the antecedents of resilient supply chains, such as supply chain visibility, cooperation, and information sharing, their confluence in creating resilient supply chains where other behavioral issues are prevailing (i.e., trust and behavioral uncertainty) has not been studied. To address this gap, we conceptualized a theoretical framework firmly grounded in the resource-based view (RBV) and the relational view that is tested for 250 manufacturing firms using hierarchical moderated regression analysis. The study offers a nuanced understanding of supply chain resilience and implications of supply chain visibility, cooperation, trust, and behavioral uncertainty. Implications and suggestions for further research are provided.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>supply chain risk management, which remains a key challenge, has generated significant interest among supply chain scholars. Hence, supply chain resilience has attracted the attention of both academics and practitioners, driven by the need of organizations to perform while resuming business continuity in periods of disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Literature has acknowledged visibility, cooperation, and information sharing as important antecedents of supply chain resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, the confluence of these antecedents in creating resilient supply chains under interaction effect of behavioral uncertainty (BU)-defined as the inability to predict a partner behavior or changes in the external environment- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> has not been studied in-depth, giving us the impetus for this study. Therefore, our first research question is as follows: What are the antecedents of resilient supply chains? To answer this question, we draw on the resource-based view (RBV) and the relational view <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We argue that visibility in supply chains is an important antecedent of risk reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and allows organizations to mitigate threats in their supply chain and safeguard organizational performance.</p><p>Literature has also argued for the role of contextual factors such as communication, integration, and cooperation on enhancing resilience in supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. The effectiveness of communication and cooperation may be enhanced or hampered due to BU factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. However, such crucial effects have not been addressed theoretically or subjected to empirical testing. Focusing on BU from a relational theory point of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>, we specify our second research question as follows: What are the effects of behavioral uncertainty on the relationship between cooperation and resilience? To answer this question, we develop a theoretical model to help our understanding of how organizations can create resilient supply chains and we test the model empirically using cross-sectional data gathered with a survey-based instrument. In doing so, we add to the understanding of the links between resources and capability, the relational constructs, and behavioral uncertainty, thus contributing to previous literature, which has utilized either the RBV or the relational view. To theoretically substantiate our test results, we integrate the two perspectives of the RBV and the relational view, because neither perspective can, on its own, explain supply chain resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. From a management point of view, our results provide extensive guidance to the managers to understand how the interplay of resources, capability, and relational constructs may help build supply chain resilience.</p><p>The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we synthesize the theoretical foundations of the study. In Section III, we illustrate our research framework and develop our hypotheses accordingly. In Section IV, we deal with the research methods, including operationalization of the constructs, sampling design, data collection, and nonresponse bias. In Section V, we discuss our statistical analyses. In Section VI, we present the discussion of the results and the implications of the results to the theory and practice. Finally, in Section VII, we conclude with limitations and further research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THEORY DEVELOPMENT</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Resource-Based View</head><p>The RBV argues that an organization can achieve competitive advantage, exploit opportunities, and/or mitigate threats by creating bundles of strategic resources and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In the supply chain management field, the RBV has been used to study the achievement of competitive advantage through the supply chain based on the combination of valuable, rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable resources and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Hitt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have suggested that the contribution of RBV in the supply chain management field involves analyzing supply chain activities individually and collectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> breaking down each of the activities in resources and capabilities to discuss how they are bundled together and how they can be integrated across the supply chain to contribute to both a focal firms' and the supply chain's competitive advantage. RBV has been used, for instance, to study supplier selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and the relationships between buyers and suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In a recent study, Brandon-Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have argued that resources and capabilities have a positive impact on supply chain resilience and supply chain robustness. Hence, RBV is used as a basis of our theoretical model to discuss resilient supply chain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Supply Chain Visibility</head><p>Visibility can be defined in different ways, depending on the focus of the scholars on, for instance, information sharing or information characteristics (accuracy, timeliness, readiness, and speed of access) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Hofstede <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> defines visibility as the "extent to which all the actors along the supply chains have a shared understanding of, and access to, the product-related information that they request, without loss, noise, delay and distortion" (p. 18). From an RBV perspective, supply chain visibility can be characterized as one of the desired capabilities in the supply chain (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>), which may reduce the negative impact of supply chain disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Supply chain visibility can improve decision making, responsiveness, and operational and supply chain performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Other scholars have underlined the importance of visibility for resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Blackhurst et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> stressed the importance of supply chain visibility in avoiding and mitigating the effect of disruptions, whereas Jüttner and Maklan <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> suggested that making visible risks and knowledge across the supply chain improves resilience. Brandon-Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> argued that supply chain visibility further improves resilience and robustness in supply chain. They also argued that supply chain visibility is largely undefined and lacks consistent understanding among operations and supply chain management scholars. In this paper, we aim to contribute to this debate and argue that supply chain visibility is a mediating construct between information sharing, data connectivity and reduction in behavioral uncertainty, which further enhances trust and commitment among supply chain partners to improve cooperation to achieve resilient supply chains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Cooperation, Trust, and Behavioral Uncertainty</head><p>Literature has discussed the role of relational competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> in supply chain resilience. Scholars have underlined the importance of three types of relational competencies, that is, communication, cooperation, and integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. These competencies help establish collaborative relationships across the supply chain to leverage supply chain resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In this paper, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, we argue that is important to discuss cooperation as a relational competency, which has often been neglected in the behavioral operations management literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Within cooperation, we focus on trust and commitment as important antecedents <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Trust is the willingness to take risk, whereas with commitment "an exchange partner believing that an ongoing relationship with another is so important as to warrant maximum efforts at maintaining it; that is, the committed party believes the relationship endures indefinitely" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Welty and Becerra-Fernandez <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> argue that interplay between technology and trust can further enhance cooperation. Furthermore, Kwon and Suh <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> argue that the degree of information sharing among supply chain partners reduces behavioral uncertainty (BU)-namely, "the inability to predict a partner's behavior or changes in the external environment" <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>-among partners, which further enhances trust, leads to commitment, and builds cooperation among supply chain partners. Organizations "create external linkages based on the sharing of information" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, p. 1217). Reduction in BU can help organizations enhance trust and commitment among supply chain partners in their endeavor to gain competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Supply Chain Resilience</head><p>There is a rich body of literature on supply chain resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, but few formal definitions of supply chain resilience. Christopher and Peck <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> define supply chain resilience as "the ability of a supply chain to return to normal operating performance, within an acceptable period, after being disturbed." Ponomarov and Holcomb <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> define supply chain resilience as "the adaptive capability of the supply chain to prepare for unexpected events, respond to disruptions and recover from them by maintaining continuity of operations at desired levels of connectedness and control over structure and function." Hence, Purvis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> argue that there is no consensus in the formal definition of the resilience. For instance, several other terms-such as agility, flexibility, risk, responsiveness, adaptability, alignment, robustness, and redundancy-are linked with resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Thus, following Brandon-Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we define supply chain resilience as the ability of the system to return to its original state, within an acceptable period, after being disturbed. The definition is consistent with previous definitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Academic literature has discussed different elements of supply chain resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Christopher and Peck <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> defined four principles for supply chain resilience, namely, supply chain reengineering, collaboration, agility, and supply chain risk management culture. Kamalahmadi and Mellat-Parast <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, based on Christopher and Peck <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, have proposed the elements (variables) of flexibility, trust, information, sharing, visibility, leadership, and innovation that correspond to Christopher and Peck's principles of resilience. Hence, following recent scholarly debates see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we propose a model that extrapolates the antecedents of resilience based on RBV and relational competencies. The theoretical underpinnings and elements of the model are discussed next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT</head><p>The foundation of our theoretical framework is inspired by RBV and the relational view <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Supply Chain Connectivity, Information Sharing, and Supply Chain Visibility</head><p>Following RBV, we argue that bundling of resources, either tangible or intangible, leads to competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Zhu and Kraemer <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> argue that connectivity, which can be referred to as organizational IT infrastructure, is an important resource that can be exploited to build certain capabilities in supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, including supply chain visibility, which, in turn, can reduce inventory-level and bullwhip effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Following Fawcett and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, we can argue that supply chain connectivity may enhance supply chain visibility; however, supply chain connectivity is dependent on the quality of information sharing. Brandon-Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> found that supply chain connectivity and information sharing both have positive impacts on supply chain visibility. Hence, we hypothesize: H1: Supply chain connectivity has a positive impact on supply chain visibility.</p><p>H3: Information sharing has a positive impact on supply chain visibility.</p><p>Next, following RBV, bundling "supply chain connectivity" and "information sharing" can improve supply chain visibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, a tangible resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Connectivity is an example of a technological resource that facilitates effective sharing of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. On the other hand, information sharing may be categorized as organizational capital, a resource, which focuses on flow of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Hence following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we can hypothesize:</p><p>H2: Supply chain connectivity has a positive impact on information sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Trust and Cooperation</head><p>In prior research, many scholars argue toward a positive relationship between trust and cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Morgan and Hunt <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> argue that trust is an important antecedent for cooperation among channel partners. Hence, in a similar vein we argue that the trust is an antecedent of cooperation among the partners in supply chain. Hence, we hypothesize it as:</p><p>H4: Trust has a positive impact on cooperation among members in the supply chain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Supply Chain Visibility and Supply Chain Resilience</head><p>Brandon-Jones and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> argue for the positive relationship between supply chain visibility and supply chain resilience. Supply chain visibility can also reduce the probability and impact of a supply chain disruption and therefore lead to enhanced resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> and the mitigation of supply chain risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, and the generation of common demand forecasts that, if combined with the proportional restoration rule, could further help to manage deviation in the observed inventory levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Hence, we hypothesize:</p><p>H5: Supply chain visibility has a positive impact on supply chain resilience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Trust, Cooperation, and Supply Chain Resilience</head><p>Morgan and Hunt <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> argue that cooperation is influenced directly by trust, whereas Scholten and Schilder <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> suggest that cooperation has a positive impact on supply chain agility and supply chain robustness, and subsequently supply chain resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Literature also underlines the role of collaborative capabilities in sustainability commitment and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> that facilitate supply chain resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Trust and cooperation play a significant role in minimizing the effect of opportunistic behavior, which is an important ingredient for building resilient supply chain. Hence, we hypothesize:</p><p>H6: Trust has a positive impact on supply chain resilience. H7: Cooperation has a positive impact on supply chain resilience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Moderating Effect of Behavioral Uncertainty</head><p>Cao and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> argue that the uncertainty has often been viewed as a dominant contingency and may be one of the important determinants of high transaction costs. Reducing uncertainty via information sharing has attracted significant attention from O&amp; SCM scholars. However, the majority of the studies have focused on reducing supply uncertainty, demand uncertainty, and technological uncertainty through effective partnering. Cao and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> argue that the intense communication among the supply chain partners may effectively reduce behavioral uncertainty, which is often cited as one the major determinants of poor trust and cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. Park and Ungson <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> note that the degree of behavioral uncertainty among partners is the major source of tension in the strategic alliances. Krishnan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> argue that BU leads to a situation where it becomes difficult for an organization to anticipate and predict the actions of their partners. They suggest that BU has negative consequences on organizational performance, impacting negatively on trust. Hence, conversely, we can argue that a reduction in BU may improve the trust and cooperation among the partners IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Theoretical Framework.</p><p>in supply chain which may further improve the supply chain resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. Hence, we hypothesize as follows:</p><p>H8/H9: Reduction in behavioral uncertainty positively moderates the effect of trust and cooperation on supply chain resilience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Measures</head><p>To test our hypothesized framework (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), we derived testable research hypotheses (H1-H9). We used a survey method to test this theoretical model. The items tapping the theoretical constructs as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> were developed based on an extensive review of literature (see Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). They were measured on a five-point Likert scale with anchors ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> to ensure high statistical variability among survey responses.</p><p>The unit of analysis employed in this study was at the level of manufacturing plant and its major upstream supplier <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. We selected manufacturing organizations following prior research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>), suggesting that manufacturing organizations provide a detailed understanding of how supply chain design affects performance.</p><p>Prior to data collection, we pretested the survey instrument with five senior managers and three academics who have published extensively and have strong research credentials in related areas for content validity. We asked the experts to critique the questionnaire for ambiguity, clarity, and appropriateness of the items used to operationalize each construct. A few changes were made based on the inputs of these experts to ensure high reliability and validity. All the exogenous constructs in the Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> were operationalized as reflective constructs (see Table <ref type="table">I</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data Collection</head><p>The target sample was composed of managers included in the Indian Institute of Materials Management database. We selected 780 potential respondents by their job function (supply chain manager, materials management manager, logistics management manager, or purchasing manager) (see Table <ref type="table">II</ref>) and the following industry codes (NIC) reflecting manufacturing organizations:</p><p>16 "manufacture of wood and products of wood and cork, except furniture . . . ";</p><p>17 "manufacture of paper and paper products"; 19 "manufacture of coke [solid fuel] and refined petroleum products"; 20 "manufacture of chemicals and chemical products"; 22 "manufacture of rubber and plastic products"; 25 "manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment."</p><p>We e-mailed the questionnaires to the respondents. Each questionnaire included a cover letter in which the purpose of the study was explained, following Dillman's total-test design method (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>). After five weeks, we had received 120 usable responses. We sent further reminders via e-mail and followed up by phone. After another four weeks, we had received a further 130 usable responses. Hence, we received a total of 250 usable responses, which represents 32.05% (250/780 = 32.05%). In comparison to prior survey based studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>), our sample size is sufficient for a hypothesis test.</p><p>Before we proceeded to data analysis, we undertook a nonresponse bias test. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, we compared the responses of early and late waves of returned surveys based on the assumption that the opinions of the late respondents are representative of the opinions of the nonrespondents (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>). The t-tests yielded no statistically significant differences (p = 0.76) between early wave (120 responses) and late wave (130 responses), suggesting that nonresponse bias was not a problem. The final sample consisted of 30 directors (12%), 75 vice-presidents (30%), and 145 general managers (58%). The respondents primarily worked for medium to large firms with 32% of the respondents working for large firms with more than 1000 employees and a gross income of more than US$ 150 million.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DATA ANALYSES AND RESULTS</head><p>It is suggested by prior research to examine for assumption of constant variance, existence of outliers, and normality before checking for reliability and validity of the constructs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>). We used plots of residuals by predicted values and statistics of skewness and kurtosis. To detect multivariate outliers, we used Mahalanobis distances of predicted variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. The maximum absolute values of skewness and kurtosis of the measures in the remaining dataset were found to be 1.66 and 2.07, respectively. These values are well within the limits recommended by past research (univariates skewness &lt; 2, kurtosis &lt; 7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. We did not find any plots nor did the statistics indicate any significant deviances from the assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Measurement Validation</head><p>We used a three-stage process (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>) to develop measures that satisfied all the requirements for reliability, validity, and unidimensionality. To evaluate reliability, we used the average correlation among items in a scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. We can see from Table III that the Cronbach's α (alpha) value for each construct is well above the accepted cut-off of 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>.</p><p>Next, we assessed two types of validity: convergent and discriminant <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>, items load on the intended constructs with standardized loadings greater than 0.5, the scale composite reliability (SCR) greater than 0.7, and the average variance extracted (AVE) greater than 0.5. Hence, we can argue that there is sufficient evidence for convergent validity. Fawcett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> noted that for discriminant validity, all the items should have higher loadings on their assigned constructs than on any other constructs. Furthermore, the mean shared variance should be below 0.50. Alternatively, the square root of the AVE for each construct should be greater than any correlation estimate (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>). Hence, we can argue that there is sufficient evidence for discriminant validity.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the unidimensionality of our theoretical framework constructs via the following two conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. First, an item must be significantly associated with the empirical indicators of the construct, and second, it must be associated with one and only one construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. To test for unidimensionality, we tested the overall fit of our model. Based on the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, multiple fit criteria were utilized to  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Common Method Bias</head><p>In the case of self-reported data, there is a high possibility of common method biases resulting from multiple sources such as consistency motif, implicit theories, social desirability, leniency biases, and acquiescence biases. We attempted to enforce a procedural remedy by asking respondents not to estimate supply chain resilience based on their own experience but to obtain this information from minutes of organizational meetings or from documentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Furthermore, we performed statistical analyses to assess the severity of common method bias. We conducted the Harman's one-factor test following the suggestions of Podsakoff and Organ <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> on seven variables in our theoretical model. The results showed that the seven factors are present and the most covariance explained by any one factor was 40.48% (see Appendix B), indicating that common method bias is not likely to contaminate our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Hypothesis Testing</head><p>We tested our research hypotheses following Ryu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, Eckstein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, and Brandon-Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. According to Eckstein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, hierarchical regression analysis is considered the most appropriate and a more conservative technique than covariance-based modeling approaches, due to the complexity of the model and the available data points and the great robustness of the technique. The hypotheses (H1-H7) were tested using hierarchical regression analysis, as shown in Table V. The results suggest that H1 (β = 0.376; p = 0.000), H2 (β = 0.569; p = 0.000), and H3 (β = 0.411; p = 0.000) are supported, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The control variable organization size (OS) does not have any significant effect on the model (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">V</ref>). We interpret that OS has little role to play on the impact of supply chain connectivity on information sharing and supply chain visibility. H4 is supported (β = 0.722; p = 0.000), which is found to be consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. H5 is supported (β = 0.110; p = 0.007), which is found to be consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. H6 is supported (β = 0.727; p = 0.000) and H7 is supported (β = 0.307; p = 0.000), which is found to be in consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>H8 and H9 were tested using hierarchical multiple moderated regression. Step 1 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">VI</ref> shows that OS has no significant effect on supply chain resilience (β = 0.062; p = 0.015). Step 2 includes the direct effect of trust and cooperation as well as the direct effect of moderator variable (BU). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">VI</ref> indicates that trust (β = 0.870; p = 0.000) and cooperation (β = 0.698; p = 0.000), supporting previous findings of Wieland and Wallenburg <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The model also indicates that the reduction in BU has direct influence on supply chain resilience (β = 0.599; p = 0.000). This finding of ours further support previous qualitative findings of Jüttner and Maklan <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. The results show that reduction in behavioral uncertainty among the partners will help to create more resilient supply chains. Although scarce theoretical rationale has been developed yet in the literature, these exploratory tests motivate future studies that would shape the future research related to the differential effects of reduction in behavioral uncertainty on supply chain resilience in different contexts.</p><p>Step 3 adds the interaction effects to our model. In support of hypothesis H8 and H9, the full model indicates that behavioral uncertainty has a significant interaction effect, where the impact of trust (β = 0.116; p = 0.000) and cooperation (β = 0.113; p = 0.000) on supply chain resilience are stronger for a higher level of the reduction of behavioral uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Theoretical Implications</head><p>In this paper, we drew on RBV, suggesting that the bundling of resources and capabilities can be utilized to create competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. We considered supply chain connectivity and information sharing as complementary resources which may be bundled together to create supply chain visibility as a capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we hypothesized that both supply chain connectivity and information sharing can create supply chain visibility and that supply chain visibility may be exploited to expose sources of the supply chain risk and to exploit opportunities, if any <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Wieland and Wallenburg <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> argue that cooperation among the supply chain partners enhances supply chain resilience. We argue, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, that reduction in behavioral uncertainty may enhance the direct effects of trust and cooperation on supply chain resilience. Building upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, we investigated how reduction of BU can further influence trust and cooperation. By adopting the RBV logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT and the relational view <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, we have attempted to provide better insight into supply chain resilience.</p><p>Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that behavioral dimensions have a significant impact on resilience along with other important resources of the firm. Second, we have shown empirically that reduction in behavioral uncertainty has a positive interaction effect on trust and cooperation. These results extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, which do not consider the role of reduction in uncertainty among supply chain partners on direct effects of trust and cooperation on resilience. Finally, we have shown that our integrated model explains 68.4% of the total variance (R²) in supply chain resilience. If we compare our model R² with the existing models, then the explanatory power of our model is comparatively high. Hence, we can argue that trust, cooperation among supply chain partners, and supply chain visibility may help to build resilient supply chains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Managerial Implications</head><p>Our results provide some useful implications for supply chain managers who face a constant dilemma: invest in appropriate technology or to wait. Hence, we enumerate three implications. First, investing in appropriate technology and quality information sharing may help to improve supply chain visibility. Second, by reducing behavioral uncertainty, an organization may achieve better interplay of trust and cooperation among the partners to build a more resilient supply chain. Third, by proper integration of supply chain visibility, trust, and cooperation, supply chain resilience can be significantly improved. Hill <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> argued that in the long run, the invisible hand of the market favors those organizations whose behavioral repertoires support trust and cooperation rather than competition and opportunism. Such behavioral repertoires enable partners to work together to mitigate the risk resulting from disasters: man-made or natural. Thus, managers need to focus on collaborative relationships, instead of cultivating competition and opportunism. We recognize that providing recommendations based on data gathered from manufacturing organizations may be a limitation as, for instance, service organizations have their own challenges. The study has only addressed companies in the Indian manufacturing context. However, it should be noted that our studies are based on those organizations that have already invested in technology and information sharing to create visibility across the supply chain. Thus, the study findings should be applied to other contexts with caution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Limitations and Future Research Directions</head><p>In this section, we deal with our limitations and unanswered questions. We have adopted RBV but have only considered supply chain connectivity and information sharing as tangible and intangible resources. Other resources such as human skills (i.e., managerial skills and technical skills) and learning culture may have significant effects on supply chain visibility as a desired capability of the organization.</p><p>The methods we have used to investigate supply chain visibility could be applied to the exploration of other organizational capabilities such as supply chain agility, adaptability, and alignment. We admit that using the survey-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, we could not measure the complexity associated with behavioral uncertainty. However, qualitative research methods may answer some of these unanswered questions.</p><p>Finally, in this paper, we have considered resilience. However, other concepts such redundancy, robustness, and rapidity are also considered to be important characteristics of supply chain resilience. Hence, a simulation-based modeling approach could further help quantify these aspects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>Drawing broadly on RBV and the relational view, we argue that resources, capabilities, behavioral uncertainty, trust, commitment, and cooperation are the predictors of supply chain resilience. Our theoretical framework reconciles the independent contributions of two well-established streams in the literature: bundling of resources and capabilities and impact of behavioral uncertainty-trust-cooperation. We attempt to explain the interaction effect of reduction of behavioral uncertainty on the path connecting trust and supply chain resilience and cooperation and supply chain resilience. Analysis based on 250 Indian manufacturing organizations supports the hypothesized relationships in the framework.</p><p>This research makes a significant contribution to supply chain resilience literature by focusing on much neglected behavioral dimensions. It confirms that supply chain visibility, trust and cooperation influence resilience significantly. We believe that we provide to researchers and practitioners food for thought to study further the role of resources and capabilities, as well as of behavioral uncertainty on visibility and supply chain resilience. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="4,95.16,68.05,408.00,325.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
