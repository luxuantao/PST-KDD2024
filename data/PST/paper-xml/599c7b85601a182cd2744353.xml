<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Most users of smartphone apps remain unaware of what data about them is being collected, by whom, and how these data are being used. In this mixed methods investigation, we examine the question of whether revealing key data collection practices of smartphone apps may help people make more informed privacyrelated decisions. To investigate this question, we designed and prototyped a new class of privacy indicators, called Data Controller Indicators (DCIs), that expose previously hidden information flows out of the apps. Our lab study of DCIs suggests that such indicators do support people in making more confident and consistent choices, informed by a more diverse range of factors, including the number and nature of third-party companies that access users' data. Furthermore, personalised DCIs, which are contextualised against the other apps an individual already uses, enable them to reason effectively about the differential impacts on their overall information exposure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Apps provide a huge variety of functionality that an estimated 1.91 billion smartphone users worldwide take advantage of each day <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. At the same time, apps are conduits through which substantial volumes of information about people are being captured, and transferred into the hands of advertisers, market researchers, ecommerce companies, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>. Increasingly, these troves of personal data are being used to determine prices, opportunities, and decisions both online and offline <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55]</ref>.</p><p>Faced with this opaque world of data harvesting, smartphone users have been left feeling that they lack adequate understanding Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

As a result, some users have chosen to withdraw from using apps to their full extent, in an attempt to limit data exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Previous research has shown that users have skewed expectations about how their data are being collected and by whom <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, and overestimate the procedures in place to vet which apps are available through app stores <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Greater transparency may go some way to alleviating these fears. If the collection activities of the many first and third party trackers were open to scrutiny, users might be able to develop better mental models, better evaluate risks, and ultimately make more informed privacy choices. In turn, these choices could exert competitive pressure on developers to bring their privacy practices in line with actual users preferences expressed in the market, such as by reducing the range and type of third-party trackers included in their applications. This paper presents the results of a mixed methods exploration of making the invisible visible, namely, allowing end-user individuals to inspect and assess the hidden data transmission behaviours of smartphone apps. Through an iterative design process, we devised a new class of privacy indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> called Data Controller Indicators (DCIs), that disclose the kinds of data sent by apps to various organisations, background information about each, and the likely purposes for which the data will be used. We also developed a user-personalised version of a DCI, that shows when data being transmitted to a particular organisation is also already provided by other apps they already use. We tested Data Controller Indicators in an app-choice task, and found that they caused participants to consider more potential privacy implications, while simultaneously allowing them to make more consistent choices, with more confidence, than with traditional interfaces.</p><p>The objectives of this work are to answer the following questions:</p><p>1. Designing Indicators -How should data collection activities be conveyed to support privacy-related decisions? Should such activities be contextualised against other apps the individual uses?</p><p>2. Effects on Decision Making -If indicators revealing data dissemination behaviours are presented at time of an app-choice decision, will it affect the decision? What aspects of such decisions are affected, e.g. would it change the decision process, degree of confidence, or change the outcome entirely?</p><p>Emerging Privacy CHI 2017, May 6-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA</p><p>We pursued a mixed methods approach to investigate these questions. We first designed and built Data Controller Indicators (DCIs), including infrastructure to intercept information sent by smartphone apps, and a technique for transforming raw app data transmission information into descriptive high-level characterisations of what was being shared with whom (#1).</p><p>We then conducted a lab study (#2), consisting of a series of app choice role-play tasks in which participants were asked to think-aloud as they were given different interfaces with which to choose an app to install and use. This was followed by a series of semi-structured interviews, in which they were asked to reflect on the interface conditions. We found that when using our novel DCI interfaces, participants chose different applications and had more confidence in their choices, compared to other interfaces.</p><p>They were also able to consider a larger range of factors, and able to reason about how the introduction of a new app might affect the overall exposure of their information to third parties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND</head><p>Users' willingness to share information is dependent on a variety of factors, including the type of information collected, how sensitive it is, how long it will be stored, how it will be used, or levels of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. In the context of smartphones these preferences can be highly idiosyncratic and context-dependent, sensitive to individual nuances and the impact of exogenous events <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Under the existing 'permissions' model used by smartphone platforms to inform users of the kinds of data accessed by apps, users generally do not understand the implications or pay attention to such requests <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, have sufficient information to make rational decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, or feel able to represent the kinds of complex rules about information sharing that they would like to specify <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Given such limitations, many researchers have proposed and evaluated alternative approaches, which often involve contextualising <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, summarising <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> or augmenting existing permission information <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Since users' expectations are frequently at odds with the actual behaviours of apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, another promising approach involves focusing user attention on app behaviours that they are not likely to expect <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to exploring new ways to present privacy-related information to users, researchers have also explored when to present it; for instance, either before the installation of an app <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> or during the usage of an app <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. A 'nudge' approach, in which interventions are made at key moments in order to sway user behaviour towards more privacy-respecting behaviour, has also been found to be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we seek to build upon recent work on privacy indicators. Privacy indicators are an approach to simplifying potential privacy risks by summarising them visually or some other method, such as a score or grade <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Some privacy indicators have explored displaying a summary whether an app exposes data to third parties, and tested the effect of such indicators on user's privacy decisions at app install time <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. Others have addressed the problem of individual differences in individual privacy preferences, by creating personalised privacy indicators and agents acting as adaptive indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53]</ref>. Beyond apps, related research pertaining to the Internet-of-Things and technologies for the Quantified Self has explored how visualisations for supporting better end-user to understanding of personal data flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</p><p>Our work extends such efforts with a new kind of privacy indicator called Data Controller Indicators (DCIs), that breaks down the data being collected by smartphone apps by the organisations doing the collecting, alongside with rich contextual information about these organisations and their purposes for collecting the data.</p><p>The other contribution of our work is exploring the effectiveness of a personalised privacy indicator, i.e. a personalised DCI. Drawing inspiration from recent proposals which provide users with an overview of what data they may have already given away <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, our personalised DCIs will highlight the new privacy cost for installing an app, in contrast to existing privacy loss of an individual, based on the apps already installed on the smartphone. This means that if installing a new app will not introduce new types of personal data to be accessed by a third party that has never accessed an individual's data yet, then the privacy risk associated with this new app is low for that individual. We are the first study to explore how this personalised privacy risk presentation could impact on an individual's privacy decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA CONTROLLER INDICATORS</head><p>This section describes the design and development of our Data Controller Indicators. To ensure ecological validity, we started by investigating a variety of approaches for analysing information collection activities of real apps. This initial investigation informed and provided essential constraints for our iterative design phase, in which we explored different visual representations of this information to derive the final design we used in the subsequent lab study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Building Models of Information Flows</head><p>Growing concern over data collection practices has motivated privacy researchers to develop methods to detect apps' data collection and dissemination activities. We first conducted a wide survey of work in this area, discovering three general approaches: static analysis, in which app binaries are decompiled and analysed to identify indicators of data collection activities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>), OS instrumentation, in which sensitive data is tagged and monitored as it flows through the system (e.g. TaintDroid <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and AppTrace <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>), and network traffic monitoring (e.g. Recon <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>) in which data transmitted by apps is intercepted and analysed. For our project, we chose network monitoring because it was reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, simple, and device and OS agnostic-meaning that practically any network-connected device could be inspected in the same way. There are, however, limitations to this approach, which we discuss at the end of the paper.</p><p>Apparatus, Modelling Workflow, and Data Capture Method</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> illustrates our data capture and modelling workflow. A smartphone was configured to connect to the Internet through a proxy server running the mitmproxy software <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The app was then launched on the smartphone, and a 10 minute tour was taken of the app, with the goal of invoking each piece of functionality at least once. This method was devised to ensure that a representative sample of traffic data would be generated by the app and captured. The raw log files were then transformed to higher-level descriptions through a dual-data processing pipeline, illustrated in the bottom of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. In the first, data detectors were applied to the raw log files to identify kinds of data being sent. For the purposes of this study, four broad categories of data were used: (Phone ID, Phone characteristics, Location, Personal attributes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emerging Privacy</head><p>CHI 2017, May 6-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA</p><p>The second pipeline mapped individual hosts to organisations that owned them. For each organisation, a profile was then gathered, which included information on parent and subsidiary organisations (if any), information about the type of business, server geographic locations, organisational country of origins, date founded, number of employees/members, names of its directors, and a short textual history. Data sources that were used for this include Crunchbase, Wikipedia and OpenCorporates. For the purposes of building an initial collection of app data sharing models for the study, we selected the top 50 most popular apps available from the iTunes and Google Play stores (combined, ranked by number of downloads), and analysed them using the method described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Designing the Indicators</head><p>To design the indicators, we started with a set of prototypes inspired by Privacy Leaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, app information flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, and trace views <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. An iterative, user-centred design process was then followed to refine the prototypes (visible in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) to yield the final set of Data Controller Indicators. During this process, we pursued several representations simultaneously: a directed graph (inspired by trace views), a tabular design (inspired by Privacy Leaks), and a nested hierarchical box representation (not shown). In its final design, two representations remained; a table representation (left), in which each row represents a distinct organisation collecting data in an app, of the types indicated by the columns, for the purposes indicated by particular colours. The Sankey version (right) has flowing paths that connect to boxes representing organisations, data types, and data uses/purposes. In both representations, detailed information about each company, data type, or purpose is displayed in a pop-up box that appears for each item hovered upon. Support for Personalisation (exploring differential exposure) A key hypothesis we wished to explore was whether contextualising a particular app's data dissemination activities against those of other apps a person uses might allow them to reason about differential exposure, i.e. the relative risk of introducing a new app to the set of apps they already use. To investigate this question, we extended both interfaces to show those activities that are unique to a particular app, versus those in common with others. We refer to these indicators as PDCIs (Personalised Data Controller Indicators) to emphasise that they are personalised to a person's particular app ecosystem, i.e., the other apps they use. In the Table <ref type="table">view</ref> in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, for instance, the PDCI view shows an app contextualised against 2 other apps; rows in yellow above the grey line are those that are unique to the app being examined, while those beneath are in common with the others.</p><p>In the Sankey version (right), all apps are displayed on the left, unique information flows are highlighted in pink.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY</head><p>Our main study was designed to test Data Controller Indicators in a realistic privacy-related decision-making setting. Specifically, we sought to measure whether people would make different decisions with DCIs than without them. Second, we wished to understand whether their decisions would follow different lines of reasoning, or consider different aspects when making choices with DCIs. Finally, we aimed to identify whether people would prefer DCIs, and the particular forms that they found most useful.</p><p>Framing these question as hypotheses, we wished to test the following :</p><p>• Compared to permissions-based interfaces, Data Controller Indicators (DCIs) enable a more diverse range of strategies in people's privacy decisions, (H:Strategy), resulting in greater consistency of choices (H:AppChoice), and higher confidence (H:Confidence). However, choices with DCIs take slightly longer (H:Time), due to additional time needed to consider all the information presented.</p><p>• Compared to visualising traffic by hostname or domain, DCI's approach of representing destinations as entities (i.e. organisations and companies) (H:Entities), annotated with background information (H:Background), allows people to make better judgements about the companies that collect their data.</p><p>• Personalising DCIs, by contextualising the data collection activities of an app against other apps people already use, helps people to focus on new risks posed by that app (H:Personalise).</p><p>• People prefer DCI and PDCI interfaces to permissions-based interfaces for privacy-related decisions because of the information these indicators provide (H:Preference).</p><p>For the privacy-related decision, we focused on choosing a new app to install and use. While this is far from the only kind of app-related privacy decision people make, it is both commonly occurring and important, because choosing a malicious or privacyinvasive app could drastically impact a person's privacy profile<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>The main study consisted of a sequence of app-choice tasks, in which participants were asked to choose between two functionally equivalent apps for their personal use, in a simulated app store setting. During each task, participants were presented information about each app using one of five interfaces, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The Permissions interface reproduced the standard Android permissions interface presented at time of app installation, and was used as a control condition. The Permissions + Purposes interface condition was one in which annotations were added to permissions, specifying the purposes for each. This interface condition was designed in response to earlier work which found that smartphone users were most concerned with finding out such uses <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. The Data Leaks interface was inspired by the Privacy Leaks interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and shows a list of third party destinations (identified by their host name) and the kinds of data they collect. The DCI and PDCI interfaces were as described earlier; participants could choose between matrix and Sankey representations for each.</p><p>Using only the information provided in each interface, participants were asked to choose one of the two apps, following a think-aloud process <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> while making their decision. After a decision was made, participants were asked to explain their decision, and indicate the level of confidence in their decision along a Likert scale. There was no time limit for each task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Design</head><p>To create the tasks used in the study, 10 representative "seed" apps models were manually chosen from the 50 app models created using the network capture and analysis method previously described. These seed apps were used to generate fictional apps in 5 different popular app categories (productivity, health, personal finance, travel and utilities), to eliminate the possibility of accidental prior familiarity.</p><p>Using real app models of traffic data with fictional names ensured that the choices participants were faced with were as realistic as possible, and reflective of the true range of data tracking behaviours we observed across our entire data set of apps, whilst avoiding the problem of prior familiarity. Re-using the same 10 app models repeatedly across conditions (rather than collecting unique underlying data for each of the 25 app pairs) also enabled us to compare decisions by app-type, and to control for other potentially confounding factors that might arise from differences in the individual models. Finally, in order to focus participants' decisions on only the data collection aspects of the app choices, (rather than e.g. functionality or ratings), the apps in each pair were presented as having equivalent functionality and ratings.</p><p>Creating task sequences for participants required delicate scheduling of tasks. To avoid potential learning effects, we wished to ensure that each participant only saw each app pair at most once during the study. At the same time, we needed to ensure that each app pair appeared in the five different interface conditions described earlier. To achieve this, we adapted a between-groups design by dividing participants into five groups.</p><p>For each of the 25 app pairs, one group made a judgement on that pair using the Permissions interface, while the other groups made a judgement on that pair using one of the other interfaces (Permissions + Purposes, Data Leaks, DCI, an PDCI). Through explicit scheduling, we ensured that each app pair was seen only once by one group, and each group saw five app pairs in each of the five interface conditions and five domain conditions. We wanted to also ensure that different interfaces were presented at each turn, so in order to overcome these issues and possible ordering biases, we permuted each app pair to ensure that no interface or domain condition appeared in adjacent order. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the five groups.</p><p>At the conclusion of the app choice tasks, participants were asked to reflect on all of the interface conditions, and to choose the interface condition that they found most helpful in making their decisions. Participants were asked to provide motivations and reasoning for their answers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Recruitment</head><p>Participants were recruited via social media, e-mail mailing lists at a large UK university, and paper flyers posted in public spaces across a small city in the UK. At time of sign-up, participants were asked to confirm eligibility by stating that they were at least 18 years old, owned and actively used a smartphone, and had installed at least 1 app on it themselves. This was done to ensure that participants had previously installed apps or would likely consider doing so in future. Prior to arriving at the lab, each participant was also asked to name up to 10 apps they used regularly. The traffic data from these apps were collected and used during the study to render a contextualised display in the PDCI interface. Participants were given a £10 gift voucher for completing the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We examined the effect of different interfaces on participants choices using several measures. First, we computed the level of inter-participant agreement within each condition to see the extent to which participants in the same interface conditions made the same choice. Second, we tested intra-participant agreement between conditions, i.e., whether an individual participant was more likely to choose apps with different data collection characteristics between interface conditions. In order to test this, for each pair, we tested whether the app with the larger number of each feature (e.g., data controllers, purposes, and the data types) was selected significantly more often than the other, between interface conditions. Third, we calculated the average time taken to reach a decision under each interface condition. Finally, we performed a one-way ANOVA to test if there was a statistically significant difference in participants' reported levels of confidence in their app choices between interface conditions.</p><p>The think-aloud processes for all app choice rounds for all participants were recorded, transcribed and anonymised, along with app choice rationale. Then, an iterative thematic coding process was used to identify common themes for all aspects that were mentioned during the think-aloud process associated with each decision. After coding disjoint quarters of all rounds, 4 researchers convened and consolidated themes and then derived theme codes. Then, two researchers re-coded all rounds. Cohen's kappa k was run to determine if there was inter-coder agreement between the thematic tag assigned by each coder to each piece of text. A one-way ANOVA test was then performed on the thematic tags applied under each interface condition, to measure whether different interfaces resulted in participants engaging in more diverse decision making processes. For the exit survey, we recorded the total number of times each interface was regarded as the most helpful in making decisions.</p><p>For the concluding semi-structured interview questions, interview data were recorded, transcribed, and anonymised, and thematic analysis was applied to identify common themes in responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>In total, 32 people participated. Data for the first two were removed, as the protocol was refined (we subsequently rebalanced the groups and their conditions). Thirty people completed the study (6 in each of the 5 in-between groups). Fifteen were male (avg. age 33), 13 were female (avg. age 36), and 2 decided not to disclose their gender (avg. age 28).

Using the Permissions interface lead to the highest inter-personal disagreement (60%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), followed by the Permissions + Purposes interface (30%). When participants were given details about third-party information flows, their answers tended to converge on a common choice (the app with the fewest data controllers, or unique/new controllers in PDCI); disagreement was lowest in Data Leaks (4%), followed by DCI (9%) and PDCI (21%).</p><p>Did participants choose the app with fewer data controllers? Yes, for the Data Leaks, DCI and PDCI interface conditions, participants were significantly (one-way ANOVA (F(4,145) = 20.59,p &lt; 0.0001)) more likely to choose the app that shared data with fewer organisations than in the permissionsbased interface conditions. A Tukey post-hoc test revealed significant differences between the Permissions condition and the rest, including Permissions + Purposes (p &lt; 0.0142), Data Leaks (p &lt; 0.0001), DCI (p &lt; 0.0001), and PDCI (p &lt; 0.0004).</p><p>The Permissions + Purposes interface also presented significant differences compared to Data Leaks (p &lt; 0.0001), DCI (p &lt; 0.0001) and PDCI (p &lt; 0.0001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect on Time Taken</head><p>A one-way ANOVA test confirmed that there was a statistically significant difference in the time taken by participants to perform each app choice task (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) among the different interface conditions (F(4,145)=9.2141,p&lt;0.0001). The average time taken to make a decision was the smallest in the Permissions condition (µ = 34.99s,σ = 12.5), followed by Permissions + Purposes (µ = 47.81s,σ = 20.83), Data Leaks (µ = 53.07s,σ = 23.78) and DCI (µ = 56.5s,σ = 27.3). The longest response time was reported using in the PDCI condition (µ =69.9s,σ =27.12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect on Confidence</head><p>A one-way ANOVA test confirmed that there was a statistically significant difference in participants' reported levels of confidence in their app choices between interface conditions(F(4,145)=27.14, p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>A Tukey post-hoc test revealed that participants' reported confidence was significantly lower in Permissions conditions (µ = 0.27, σ = 0.2, p &lt; 0.0001) compared to all the others (p &lt; 0.0001). Participants' confidence increased when more detailed information was included as part of the interface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). Merely including the purpose of use in Permissions interfaces (i.e. Permissions + Purposes) substantially raised confidence levels (µ =0.62, σ =0.2, p&lt;0.0001), and levels subsequently increased when using Data Leaks (µ =0.70, σ =0.2, p&lt;0.0001), DCI (µ =0.78, σ =0.18, p&lt;0.0001) and PDCI interfaces (µ = 0.74, σ =0.2, p&lt;0.0001). There were no significant differences between the Data Leaks, DCI and PDCI interface conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects on Decision-Making Thought Process</head><p>Our thematic analysis of participants' think-aloud process resulted in the set of codes described in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. There was substantial agreement between the coders' judgements (Cohen's kappa k = .776; p &lt; .0001). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> think-aloud processes suggested that each interface resulted in participants using different thought processes and motivations for their choices (even if the same choice was made) (H:Strategy).</p><p>There was a significant difference in the number of factors participants reported considering between each interface condition, as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(4,145)=5.848, p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Decision-making factors -Frequency (per task) that each factor was considered per interface condition. Each factor (corresponding to the tags in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) is represented as a distinct symbol. In the Permission condition, most factors were seldom considered, except 3: Types of Data (DT), Name of App (NA), and the similarity between the choices (SA) were mentioned, whilst in DCI and PDCI conditions, these factors were rarely mentioned, instead replaced by a spread of others.</p><p>In the Permissions condition, participants primarily considered the types of data being collected (DT). Most often, however, they mentioned not having sufficient information to make a decision (e.g. "not a lot of difference between them") (P7), and often mentioned that they chose randomly because they looked the same (SA) or because they liked the app's name (NA), such as P12 who said: "I'll go with [appname] because they're basically the same, but the name sounds more professional". In other conditions, participants very rarely mentioned using an app name as part of their decision making process.</p><p>The purpose of use (PU) was mentioned most often when participants were presented with the Permissions + Purposes interface. Participants paid close attention to the purposes and made judgements based on which type of purpose they believed more reasonable and necessary. For instance P2 preferred usage tracking to marketing, reporting that "usage tracking could be a good thing", whereas "marketing is too much in-your-face".</p><p>Purpose was not always deemed useful, as P9 reported "those words don't mean much to me".</p><p>When distinct controllers were presented (as in Data Leaks, DCI and PDCI conditions), the number of data controllers (NC) was the most prominent factor discussed by participants. For example P17 reported, "it instinctively makes me feel less threatened, knowing that my information will be shared with fewer people</p><p>[companies]". Similarly, P13 rejected an app because it "seems to be sending your data to random places that i don't think are going to be beneficial to anyone".</p><p>While the number of controllers was the predominant factor that participants mentioned in these conditions, they also reported basing their decision on the familiarity (or lack thereof) (FM) and the trust (TR) they had towards particular companies. For example P9 discussed the importance of recognising a specific brand "there's some comfort in Google being a brand that you recognise, as opposed to The [company name] Company. Like, who are they?". P6 reported that "my choice would be done based on which [app] is [owned by] the large company. [...] I would go for a google one because it's more likely that they already have my information".</p><p>When faced with an unfamiliar entity, several participants described the importance of companies' jurisdiction and location (CA). P26 explained his reasoning for not wanting to choose the app which shared his data with a foreign organisation, because his data would be "sent by one legislative zone to another". Four participants (P10, P25, P26, P29) discussed their concerns about having their data shared with companies based in specific countries. P25 reported "[entity] oh those are both Chinese. [...] Every problem I've had recently is due to Chinese software vulnerabilities".</p><p>In the PDCI condition, participants frequently focused on whether installing an app would result in their data being exposed to new data controllers who hadn't previously accessed it (UN &amp; AC). P4 reported "contextualisation shows that there's only one unique data flow there". P1 discussed making a trade-off between sharing his data with more, but familiar, companies versus fewer but less familiar ones: "Although [app name] doesn't have as many new companies that I need to consent to, I don't know who these are!".</p><p>Participants' decision making processes were also influenced by the specific domain (finance, health, note-taking, utilities and travel) of the app they were viewing (DO). There was a statistically significant difference in the number of factors participants considered between each type of domain, with regard to data type (what), purpose (why) and companies (who), as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(4,145)=4.0123,p&lt;0.0001), (F(4,145)= 7.8325, p &lt; 0.0001), (F(4,145) = 14.3364, p &lt; 0.0001) respectively. The type of domain of each app pair presented different expectations and resulted in different types of considerations. For example, P12 disliked finance apps that either tracked her or sent data to third parties, arguing that "it's a money management app, and I don't want my location tracked!". Others considered whether an app in a given domain could conceivably have legitimate need to collect certain data (NE), e.g. P15 reported "for [...] a note taker, there is no reason to collect my location information".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Helpfulness, Preferences and Reflections on Interfaces</head><p>At the end of the study, we asked participants to state which interface they found most helpful when deciding which app to choose. The majority of participants ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) preferred the PDCI interface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>). The DCI and Permissions + Purposes interfaces were preferred by 6 participants each, making them the second most liked interface conditions.</p><p>Permissions The standard (and currently used) Permissions interface was regarded by many participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> as the least useful one, a "standard form with no detail" (P30), which Permissions+Purposes 6 participants preferred the balance between details and clarity that the Permissions + Purposes interface provided. P14 reported "I just want to know roughly what kind of data and why. ". This interface was also reported to be the "easiest to read" (P21) and more "straightforward" (P24) than the rest. However, the remainder of participants (the majority) stated that this interface "felt uncontextualised" (P9) and lacking in "critical information" (P1), since like the Permissions interface, it "doesn't actually tell you [...] who it's sharing the information with, which is quite important"(P28).</p><p>Data Leaks The Data Leaks interface was the least favoured of all the interfaces. Participants stated that the lack of company information was disconcerting; since as P13 described "it makes me more inherently suspicious about the destination if you don't know why it's going there, and if you only have a website rather than company information that raises alarm bells". The only participant who reported finding it helpful (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>) appeared to be recognising many of the host names directly (P24).</p><p>DCI Participants who preferred DCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> reported that they found it helpful to understand and reason about unfamiliar companies using the background information the interface provides. P10 was interested in company size, as he reasoned that large companies might 'pay more attention' to laws on data protection, although he would be willing to forgive certain small start-up companies 'because they are trying their best not to misuse it'. In addition to jurisdiction and size, corporate relationships were also seen as relevant. In some cases, being a subsidiary of a known brand offered reassurance to participants and indicated that the company was reputable; "it was useful knowing it was [owned by] Twitter"(P10). However, this detailed information could also be considered a disadvantage, since some participants (4) felt that the DCI presented too much information that required too much time to be interpreted. For instance, (P14 stated that "I am not able to take the time to make much sense of that"), while for (P26), the company descriptions were "too broad" to be useful.</p><p>PDCI The majority of participants ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) preferred PDCI. They reported valuing the ability to understand and differentiate between companies who had already accessed their data (via other applications) to the ones who had not. For example P1 stated "I feel that the more new companies [there are] involved in collecting my data, the more I feel like I'm increasing my exposure to the world and to risks [...] increasing the danger of it being leaked". Similarly P10 remarked: "it's kind of in for a penny, in for a pound with Google", implying that since Google already had his information, there would be no danger in sharing it with them again.</p><p>There were some participants (4) who had reservations about PDCI due to the complexity and difficulty of understanding the variety and the number of unique data flows, as well as fears that it may encourage complacency in the face of over-zealous trackers: ("just because another app is doing it doesn't make it ok.</p><p>[PDCI] is basically saying two wrongs make a right -that's completely silly!" (P24)). This potential for complacency was recognised even by the participants who stated a clear preference for PDCI. P4 noted that while the PDCI interface was useful, there was a danger of "a ratcheting up effect, where you think well because my phone is already doing this, then I'm ok with it happening [...] so it is a double-edged sword". However, participants did recognise that this was highly dependent on the company, for example P23 described "if it's Facebook Ads [...] I don't want them to know about me through [this] app as well as the other ways they already know about me".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Revisiting our hypotheses, we found significant support for H:Strategy. Somewhat unsurprisingly, interface conditions that provided more varied information resulted in more diverse decision-making strategies. However, there was also considerable contrast in the factors considered in each; the factors used most in the control conditions (such as app name and data types), were much less frequently considered in the information-rich conditions. Instead, other factors were considered first, such as the number of data destinations and purposes of use, along with details about the destination organisations, such as their reputation, trustworthiness, and country of origin. For PDCI, the additional factor of whether choosing an app sent data to organisations that already had their data, or widened their exposure served as an important focus. Such findings suggest that these factors were more valuable to app-choice decisions than those that currently take centre stage in platform permission interfaces.</p><p>In addition to variations in strategy, the results also revealed significant effects of interface condition on app choice, lending support to H:AppChoice. Such differences included both a higher rate of inter-participant agreement when DCI and PDCI interfaces were used, as well as a significant bias towards apps that shared data to fewer destinations, compared to when Permissions-based interfaces were used. Participants took significantly longer (H:Time) with both DCI and PDCI over the other conditions. On one hand, taking longer in these conditions could be seen as drawback due to the need for more time and effort; on the other hand, however, choices with these interfaces were made considering more factors, and were ultimately made with greater confidence (H:Confidence), particularly in the DCI condition. Finally, a majority of participants said they preferred the PDCI interface (H:Preference) overall, because it was perceived as most helpful in reasoning about how their degree of exposure would change as the result of their choice.</p><p>Individually, none of these measures is sufficient to draw a definitive evaluation of the interfaces examined in this study. </p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref>. Summary of findings -Summary of findings contextualised with hypotheses they were seen to support. Details of each finding are described under Results, and discussed in Discussion.</p><p>For instance, the speed with which user makes a decision says nothing about the quality of the decision; likewise, while greater confidence may generally be a positive thing, confidence can be misplaced <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Evaluating the effectiveness of a privacy indicator therefore necessitates consideration of multiple dimensions -as well as some notion of what constitutes a 'good' privacy decision, which is itself highly contested. By providing these multiple measures we hope to enable such multi-faceted evaluation, and allow for a more nuanced deliberation on the various merits and trade-offs associated with each type of indicator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation to Prior Work</head><p>As noted in the introduction, we sought to extend prior work on privacy indicators in several ways. First, we have extended previous work on exposing third-party libraries <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, with our (P)DCI approach, which represents third-party entities not simply by a hostname, but rather as companies, incorporated and embedded in a particular social, legal and economic context. Our study suggests that users did indeed find this more helpful (supporting H:Entities and H:Background). Furthermore, to our knowledge, our study is unique in directly comparing two other styles of indicator, namely Privacy Leaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and purpose-based interfaces (such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>), via a controlled study. Second, our PDCI interface explores the notion of differential risk of installing an app: that is, the extent to which installing an app would expose an individual's data to entities who did not already have access to such data via other apps. Participants were able to use this to reason effectively about the differential impacts on their overall information exposure. This extends related work exploring similar approaches in the context of files shared to cloud backup services <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and visual representations of a user's existing overall information exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. To our knowledge, our study is the first to explore differential risk with the typical range of data collected and shared with third parties through a smartphone app. Our results show that a large proportion of users may find this form of personalised privacy indicator useful in making decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications: Better Decisions Through Transparency?</head><p>Our findings suggest providing transparency about tracking behaviours is important for several reasons. First, there was substantial variability in people's sensitivity to being tracked. A few disliked the idea of being tracked altogether, and, lacking the ability to control or know about what was going on, had resorted to the strategy of using apps minimally and avoiding installing new apps altogether. By providing greater transparency, these individuals could purposely find and choose apps that disclosed minimally to entities they trusted, and be more confident in their use.</p><p>A majority of people, however, were pragmatic. One of the most important findings of our work is the variation in the ways such pragmatists chose apps in the information-rich conditions. While certain heuristics (such as number of data controllers) were often important, there was no universal tactic for anticipating what people would consider a "better" choice; it was clear that different factors mattered for different people. For instance, while some expressed their love for and trust in Google; others felt resigned to Google having "everything". Still others were resolutely against Google gaining any more information about them. Even for lesserknown controllers, participants attitudes ranged from thinking that they were "probably harmless" to being deeply suspicious. These highly idiosyncratic forms of reasoning suggest that interfaces such as (P)DCI allow non-experts to effectively make choices that reflect their individual preferences, biases and world-views. They achieve this by re-contextualising the decision, representing it as a choice between ecosystems of data controllers as social entities, rather than as a choice between one app or another. Ultimately, these kinds of transparency mechanisms might encourage users to choose apps with more reasonable data collection and sharing practices, thus exerting pressure on app developers and third party services to reform standards in the app market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Findings and Modelling Accuracy</head><p>With regard potential limitations, it might be assumed that the study results depended crucially on the accuracy of the techniques used to model app data sharing behaviours. However, we believe this to not be the case; the apps and their descriptions were entirely fictional, and although the models were derived from real apps, they were randomly assigned from among the archetypes selected from a much larger set. Therefore, we believe the results could be attributed more to the kinds of information and means of conveyance, rather than the specifics of what was conveyed, namely data in the captured models. This is not to say that accuracy would not matter in a real deployment; for privacy indicators to carry any weight, people would need to be able to trust their accuracy and completeness. Even when participants were told in the study that the apps were fictional, some participants were intrigued as to how the data represented in the DCI was detected, and keen to confirm their veracity. If such trust were compromised, people would likely ignore the indicators outright, making them useless. This leads to the obvious question of how such app behaviours should be measured, by whom, and how they should be verified. While app developers themselves generally know what their apps are doing in their code, they may have a perverse incentive to not report them for fear of discouraging potential users (creating a problematic information asymmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Companies that run app marketplaces, such as Google and Apple, are another obvious possibility, as the anchors of trust that arbitrate which apps can enter their ecosystems. However, leaving such analysis to the operators of these platforms raises its own problems, as they themselves are purveyors of apps which may collect large amounts of personal data. In some cases, these companies are beneficiaries (or even owners) of the very third party advertising networks that would be the subject of their audit activity, creating a conflict of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Moreover, if data collection and dissemination behaviours become widely known, it is possible, even likely, that third party entities will start to resort to covert methods that are harder to detect. For example, instead of simply encrypting data via HTTPS, apps could further encrypt the payload, or use techniques such as certificate pinning <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Such technical challenges mean that alternative approaches, such as static analysis or runtime instrumentation, may ultimately need to be used. However, even these "deeper" approaches are at risk of being ineffective (or illegal) if developers start to employ DRM to hide their information collecting activities, since reverse engineering DRM can fall foul of copyright law in many countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Thus, the ultimately sustainability of approaches to achieving transparency may depend on either voluntary compliance by platform providers, or an external force such as a regulatory policy change requiring such disclosure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS</head><p>There are several potential limitations of our primary findings. The first pertains to the ecological validity of our results. Since our methodology used a lab study requiring role-play and decisions about fictional apps, there are many potential ways that a real field deployment of (P)DCI indicators might yield different results. In designing the lab study, however, we took steps to make the study more realistic, and make it easier for people to treat the role-playing tasks as genuine. First, we chose a common role-play task that would be as familiar as possible to our participant population, who we selected to ensure all had experience installing apps. Second, to ensure that the fictional apps were realistic, we used real models to drive all interface conditions, which we fictionalised only by changing the name of the app and company. Thus, the interfaces were as close to real as possible, while avoiding the use of real apps which would have presented the challenge of prior familiarity. Finally, we attempted to recreate platform interfaces for control conditions as close to the originals as possible, to the extent that this was feasible.</p><p>A second limitation of the study pertains to its scope: we focused on a single, common decision-making context. As discussed already, there are many other privacy-related decisions people make routinely regarding their apps, and whether indicators like PDCI will help in these other contexts will likely vary upon the particular situation. Moreover, even for app choice, our tasks were simplified to involve choosing only between two apps, whilst in real life people may be selecting among dozens or even hundreds.</p><p>While using real app models was beneficial for ecological validity, it simultaneously meant we were limited in the extent to which we could examine the decisions that were made. For example, we were not able to tweak the models in each round to measure specific thresholds for decisions being made, such as by incrementally varying the number of data collection hosts or company reputations. One reason that we felt this was out of the scope of what we wanted to look at initially is that it was likely that these specific thresholds would likely vary significantly, from one person to another, or even for a single person between situations. We intend to examine such detailed preferences and variation in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>This study revealed that making apps' data collection and sharing behaviours transparent to users was beneficial in several ways. Participants were able to consider to what extent using an app would increase their exposure to third parties, and weigh a much larger variety of factors to determine whether they were comfortable with the parties gaining access to their data. The result was that people made different choices than with a traditional permissions interface, and had higher confidence in their choices. However, the continued ability to be able to detect and discern such behaviours of apps is under threat, as apps and platforms are likely to hide the particular information pathways we used to collect data from scrutiny in the future. We believe keeping pathways open and scrutable, and making information collection behaviours accountable, will lead to greater trust in apps in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>CHI 2017 ,</head><label>2017</label><figDesc>May 06-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA © 2017 ACM.
