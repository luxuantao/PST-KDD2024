<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The quest for a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for Nash equilibrium in a two-player game, which emerged as a major open question in algorithmic game theory, seeks to circumvent the PPAD-completeness of finding an (exact) Nash equilibrium by finding an approximate equilibrium. The closely related problem of finding an equilibrium maximizing a certain objective, such as social welfare, was shown to be NP-hard [Gilboa and Zemel, Games Econom. Behav., 1  (1989), pp. 80-93]. However, this NP-hardness is unlikely to extend to approximate equilibria, since the latter admits a quasi-polynomial time algorithm [Lipton, Markakis, and Mehta, in Proceedings of the 4th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, ACM, New York, 2003, pp. 36-41]. We show that this optimization problem, namely, finding in a two-player game an approximate equilibrium achieving a large social welfare, is unlikely to have a polynomial-time algorithm. One interpretation of our results is that a PTAS for Nash equilibrium (if it exists) should not extend to a PTAS for finding the best Nash equilibrium. Technically, our result is a reduction from the notoriously difficult problem in modern combinatorics, of finding a planted (but hidden) clique in a random graph G(n, 1/2). Our reduction starts from an instance with planted clique size O(log n). For comparison, the currently known algorithms are effective only for a much larger clique size Ω( √ n).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Introduction. Computational aspects of equilibrium concepts (and in particular of Nash equilibrium) have seen major advances over the last few years, both from the side of algorithms and in terms of computational complexity (namely, completeness and hardness results). Perhaps the most celebrated result in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) proves that computing a Nash equilibrium in a finite game with two players is PPAD-complete. Consequently, a weaker notion of ε-approximate Nash equilibrium, or in short an ε-equilibrium, was suggested, and the following has emerged as a central open question:</p><p>Is there a PTAS for Nash equilibrium? Recall that the acronym PTAS stands for polynomial-time approximation scheme, meaning that for every fixed ε &gt; 0 there is a polynomial-time algorithm. The question highlighted above thus asks for a polynomial-time algorithm that finds an ε-Nash equilibrium for arbitrarily small but fixed ε &gt; 0. Here and in the rest of this paper, we follow the literature and assume that the game's payoffs are in the interval [0, 1], and approximations are measured additively; see section 2 for precise definitions.</p><p>While every game has at least one Nash equilibrium, the game may actually have many equilibria, some more desirable than others. Thus, an attractive solution concept is to find a Nash equilibrium maximizing an objective such as the social welfare (the total utility of all players). For two-player games this problem is known to be NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. But as we shall soon see, this hardness result is unlikely to extend to ε-equilibrium.</p><p>A fairly simple yet surprisingly powerful technique is random sampling, where each player's mixed strategy x is replaced by another mixed strategy x that has small support, obtained by sampling a few pure strategies independently from x and taking x to be a uniform distribution over the chosen pure strategies. (We allow repetitions, i.e., the support is viewed as a multiset.) This technique leads to a simple algorithm that finds, for a two-player game, an ε-equilibrium in quasi-polynomial time N O(ε -2 log N ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, assuming that the game is represented as two N × N matrices. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>Indeed, applying random sampling on any Nash equilibrium together with Chernofflike concentration bounds yields an ε-equilibrium consisting of mixed strategies that are each uniform over a multiset of size O(ε -2 log N ), and such an ε-equilibrium can be found by enumeration (exhaustive search). In fact, this argument applies also to the social welfare maximization problem, and thus the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> finds in time N O(ε -2 log N ) an ε-equilibrium whose social welfare is no more than ε smaller than the maximum social welfare of a Nash equilibrium in the game.</p><p>The existence of a quasi-polynomial algorithm may be seen as promising evidence that a polynomial algorithm exists. The latter emerged as a major goal and has drawn intense work with encouraging progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40]</ref>, culminating (so far) with a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a 0.3393-equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. All of these algorithms, with the sole exception of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, rely on the aforementioned approach of proving the existence of a small support ε-equilibrium via sampling, and then finding such an equilibrium using enumeration (exhaustive search) in conjunction with other algorithmic tools (such as linear programming).</p><p>While progress on the approximation side has remained steady, the other side of computational lower bounds has resisted attempts to exclude PTAS by extending the known hardness results to approximations, either for any equilibrium or for an objective-maximizing one. For instance, the aforementioned PPAD-hardness results <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> extend to a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS), which is defined similarly to a PTAS except for the additional requirement that the running time is polynomial also in 1/ε; they extend also to the smoothed complexity of the problem. These two extensions fall short of excluding a PTAS, and the reason for this difficulty might be the aforementioned quasi-polynomial time algorithms, due to which it is less plausible that we can prove hardness of approximation based on NP-hardness or PPAD-hardness for the corresponding question.</p><p>In this paper we use a nonstandard hardness assumption to give the first negative evidence for the existence of a PTAS for the objective-maximizing question. We design a reduction from the well-known problem of finding a hidden (planted) clique in a random graph. The latter choice is nonstandard, as the problem appears to be hard on the average rather than in a worst-case sense. However, in several respects it is an ideal choice. First, it admits a straightforward quasi-polynomial time algorithm. Second, the average-case nature of the problem is particularly suited for constructing games with a highly regular structure, which will be important in our reduction.</p><p>The hidden clique problem. Denote by G n,p the distribution over graphs on n vertices generated by placing an edge between every pair of vertices independently with probability p.</p><p>In the hidden clique problem, the input is a graph on n vertices drawn at random from the following distribution G n,1/2,k : pick k = k(n) arbitrary vertices and place on them a k-clique, then connect every other pair of vertices by an edge independently with probability 1/2. In other words, the graph is random (like in G n,1/2 ) except for a planted clique whose "location" is hidden (not known to the algorithm) because the clique vertices are chosen by an adversary (but independently of the random graph, e.g., of its degrees). The goal is to recover the planted clique (in polynomial time), with probability at least (say) 1/2 over the input distribution.</p><p>In a random graph, the maximum size of a clique is, with high probability, roughly 2 log n, and when the parameter k is larger than this value, the planted clique will be, with high probability, the unique maximum clique in the graph, and the problem's goal is simply to find the maximum clique in the graph (see Lemma 2.2 for details). The problem was suggested independently by Jerrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and by Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>It is not difficult to see that the hidden clique problem becomes easier only as k gets larger, and the best polynomial-time algorithm to date, due to Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, solves the problem whenever k = Ω( √ n) (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). Improving over this bound is a well-known open problem, and certain algorithmic techniques provably fail this task, namely the Metropolis process <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the Lovász-Schrijver hierarchy of relaxations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Recent results <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> based on r-dimensional tensors (the generalization of matrices to dimension r ≥ 3) suggest an algorithmic approach capable of finding a hidden clique of size O(n 1/r ), but currently this tensor-based approach is not known to yield a polynomial-time algorithm.</p><p>The hidden clique problem can be easily solved in quasi-polynomial time n O(log n) ; for the most difficult regime k = O(log n), this is obviously true (via exhaustive search) even for worst-case instances of the maximum clique problem.</p><p>1.1. Our results. We relate the worst-case hardness of finding an approximate equilibrium to that of solving the hidden clique problem, formally stated as follows.</p><p>Theorem 1.1. There are constants ε, ĉ &gt; 0 such that the following holds. If there is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds in an input two-player game an ε-equilibrium whose social welfare is no more than ε smaller than the maximum social welfare of an equilibrium in this game, then there is a (randomized) polynomial-time algorithm that solves the hidden clique problem for k = ĉ log n with high probability.</p><p>We remark that our proof is actually shown for the special case of symmetric two-player games (see section 2 for definitions), which only makes the result stronger (since this is a hardness result). We make no attempt to optimize various constants in the proofs.</p><p>Subsequent work. Recently, Minder and Vilenchik <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> improved the constants in our main theorem, showing that a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the best Nash equilibrium implies a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a hidden clique of size (3+δ) log n in a random graph, or alternatively for the decision version of detecting a hidden clique of size (2+δ) log n, for an arbitrarily small constant δ &gt; 0. The leading constant 2 is a natural barrier for the problem, since a clique of size roughly 2 log n exists in a random graph with very high probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Related work.</head><p>There are complexity classes that attempt to capture problems requiring running time n O(log n) ; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> and the references in section 5 therein. It is plausible that our approach of relying on the hidden clique problem may be used to prove hardness of approximation for problems mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, such as the VC dimension of a 0-1 matrix and the minimum dominating set in a tournament graph.</p><p>Average-case hardness. The hidden clique problem is related to the assumption that refuting 3-satisfiability (3SAT) is hard on average (for low-density formulas), which was used by Feige <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to derive constant factor hardness of approximation for Downloaded 12/20/12 to 138.26.31.3. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php several problems, such as minimum bisection, dense k-subgraph, and maximum bipartite clique. His results may be interpreted as evidence that approximation within the same (or similar) factor is actually NP-hard, which is a plausible possibility but not known to date. In fact, the random 3SAT refutation conjecture may be viewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> as an analogue of the hidden clique problem, in the following sense. An important distinction between these two average-case problems appears to be that straightforward algorithms based on enumeration require different running times, exponential for one problem and quasi-polynomial for the other. However, they are based on different yet related combinatorial optimization problems, and it is perhaps not surprising that some of the inapproximability results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> can be shown (more or less) also under the assumption that the hidden clique problem cannot be solved in polynomial time. Consider for example the dense k-subgraph problem; the hidden clique graph itself obviously contains a k-vertex subgraph of full density, while any algorithm that is likely to find in it a sufficiently dense k-vertex subgraph can be used to find the planted clique; see, e.g., Lemma 5.3. The argument for the maximum bipartite clique problem is similar.</p><p>It is worth noting that the assumption that the hidden clique problem is hard was used in a few other contexts, including for cryptographic applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and for hardness of testing almost k-wise independence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The decision version of the hidden clique problem, namely, to distinguish between the distributions G n,1/2,k and G n,1/2 , is attributed to Saks in <ref type="bibr">[29, section 5]</ref>.</p><p>Computing equilibria. The last decade has seen a vast amount of literature on computational aspects of equilibria in various scenarios, including, e.g., succinct games (where the payoffs can be represented succinctly, e.g., due to strong symmetries or because direct interaction between players is limited to a certain graph structure) or markets (where sellers and buyers interact via prices). For more details, we refer the reader to the excellent and timely surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref> and the many references therein. More concretely for Nash equilibrium in bimatrix games, see the recent surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>.</p><p>In general, the problems of finding any equilibrium and that of finding an equilibrium that maximizes some objective need not have the same (runtime) complexity, although certain algorithmic techniques may be effective to both. As mentioned earlier, this indeed happens for ε-equilibrium in two-player games when employing random sampling combined with quasi-polynomial enumeration. Another example is the use of the discretization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which was recently used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to find an ε-equilibrium in anonymous games with fixed number of strategies, but actually extends to the value-maximization version <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.

A (square) two-player bimatrix game is defined by two payoff matrices R, C ∈ R n×n , such that if the row and column players choose pure strategies i, j ∈ [n], respectively, the payoffs to the row and column players are R(i, j) and C(i, j), respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ELAD HAZAN AND ROBERT KRAUTHGAMER</head><p>Techniques. Our construction is motivated by an observation of Motzkin and Straus <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> (and independently by Halperin and Hazan <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>) that for every graph, the quadratic form corresponding to the graph's adjacency matrix, when considered over the unit simplex (i.e., all probability distributions over [n]), is maximized exactly at a (normalized) incidence vector of a maximum clique in the graph. We rely on this observation, as one portion of the game we construct is exactly the adjacency matrix of the hidden clique instance. However, this is not enough to obtain a suitable Nash equilibrium instance.</p><p>First, an equilibrium is a bilinear form rather than a quadratic form, so hence the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> are not directly applicable. We thus use (mainly in Lemma 5.2) the special properties of an approximate equilibrium to prove a relationship of similar flavor between bilinear forms on the adjacency matrix and large cliques (or actually dense subgraphs) in the graph.</p><p>Second, a simple use of the adjacency matrix yields a very small gap (between vectors corresponding to a clique and those that do not) that is by far insufficient to rule out a PTAS. To boost this gap we use an idea of Feder, Nazerzadeh, and Saberi <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to eliminate from the game all equilibria of small support (cardinality at most O(log n)).</p><p>The construction. Let ε, ĉ and M, c 1 , c 2 be constants to be defined shortly.

The following two claims are stated with a general parameter δ &gt; 0, although we will later use them only with a specific value δ = ε.</p><p>Claim 5.1. In every pair of mixed strategies achieving value ≥ 1δ, at most δ of the probability mass of each player resides on strategies not in <ref type="bibr">[n]</ref>.</p><p>Proof. The contribution to the value of the equilibrium from outside the upper left block is 0, because over there the game is zero-sum. Inside that block the two players receive identical payoffs, which are according to A and thus upper bounded by 1. Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1 -δ ≤ 1 2 x (R + C)y = i,j∈[n] x i y j A ij ≤ ⎛ ⎝ i∈[n] x i ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ j∈[n] y j ⎞ ⎠ ,</formula><p>and it immediately follows that both i∈ <ref type="bibr">[n]</ref> x i and j∈[n] y j are at least 1δ. Claim 5.2. Given an ε-equilibrium where at most δ of each player's probability mass resides on strategies not in [n], we can find an (ε + 3M δ)-equilibrium that is supported only on A and whose value is at least as large.</p><p>Proof. Given an ε-equilibrium (x, y), we obtain a new equilibrium (x, ỹ) by restricting each player's support to [n], i.e., removing strategies not in [n] and scaling to obtain a probability distribution. Since the game is zero-sum outside of A, removing strategies not in A does not change the value, and since the entries in A are nonnegative, the scaling operation can only increase the value, i.e., x (R+C)ỹ ≥ x (R+C)y.</p><p>To bound defections, consider without loss of generality the row player. First, her payoff when defecting to strategy i ∈ [N ] does not change much, i.e., |e i Rỹ -e i Ry| ≤ M δ, because the total mass of y moved around is at most δ, and because entries in the same row (or same column) of R differ by at most M . Furthermore, her payoff in the new equilibrium does not change much, i.e., |x Rỹx Ry| ≤ 2M δ, again because at most 2δ of the total probability mass of x and y was moved.</p><p>Lemma 5.1 now follows immediately from the two claims above by setting δ = ε.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Proof of Lemma 5.2.</head><p>To prove this lemma, we first need the following structural claim.</p><p>Claim 5.3. With high probability, in every 1/2-equilibrium supported only on the matrix A, the total probability mass every player places on every set of c 2 log n pure strategies is ≤ 2/M . Proof. For convenience, denote d = c 2 log n. Suppose that one of the players, say the column player, has probability mass of more than 2 M on a given set of d strategies. Let us compute the probability that there exists a row in B in which the d corresponding entries all have a value of M . If this event happens, then we do not have an ε-equilibrium, since the row player can defect to this particular row, to obtain payoff ≥ 2 M • M = 2, while her current payoff is ≤ 1. The probability this event happens for a single row is very small, namely p d for p = 3 4M . But we have Nn rows, and they are independent. Thus, the probability that no row has a streak of M 's in the particular d columns is at most</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(1 -p d ) N -n ≤ exp(-p d N/2) = exp(-n c1-c2 log 4M 3 /2) = exp(-n 2 /2),</formula><p>where the last inequality is by our choice of c 1 and c 2 . Hence with probability ≥ 1e -n 2 /2 , there is such a row, and this cannot be an equilibrium. We now need to rule out all possible subsets sets of size d. There are n d ≤ n d such subsets, and each one cannot be an equilibrium with probability ≥ 1e -n 2 /2 . We can rule out all of them by a union bound, since n d • e -n 2 /2 ≤ e -Ω(n 2 ) . Downloaded 12/20/12 to 138.26.31.3. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php Proof of Lemma 5.2. Let (x, y) be such a (4M ε)-equilibrium. Define T = {j ∈ supp(y) : x Ae j ≥ 4  5 }, where e j is the jth standard basis vector. Observe that T is nonempty, since x Ay ≥ 1ε. Furthermore, its total probability mass must be j∈T y j &gt; 2 M , as otherwise x Ay</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">≤ 2 M • 1 + (1 -2 M ) • 4 5 &lt; 1 -ε by our choice of ε.

To get size exactly c 2 log n, we can just take an arbitrary subset of T and rename it to be T . Thus we assume henceforth |T | = c 2 log n. Denoting by u T the uniform distribution on T , the pair (x, u T ) satisfies</p><p>x Au T ≥ 4  5 .</p><p>Now define S = {i ∈ supp(x) : e i Au T ≥ 3 5 }.

By again applying Claim 5.3 to the 1/2-equilibrium (x, y), we then have |S| &gt; c 2 log n. Again, to get size exactly c 2 log n, we can just take an arbitrary subset of S and rename it to be the set S itself. Let u S be the uniform distribution over the set S. Then u S Au T ≥ 3 5 , i.e., S, T define a bipartite subgraph of size c 2 log n and density ≥ 3 5 . We can bound the probability of this necessary event as follows. The density between S \ W and T is essentially the average of Θ(c 2 log n) 2 Bernoulli random variables each with expectation 1/2 (strictly speaking, there are two exceptions: some Bernoulli variables are included twice, and at most c 2 log n terms correspond to selfloops). Thus, by the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound above, Pr[density(S \ W, T ) ≥ 0.55] ≤ exp(-Ω(c 2 log n) 2 ). Putting these facts together using a union bound, 1) .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding remarks.</head><p>We have shown that a PTAS for the "best" Nash equilibrium implies an efficient algorithm to a seemingly difficult combinatorial optimization problem. The measure of quality for equilibria we have used is the total payoff to the two players. It seems plausible that other quality measures, such as those considered by Gilboa and Zemel <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, can be reduced to the hidden clique problem in much the same way.</p><p>The problem from which we carry out the reduction, namely the hidden clique problem, is nonstandard in the sense that it is an assumption about average-case hardness (in addition to being easily solvable in quasi-polynomial time). It is plausible that it suffices to assume worst-case hardness, and show, e.g., a reduction from the problem of finding in an n-vertex graph a clique of size O(log n). In light of the known quasi-polynomial time algorithms, an alternative complexity assumption that could potentially be used is that (say) maximum clique cannot be solved in time 2 O( √ n log n) ; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Yet another direction is to relate the hardness of computing the best Nash equilibria to the complexity class logarithmically-restricted NP (LOGNP) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, because it naturally captures the known (quasi-polynomial time) algorithms for approximating Nash equilibria.</p><p>Finally, an intriguing question is whether such techniques can possibly be applied to the problem of finding a PTAS for any Nash equilibrium, i.e., to the regime of the PPAD complexity class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix. Deferred proof from section 2.</head><p>Proof of Lemma 2.2. Suppose there exists a polynomial-time algorithm A * that, given the hidden clique problem with k ≥ c 1 log n, finds a clique of size 100 log n. We prove that there exists a (randomized) polynomial-time algorithm that solves the hidden clique problem exactly for every k ≥ c 0 log n, where c 0 = 2tc 1 for a sufficiently large t to be determined later. The algorithm is composed of two stages.</p><p>Stage 1. Randomly partition the graph vertices into t parts. In each part, the expected number of vertices from the planted clique vertices is k/t ≥ c0 log n t = 2c 1 log n. Furthermore, using Chernoff bounds it can be shown that with probability &gt; 7/8, every part contains at least c 1 log n vertices from the hidden clique. In our analysis we shall assume henceforth that this is the case.</p><p>In each part separately, first complete it into an instance of hidden clique of size exactly n by adding nn/t vertices and connecting all new potential edges with probability 1  2 . Then apply the polynomial-time algorithm A * . Observe that each part is distributed exactly as a hidden clique instance, and by our assumption its hidden clique size is large enough that algorithm A * succeeds, with probability ≥ 1/2, in finding a clique of size at least 100 log n. Since the different parts are independent, the probability that A * succeeds in one or less parts is ≤ (t + 1)2 -t &lt; 1/8 for, say, t = 6.</p><p>Even if this does not occur, report fail. Henceforth assume that A * succeeds in at least two parts.</p><p>In each part where A * succeeds, we may assume that the clique size is exactly 100 log n by removing arbitrary vertices from it. It can be shown that in the random portion of the graph (i.e., not using the planted clique), the maximum clique size is with very high probability at most 3 log n. In our analysis we shall assume henceforth Downloaded 12/20/12 to 138.26.31.3. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php that this is the case in all parts of the partition, and hence at least 97 log n among the 100 log n vertices of the clique found belong to the planted clique.</p><p>Stage 2. In each part i apply the following. Identify another part j = i, where A * succeeded in finding a clique of size 100 log n. Select the vertices in the part i whose degree towards the clique found in part j is at least 97 log n. Call these vertices Q i and report all selected vertices, i.e., Q = ∪ i Q i .</p><p>To analyze this stage, observe that a vertex v from part i that belongs to the planted clique must have degree at least 97 log n towards the clique found in another part j, and thus belongs to Q i . On the other hand, for a vertex v in part i that does not belong to the planted clique, the expected degree towards any fixed subset of 100 log n vertices in part j is 50 log n. Notice that the choice of the part j and the clique found in it are determined only by the edges internal to the different parts (possibly in a complicated way, e.g., if A * succeeds in more than two parts, then j will depend on the tie breaking method), and are thus completely independent of the edges connecting different parts. Thus, the probability that v has degree at least 97 log n towards the corresponding clique in part j is, using the Chernoff bound, 1/n 2 . By a union bound over all vertices we get that with very high probability all such vertices do not belong to Q i . Combining this with the events mentioned earlier, we get by a union bound that Q = ∪ i Q i contains exactly all the hidden clique vertices with probability at least 2/3.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Lemma 5 . 3 .Claim 5 . 4 . 1 20</head><label>53541</label><figDesc>The main step in proving Lemma 5.3 is the following claim, which shows that a dense bipartite subgraph can be used to recover a large clique. With high probability, given a bipartite subgraph of size c 2 log n and density ≥3  5 in the input graph, we can efficiently find a clique of size 100 log n. Proof. Let S * , T * ⊂ V (G) be the two sets forming a bipartite subgraph with density(S * , T * ) ≥ 3 5 , and let W ⊂ V (G) denote the vertices of the planted clique, i.e., |W | = k. In what follows, we use a union bound to show that with high probability at least 1 20 of the vertices in S * must lie in the planted clique W . The number of possible sets S, T ⊂ V (G) with |S| = |T | = c 2 log n and |S ∩ W | &lt; |S| is at most n |S| n |T | ≤ n 2c2 log n . Now fix two such sets S, T . For the event density(S, T ) ≥ 3/5 to occur, it is necessary to have density(S \ W, T ) ≥ 0.55, because otherwise density(S, T ) = |S∩W | |S| density(S∩W, T )+ S\W |S| density(S\W, T ) &lt; 1 20 •1+ 19 20 •0.55 &lt; 3 5 .</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_1"><p>2.2. The hidden clique problem.Recall that in this problem the input is drawn at random from the distribution G n,1/2,k . Intuitively, the problem only becomes easier as k gets larger, at least in our regime of interest, namely, k ≥ c 0 log n for sufficiently large constant c 0 &gt; 0. This intuition can be made precise as follows.Lemma 2.2. Suppose there are a constant c 1 &gt; 0 and a polynomial-time algorithm such that given an instance of the hidden clique problem with k ≥ c 1 log n, this algorithm finds a clique of size 100 log n with probability at least 1/2. Then there exists a constant c 0 &gt; 0 and a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that solves the hidden clique problem for every k ≥ c 0 log n.This lemma is probably known, but since we could not provide a reference, we prove it in the appendix, essentially using ideas from<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Notice that one cannot employ simple techniques that are useful in worst-case instances, such as repeatedly finding and removing from the input graph a clique of size 100 log n (using the assumed algorithm), because such operations affect the graph distribution (even one such iteration results in a graph not distributed like G n,1/2,k ) not to mention, of course, that the assumed algorithm succeeds only with probability 1/2 (and repeating it need not amplify the success probability).3. The reduction. We prove Theorem 1.1 by reducing the hidden clique problem to the Nash equilibrium problem. That is, given an input instance of the hidden clique problem we construct a two-player game such that with high probability (over the randomness in our construction and in the hidden clique instance), a high-value approximate equilibrium leads, in polynomial time, to a solution to the hidden clique instance.
