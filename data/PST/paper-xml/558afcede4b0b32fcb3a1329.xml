The model assumes that the pixel reflectances result from linear combinations of pure component spectra contaminated by an additive Gaussian noise. The abundance parameters appearing in this model satisfy positivity and additivity constraints. These constraints are naturally expressed in a Bayesian context by using appropriate abundance prior distributions. The posterior distributions of the unknown model parameters are then derived. A Gibbs sampler allows one to draw samples distributed according to the posteriors of interest and to estimate the unknown abundances. An extension of the algorithm is finally studied for mixtures with unknown numbers of spectral components belonging to a know library. The performance of the different unmixing strategies is evaluated via simulations conducted on synthetic and real data.</p><p>Index Terms-Gibbs sampler, hierarchical Bayesian analysis, hyperspectral images, linear spectral unmixing, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, reversible jumps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>S PECTRAL unmixing has been widely used in remote sensing signal processing for data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Its underlying assumption is based on the fact that all data sample vectors are mixed by a number of so-called endmembers assumed to be present in the data. By virtue of this assumption, two models have been investigated in the past to model how mixing activities take place. One is the macrospectral mixture that describes a mixed pixel as a linear mixture of endmembers opposed to the other model suggested by Hapke <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, referred to as intimate mixture that models a mixed pixel as a nonlinear mixture. Nonetheless, it has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> that the intimate model could be linearized to simplify analysis. Accordingly, only linear spectral unmixing is considered in this paper. In order for linear spectral unmixing to be effective, three key issues must be addressed. One is the number of endmembers assumed to be in the data for linear mixing. Another is how to estimate these endmembers once the number of endmembers is determined. The third issue is algorithms designed for linear unmixing (also referred to as inversion algorithms). While much work in linear spectral unmixing is devoted to the third issue, the first and second issues have been largely ignored or avoided by assuming availability of prior knowledge. Therefore, most linear unmixing techniques currently being developed in the literature are supervised, that is the knowledge of endmembers is assumed to be given a priori. This paper considers a semi-supervised linear spectral unmixing approach which determines how many endmembers from a given spectral library should be present in the data and uses the desired endmembers for linear spectral unmixing. In some real applications, the endmembers must be obtained directly from the data itself without prior knowledge. In this case, the proposed algorithm has to be combined with an endmember extraction algorithm such as the well-known N-finder algorithm (N-FINDR) developed by <ref type="bibr">Winter [4]</ref> to find desired endmembers which will be used to form a base of the linear mixing model (LMM).</p><p>As explained above, the inversion step of an unmixing algorithm has already received much attention in the literature (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and references therein). The LMM is classically used to model the spectrum of a pixel in the observed scene. This model assumes that the spectrum of a given pixel is related to endmember spectra via linear relations whose coefficients are referred to as abundance coefficients or abundances. The inversion problem then reduces to estimate the abundances from the observed pixel spectrum. The abundances satisfy the constraints of non-negativity and full additivity. Consequently, their estimation requires to use a quadratic programming algorithm with linear equalities and inequalities as constraints. Different estimators including constrained least squares and minimum variance estimators were developed using these ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This paper studies a hierarchical Bayesian estimator which allows one to estimate the abundances in an LMM. The proposed algorithm defines appropriate prior distributions for the unknown signal parameters (here the abundance coefficients and the noise variance) and estimates these unknown parameters from their posterior distributions. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>The complexity of the posterior distributions for the unknown parameters requires to use appropriate simulation methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The prior distributions used in the present paper depend on hyperparameters which have to be determined. There are mainly two approaches which can be used to estimate these hyperparameters. The first approach couples MCMCs with an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm which allows one to estimate the unknown hyperparameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, as explained in <ref type="bibr">[10, p. 259</ref>], the EM algorithm suffers from the initialization issue and can converge to local maxima or saddle points of the log-likelihood function. The second approach defines non-informative prior distributions for the hyperparameters introducing a second level of hierarchy within the Bayesian paradigm. The hyperparameters are then integrated out from the joint posterior distribution or estimated from the observed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This second strategy results in a hierarchical Bayesian estimator which will show interesting properties for unmixing hyperspectral images. Another advantage of the hierarchical Bayesian estimator is that it allows one to estimate the full posterior distribution of the unknown parameters and hyperparameters. As a result, these posterior distributions can be used to derive confidence intervals for the unknown parameters, providing information on the significance of the estimations.</p><p>The proposed spectral unmixing problem is formulated as a constrained linear regression problem. Bayesian models are particularly appropriate for these problems since the constraints can be included in the prior distribution. The support of the posterior then reduces to the constrained parameter space. Examples of constraints recently studied in the literature include monotone constraints and positivity constraints. Monotony can be handled efficiently by using truncated Gaussian priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Positivity constraints can be satisfied by choosing Gamma priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or truncated Gaussian priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. It is interesting to mention here that similar ideas have also been recently exploited to handle linear sparse approximation models. For instance, sparsity can be ensured by defining factoring mixtures with modified Rayleigh priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> or Student priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This paper defines a Bayesian model with priors satisfying positivity and additivity<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> constraints as required in hyperspectral imagery. To our knowledge, this is the first time a Bayesian model based on these constraints is proposed in the literature. The parameters of this model are estimated by an appropriate Gibbs sampler. Interestingly, the proposed sampler can handle mixtures with unknown numbers of spectral components belonging to a known library.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the usual LMM for hyperspectral images. Section III describes the different elements of the proposed hierarchical model for unmixing these hyperspectral images. Section IV studies a Gibbs sampler which allows one to generate samples distributed according to the posteriors of the unknown parameters to be estimated. The sampler convergence is investigated in Section V. Some simulation results on synthetic and real data are presented in Sections VI and VII. Section VIII shows that the number of endmembers contained in the mixing model can be estimated by including a reversible jump MCMC algorithm. Conclusions are reported in Section IX.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. LINEAR MIXING MODEL</head><p>This section defines the classical analytical model which will be used to perform spectral unmixing. This paper concentrates on the most commonly used linear unmixing problem which constitutes a good approximation in the reflective domain ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 m (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, or more recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). However, the proposed analysis might be extended to nonlinear unmixing models, for instance, by using a basis function representation approach as in <ref type="bibr">[23, p. 134</ref>]. The LMM assumes that the -spectrum of a mixed pixel is a linear combination of spectra contaminated by additive white noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where denotes the spectrum of the th material;</p><p>is the fraction of the th material in the pixel; is the number of pure materials (or endmembers) present in all the observed scene; is the number of available spectral bands for the image;</p><p>is the additive white noise sequence which is classically assumed to be an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean Gaussian sequence <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> with variance , denoted as , where is the identity matrix of dimension .

As a consequence, the proposed methodology has to be coupled with one of the many identification techniques to estimate these endmember spectra. These techniques include geometrical methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> or statistical procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The second part of the paper extends the algorithm to mixtures containing an unknown number of spectra belonging to a known library.</p></div>

This section surveys some works allowing to determine appropriate values for parameters and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Determination of the Burn-in Period</head><p>Running multiple chains with different initializations allows to define various convergence measures for MCMC methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The popular between-within variance criterion has shown interesting properties for diagnosing convergence of MCMC methods. This criterion was initially studied by Gelman and Rubin in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and has been used in many studies including <ref type="bibr">[30, p. 33</ref>], <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The main idea is to run parallel chains of length for each data set with different starting values and to evaluate the dispersion of the estimates obtained from the different chains. The between-sequence variance and within-sequence variance for the Markov chains are defined by ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where is the parameter of interest and is its estimate at the th run of the th chain. The convergence of the chain can then be monitored by the so-called potential scale reduction factor defined as <ref type="bibr">[34, p.</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Determination of the Number of Computation Iterations</head><p>Once the number of burn-in iterations has been adjusted, it is important to determine the appropriate number of iterations to obtain an accurate estimate of when using ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>). An ad hoc approach consists of assessing convergence via appropriate graphical evaluations <ref type="bibr">[30, p. 28</ref>]. This paper proposes to compute a reference estimate denoted as from a large number of iterations to ensure convergence of the sampler and good accuracy of the approximation in (13) ( in our simulations). The mean square error (MSE) between this reference estimate and the estimate obtained after iterations is then computed as</p><p>The number of iterations is finally determined as the value of ensuring the MSE is below a predefined threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SIMULATION RESULTS ON SYNTHETIC DATA</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Abundance Estimation</head><p>The accuracy of the proposed abundance estimation procedure is first illustrated by unmixing a synthetic pixel resulting from the combination of three pure components. These components have been extracted from the spectral libraries that are distributed with the ENVI software <ref type="bibr">[35, p. 1035</ref>] and are representative of an urban or suburban environment: construction concrete, green grass, and dark yellowish brown micaceous loam. The proportions of these components are defined by and . The observations have been corrupted by an additive Gaussian noise with variance , i.e., the SNR is about dB, where . The endmember spectra and the noisy spectrum of the mixed pixel are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the posterior distributions of the abundance coefficients obtained for iterations (including burn-in iterations). These distributions are in good agreement with the actual values of abundances, i.e., . For comparison, the fully constrained least-squares (FCLS) algorithm detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> has been run times for signals similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(bottom) obtained with different noise sequences. Note that running times the FCLS algorithm on a pixel requires 6.23 s for a MATLAB implementation on a 1.67-GHz Intel Core Duo.</p><p>The histograms of the FCLS abundance estimates are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (dotted lines). These histograms are clearly in good agreement with the corresponding posterior distributions obtained from the proposed hierarchical Bayesian algorithm. However, it is important to point out that the abundance posteriors shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (continuous lines) have been obtained from a given pixel spectrum, whereas the FCLS algorithm has to be run times to compute the abundance histograms. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the abundance MAP estimates of and the corresponding standard-deviations (computed from the proposed Bayesian algorithm) as a function of the SNR. These figures allow us to evaluate the estimation performance for a given SNR. Note that the SNRs of the actual spectrometers like AVIRIS are not below 30 dB when the water absorption bands have been removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. As a consequence, the results on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> indicate that the proposed Bayesian algorithm performs satisfactorily for these SNRs. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> also indicates that the proposed estimates of converge (in the mean square sense) to the actual values of when the SNR tends towards infinity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Acceptance Rate of the Sampler</head><p>The computational efficiency of the proposed Gibbs sampler is governed by the acceptation rate of the accept-reject procedure for simulating according to a truncated Gaussian distribution. The probability of accepting a sample distributed according to a truncated Gaussian distribution is denoted , where and and have been defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Straightforward computations allow us to obtain (18)  where is the probability density function (pdf) of a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean and covariance matrix . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> compares the theoretical acceptation rate resulting from a rectangle integration method which is compared with the experimental one estimated from the generation of 5000 Gaussian variables. These results have been obtained for a given value of as a function of the SNR. However, these results do not change significantly for other values of . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows that the acceptation rate is an increasing function of SNR, as expected. It also shows that the acceptation rate is very satisfactory for typical SNRs encountered in hyperspectral imagery ( dB). It is interesting to mention here that we did not experience any problem in our simulations regarding the time required for simulating according to the truncated Gaussian distribution, since the number of endmembers present in the image is relatively small. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Sampler Convergence</head><p>The sampler convergence is monitored by computing the potential scale reduction factor introduced in Section V-A for an appropriate parameter of interest. Different choices for the parameter could be considered for the proposed unmixing procedure. This paper proposes to monitor the convergence of the Gibbs sampler by checking the noise variance (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> for a similar choice). The potential scale reduction factor for parameter computed from Markov chains is equal to 0.9996. This value of confirms the good convergence of the sampler (a recommendation for convergence assessment is a value of <ref type="bibr">[34, p. 332]</ref>). The number of iterations necessary to compute an accurate estimate of according to the MMSE principle in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is determined by monitoring the MSE between a reference estimate (obtained with</p><p>) and the estimate obtained after iterations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows this MSE as a function of the number of iterations (the number of burn-in iterations is</p><p>). This figure indicates that a number of iterations equal to is sufficient to ensure an accurate estimation of the empirical average in (13) for this example. Note that, for such values of and , unmixing this pixel takes approximately 0.3 s for a MATLAB implementation on a 2.8-GHz Pentium IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. SPECTRAL UNMIXING OF AN AVIRIS IMAGE</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for actual data, this section presents the analysis of an hyperspectral image that has received much attention in the remote sensing and image processing communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The image depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> has 224 spectral bands, a nominal bandwidth of 10 nm, and was acquired in 1997 by the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Moffett Field, at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay, CA (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> for more details). It consists of a large water point (a part of a lake that appears in dark pixel at the top of the image) and a coastal area composed of vegetation and soil. The data set has been reduced from the original 224 bands to bands by removing water absorption bands. Subimages of size 50 50 observed in spectral bands have been processed by the proposed unmixing algorithm. This portion of the image is represented in gray scale at wavelength m (band 30) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Endmember Determination</head><p>The first step of the analysis identifies the pure materials that are present in the scene. Note that a preliminary knowledge of the ground geology would allow us to use a supervised method for endmember extraction (e.g., by averaging the pixel spectra on appropriate regions of interest). Such data being not available, a fully automatic procedure has been implemented. This procedure includes a principal component analysis (PCA) which allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to know the number of endmembers present in the scene as explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. After computing the cumulative normalized eigenvalues, the data have been projected on the first two principal axes (associated to the two larger eigenvalues) which contain more than 95% of the information (i.e.,</p><p>). The vertices of the simplex defined by the centered-whitened data in the new 2-D space are determined by the N-FINDR algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The resulting endmember spectra corresponding to vegetation, water and soil are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. It is interesting to note that other endmember extraction algorithms have been recently studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The reader is invited to consult <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> for other simulation examples obtained with one of these algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Abundance Estimation</head><p>The Bayesian unmixing algorithm defined in Sections III and IV has been applied on each pixel of the hyperspectral image (using the endmember spectra resulting from VII-A). Various convergence diagnosis have shown that a short burn-in is sufficient for this example. This is confirmed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> (bottom) which shows a typical Markov chain output for the three abundance coefficients. Consequently, the burn-in period has been fixed to for all results presented in this section. The posterior distributions of the abundances are represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> (top) for the pixel # <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>. These posterior distributions indicate that the pixel is composed of soil essentially, reflecting that the pixel is located on a coast area containing very few vegetation.  The image fraction maps estimated by the proposed algorithm for the pure materials are represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> (top). Note that a white (respectively, black) pixel in the map indicates a large (respectively, small) value of the abundance coefficient. Note also that the estimates have been obtained by averaging the last simulated samples for each pixel, according to the MMSE principle. The lake area (represented by white pixels in the water fraction map and by black pixels in the other maps) can be clearly recovered. Note that the analysis of this image takes approximately 18 min for a MATLAB implementation on a 2.8-GHz Pentium IV. The results obtained with the deterministic fraction mapping routine of the ENVI software <ref type="bibr">[35, p. 739</ref>] are represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> (bottom) for comparison. These figures obtained with a constrained least-squares algorithm (satisfying the additivity and positivity constraints) are clearly in good agreement with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> (top). However, the proposed Bayesian algorithm allows one to estimate the full posterior of the abundance coefficients and the noise variance. This posterior can be used to compute measures of confidence regarding the estimates.</p></div>

Convergence of the Sampler</head><p>As explained in Section V, the convergence of the sampler can be checked by monitoring some key parameters such as the parameter . The potential scalar reduction factor associated  with the noise variance is computed from Markov chains for each pixel. The values of computed for each pixel are represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>. All these values are below 1.0028 (the value obtained for the pixel # <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>) which indicate a good convergence of the sampler for each pixel.</p></div>

However, the number of components as well as the corresponding spectra belonging to are unknown.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Hybrid Metropolis-Within-Gibbs Algorithm</head><p>This section studies an hybrid Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to sample according to . The vectors to be sampled belong to a space whose dimension depends on , requiring to use a dimension matching strategy as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. More precisely, the proposed algorithm referred to as Algorithm 2 consists of three moves:</p><p>1) updating the endmember spectra ; 2) updating the abundance vector ; 3) updating the noise variance . The three moves are scanned systematically as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and are detailed here.</p><p>1) Updating the Endmember Spectra : The endmember spectra involved in the mixing model are updated by using three types of move, referred to as "BIRTH", "DEATH" and "SWITCH" moves, as in <ref type="bibr">[23, p. 53</ref>]. The first two of these moves consist of increasing or decreasing the number of pure components by 1. Therefore, they require the use of the reversible jump MCMC method introduced by Green <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and then widely used in the signal processing literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, or more recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>). Conversely, the dimension of is not changed in the third move, requiring the use of a standard Metropolis-Hastings acceptance procedure. Assume that at iteration , the current model is defined by . The "BIRTH", "DEATH" and "SWITCH" moves are defined as follows.</p><p>• BIRTH: A birth move is proposed with the probability as explained in Algorithm 3. A new spectrum is randomly chosen among the available endmembers of the library to build . A new abundance coefficient vector is proposed according to a rule inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>:</p><p>-draw a new abundance coefficient from the Beta distribution ; -rescale the existing weights so that all weights sum to 1, using ; -build . • DEATH: A death move is proposed with the probability as explained in Algorithm 4. One of the spectra of is removed, as well as the corresponding abundance coefficient. The remaining abundances coefficients are rescaled to sum to 1.</p><p>• SWITCH: A switch move 6 is proposed with the probability (see Algorithm 5). A spectrum randomly chosen in is replaced by another spectrum randomly chosen in the library . At each iteration, one of the moves "BIRTH," "DEATH," and "SWITCH" is randomly chosen with probabilities and with . Of course, the death move is not allowed for and the birth move is impossible for (i.e., ). As a consequence, and for . The acceptance probabilities for the "birth" and "death" moves are and where is given in Appendix I.</p><p>The acceptance probability for the "switch" move is the standard Metropolis Hastings ratio with <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> Note that the proposal ratio associated to this switch move is 1, since in each direction the probability of selecting one spectrum from the library is . 2) Generating Samples According to : As in the initial model, the following posterior is obtained: (24) 6 The "switch" move allows one to speed up the algorithm and to improve the mixing properties of the sampler.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Simulations</head><p>The accuracy of the Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler is studied by considering the synthetic pixel spectrum used in Section VI. Recall here that this pixel results from the combination of three endmembers (construction concrete, green grass, micaceous loam) with the abundance vector . The observation is corrupted by an additive Gaussian noise with dB. The results are obtained for iterations, including burn-in iterations. This simulation uses a spectrum library containing six elements: construction concrete, green grass, micaceous loam, olive green paint, bare red brick, and galvanized steel metal. The spectra of these pure components are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>.</p><p>The first step of the analysis estimates the model order (i.e., the number of endmembers used for the mixture) using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. The posterior distribution of depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> is clearly in good agreement with the actual value of since its maximum is obtained for . The second step of the analysis estimates the posterior probabilities of all endmember combinations, conditioned to . For this experiment, only two matrices were generated and with the probabilities and . The maximum probability corresponds to the actual spectra involved in the mixture. The posterior distributions of the corresponding abundance coefficients are finally estimated and depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>. These posteriors are clearly in good agreement with the actual values of the abundances . Note that unmixing this pixel with the values of and defined above takes approximatively 50 s for a MATLAB implementation on a 2.8-GHz Pentium IV.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper studied a hierarchical Bayesian model for hyperspectral image unmixing. The relationships between the different image spectra were naturally expressed in a Bayesian context by the prior distributions adopted for the model and their parameters. The posterior distributions of the unknown parameters related to this model were estimated by a Gibbs sampling strategy. These posterior distributions provided estimates of the unknown parameters but also information about their uncertainties such as standard deviations or confidence intervals. Two algorithms were developed depending whether the endmembers belonging to the mixture are known or belong to a known library. Simulation results conducted on synthetic and real images illustrated the performance of the methodologies.</p><p>The hierarchical Bayesian algorithm developed in this paper could be modified to handle more complicated models. For instance, it would be interesting to extend the proposed algorithm to unmix hyperspectral images composed of homogenous regions surrounded by sharp boundaries by introducing spatial correlation via hidden Markov models. Estimating the components of a mixture of endmembers embedded in other noise structures is also under investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX I ACCEPTANCE PROBABILITIES FOR THE "BIRTH" AND "DEATH" MOVES</head><p>This section derives the acceptance probabilities for the "birth" and "death" moves introduced in Section VIII. At iteration index , consider the birth move from the state to the new state with and . The acceptance ratio associated to this "birth" move is <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> where refers to the proposal distribution, is the Jacobian of the transformation and denotes the transition probability, i.e., and . According to the moves of Section VIII, the proposal ratio is <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> where denotes the pdf of a Beta distribution . Indeed, the probability of choosing a new element in the library ("birth" move) is and the probability of removing an element ("death" move) is . The posterior ratio appearing in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> can be rewritten as <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> Since the abundance coefficient vector has a Dirichlet prior , the prior ratio can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> By choosing a priori equiprobable configurations for conditional upon , the prior ratio for the spectrum matrix is <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> The prior ratio related to the number of mixtures associated to the uniform distribution specified in (21) reduces to 1.</p><p>Finally, the acceptance ratio for the BIRTH move is <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> Note that ( <ref type="formula">31</ref>) is very similar to the equation given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and that when has a uniform prior on the simplex .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
