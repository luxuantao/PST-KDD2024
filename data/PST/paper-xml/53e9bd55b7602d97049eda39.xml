<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A review of the optimization methods used in the design of type-2 fuzzy systems, which are relatively novel models of imprecision, has been considered in this work. The fundamental focus of the work has been based on the basic reasons of the need for optimizing type-2 fuzzy systems for different areas of application. Recently, bio-inspired methods have emerged as powerful optimization algorithms for solving complex problems. In the case of designing type-2 fuzzy systems for particular applications, the use of bio-inspired optimization methods have helped in the complex task of finding the appropriate parameter values and structure of the fuzzy systems. In this review, we consider the application of genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization as three different paradigms that help in the design of optimal type-2 fuzzy systems. We also provide a comparison of the different optimization methods for the case of designing type-2 fuzzy systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Uncertainty affects decision-making and emerges in a number of different forms. The concept of information is inherently associated with the concept of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. The most fundamental aspect of this connection is that the uncertainty involved in any problem-solving situation is a result of some information deficiency, which may be incomplete, imprecise, fragmentary, not fully reliable, vague, contradictory, or deficient in some other way. Uncertainty is an attribute of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. The general framework of fuzzy reasoning allows handling much of this uncertainty and fuzzy systems employ type-1 fuzzy sets, which represent uncertainty by numbers in the range [0, 1]. When an entity is uncertain, like a measurement, it is difficult to specify its exact value, and of course a type-1 fuzzy set makes more sense than a traditional set <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>. However, it is not reasonable to use an accurate membership function for something uncertain, so in this case what we need is another type of fuzzy sets, those which are able to handle these uncertainties, the so called type-2 fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. The amount of uncertainty in a system can be reduced by using type-2 fuzzy logic because this logic offers better capabilities to handle linguistic uncertainties by modeling vagueness and unreliability of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>.</p><p>Type-2 fuzzy models have emerged as an interesting generalization of fuzzy models based upon type-1 fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. There have been a number of claims put forward as to the relevance of type-2 fuzzy sets being regarded as generic building constructs of fuzzy models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. Likewise, there is a record of some experimental evidence showing some improvements in terms of accuracy of fuzzy models of type-2 over their type-1 counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. Unfortunately, no systematic and comprehensive design framework has been provided and while improvements over type-1 fuzzy models were evidenced, it is not clear whether this effect could always be expected. Furthermore, it is not demonstrated whether the e A ¼ fððx; uÞ; l e A ðx; uÞÞj8x 2 X; 8u 2 J x # ½0; 1g ð1Þ in which 0 6 l e A ðx; uÞ 6 1. In fact J x # [0,1] represents the primary membership of x, and l e A ðx; uÞ is a type-1 fuzzy set known as the secondary set. Hence, a type-2 membership grade can be any subset in [0,1], the primary membership, and corresponding to each primary membership, there is a secondary membership (which can also be in [0,1]) that defines the possibilities for the primary membership. Uncertainty is represented by a region, which is called the footprint of uncertainty (FOU). When l e A ðx; uÞ ¼ 1; 8u 2 J x # ½0; 1 we have an interval type-2 membership function, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The uniform shading for the FOU represents the entire interval type-2 fuzzy set and it can be described in terms of an upper membership function l e A ðxÞ and a lower membership function l e A ðxÞ.</p><p>An FLS described using at least one type-2 fuzzy set is called a type-2 FLS. Type-1 FLSs are unable to directly handle rule uncertainties, because they use type-1 fuzzy sets that are certain (viz, fully described by single numeric values). On the other hand, type-2 FLSs, are useful in circumstances where it is difficult to determine an exact numeric membership function, and there are measurement uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>A type-2 FLS is characterized by IF-THEN rules, where their antecedent or consequent sets are now of type-2. Type-2 FLSs, can be used when the circumstances are too uncertain to determine exact membership grades such as when the training   data is affected by noise. Similarly, to the type-1 FLS, a type-2 FLS includes a fuzzifier, a rule base, fuzzy inference engine, and an output processor, as we can see in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The output processor includes type-reducer and defuzzifier; it generates a type-1 fuzzy set output (from the type-reducer) or a number (from the defuzzifier) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Now we explain each of the blocks shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Bio-inspired optimization methods</head><p>In this section a brief overview of the basic concepts from bio-inspired optimization methods needed for this work is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Particle swarm optimization</head><p>Particle swarm optimization is a population based stochastic optimization technique developed by Eberhart and Kennedy in 1995, inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. PSO shares many similarities with evolutionary computation techniques such as the GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>The system is initialized with a population of random solutions and searches for optima by updating generations. However, unlike the GA, the PSO has no evolution operators such as crossover and mutation. In the PSO, the potential solutions, called particles, fly through the problem space by following the current optimum particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space, which are associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far (The fitness value is also stored). This value is called pbest. Another ''best'' value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle. This location is called lbest. When a particle takes all the population as its topological neighbors, the best value is a global best and is called gbest <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>The particle swarm optimization concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO). Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random numbers being generated for acceleration toward pbest and lbest locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. In the past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in many research and application areas. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way when compared with other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. Another reason that PSO is attractive is that there are few parameters to adjust. One version, with slight variations, works well in a wide variety of applications. Particle swarm optimization has been considered for approaches that can be used across a wide range of applications, as well as for specific applications focused on a specific requirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>.</p><p>The basic algorithm of PSO has the following nomenclature: Random numbers between 0 and 1</p><p>The equation to calculate the velocity is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v i zþ1 ¼ w ij v i z þ c 1 r 1 p i z À x i z À Á þ c 2 r 2 p g z À x i z À Á<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>and the position of the individual particles is updated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x i zþ1 ¼ x i z þ v i zþ1<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Genetic algorithms</head><p>Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The basic principles of GAs were first proposed by John Holland in 1975, inspired by the mechanism of natural selection, where stronger individuals are likely the winners in a competing environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. GA assumes that the potential solution of any problem is an individual and can be represented by a set of parameters. These parameters are regarded as the genes of a chromosome and can be structured by a string of values in binary form. A positive value, generally known as a fitness value, is used to reflect the degree of ''goodness'' of the chromosome for the problem, which would be highly related with its objective value. The pseudocode of a GA is as follows:</p><p>1. Start with a randomly generated population of n chromosomes (candidate solutions to a problem). 2. Calculate the fitness of each chromosome in the population. 3. Repeat the following steps until n offspring have been created: a. Select a pair of parent chromosomes from the current population, the probability of selection being an increasing function of fitness. Selection is done with replacement, meaning that the same chromosome can be selected more than once to become a parent. b. With probability (crossover rate), perform crossover to the pair at a randomly chosen point to a form two offspring. c. Mutate the two offspring at each locus with probability (mutation rate), and place the resulting chromosomes in the new population. 4. Replace the current population with the new population.</p></div>

This method is inspired on the behavior presented by ants in finding paths from the nest or colony to the food source.</p><p>The S-ACO is an algorithmic implementation that adapts the behavior of real ants to solutions of minimum cost path problems on graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. A number of artificial ants build solutions for a certain optimization problem and exchange information about the quality of these solutions making allusion to the communication system of real ants <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Let us define the graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of nodes and E is the matrix of the links between nodes. G has n G = jVj nodes. Let us define L K as the number of hops in the path built by the ant k from the origin node to the destiny node. Therefore, it is necessary to find:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Q ¼ fq a ; . . . ; q f jq 1 2 Cg<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where Q is the set of nodes representing a continuous path with no obstacles; q a , . . . , q f are former nodes of the path and C is the set of possible configurations of the free space.

Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) represents the evaporation pheromone update, where q 2 [0, 1] is the evaporation rate value of the pheromone trail. The evaporation is added to the algorithm in order to force the exploration of the ants, and avoid premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">General remarks about optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems</head><p>The problem of designing type-2 fuzzy systems can be solved with any of the above mentioned optimization methods. The main issue in any of these methods is deciding on the representation of the type-2 fuzzy system in the corresponding optimization paradigm. For example, in the case of GAs, the type-2 fuzzy systems must be represented in the chromosomes. On the other hand, in PSO the fuzzy system is represented as a particle in the optimization process. In the ACO method, the fuzzy system can be represented as one of the paths that the ants can follow in a graph. Also, the evaluation of the fuzzy system must be represented as an objective function in any of the methods. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive review of the most representative works in optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems that have been done around the world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">GAs in optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems</head><p>There have been many works reported in the literature optimizing type-2 fuzzy systems using different kinds of genetic algorithms. Most of these works have had relative success according to the different areas of application. In this section, we offer a representative review of these types of works to illustrate the advantages of using a bio-inspired optimization technique for automating the design process of type-2 fuzzy systems.</p><p>In a paper by Park et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> a design methodology of interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks (IT2FNN) was introduced to optimize the network using a real-coded genetic algorithm. IT2FNN is the combination between the fuzzy neural network (FNN) and interval type-2 fuzzy set with uncertainty. The antecedent part of the network is composed of the fuzzy division of input space and the consequence part of the network is represented by polynomial functions. The parameters such as the apexes of membership function, uncertainty parameter, the learning rate and the momentum coefficient are optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed network is evaluated with the performance between the approximation and the generalization abilities.</p><p>In a work by Chua and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> a method for genetically evolving type-2 fuzzy rule based classifiers was proposed. This work was aimed at investigating if type-2 fuzzy classifiers can deliver a better performance when there exists an imprecise decision boundary caused by improper feature extraction method. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to tune the fuzzy classifiers under Pittsburgh scheme. The proposed fuzzy classifiers were successfully applied to an automotive application whereby the classifier needs to detect the presence of human in a vehicle. Results revealed that a type-2 classifier has the edge over type-1 classifier when the decision boundaries are imprecise and the fuzzy classifier itself has not enough degrees of freedom to construct a suitable boundary. Conversely, when decision boundaries are clear, the advantage of type-2 framework may not be significant anymore. In any case, the performance of a type-2 fuzzy classifier is at least comparable with a type-1 fuzzy classifier. When dealing with real world classification problem where the uncertainty is usually difficult to be estimated, type-2 fuzzy classifier can be a more rational choice.</p><p>In a paper by Cazarez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> a genetic-type-2 fuzzy approach was proposed to optimize the parameters of the Membership Functions (MFs) of a Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) applied to control. The chromosome was designed to represent the parameters of the MFs of a pre-established Type-2 FLS. A case of study was proposed to evaluate the optimization process, which was to achieve the output regulation problem of a servomechanism with backlash. The problem is the design of a type-2 fuzzy logic controller which was optimized by a GA to obtain the closed-loop system in which the load of the driver is regulated to a desired position. Simulations results illustrate the effectiveness of the optimized closed-loop system.</p><p>In the work of Lopez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> a new method for response integration in ensemble neural networks with type-2 fuzzy logic using genetic algorithms for optimization was proposed. In this paper, pattern recognition with ensemble neural networks for the case of fingerprints was considered. An ensemble neural network of three modules was used. Each module was a local expert on person recognition based on its biometric measure (pattern recognition for fingerprints). The response integration method of the ensemble neural networks has the goal of combining the responses of the modules to improve the recognition rate of the individual modules. Using GAs to optimize the membership functions the results of the type-2 fuzzy systems were improved. In this paper the results of a type-2 approach for response integration were shown to outperform the type-1 logic approach.</p><p>In the work of Cai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> a novel fuzzy-neural network combining a type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy neural network (GA-TSKfnn), is presented. The rational for this combination is that type-2 fuzzy sets are better able to deal with rule uncertainties, while the optimal GA-based tuning of the T2GA-TSKfnn parameters achieves better classification results. However, a general T2GA-TSKfnn is computationally very intensive due to the complexity of the type-2 to type-1 reduction. Therefore, an interval T2GA-TSKfnn implementation to simplify the computational process was adopted. Simulation results were provided to compare the T2GA-TSKfnn against other fuzzy neural networks. These results show that the proposed system is able to achieve a higher classification rate when compared against a number of other traditional neuro-fuzzy classifiers.</p><p>In the work of Wagner and Hagras, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref> a genetic algorithm for evolving type-2 fuzzy logic controllers for real world autonomous robots was presented. The type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) has started to emerge as a promising control mechanism for autonomous mobile robots navigating in real world environments. This is because such robots need control mechanisms such as type-2 FLCs which can handle the large amounts of uncertainties present in real world environments. However, manually designing and tuning the type-2 Membership Functions (MFs) for an interval type-2 FLC to give a good response is a difficult task. This work describes a genetic algorithm to evolve the type-2 MFs of interval type-2 FLCs for mobile robots that will navigate in real world environments. The GA based system converges after a small number of iterations to type-2 MFs which give a very good performance. A series of real world experiments in which the evolved type-2 FLCs controlled a real robot in an outdoor arena was performed. The evolved type-2 FLCs dealt with the uncertainties present in the real world to give a very good performance that has outperformed their type-1 counterparts as well as the manually designed type-2 FLCs.</p><p>In the work of Qiu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> statistical genetic interval valued fuzzy systems for prediction in clinical trials are presented. In recent years, statistical tools and computational intelligence methods have played important roles in many areas. After statistically optimizing interval-valued fuzzy membership functions in the type-2 fuzzy logic system, genetic algorithms were applied to optimize them. The proposed method was used to predict survival times for patients in clinical trials. The results show that the new GA-based method was more accurate than traditional type-1 and type-2 methods.</p><p>In the work by Tan and Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> the design of type reduction strategies for type-2 fuzzy logic systems using genetic algorithms was presented. While a type-2 fuzzy system has the capability to model more complex relationships, the output of a type-2 fuzzy inference engine is a type-2 fuzzy set that needs to be type-reduced before defuzzification can be performed. Unfortunately, type-reduction is usually achieved using the computationally intensive Karnik-Mendel iterative algorithm. In order for type-2 fuzzy systems to be useful for real-time applications, the computational burden of type-reduction needs to be relieved. This work was aimed at designing computationally efficient type-reducers using a genetic algorithm. The proposed type-reducer is based on the concept known as equivalent type-1 fuzzy systems (ET1FSs), a collection of type-1 FSs that replicates the input-output relationship of a type-2 fuzzy system. By replacing a type-2 fuzzy system with a collection of ET1FSs, the type-reduction process then simplifies to deciding which ET1FS to employ in a particular situation. The strategy for selecting the ET1FS is evolved by a GA. Results were presented to demonstrate that the proposed type-reducing algorithm has lower computational cost and may provide better performance than FLSs that employ existing type-reducers.</p><p>In the work by Wu and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> genetic learning and performance evaluation of interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers was presented. Type-2 fuzzy sets, which are characterized by membership functions that are themselves fuzzy, have been attracting interest. This paper focuses on advancing the understanding of interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). First, a type-2 FLC was evolved using genetic algorithms. The type-2 FLC was then compared with another three GA evolved type-1 FLCs that have different design parameters. The objective was to examine the amount by which the extra degrees of freedom, provided by antecedent type-2 fuzzy sets, was able to improve the control performance. Experimental results show that better control can be achieved using a type-2 FLC with fewer fuzzy sets/rules so one benefit of type-2 FLC was a lower tradeoff between modeling accuracy and interpretability.</p><p>The work by Wu and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> focuses on evolving type-2 fuzzy logic controllers genetically and examining whether they are better able to handle modeling uncertainties. The study was conducted by utilizing a type-2 FLC, evolved by a genetic algorithm, to control a liquid-level process. A two stage strategy is employed to design the type-2 FLC. First, the parameters of a type-1 FLC are optimized using the GA. Next, the footprint of uncertainty was evolved by blurring the fuzzy input set. Experimental results show that the type-2 FLC copes well with the complexity of the plant, and can handle the modeling uncertainty better than its type-1 counterpart.</p><p>In the work by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> a type-2 fuzzy logic system cascaded with neural network, type-2 fuzzy neural network (T2FNN), was presented to handle uncertainty with dynamical optimal learning. A T2FNN consists of a type-2 fuzzy linguistic process as the antecedent part, and the two-layer interval neural network as the consequent part. A general T2FNN is computational-intensive due to the complexity of type-2 to type-1 reduction. Therefore, the interval T2FNN is adopted in this work to simplify the computational process. The dynamical optimal training algorithm for the two-layer consequent part of interval T2FNN was first developed. The stable and optimal left and right learning rates for the interval neural network, in the sense of maximum error reduction, can be derived for each iteration in the training process (back propagation). It can also be shown that both learning rates cannot be both negative. Further, due to variation of the initial MF parameters, i.e., the spread level of uncertain means or deviations of interval Gaussian MFs, the performance of back propagation training process may be affected. To achieve better total performance, a genetic algorithm was designed to search optimal spread rate for uncertain means and optimal learning for the antecedent part. Several examples are fully illustrated. Excellent results are obtained for the truck backing-up control and the identification of non-linear system, which yield more improved performance than those using type-1 FNN.</p><p>In the work by Innocent et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> the exploratory use of type 2 fuzzy sets to represent the perceptions of lung scan images by experts in order to predict pulmonary emboli using type 2 fuzzy relations is presented. A genetic algorithm was used to find suitable parameters for the fuzzy sets so that a good classification was achieved. Preliminary results with a limited data set demonstrating the potential power of the approach were presented.</p><p>In the work by Cervantes and Castillo <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> a genetic design of a fuzzy system for the longitudinal control of an F-14 airplane was presented. The longitudinal control is carried out only by controlling the elevators of the airplane. To carry out such monitoring it is necessary to use the stick, the rate of elevation and the angle of attack. These three variables are the inputs into the fuzzy inference system, which is of Mamdani type, and the output the values of the elevators are obtained. Simulation results of the longitudinal control are obtained using a plant in Simulink and those results were compared against the PID controller. Genetic algorithms were used to optimize parameters of type-2 and type-1 fuzzy systems to find the best fuzzy controller under noisy conditions. The type-2 fuzzy controller outperforms the type-1 when the level of noise is sufficiently high.</p><p>In the work by Sanchez and Melin <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> a Modular Neural Network (MNN) for iris, ear and voice recognition was presented. The proposed MNN architecture consists of three modules, one for each biometric measure: iris, ear and voice. Each module is divided into other three sub modules. Each sub module contains different information, which consists of the database divided in three parts. The integration of each biometric measure was considered separately. Later, the integration of the modules was performed with a fuzzy logic integrator. Also, the optimization of the modular neural networks and the fuzzy integrators was performed using genetic algorithms, and comparisons were made between optimized results and the results without optimization. The use of type-2 fuzzy logic was considered in the fuzzy response integrators, and the result was that higher recognition rates under noisy conditions were achieved with a significant improvement over type-1 fuzzy logic.</p><p>In the work of Martinez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, a tracking controller for the dynamic model of a unicycle mobile robot by integrating a kinematic and a torque controller based on type-2 fuzzy logic theory and genetic algorithms was proposed.

In this work a comparative study between fuzzy inference systems as methods of integration in modular neural networks for multimodal biometry was presented. These methods of integration are based on techniques of type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic. Also, the fuzzy systems are optimized with simple genetic algorithms with the goal of having optimized versions of both types of fuzzy systems. First, the use of type-1 fuzzy logic and later the approach with type-2 fuzzy logic were considered. The fuzzy systems were developed using genetic algorithms to handle fuzzy inference systems with different membership functions, like the triangular, trapezoidal and Gaussian; since these algorithms can generate fuzzy systems automatically. Then the response integration of the modular neural network was tested with the optimized fuzzy systems of integration. The comparative study of the type-1 and type-2 fuzzy inference systems was made to observe the behavior of the two different integration methods for modular neural networks for multimodal biometry.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> a summary of the previously presented contributions, where GAs have been applied to optimize type-2 fuzzy systems, is presented.

Most of these works have had relative success according to the different areas of application. In this section, we offer a representative review of these types of works to illustrate the advantages of using the PSO optimization technique for automating the design process of type-2 fuzzy systems.</p><p>In the work of Al-Jaafreh and Al-Jumaily <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a training method for a type-2 fuzzy system using PSO was presented. This work presents the improvement and implementation for two recent intelligent techniques; Type-2 Fuzzy System (T2 FS) and particle swarm optimization and presents a new method to optimize parameters of the primary membership functions of T2 FS using PSO to improve the performance and increase the accuracy of the T2 FS model. The implementation of the suggested method on mean blood pressure estimation has a very successful rate.</p><p>In the work of Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, a PSO type-reduction method for geometric interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm was presented. With the PSO type-reduction, the inference principle of geometric interval FLS operating on the continuous domain is consistent with that of traditional interval type-2 FLS operating on the discrete domain. With comparative experiments, it is proved that the PSO type-reduction exhibits good performance, and is a satisfactory complement for the theory of geometric interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems.</p><p>In the work of Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the PSO algorithm was used to derive an adaptive fuzzy logic controller (AFC) based on interval fuzzy membership functions for vehicle non-linear active suspension systems. The interval membership functions were utilized in the AFC design to deal with not only non-linearity and uncertainty caused from irregular road inputs and immeasurable disturbance, but also the potential uncertainty of expert's knowledge and experience. The adaptive strategy was designed to self-tune the active force between the lower bounds and upper bounds of interval fuzzy outputs. A case study based on a quarter active suspension model demonstrated that the proposed adaptive fuzzy controller significantly outperforms conventional fuzzy controllers of an active suspension and a passive suspension.</p><p>In the work of Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, the design of optimized type-2 fuzzy neural networks using PSO was presented. In order to develop reliable on-site partial discharge (PD) pattern recognition algorithm, Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Networks (T2FNNs) optimized by means of particle swarm optimization were introduced. T2FNNs exploit type-2 fuzzy sets which have a characteristic of robustness in the diverse area of intelligence systems. Considering the on-site situation where it is not easy to obtain voltage phases to be used for Phase Resolved Partial Discharge Analysis, the PD data sets measured in the laboratory were artificially changed into data sets with shifted voltage phases and added noise in order to test the proposed algorithm. Also, the results obtained by the proposed algorithm were compared with that of conventional neural networks as well as the existing radial basis function neural networks. The T2FNNs proposed in this study appeared to have better performance when compared to conventional neural networks.</p><p>In the work by Martinez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, bio-inspired optimization methods were applied to design type-2 fuzzy logic controllers to minimize the steady state error of linear plants. The optimal type-2 fuzzy controllers obtained by genetic algorithms and PSO were compared using benchmark plants. The bio-inspired methods were used to find the parameters of the membership functions of the type-2 fuzzy system to obtain the optimal controller. Simulation results were presented to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.</p><p>In the work of Jeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, a novel Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type fuzzy neural network that uses general type-2 fuzzy sets, called general type-2 fuzzy neural network (GT2FNN), was proposed for function approximation. The problems of constructing a GT2FNN include type reduction, structure identification, and parameter identification. An efficient strategy was proposed by using a-cuts to decompose a general type-2 fuzzy set into several interval type-2 fuzzy sets to solve the type reduction problem. Incremental similarity based fuzzy clustering and linear least squares regression were combined to solve the structure identification problem. Regarding the parameter identification, a hybrid learning algorithm which combines PSO and a recursive least squares estimator was proposed for refining the antecedent and consequent parameters, respectively, of the fuzzy rules.</p><p>In the work by Martinez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, the optimization of type-2 fuzzy logic controllers using PSO was presented. The PSO method was applied to find the parameters of the membership functions of a type-2 fuzzy logic controller in order to minimize the state error for linear systems. PSO was used to find the optimal type-2 fuzzy controller to achieve regulation of the output and stability of the closed-loop system. For this purpose, the values of the cognitive, social and inertia variables in the PSO were changed. Simulation results, with the optimal type-2 fuzzy controller implemented in Simulink, show the potential applicability of the proposed approach.</p><p>In the work by Khanesar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, a novel, diamond-shaped type-2 fuzzy membership function was introduced. The proposed type-2 fuzzy membership function has certain values on 0 and 1, but it has some uncertainties for the other membership values. It has been shown that the type-2 fuzzy system using this type of membership function has some noise reduction property in the presence of noisy inputs. The appropriate parameter selection to be able to achieve noise reduction property was also considered. A hybrid method consisting of PSO and gradient descent algorithm was used to optimize the parameters of the proposed type-2 fuzzy system. PSO is a derivative-free optimizer, and the possibility of the entrapment of this optimizer in local minimums is less than the gradient descent method. The proposed type-2 fuzzy system and the hybrid parameter estimation method were then tested on the prediction of a noisy, chaotic dynamical system. The simulation results show that the type-2 fuzzy predictor with the proposed novel membership functions shows a superior performance when compared to the other existing type-2 fuzzy systems in the presence of noisy inputs.</p><p>In this work of Bingül and Karahan <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, two-degrees of freedom planar robot was controlled by fuzzy logic controller tuned with a particle swarm optimization. For a given trajectory, the parameters of Mamdani-type-Fuzzy Logic Controller (the centers and the widths of the Gaussian membership functions in inputs and output) were optimized by the particle swarm optimization with three different cost functions. In order to compare the optimized fuzzy logic controller with different controllers, the PID controller was also tuned with particle swarm optimization. In order to test the robustness of the tuned controllers, the model parameters and the given trajectory were changed and the white noise was added to the system. The simulation results show that fuzzy logic controller tuned by particle swarm optimization is better and more robust than the PID tuned by particle swarm optimization for robot trajectory control.</p><p>In the work by Oh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, the design methodology of an optimized fuzzy controller with the aid of particle swarm optimization (PSO) for ball and beam system was introduced. The ball and beam system is a well-known control engineering experimental setup which consists of servo motor, beam and ball. This system exhibits a number of interesting and challenging properties when being considered from the control perspective. The ball and beam system determines the position of ball through the control of a servo motor. The displacement change of the position of ball leads to the change of the angle of the beam which determines the position angle of a servo motor. The fixed membership function design of type-1 based fuzzy logic controller (FLC) leads to the difficulty of rule-based control design when representing linguistic nature of knowledge. In type-2 FLC as the expanded type of type-1 FL, we can effectively improve the control characteristic by using the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) of the membership functions. Type-2 FLC exhibits some robustness when compared with type-1 FLC. Through computer simulation as well as real-world experiment, we apply optimized type-2 fuzzy cascade controllers based on PSO to ball and beam system. To evaluate performance of each controller, we consider controller characteristic parameters such as maximum overshoot, delay time, rise time, settling time, and a steady-state error. In the sequel, the optimized fuzzy cascade controller is realized and also experimented with through running two detailed comparative studies including type-1/type-2 fuzzy controller and genetic algorithms/particle swarm optimization. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> a summary of the previously presented contributions, where PSO has been applied to optimize type-2 fuzzy systems, is presented.

From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> it can be noted that most of the applications of PSO in designing optimal type-2 fuzzy systems have been in the area of intelligent control, with fewer applications in pattern recognition and time series prediction. It can also be noted that the number of papers using PSO is lower than the ones using GAs, mentioned in the previous section.</p></div>

The antecedent part in each fuzzy rule of the RSOIT2FS-ACO uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets in order to improve system robustness to noise. The consequent part of each fuzzy rule was designed using the ACO technique. The ACO approach selects the consequent part from a set of candidate actions according to ant pheromone trails. The RSOIT2FS-ACO method was applied to a truck backing control. The proposed RSOIT2FS-ACO was compared with other reinforcement fuzzy systems to verify its efficiency and effectiveness.

Simulation results show that ACO outperforms a GA in the optimization of type-2 fuzzy logic controllers for a particular autonomous mobile robot.</p><p>In the work of Juang and Hsu <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, a reinforcement ant optimized fuzzy controller (FC) design method, called RAOFC, was proposed. The method was applied it to wheeled-mobile-robot wall-following control under reinforcement learning environments. The inputs to the designed FC are range-finding sonar sensors, and the controller output is a robot steering angle. The antecedent part in each fuzzy rule uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets in order to increase FC robustness. No a priori assignment of fuzzy rules was necessary in RAOFC. An online aligned interval type-2 fuzzy clustering (AIT2FC) method was proposed to generate rules automatically. The AIT2FC not only flexibly partitions the input space but also reduces the number of fuzzy sets in each input dimension, which improves controller interpretability. The consequent part of each fuzzy rule is designed using Q-value aided ant colony optimization (QACO). The QACO approach selects the consequent part from a set of candidate actions according to ant pheromone trails and Q-values, both of whose values are updated using reinforcement signals.

The ORGQACO concurrently designs both the structure and parameters of an IT2FS. An online interval type-2 rule generation method for the evolution of system structure and flexible partitioning of the input space was proposed. Consequent part parameters in an IT2FS are designed using Q-values and the reinforcement local-global ant colony optimization algorithm. This algorithm selects the consequent part from a set of candidate actions according to ant pheromone trails and Q-values, both of which are updated using reinforcement signals. The ORGQACO design method was applied to the following three control problems: (1) truck-backing control; (2) magnetic-levitation control; and (3) chaotic-system control.

Type-2 fuzzy logic systems developed with the aid of evolutionary optimization forms a useful modeling tool subsequently resulting in a collection of efficient ''If-Then'' rules. Type-2 fuzzy neural networks take advantage of capabilities of fuzzy clustering by generating type-2 fuzzy rule base, resulting in a small number of rules and then optimizing membership functions of type-2 fuzzy sets present in the antecedent and consequent parts of the rules. The clustering itself is realized with the aid of differential evolution. Several examples, including a benchmark problem of identification of non-linear system, are considered.

Uncertainty is an inherent part in control systems used in real world applications. Various instruments used in such systems produce uncertainty in their measurements and thus influence the integrity of the data collection. Type-1 fuzzy sets used in conventional fuzzy systems cannot fully handle the uncertainties present but type-2 fuzzy sets that are used in type-2 fuzzy systems can handle such uncertainties in a better way because they provide more parameters and more design degrees of freedom. There are membership functions which can be parameterized by a few variables and when optimized, the membership optimization problem can be reduced to a parameter optimization problem. This work deals with the parameter optimization of the type-2 fuzzy membership functions using a new proposed reinforcement learning algorithm in a nonlinear system. The results of the proposed method referred to as Extended Discrete Action Reinforcement Learning Automata algorithm were compared to the results obtained by the Discrete Action Reinforcement Learning Automata and Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automata algorithms.

Interval type-2 fuzzy controllers can outperform conventional type-1 fuzzy controllers when the problem has a high degree of uncertainty. However, designing interval type-2 fuzzy controllers is more difficult because there are more parameters involved. In this work, interval type-2 fuzzy systems were approximated with the average of two type-1 fuzzy systems, which has been shown to give good results in control if the type-1 fuzzy systems can be obtained appropriately. An evolutionary algorithm is applied to find the optimal interval type-2 fuzzy system as mentioned above. The human evolutionary model is applied for optimizing the interval type-2 fuzzy controller for a particular non-linear plant and results are compared against an optimal type-1 fuzzy controller.

The use of GAs, ACO and PSO in designing type-1 fuzzy systems has become a standard practice for automatically designing this sort of systems. This trend has also continued to the type-2 fuzzy systems area, which has been accounted for with the review of papers presented in the previous sections. In the case of designing type-2 fuzzy systems the problem is more complicated due to the higher number of parameters to consider, making it of upmost importance the use of bio-inspired optimization techniques for achieving the optimal designs of this sort of systems.</p><p>In this section a summary of the total number of papers published in the area of type-2 fuzzy system optimization is presented, so that the increasing trend occurring in this area can be better appreciated. Also, the distribution of papers according to the used optimization technique is presented, so that a general idea of how these different techniques are contributing to the automatic design of optimal type-2 fuzzy systems is obtained. We have to mention that the search for the papers considered in this review has been done by using the search engine available in Scopus online system of Elsevier, in which the papers can be searched for by subject or by author names. In this sense, an exhaustive search for papers on type-2 fuzzy system optimization was done by using the following keywords: type-2 fuzzy optimization, ACO type-2 fuzzy system optimization, PSO type-2 fuzzy system optimization and GA type-2 fuzzy system optimization. Also, the search was tried with other bio-inspired optimization methods, but no published papers were found in that case. It is worth mentioning here that the Scopus database of Elsevier contains almost all the respected and relevant publications around the world, so the review that was formed based on the papers found by the search engine of Scopus can be considered representative of the publications in this area. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows the total number of papers published per year describing the application of optimization methods for designing type-2 fuzzy systems in the areas of control, pattern recognition, classification, and time series prediction. From Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> it can be noted that the number of papers published have been increasing each year (in 2011 there appears to be a decline because the information of this year is not complete at the moment of preparing the paper). It is expected that this increasing trend will continue in the future because type-2 fuzzy systems have been recently used more frequently in the applications (and are becoming more popular), and this will require designing more complex type-2 fuzzy systems, which in turn will need even better optimization techniques to achieve solutions more efficiently. It is also worth mentioning that at the moment most of the type-2 fuzzy systems considered in the applications, presented in this review, only use interval type-2 fuzzy sets due to the higher degree of difficulty in managing and processing generalized type-2 fuzzy sets, but when these generalized type-2 fuzzy sets become more of a standard in the area of type-2 fuzzy logic, the design problem would require even more powerful optimization techniques. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> shows the distribution of the published papers in optimizing type-2 fuzzy systems according to the different bioinspired optimization techniques previously mentioned. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> it can be noted that the use of GAs have been decreasing recently, on the other hand the use of PSO, ACO and other methods have been increasing. The reason for the increase in the use of PSO and ACO may be due to the fact that there have been recent works in which either PSO or ACO have been able to outperform GAs for different applications. However, to the moment, ACO has been only used in few research works, which explains why there are only published papers reported in 2009 and 2011 and not in 2010 (as can be appreciated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>), which can be due to the long times of publication in the journals, and for this reason there appears to be a research (publication) gap for ACO in 2010.</p><p>Regarding the question of which method would be the most appropriate for optimizing type-2 fuzzy systems, there is no easy answer to this question. At the moment, what we can be sure of, based on this review, is that the techniques mentioned in this paper and probably newer ones that may appear in the future, would certainly be tested in the optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems because the problem of designing automatically these types of systems is complex enough to require their use. It is also possible that hybrid approaches combining several bio-inspired optimization techniques could be good alternatives for solving the type-2 fuzzy system optimization problem.</p><p>There are other bio-inspired or nature-inspired techniques that at the moment have not been applied to the optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems that may be worth mentioning. For example, membrane computing, harmony computing, electromagnetism based computing, genetic programming, grid search, artificial bee colony optimization and other similar approaches have not been applied (to the moment) in the optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems. These approaches have not been covered in this paper because to the moment there are no applications to type-2 fuzzy system optimization of these bio-inspired methods. It is expected that these approaches and similar ones could be applied in the near future in the area of type-2 fuzzy system optimization. Of course, as new bio-inspired and nature-inspired optimization methods are being proposed at any time in this fruitful area of research, it is expected that newer optimization techniques would also be tried in the near future in the automatic design of optimal type-2 fuzzy systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Conclusions</head><p>A review of the optimization methods used in the design of type-2 fuzzy systems has been presented in this work. The fundamental focus of the paper was based on the basic reasons of the need for optimizing type-2 fuzzy systems for different areas of application. In the case of designing type-2 fuzzy systems for particular applications, the use of bio-inspired optimization methods have helped in the complex task of finding the appropriate parameter values and structure of the fuzzy systems. In this review, we have considered the application of genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization as three different paradigms that help in the design of optimal type-2 fuzzy systems. We have also provided a comparison of the different optimization methods for the case of designing type-2 fuzzy systems.</p><p>In the previous sections of the paper we have presented a representative account of the different optimization methods that have been applied in the optimal design of type-2 fuzzy systems. To the moment, genetic algorithms have been used more frequently to optimize type-2 fuzzy systems. However, more recently PSO and ACO have attracted more attention and have also been applied with some degree of success to the problem of optimal design of type-2 fuzzy systems. There have been also other optimization methods applied to the optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems, like artificial immune systems and the chemical optimization paradigm, but not as frequently as GAs, ACO and PSO. At this time, it would be very difficult to declare one of these optimization techniques as the best for optimizing type-2 fuzzy systems, as different techniques have had success for different applications of type-2 fuzzy logic. In any case, the need for bio-inspired optimization methods is justified due to the complexity of designing type-2 fuzzy systems. There are other bio-inspired or nature-inspired techniques that at the moment have not been applied to the optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems, like, membrane computing, harmony computing, electromagnetism based computing, genetic programming, grid search, artificial bee colony optimization and other similar approaches. These approaches have not been covered in this paper because to the moment there are no applications to type-2 fuzzy system optimization of these optimization methods. It is expected that these approaches and similar ones could be applied in the near future in the area of type-2 fuzzy system optimization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
