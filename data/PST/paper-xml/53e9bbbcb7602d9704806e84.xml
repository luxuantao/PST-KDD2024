<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Due to the broadcast nature of wireless medium and the resulting security vulnerabilities such as eavesdropping, physical (PHY) layer security has emerged as an indispensable strategy to augment secrecy in wireless communications networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The pivotal principle behind this novel strategy is to exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of wireless channels to facilitate secure data transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In early studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, perfect secrecy in wiretap channels was shown to be achieved when the channel between the transmitter and the eavesdropper is a degraded version of the channel between the transmitter and the receiver. This necessitates the channel state information (CSI) of both channels at the transmitter to ensure secure communications. In practice, the eavesdropper's channel knowledge may not be known at the transmitter such that perfect secrecy cannot be guaranteed. In this passive eavesdropping case, the secrecy outage probability is adopted as a useful and intuitive metric to evaluate security <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by the next generation wireless standards with multiantenna nodes, PHY layer security in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channels has recently been studied (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and reference therein). For the practical case of passive eavesdropping, maximal-ratio combining (MRC) was applied at the receiver and the eavesdropper in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to increase secrecy capacity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the secrecy outage probability was compared between MRC and selection combining (SC) at the eavesdropper. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the secrecy performance metrics with transmit antenna selection (TAS) were examined in independent Rayleigh and Nakagami-fading channels, respectively. To the best of authors' knowledge, however, very limited attention has been directed to the antenna correlation effect on secrecy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>  applies to two antennas at the eavesdropper). The findings in this direction are crucial for system designers since antenna correlation is unavoidable in many practical situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We note that secrecy capacity increases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the main channel and decreases with the SNR of the eavesdropper's channel. Therefore, the correlation features that increase (or decrease) the performance of both channels have non trivially predictable effects on the secrecy performance of the system. In this paper, we completely characterize the impact of antenna correlation on the secrecy performance of the wiretap channel with multiple antennas at the transmitter, receiver, and eavesdropper. The adoption of this model relaxes some restrictions imposed in the existing literature on the number of antennas at the receiver (e.g., single antenna <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) and the eavesdropper (e.g., dual antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). In our model, the transmitter side experiences independent fading which is applicable due to spatially separated antennas, e.g., at a base station. At the receiver side and the eavesdropper side, we assume an arbitrary antenna correlation model. This model has the ability to mimic a wide range of antenna correlation conditions often experienced in practice, such as uniform correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, exponential correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and correlation models constructed from measured channels (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). The special case of full correlation is also included in our analysis as one extreme end. At the transmitter, TAS is adopted to enhance physical layer security with low feedback overhead <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> while MRC is applied at the receiver and at the eavesdropper.</p><p>For the considered wiretap channel in this paper, we examine the two following, fundamental and interesting questions: "1) What is the impact of antenna correlation at the receiver/eavesdropper on secrecy?" and "2) Which correlation has a higher dominance on secrecy?" In order to address these questions completely, new closed-form expressions are derived for the exact secrecy outage probability and the probability of positive secrecy. Our new expressions encompass the results for independent fading in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> as special cases. Moreover, for the considered scenarios, we derive a new compact expression for the asymptotic secrecy outage probability, which characterizes the secrecy performance with high average SNR over the main channel. The asymptotic expressions explicitly show how the secrecy outage diversity order and the secrecy outage array gain vary depending on the correlation parameters, the number of antennas, and the average SNRs. Notably, we show that for the low average SNR of the main channel, higher correlation at the eavesdropper brings greater performance improvement than higher correlation at the receiver. For the medium and high average SNR of the main channel, higher correlation at the eavesdropper imposes less performance degradation than higher correlation at the receiver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL</head><p>Consider a wiretap channel where the transmitter (Alice), the receiver (Bob), and the eavesdropper (Eve) are equipped with , , and antennas, respectively. We concentrate on passive eavesdropping, where the CSI of the eavesdropper's channel is not available at Alice. A quasi-static Rayleigh fading model is assumed for the main channel and the eavesdropper's channel, where the fading coefficients remain fixed during a transmission block but vary independently from block to block. Also, the main channel and the eavesdropper's channel are assumed to be independent of each other. To perform secure transmission, Alice encodes the message block into the codeword 1556-6013/$31.00 Â© 2012 IEEE</p><p>, where is the length of . This codeword is subject to an average power constraint , where denotes the expectation. Applying the TAS/MRC protocol in this MIMO wiretap channel, the strongest antenna amongst antennas at Alice is selected to maximize the instantaneous SNR of the main channel. Since MRC is adopted at Bob, the strongest antenna refers to the transmit antenna providing the highest instantaneous SNR at Bob. In this protocol, only the strongest antenna index is fed back from Bob and Alice. As such, the strongest antenna for Bob is entirely determined by the CSI of the main channel and thus, corresponds to a random transmit antenna for Eve. This is due to the assumption that the main channel and the eavesdropper's channel are assumed to be mutually independent. It follows that Eve is not able to exploit the multiantenna diversity from Alice. We consider MRC at Bob and Eve. 1 Therefore, the index of the selected strongest antenna, , is determined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where denotes the antenna correlation matrix at Bob, denotes the channel vector between the th transmit antenna at Alice and the antennas at Bob with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading entries, and denotes the Euclidean norm. With this strongest antenna, the main channel vector is written as . We further denote as the antenna correlation matrix at Eve, and denote as the channel vector between the th transmit antenna at Alice and the antennas at Eve with i.i.d. Rayleigh fading entries. As such, the eavesdropper's channel vector is written as . The distinct real eigenvalues of are denoted as with multiplicities , respectively, where . The distinct real eigenvalues of are denoted as with multiplicities , respectively, where . In the main channel, the received signal vector at Bob at time is given by , where is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector at Bob satisfying , is the noise variance at each receive antenna, denotes the conjugate transpose operation, and denotes the identity matrix. Applying MRC, Bob multiplies the received signal vector by the conjugate transpose of a weight vector . This results in a single scalar symbol given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Based on (2), the instantaneous SNR of the main channel is given by . In the eavesdropper's channel, Eve receives the signal vector from Alice and performs MRC at time , resulting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where is a weight vector at Eve, is the AWGN vector at Eve which satisfies , and is the noise variance at each receive antenna. According to (3), the instantaneous SNR of the eavesdropper's channel is given by . In this system, the capacity of the main channel is given by and the capacity of the eavesdropper's channel is given by . According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the secrecy capacity is defined 1 We note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> considered comparing MRC and SC at Eve. We do not consider SC in this paper since MRC always outperforms SC. as for , where denotes . Here, the secrecy capacity is strictly positive. In TAS/MRC, Alice has no CSI about the main channel since Bob only feeds back the strongest antenna index to Alice. For passive eavesdropping, Alice and Bob have no CSI about the eavesdropper's channel. Therefore, Alice sets a constant code rate . If , the codewords with rate guarantee perfect secrecy. Otherwise, if</p><p>, Eve can eavesdrop on data, thereby perfect secrecy is compromised. This mandates the use of secrecy outage probability as a useful and practical secrecy performance metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Specifically, secrecy outage probability is the probability that either there is an outage between Alice and Bob (i.e., the conventional outage probability where the message is not decodable at Bob) or Eve can eavesdrop on data such that perfect secrecy is compromised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SECRECY WITH ANTENNA CORRELATION</head><p>In this section, we derive two important secrecy metrics, namely the secrecy outage probability and the probability of positive secrecy. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> We commence our analysis by presenting the statistics of and .

Expanding the binomial and the resultant polynomial in (6), we rewrite the CDF of as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where with nonnegative integers and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Secrecy Outage Probability</head><p>The secrecy outage probability is defined as , where is the predetermined secrecy rate. We proceed to rewrite as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where is derived as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and is derived as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Using ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) into ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), is derived as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Substituting ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) into <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and solving the resultant integrals with the help of [14, Eq. (3.326.2)] yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> The secrecy outage probability expression in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is derived in closedform and applies to arbitrary numbers of antennas, arbitrary average SNRs, and generalized antenna correlation. We note that ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is useful to calculate other secrecy metrics. We first evaluate the probability of positive secrecy. In wiretap channels, positive secrecy is achievable when . As such, the probability of positive secrecy is evaluated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> Setting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, a new closed-form expression for the probability of positive secrecy is derived as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> Second, based on ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) we obtain the -outage secrecy capacity as , where . This specifies the maximum secrecy rate when the secrecy outage probability is less than .</p><p>We next derive the asymptotic secrecy outage probability to characterize the behavior of secrecy outage probability when the average SNR of the main channel is sufficiently high, 3 i.e., . Here, corresponds to the scenario where Bob is located much closer to Alice than Eve, which is a practical scenario of interest. The asymptotic result will enable us to explicitly examine the impact of antenna correlation on the secrecy performance in terms of the secrecy outage diversity order and the secrecy outage array gain. The secrecy outage diversity order, which is the slope of the secrecy outage probability curve, describes how fast the secrecy outage probability decreases with average SNR. The secrecy outage array gain, which is the horizontal shift of the secrecy outage probability curve, describes the SNR advantage of a secrecy outage probability curve relative to the reference curve with the same secrecy outage diversity order. To this end, the first nonzero order expansion is derived. With the aid of the Maclaurin series expansion from [14, Eq. (1.211.1)], we retain the first nonzero order term and discard the higher order terms, which results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where denotes the higher order terms, i.e., as if . Substituting ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) into ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and using [14, Eq. (3.326.2)], the asymptotic secrecy outage probability is derived as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where and is given by (18) 3 When , the probability of successful eavesdropping will go to one. As such, we omit this case in this paper.</p><p>where</p><p>. Based on ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), we confirm that the secrecy outage diversity order of is achieved. It is evident that correlation has no impact of the secrecy outage diversity order but affects the secrecy outage array gain. By observing (18), we see that larger and lead to a lower . This indicates that increasing antenna correlation will increases secrecy outage probability in the high SNR regime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Special Correlation Models</head><p>Next we examine independent fading and two special correlation models: uniform and exponential correlation. The uniform correlation matrix is defined as where , if and otherwise. This model can provide suitable representations for closely spaced antennas on other than linear array configurations and for a trio of equidistant antennas forming an equilateral triangle in the space <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The exponential correlation matrix is defined as and describes the scenario of reception from equi-spaced antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Specifically, we characterize the performance gap between these cases as a simple ratio of their secrecy outage array gains.</p><p>1) Independent Fading: In this case, we have with for Bob and with for Eve. We simplify and using [12, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">23</ref>)] and then apply the simplified and into ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) to obtain the exact and asymptotic secrecy outage probability with independent fading, respectively. In this case, we note that the exact result with is equivalent to [5, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">6</ref>)], the exact result with is equivalent to [6, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)], and the exact result with is equivalent to [7, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)].</p></div>

Substituting the simplified and , given in [12, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">22</ref>)], into <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, we obtain the exact and asymptotic secrecy outage probability with uniform correlation, respectively.

The performance gap between exponential correlation and independent fading is characterized as <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref> where denotes the secrecy outage array gain of exponential correlation and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Impact of Full Correlation</head><p>We now consider the case where the antennas and/or the antennas at Eve are fully correlated, i.e., correlation matrices become rank-one and can be written as and . The fully correlated case enables the examination of the effect of correlation on the secrecy performance at one extreme end (other being independent fading). Since we consider passive eavesdropping where the Eve's channel knowledge is not available at Alice, it is important for the system designers to understand the secrecy performance of the worst possible correlation scenario.</p><p>Using [16, Eq.

Indeed, Bob cannot exploit any diversity benefits of antennas if they experience full correlation. Although not shown, the probability of positive secrecy for Cases 1, 2, and 3 can be easily derived by using , where is obtained by setting in the expressions for the exact secrecy outage probability in (24), (27), and (30), respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>We present numerical results to examine the impact of antenna correlation on secrecy performance. Throughout this section, denotes the correlation parameter of the main channel and denotes the correlation parameter of the eavesdropper's channel. The exact curves in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>precisely agree with the Monte Carlo simulation results, which validates the correctness of our analysis.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> plots the probability of positive secrecy versus . The exact curves are generated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. This figure highlights that correlation is beneficial to the secrecy performance when is low. Specifically, as increases, we observe an increase in when . This observation is not surprising since antenna correlation reduces the effective dimensionality at Bob for low , which enables  power focusing. At low SNR, a similar observation for non secrecy MIMO relay systems was found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Moreover, we observe that increases with increasing when . In this regime, is relatively high compared with and effective dimensionality plays a dominant role at Eve. As such, correlation weakens the eavesdropper's channel quality and thus benefits the secrecy performance. Furthermore, we observe that the performance improvement brought by increasing is higher than brought by increasing . In addition, we observe a profound improvement in with increasing , which confirms the benefits of TAS in PHY layer security enhancement.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> plots the secrecy outage probability versus . The exact and asymptotic curves are generated from ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), respectively. It is evident that the secrecy outage diversity order is not affected by or , as indicated by the parallel slopes of the asymptotes. This figure demonstrates that correlation is detrimental to the secrecy performance when is at medium and high levels. In this regime (e.g., for and for ), the secrecy outage probability increases as or increases. On one hand, higher indicates the degraded quality of the main channel, which results in poorer secrecy performance. On the other hand, is relatively low compared with . As such, higher implies power focusing at Eve, which leads to improved eavesdropper's channel quality and weakening secrecy performance. Moreover, we observe that the performance degradation caused by increasing is larger than brought by increasing .</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> plots the secrecy outage probability versus . The exact curves for Cases 1, 2, and 3 are generated from (24), (27), and (30), respectively, and the asymptotic curves for Cases 1, 2, and 3 are generated from (25), (28), and (31), respectively. We first observe that when antennas are fully correlated, e.g., Cases 2 and 3, the secrecy outage diversity order reduces from 4 to 2, as predicted by ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) and (31). Second, we observe that when is at medium and high levels, the secrecy outage probability achieved by exponential correlation with is lower than that achieved by Case 1. Moreover, the secrecy outage probability achieved by Case 2 is lower than that achieved by Case 3. As explained previously, higher correlation at Eve degrades the secrecy performance for medium and high .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we analyzed the effects of antenna correlation on the secrecy performance of MIMO wiretap channels with transmit antenna selection at the transmitter and maximal-ratio combining at the receiver and the eavesdropper. New closed-form expressions were derived for the probability of positive secrecy, the exact secrecy outage probability, and the asymptotic secrecy outage probability. Some existing results for independent fading are included in our analysis as special cases. We showed that when the average SNR of the main channel is at low level, higher correlation at the eavesdropper offers more beneficial effects on secrecy than higher correlation at the receiver. When the average SNR of the main channel is at medium and high levels, higher correlation at the receiver exerts more detrimental effects on secrecy than higher correlation at the eavesdropper.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
