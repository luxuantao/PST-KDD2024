<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract-Evolutionary algorithm-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planners have been extensively studied for their effectiveness and flexibility. However, they still suffer from a drawback that the high-quality waypoints in previous candidate paths can hardly be exploited for further evolution, since they regard all the waypoints of a path as an integrated individual. Due to this drawback, the previous planners usually fail when encountering lots of obstacles. In this paper, a new idea of separately evaluating and evolving waypoints is presented to solve this problem. Concretely, the original objective and constraint functions of UAVs path planning are decomposed into a set of new evaluation functions, with which waypoints on a path can be evaluated separately. The new evaluation functions allow waypoints on a path to be evolved separately and, thus, high-quality waypoints can be better exploited. On this basis, the waypoints are encoded in a rotated coordinate system with an external restriction and evolved with JADE, a state-of-the-art variant of the differential evolution algorithm. To test the capabilities of the new planner on planning obstacle-free paths, five scenarios with increasing numbers of obstacles are constructed. Three existing planners and four variants of the proposed planner are compared to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed planner. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed planner and the idea of separate evolution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>U NMANNED aerial vehicles (UAVs) are aircrafts without human pilots onboard. Due to their great advantages in terms of crew endurance, UAVs have been entrusted in high-risk missions so that human lives can be completely kept away from danger <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Over the past few decades, autonomous path-planning techniques have become increasingly important to the UAV, as the conventional remotely piloted techniques cannot offer sufficient accuracy and perfect timing for complex missions nowadays <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The path-planning problem for a UAV can be formulated as an optimization problem that finds a feasible path from the start point to the destination for a UAV to follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In the literature, a path is usually represented as a set of segments by a sequence of waypoints. These segments can be line segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Bspline curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, or Bezier curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Hence, path planning, in general, is to find out a sequence of waypoints, as well as the segments linking each pair of adjacent waypoints to optimize various objectives subject to a number of constraints. Generally, the curve-based representations can ensure the smoothness of candidate paths, while their computational costs are high as they introduce external local controls for generating paths. In this paper, line-segment-based paths are adopted for their simplicity and efficiency.</p><p>The UAV path-planning problems can be further categorized into three types, i.e., offline planning, online planning, and cooperative planning. If the global information about the environment is at hand, the problem is called offline planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. If the circumstance is partially known or completely unknown in advance, the path will be planned online <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In case a mission is too complex to accomplish by a single UAV, a team of UAVs are called for, and hence, cooperative planning is studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. All these three types of problems have been proved to be NPcomplete <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Among them, offline planning is probably the most commonly adopted approach for UAV path planning. Besides, online planning and cooperative planning can be viewed as extended versions of offline planning problems. Hence, this paper focuses on offline path-planning problems. For the sake of brevity, UAV offline path planning will be referred to as path planning throughout the rest of the paper.</p><p>The path-planning problem is not restricted to UAVs. In fact, it is much more intensively investigated in the general domain of Robotics, where path planning is usually referred to as motion planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Notice that the motion of robots may concern not only the waypoints, but also the configurations for some other degrees of freedom (DOFs), e.g., rotation for articulated robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Such additional DOFs are usually not considered in the UAVs' path-planning problem, since a UAV is usually considered as a point instead of a rigid body, comparing its size with the large-scale mission space. In the literature, a large variety of approaches, including mathematic programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, roadmap <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, cell decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, potential field approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, sampling-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, have been developed for the general motion planning problems. It is not surprising that most of these approaches have also been studied in the context of UAVs path-planning problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>However, in spite of the similarity between general motion planning for robotics and path planning for UAVs, the latter involves two domain-specific challenges, which are seldom encountered in the context of the former and thus could hardly be tackled by direct applications of existing approaches. First, as UAVs fly above the ground and can change their altitude during flight, in essence, they work in a 3-D space. In contrast, motion planning for vehicles usually considers 2-D space because vehicles move on the ground. The additional DOF significantly enlarges the mission space and, thereby, the solution space of the path-planning problem of UAVs. Second, a fixed-wing UAV cannot hover and has to always keep a rather high cruise speed. Such a requirement induces additional complicated constraints, e.g., smoothness of the path, to the path-planning problem. On comparison, motion planning for robots is much less restricted by this requirement, because robots can slow down or even stop when necessary. Due to the smoothness requirement, the feasible space for the path of a UAV may decrease rapidly as the number of obstacles increases. Moreover, the increase in obstacles leads to much narrower and more zigzagged passageways for the UAV. In such cases, more waypoints are required to keep a path sufficiently flyable, i.e., smooth and safe, and thus, a pathplanning problem with significantly larger scale (i.e., in terms of the number of waypoints) will be induced.</p><p>Among the existing approaches, the EA-based planners are normally more flexible and effective than the other approaches on planning obstacle-free paths for UAVs. On one hand, they do not require constructing the configuration space, which is very time consuming. On the other hand, EAs have powerful global search ability to avoid being trapped in local optima due to their population-based nature. During the past few years, EAbased UAV's path planners have drawn increasing research of interests. Nevertheless, they still usually fail when the number of obstacles becomes quite large. The reason for this failure of the existing EA-based planners is that they all regard the whole path as a candidate solution. Generally, a path is feasible only if all its waypoints are at feasible positions. When searching for a feasible path, it is unlikely that the feasible positions for all waypoints can be obtained simultaneously (e.g., in the same iteration). Instead, it is highly possible that one candidate path consists of good positions for some waypoints, while the other waypoints are in bad positions. In other words, waypoints in a candidate path may be of different qualities. Nevertheless, existing EA-based approaches are unable to identify such differences as they regard the whole candidate path rather than a single waypoint as the unit of evaluation and evolution. Consequently, all waypoints of a "bad" path will be regarded as "bad" waypoints and vice versa. Eventually, the lack of capability to exploit high-quality waypoints leads the existing EA-based planners to an inefficient search when lots of obstacles exist.</p><p>Taking a closer look at the commonly used objective and constraint functions of path-planning problems, which will be detailed in Section II, it can be observed that most of them are separable at waypoints. The reason is that planning obstacle-free paths for UAVs actually works at the geometric level (assuming the dynamic of actuators are not taken into consideration), where most of our concerns (criteria) are the points, segments, and angles. These geometric relations are all separable on waypoints. Hence, the general idea adopted in this study is to explicitly decompose those evaluation functions and design a new evolution strategy to evaluate and evolve each single waypoint, in terms of the decomposed criteria. In this case, high-quality waypoints can be exploited to improve the performances of the whole candidate paths. To implement this idea, a new EA-based path planner is proposed. Instead of searching for a sequence of feasible waypoints simultaneously, the proposed path planner evaluates and evolves each waypoint separately. For the evaluation phase, a set of new objective and constraint functions for single waypoints is derived from the existing functions that are used to evaluate the whole path. For the evolution phase, a stateof-the-art differential evolution (DE), JADE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, is employed to evolve each single waypoint. A widely used multicriteria handling method is also used to select the evaluated waypoints for reproduction. This way, the planner can focus more on seeking good positions for waypoints, and information about previous good positions of waypoints can be better exploited. To further enhance the performance of the proposed planner, a recently proposed 3-D coordinate system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is also employed to encode the waypoints.</p><p>Finally, a set of detailed simulations are carried out. In the simulations, the proposed planner is compared with seven planners on five scenarios with different numbers of obstacles. The obstacles are represented as ranges of missiles and mountains where the UAV is forbidden to fly through. By randomly setting missiles on the ground, the numbers of obstacles are set as 7, 15, 30, 60, and 120 for the five scenarios, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed idea can significantly improve the ability of path planners in scenarios with lots of obstacles. The proposed planner can outperform all compared planners when there are lots of obstacles.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the evaluation functions of the key factors of UAV path planning in detail. The proposed path planner is then introduced in Section III. In Section IV, we test the effectiveness of the proposed planner by comparing it with seven planners in five scenarios with different numbers of obstacles. Finally, the conclusions of this study and expectation of further research are discussed in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</head><p>When planning a path for a UAV, quite a few important factors need to be taken into consideration, such as the maneuverability of the UAV, the environment of the mission space, safety, and cost of the path. These factors are involved either in the form of objective functions that need to be maximized/minimized, or in the form of constraints that a path must comply with. Since the purpose of this paper is not to construct a new set of realistic evaluation functions, we directly employ or derive some existing representative functions in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> to include several key factors in UAV path planning. Detailed technical justifications of the chosen functions can be found in the corresponding studies, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Generally, these factors restrict the paths in a geometric manner. Specifically, the factors to be considered can be categorized into two types based on the way they restrict the paths. The first type of factors require only the waypoints for evaluation. That is, those factors can be evaluated by checking the locations of waypoints as well as the geometric relations in between. Examples are maximal turning angle, maximal slope, minimal path length, minimal flight altitude (FA), and map limitation. The other factors are relevant to the segments as well as to the waypoints, since waypoints are not sufficient to determine the real states of a UAV. In other words, the segments may be infeasible even when the corresponding waypoints are in feasible locations. Examples are minimal risk of kill, minimal risk of radar detection (RRD), and the terrain limitation. For the first type of factors, we directly borrow the existing functions. For the second type of factors, however, the existing functions have only considered the states of waypoints and regard those states as the behaviors of the corresponding segments. In this paper, we try to modify the second type of functions and approximate the real behaviors of a segment. The approximation is to first divide each segment into N d piecewise parts and then evaluate the N d dividing points (the waypoint is also regarded as a dividing point). Suppose (dx ij , dy ij , dz ij ) indicates the jth dividing point in the segment between the (i -1)th and the ith waypoint, where i = 2, 3, . . . , N w , j = 1, 2, . . . , N d ; it can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(dx ij , dy ij , dz ij ) = (x i-1 , y i-1 , z i-1 ) + j ‚Ä¢ ((x i , y i , z i ) -(x i-1 , y i-1 , z i-1 ))/N d .</formula><p>(1)</p><p>N d reflects the tradeoff between the computational cost and the accuracy of approximation. Generally, the larger N d is, the higher the accuracy of the approximation will be, while the efficiency will fall. The value of N d is problem dependent and will be discussed in Section IV.</p><p>At the end of this section, the scheme of selecting the final solution according to these constraints and objectives will be presented.</p><p>A. Objective Functions 1) Minimal Path Length: For military missions, shorter paths are always preferred to longer ones, because shorter paths usually consume less fuel and have a lower chance of encountering some unexpected threats, e.g., gusty winds or undetected enemies. Hence, the total length of the path needs to be minimized. This consideration leads to the objective function path length ratio (PLR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> given by 2  (2) where (x i , y i , z i ), i = 2, 3, . . . , N w , denotes the position of the ith waypoint in the 3-D mission space, and N w is the total number of waypoints of a path (including the starting point and the destination). Here, the PLR is used instead of the absolute path length. Besada-Portas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has explained why they are equivalent and the former is more admissible.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f 1 = N w i=2 (x i -x i-1 ) 2 + (y i -y i-1 ) 2 + (z i -z i-1 ) 2 (x N w -x 1 ) 2 + (y N w -y 1 ) 2 + (z N w -z 1 )</formula><p>2) Minimal Risk of Kill: If a UAV is within the range of hostile missiles, it is at risk. Intuitively, paths with lower risk of kill (RKill) are safer than those with higher probabilities. For each dividing point, the kth, k = 1, 2, . . . , M (the number of missiles), hostile missile imposes a certain risk of kill for the UAV only if that point is inside the region defined by the missile's maximal risk distance (seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), denoted as R k RK max . The distance between a dividing point and the kth missile is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dis k ij = (dx ij -mx k ) 2 + (dy ij -my k ) 2 + (dz ij -mz k ) 2<label>(3</label></formula><p>) where (mx k , my k , mz k ) is the given location of the kth missile. Hence, the RKill of the whole path can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f 2 = N w i=2 N d j =1 M k =1 RK k ij with RK k ij = ‚éß ‚é™ ‚é® ‚é™ ‚é© (R k RK max ) 4 (R k RK max ) 4 + (dis k ij ) 4 , if dis k ij ‚â§ R k RK max 0, otherwise.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>This formulation (4) is derived from that suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, which is a simplified version of the real probability of kill in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, where the impact of the altitude of the UAV is neglected.</p><p>3) Minimal Risk of Radar Detection: A UAV can always remain undetected until enemy radars pick it up. The RRD should be as small as possible. The RRD is technically the fourth power of the distance between the dividing point and the radar. Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> suggested a simplified version of the real RRD. We modify it by evaluating N d dividing points for each segment. The derived function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f 3 = N w i=2 N d j =1 R k =1 RD k ij with RD k ij = ‚éß ‚é™ ‚é™ ‚é® ‚é™ ‚é™ ‚é© Œ¥ dis k ij 4 , if dis k ij ‚â§ R k RRD max 0, otherwise<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">dis k ij = (dx ij -rx k ) 2 + (dy ij -ry k ) 2 + (dz ij -rz k ) 2<label>(6</label></formula><p>) where Œ¥ is the scale of the intensity of the radar, (rx k , ry k , rz k ) is the location of the kth radar, R is the number of radars, and R k RRD max represents the maximal risk distance of missiles. 4) Minimal Flight Altitude: A UAV may need to fly at a low altitude to be a greater threat to the enemy on the ground. The formulation of FA is directly borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f 4 = N w i=2 FA i with FA i = 0, if z i ‚â§ map(x i , y i ) (z i -map(x i , y i ))/N w , otherwise<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where map(x, y) is a function that returns the height of the location (x, y).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Constraints Functions</head><p>1) Maximal Turning Angle: Subject to the maneuverability of a UAV, a path should be sufficiently smooth. This requires the turning angle of the UAV at a waypoint to be kept small. The turning angle is defined as the angle between its previous direction and the current direction in the horizontal direction. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">g 1 = 0, where g 1 = N w -1 i=2 c 1 i with c 1 i = 1, if Œ∏ i &gt; Œ∏ max 0, otherwise<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where Œ∏ max is the upper limit of the turning angle, Œ∏ i is the turning angle at the ith waypoint (x i , y i , z i ), i = 2, 3, . . . , N w . Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> suggested a formulation of Œ∏ i as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Œ∏ i = arccos √ó (x i -x i-1 , y i -y i-1 ) ‚Ä¢ (x i+1 -x i , y i+1 -y i ) T (x i -x i-1 , y i -y i-1 ) ‚Ä¢ (x i+1 -x i , y i+1 -y i )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where x means the norm of vector x.</p><p>2) Limited Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Slope: Similar to the turning angle, the slope characterizes the change of flying direction in the vertical direction, i.e., the diving or climbing angle. The slope is the included angle between the horizontal and the direction from the current waypoint toward the next one. For each waypoint (x i , y i , z i ), i = 2, 3, . . . , N w , Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> suggested its slope as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">r = z i -z i-1 ||(x i -x i-1 , y i -y i-1 )|| . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>Similarly, the slope should be in the range of the maximal diving or climbing angle. For a feasible path, this constraint can be depicted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">g 2 = 0, where g 2 = N w i=2 c 2 i with c 2 i = 0, if Œ± ‚â§ r ‚â§ Œ≤ 1, otherwise.<label>(11)</label></formula><p>3) Terrain Limited: A UAV should fly above the rugged terrain and avoid collisions with the mountains. The height of the UAV should always be higher than the terrain below it. We derive the following formulation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The dividing points are also used, as the segments may be in the mountains. This constraint can be depicted as g 3 = 0, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">g 3 = N w i=2 N d j =1 c 3 ij with c 3 ij = 1, if dz ij ‚â§ map(dx ij , dy ij ) 0, otherwise.<label>(12)</label></formula><p>4) Map Limited: Before executing a mission, a certain related mission space is usually investigated. Conversely, the areas outside the mission space are normally unknown and may conceal unexpected dangers, e.g., unknown hostile army. Thus, UAVs should always fly in the mission space to keep away from uncertainties. Typically, the mission space is assumed as a cube. For a feasible path, it should be inside the cube. Besada-Portas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> suggested this constraint as follows:g 4 = 0, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">g 4 = N w i=2 c 4 i with c 4 i = 0, if In Range(x i , y i ) 1, otherwise<label>(13)</label></formula><p>In Range</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(x i , y i ) = (l x ‚â§ x i ‚â§ h x ) ‚àß (l y ‚â§ y i ‚â§ h y )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where l x and h x are the lower and higher bounds for the x coordinate system, and l y and h y are the lower and higher bounds for the y coordinate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Selection of the Final Solution</head><p>The problem described above appears to be a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) at first sight as there are several conflicting objective functions to optimize. Normally, an MOP outputs a set of Pareto optimal solutions, which will be presented to human experts to determine the final solution to be followed by the UAV. However, this does not fit the context of UAV path planning as no human expert is onboard to make such a choice. Hence, a final solution should be selected for the UAV. Usually, a common practice in the context of UAVs is to integrate different objectives. In the literature, some previous works solve this problem by using weighted sum <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, those weighted parameters appear very difficult to fine-tune as different objectives are in different scales. In this paper, we adopt a more intuitive scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This scheme considers different human preferences to the objectives. Detailedly, this scheme takes two cases into account.</p><p>1) For all the feasible paths such that f 2 = 0, i.e., there is no chance of the UAV being destroyed. The path with the smallest f 1 , i.e., path length, is selected as the final output. If there exist more than one path sharing the same value as f 2 and f 1 , we randomly select one of them as the best final output. This is because the objectives of minimal probability of radar detection and minimal FA look equally important to the UAV. 2) For all the feasible paths such that f 2 &gt; 0, i.e., it is possible that the UAV will be destroyed. We first calculate the relative f i 2 of each ith path as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">rf i 2 = f i 2 /min i (f i 2 )</formula><p>. Then, the paths with rf i 2 ‚â• V (for example, with V = 1.05) are discarded, which makes the nondiscarded jth paths have a value of f j 2 insignificantly larger than the minimum. At last, the path with min j (f j 1 ) is selected. Therefore, the final output has an f 2 that is a bit larger than the minimum, as well as a reasonable path length f 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED PLANNER</head><p>Most of these EA-based approaches adopt a similar iterative search framework. That is, a candidate solution to the pathplanning problem is encoded as a real-valued vector that represents the positions of all the waypoints, and the optimal path is iteratively searched in the corresponding real space. At each iteration, a number of candidate paths are generated and evaluated with respect to the objective functions and constraints. Only those paths with higher fitness will be maintained, based on which new candidate paths will be generated by applying some search operators to the maintained paths. The search process terminates when the optimal (or sufficiently good) solution is obtained or a given time budget is reached. The above-described EA-based approaches have proved to be very effective for UAV path planning when obstacles in the mission space are few. However, when the obstacles increase, those planners usually fail. This results from the common disadvantage that the high-quality waypoints in previous candidate paths appear very difficult to exploit. To be specific, a path is optimal only if all its waypoints are at optimal positions. When searching for the optimal path, it is unlikely that the optimal positions for all waypoints can be obtained simultaneously (e.g., in the same iteration). Instead, it is highly possible that one candidate path consists of good positions for some waypoints, while the other waypoints are assigned good positions in another candidate path. In other words, waypoints in a candidate path may be of different quality. However, existing EA-based approaches are unable to identify such differences. Intuitively speaking, all waypoints of a "bad" path will be regarded as "bad" waypoints and vice versa. Such a search behavior will make it difficult to exploit high-quality waypoints in previous candidate paths and eventually lead to an inefficient search.</p><p>During the investigation of the UAV path-planning problems, it was noticed that most of the commonly used objective and constraint functions are separable on waypoints. The reason is that planning obstacle-free paths for UAVs actually works at the geometric level (assuming the dynamic of actuators are not taken into consideration), where most of our concerns (criteria) are the points, segments, and angles. These geometric relations are all separable on waypoints. If it is possible to explicitly decompose those evaluation functions, a new evolution strategy can be developed to evaluate and evolve each single waypoint, separately. In this case, high-quality waypoints can be exploited to improve the performances of the whole candidate paths. Inspired by the above considerations, a new EA-based path planner is proposed. Instead of searching for the feasible path as a whole, the proposed path planner evaluates and evolves each waypoint separately. Specifically, at each generation, for each path j, its waypoints are separately evolved in an ascending order, i.e., the (i + 1)th waypoint will be evolved after the ith one has been evolved, i = 2, 3, . . . , N w -1. For the ith waypoint of the jth path, its offspring is generated by referring to the ith waypoints of all the other candidate paths, i = 2, 3, . . . , N w -1, j = 1, 2, . . . , N p . This way, the information of the other ith waypoints in the population can be explicitly exploited to improve the quality of the currently being evolved ith waypoint. After a new offspring is produced, it is asked to compete with its parent for survival based on their fitness values. To evaluate the waypoints, a set of new evaluation functions are derived from the commonly used functions introduced in Section II. The evolution of each single waypoint is performed by a state-ofthe-art DE, JADE. The diagram of the evolution of waypoints is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The evolution of each waypoint, i.e., the inner loop in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, is only executed once at each generation here. Ideally, it can be executed any fixed times, say N . The larger N is, the greater the local information of waypoints that can be used and the new produced waypoint may be of better quality. However, the efficiency of optimization will drop as more time budgets are required for the local improvements. For simplification and efficiency, here, we set N = 1. A widely used multicriteria handling method is also used to select the evaluated waypoints. To further enhance the performance of the proposed planner, a recently proposed 3-D coordinate system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is also employed to encode the waypoints.</p><p>In the framework of EAs, a path planner usually consists of several key components, i.e., evaluation, reproduction, selection, and path representation. In order to introduce the proposed planner in detail, each key component is described one by one in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. New Evaluation Functions</head><p>Each waypoint should be evaluated before evolution. However, the aforementioned evaluation functions cannot be adopted in our framework as they can only be used for evaluating the global states of a path. Fortunately, those commonly used evaluation functions are found separable on waypoints. The reason is that those objectives restrict the flight of the UAV at the geometric level, where most objects concerned are the points, segments, and angles, which are all separable on points, i.e., waypoints. To be specific, the behavior of a waypoint usually depends on, except for itself, one or two neighbor waypoints. For example, the minimal path length and maximal turning angle involve three waypoints, i.e., the previous neighbor, the current waypoint, and its successive neighbor, while the remaining functions require the information about the current waypoint and its previous neighbor. In the framework of the proposed planner, as the waypoints of a new candidate path are produced in sequence, the knowledge of the previous neighbor can easily be obtained as they are produced earlier, while the information about the successive neighbor is unknown. Considering this, the two rules are given as follows.</p><p>1) For the evaluation function involving two waypoints, its local version is calculated relevant to the previous neighbor and the current waypoint. 2) For the evaluation function involving three waypoints, its local version is calculated relevant to the previous neighbor, the current waypoint and the destination. The idea behind the second rule is driven by the following: Suppose all the previous waypoints have been determined and the current waypoint is the last intermediate waypoint, where should it be? Although this idea sounds a bit greedy and the transcribed local versions are only approximations of their global ones, it works well as we will see later in the simulation results.</p><p>Based on the two rules, the new evaluation functions, i.e., local versions, are introduced as follows.</p><p>1) Minimal Path Length: As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, for the ith waypoint (x i , y i , z i ), the PLR is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">f 1 ,i = (x i -x i -1 ) 2 + (y i -y i -1 ) 2 + (z i -z i -1 ) 2 (x N w -x i -1 ) 2 + (y N w -y i -1 ) 2 + (z N w -z i -1 ) 2 + (x N w -x i ) 2 + (y N w -y i ) 2 + (z N w -z i ) 2 (x N w -x i -1 ) 2 + (y N w -y i -1 ) 2 + (z N w -z i -1 ) 2 .

As only the waypoints are evolved in the proposed planner, the fitness of segments should be assigned to the corresponding waypoints, since the locations of waypoints determine the segments. For i = 2, 3, . . . , N w -1, the fitness of the (i -1)th segment will be added to the ith waypoint. However, this is not generally suitable when i = N w , since the last waypoint is fixed. To solve this problem, the fitness of the last segment, from the (N w -1)th waypoint to the destination, is also added to the (N w -1)th waypoint. This is reasonable as the (N w -1)th waypoint determines the last two segments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Reproduction and Selection</head><p>In the proposed planner, the reproduction component is independent of the other components, e.g., selection, evaluation, and representation. Ideally, any strategy of reproduction can be adopted to drive the evolution. Here, JADE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which is one state-of-the-art variant of DE, is employed to evolve waypoints. DE is arguably one of the most powerful stochastic realparameter optimization algorithms, and its variants have been widely used in solving many real-world problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. DE shares the same framework with traditional EAs. Within this framework, DE employs a differential mutation operator that creates trial vectors (individuals) by adding the weighted difference vector between two individuals to a third one. This novel mutation strategy turns out to be very efficient. In recent years, DE has been extensively studied, and lots of variants have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Among them, JADE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> is undoubtedly one of the state-of-the-art variants. JADE is an adaptive version of DE that requires very few parameters to be tuned.</p><p>It is very easy to implement JADE into the proposed path planner. For intuition, we first list the framework of the proposed path planner in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref> and then explain it in detail. In the pseudocode, each waypoint is denoted as x t j,i , where i = 2, 3, . . . N w -1; j = 1, 2, . . . N p , which means the ith waypoint of the jth path at the tth generation. In addition, x t j,i,m , where m = 1, 2, 3, means the mth coordinate value of waypoint x t j,i , i.e., the x, y, zcoordinate, respectively. Œº i C R and Œº i F are adaptive parameters for updating CR and F , i.e., two key parameters for crossover and mutation, for the ith waypoints. Steps 9-12 describe the mutation scheme: First, three distinct ith waypoints are randomly selected from the whole population at the tth generation, denoted as x q best , x r 1 , andx r 2 , respectively. Specifically, x q best must be selected from the top q% of the ith waypoints. The value of q is usually chosen from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. The term x t 1:N p ,i indicates all the ith waypoints at the tth generation. Strictly speaking, the selected waypoint x q best may not be the best reference for generating offspring for the waypoint x t j,i . This is because the good behavior of x q best is referred to a path different from the jth path and a good waypoint of one path may not be good in the other path. Nevertheless, this mutation scheme is still reasonable: At the early stage of the search process, candidate paths are quite diverse. Although the feasibility of the segment from x t j,i-1 to x q best cannot be guaranteed, the location of x q best is at least in the good (or even feasible) regions. This information provides a bias for the generated offspring toward the feasible regions. This stage can be seen as the coarse tuning. As the optimization continues, waypoints in each order will gradually converge, and candidate paths will get closer to each other. At this stage, the information of x q best can be used to fine tune the waypoints and gradually drive the segments to feasibility.</p><p>With this mutation scheme, a new potential waypoint v t j,i is generated by step 12. After that, the crossover scheme is from steps 13-20 with respect to the three coordinates. The evaluation and ranking is at step 21, where the parent waypoint and offspring waypoint are asked to compete for survival. As introduced in Section III-A, the evaluations of the parent and offspring waypoints are in relation to their common previous waypoint x t j,i-1 , and the destination if necessary. The ranking of the parent and its offspring in terms of their evaluation values will be introduced later in this section. At step 24, S i C R and S i F record the value of CR and F of successful reproduction, where the offspring is better than its parent. The update scheme is shown in steps 29 and 30, where mean A (S i C R ) is the ordinary arithmetic mean, and mean L (S i F ) is the Lehmer mean, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">mean L S i F = F ‚ààS i F F 2 F ‚ààS i F F . (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">)</formula><p>Parameter c is used to control the adaptation of Œº i C R and Œº i F . The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> suggest that c works well if it is chosen within the range of [0.05, 0.2]. In this study, we set c as 0.1. After Œº i C R and Œº i F are updated, the parameters CR and F are adaptively generated in step 8, where randn Œº i C R , 0.1 is the Gaussian distribution with mean Œº i C R and standard deviation 0.1. randc Œº i F , 0.1 represents the Cauchy distribution with mean Œº i F and scale parameter 0.1.</p><p>Step 32 indicates that the next generation starts.</p><p>The parent waypoint and new reproduced waypoint are evaluated at step 21. After evaluation, they will compete for survival by comparing their fitness. However, it is not intuitive for such a comparison as each waypoint receives a vector of fitness values rather than a scalar. To deal with this difficulty, most previous works try to combine the fitness vector into a scalar with some weight parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, those weight parameters appear very difficult to fine-tune as different constraints and objectives are in different scales. In this paper, a multicriteria handling method <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> based on the priorities is adopted to select the best waypoint, which has already been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In fact, we have already introduced a priority-based selection scheme in Section II. However, it cannot be adopted here as it is used to select the best path for output rather than a temporarily better waypoint. The first step of the waypoint selection scheme is to place all these eight constraints and objectives in different priority levels, which reflects the human preferences. To be specific, four constraints are placed in the highest level as they must be satisfied. PLR and RKill, which should be first minimized, are placed in the second level, and RRD and FA are placed in the lowest level. Then, a waypoint a is said to dominate waypoint b only if one of the following situations occurs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Representation of Waypoints</head><p>In most existing works, the waypoint is usually represented as a 3-D coordinate within a Cartesian coordinate system or a polar coordinate system in previous works. Recently, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> discussed the shortage of these two coordinate systems, either generating very large search spaces or appearing very difficult for local controls, e.g., mutation and crossover. To solve these problems, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposed a new coordinate system. The new coordinate system (x , y , z ) is actually a rotation of the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z), where its x -axis lies along the horizontal direction from the start to the destination and y remains orthogonal to x -axis, and z -axis stays the same with z-axis. A 2-D illustration of the relation between these two coordinate systems is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. For any waypoint (x i , y i , z i ), i = 1, 2, . . . , N w , in rotated coordinate system, its codification in Cartesian coordinate system (x i , y i , z i ) is mathematically defined as ‚éß ‚é™ ‚é™ ‚é® ‚é™ ‚é™ ‚é©</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">x i = x 1 + cos(œï + œÜ) ‚Ä¢ x 2 i + y 2 i y i = y 1 + sin(œï + œÜ) ‚Ä¢ x 2 i + y 2 i z i = z i (<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>where œï is the angle included by the direction from the start to waypoint and x -axis, and œÜ is the angle between x -axis and x-axis. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, for example, the codifications of the start and destination in the rotated coordinate system are (0, 0, z 1 ) and ( (x N wx 1 ) 2 + (y N wy 1 ) 2 , 0, z N w ), respectively. Within the rotated coordinate system, an external restriction is imposed on the encoded paths. This restriction forces the x coordinates of waypoints along the paths to be monotone increasing. With this restriction, the search space can be significantly reduced. To be specific, as the waypoints along the x -axis will not intersect, the search space can be explicitly equally divided into N w -2 subspaces along the x axis, and within each subspace, the N w -2 corresponding intermediate waypoints will be generated. Consequently, the whole search space has been reduced by (N w -2) N w -2 times. Some other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> have also noticed the advantage of this restriction, and a quite similar rotated coordinate system has been adopted. Although this advantage is attractive, this restriction compromises the flexibility of the planners as the UAV cannot go backwards. In relation to this shortage, the researchers briefly mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> that there are very few cases where a UAV needs to go backwards to bypass the obstacles. In fact, such cases only happen at the beginning of the flight and at the end of the path. The cause of this case is that the angle Œ∑ 1 , included by the x -axis and the line-of-sight (LOS) between the start/destination and the edge of the obstacles, is larger than 90 ‚Ä¢ . From this point of view, we can easily remedy this limitation by artificially inserting an Intermediate Fixed point (IF) somewhere safe so that the new angle Œ∑ 2 at the IF is smaller than 90 ‚Ä¢ , as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. The angle Œ∑ 2 is defined as the included angle between the LOS from the IF to start/destination and the LOS from the IF to the edge of the obstacles. After that, the original path-planning problem can be solved as two subproblems from the start to the IF and from the IF to the destination, as illustrated with the dotted line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. The use of IF is not a new idea as it has been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to control the B-spline curves. The proper location for IF is usually very easy to obtain. Although the artificial insertion slightly decreases the autonomous capacity of the proposed planner, it is still worthwhile, considering its contribution to the reduction of the search space.</p><p>Note that the waypoints are encoded in rotated coordinate system through the whole search process. However, since the new evaluation functions require the Cartesian coordinate encoded waypoints, it is necessary to generate a Cartesian coordinate copy of those waypoints according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> as the inputs of the evaluation phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>Ideally, by evolving waypoints separately, the waypoints with better quality can be better exploited to guide the evolution. To verify its actual ability, the proposed planner is asked to handle different scenarios with increasing obstacles. In each scenario, the proposed planner is compared with seven planners from different viewpoints. The superiorities of the proposed planner over the compared planners are shown based on the effectiveness and efficiency. To test how the evaluation accuracy influences the proposed planner, the impacts of the number of dividing points, i.e., N d , is also analyzed and tested. The sensitive analysis is also given for a proper choice of the only EA-related parameter, i.e., N w . Finally, we clarify that the proposed planner is insensitive to the quality of the initialized solutions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Description of Scenarios</head><p>In the field of path planning for UAVs, there are no widely accepted benchmark problems. Hence, we have designed five scenarios with different numbers of obstacles for the simulation. Specifically, the scenarios consist of three key components, i.e., terrain, obstacles, and the start as well as the destination. The terrain here is represented as the landscape of a variant of the well-known Foxhole Shekel optimization problem (seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>), formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">h (x) = 30 i=1 0.1 2 j =1 (x j -a ij ) 2 + c i (26)</formula><p>where parameters a and c are employed to vary the landscape. The reason of adopting this terrain is that the landscape appears very rugged, and the local optima can be imaged as "mountains" in real life, which is similar to the real terrain. The mission space is limited within the space of [0, 10] √ó [0, 10] √ó [0, <ref type="bibr">1.5]</ref>. The obstacles are the zones that are dangerous and even prohibited for the UAV to fly through. In our scenarios, the obstacles are depicted as the range of hostile missiles and mountains. The number of obstacles is varied by randomly setting the missiles on the ground in the range of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> √ó <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Specifically, the number of missiles in the five scenarios is set as 7, 15, 30, 60, and 120, respectively. For each missile, a coupled radar is set concentric with the missile. The diameters of the range of missiles and radar detections are set 0.5 and 1.5, respectively. The start position of mission is set at (0.5, 0.5, h([0.5, 0.5])), and the destination is set at <ref type="bibr">(9.6, 9.6, h([9.6, 9.6]</ref>)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Compared Algorithms</head><p>In the literature, there are quite a few related works focusing on planning obstacle-free paths. In this simulation, we select three recently proposed EA-based planners as the first group of compared algorithms, denoted as planners A, B, and C, respectively. The aim of this group of comparisons is to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed planner. Planner A <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was based on genetic algorithms (GAs). The candidate paths were first initialized in the Polar coordinate system and then evolved in the Cartesian coordinate system. The evolution was processed by a single-point crossover and Gaussian mutation. The immigrants were also included. Planner B <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> encoded the candidate paths in the rotated coordinate system. Within such a codification, the evolution process was driven by a simple estimation of distribution algorithm, i.e., UMDA c . Besada-Portas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> suggested a set of comparison measures for UAV path planning. By using these measures, a lot of EA-based variants, including GAs, Des, and particle swarm optimizations were compared. Among them, two DE-based approaches, i.e., D14 and D15 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, were found to be the most effective. As D14 and D15 perform generally the same, we thus simply employ D15 as the compared Planner C. Similar to Planner A, Planner C first initializes the candidate paths in the Polar coordinate system and then evolves them in the Cartesian coordinate system. For the reproduction, Planner C randomly selects the base mutation vectors among the solutions of the best Pareto front. All these three planners employ the same selection strategy with the proposed planner.</p><p>Despite the first comparison group, two variants of the proposed planner were also employed as compared planners. The purpose of this comparative study is to show how the proposed separate evolution idea improves the performance of path planning. We denote these two planners as Planner D and Planner E, respectively. Both these two planners use the same selection strategy and EA, i.e., JADE, with the proposed planner. Specifically, Planner D encodes the waypoints in the rotated coordinate system with external restriction as the proposed planner does, while it excludes the proposed separate evolution strategy. Instead, it evolves the whole candidate path as the existing work does. Planner E evolves the waypoints separately as the proposed planner does, but it encodes the waypoints in the ordinary Cartesian coordinate system.</p><p>There are two kinds of parameters for planners, i.e., non-EA-related parameters and EA-related parameters. One typical non-EA-related parameter is the number of waypoints in a path, i.e., N w . In the UAV path-planning problems, a candidate path is usually represented as a sequence of waypoints. This candidate path is, in fact, an approximation to a real flight. From this point of view, more waypoints can keep the candidate path closer to a real flight. However, the search space will be too large and both the effectiveness and efficiency of the planner will fall. To balance this tradeoff, there is no widely acknowledged criterion for choosing an optimal N w . Instead, the existing planners usually select a rather small N w that sufficiently guarantees the feasibility of candidate paths. This idea is also used in this paper to set N w . In our simulation, the increasing obstacles in five scenarios lead to an increasingly narrower and more zigzagged feasible passageway for the UAV. To keep the path sufficiently smooth and safe, N w should be increased for the scenarios with more obstacles. Thus, by testing several different possible values, we find some feasible N w , i.e., N w = 7, 10, 12, 15, and20, for the proposed planner in the corresponding scenarios with 7, 15, 30, 60, and 120 obstacles, respectively. Taking the scenario with seven obstacles as an example, we tested the proposed planner with N w = 4, 7, 10. We found that N w = 4 cannot guarantee good performances of the proposed planner, while N w = 10  requires much more computational time. Hence, we set N w = 7 for that scenario. Generally speaking, some other values of N w can also be used as long as the feasibility of candidate paths and the computational efficiency can be guaranteed.</p><p>Regarding N w , another non-EA-related parameter is N d , i.e., the number of dividing points in each segment. Recall that the purpose of using dividing points is to detect the violations of segments regarding the missiles, radars, and mountains. If the interval between two adjacent dividing points is smaller than the range of missiles, radars, and mountains, the violations of segment are highly possible to be detected. This geometric relation can be depicted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">P L (N w -1) ‚Ä¢ N d &lt; D (<label>27</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">)</formula><p>where PL is the path length, and D is the minimal diameter of the range of missiles, radars, or mountains. The ranges of mountains are usually larger than 0.5, i.e., the diameter of the range of missiles. Hence, we set D = 0.5. The smallest N w , i.e., 7, and the largest feasible path length, which is 1.5 times the distance between start and destination, are also considered. The value 1.5 is the preference of minimal PLR, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, we have N d &gt; 4. Generally, N d reflects the tradeoff between accuracy of evaluations and computational cost. The larger N d is, the higher accuracy of evaluations we can get, while the efficiency will fall. In this simulation, we simply set N d = 6 for all the planners. Furthermore, we also test the proposed planner with N d = 12 and N d = 18 to see how N d influences the planner. The EA-related parameters of planners A and C are those suggested in the original work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the EA-related parameters of planner B, i.e., population size, are problemdependent. For the purpose of unifying the population sizes in different scenarios, they are set as 200 in this paper. The EArelated parameters of planners D and E are set the same with the proposed planner. As all the components of the proposed planner are parameterless, there is actually only one EA-related parameter to be fine-tuned, i.e., the population size N p . After a set of parameter sensitive analyses (which will be discussed later), N p is set to 10. The parameter settings of these eight planners are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, where New 6 , New 12 , and New 18 are the proposed planners with N d = 6, 12, 18, respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performances Measures</head><p>Through the whole simulations, the best path of each planner in each scenario is output when 100 generations run out. All the results are obtained by repeating N r = 25 runs on MATLAB 2012b software on a windows-8 personal computer with i3-2350 @ 2.30-GHz CPU and 2-GB RAM.</p><p>To compare the final outputs, generally, most of the previous works lack statistical analysis. This situation makes the comparison among UAV planners far from rigorous. Fortunately, some researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> have noticed this gap and suggested several metrics for statistical comparison in UAV pathplanning domain. In this paper, we adopt one of them, i.e., the Statistical Front-Dominance Ranking Procedure (SFDRP) metric to measure the ability of the eight planners. SFDRP measures the performances of two planners, for example, planner A and B, to see if they are statistically different by comparing their final outputs in terms of corresponding objectives and constraints. The term (‚ô¶</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">B 1 :N r A l</formula><p>) counts the numbers of the best path of the lth run obtained by planner A is dominated by each of the N r best paths obtained by planner B and vice versa (‚ô¶</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">A 1 :N r B l ). Specifically, ‚ô¶ B 1 :N r A l = m =1:N r I c (A l ‚â∫ B m ) and ‚ô¶ A 1 :N r B l = m =1:N r I c (B l ‚â∫ A m )</formula><p>, where I c (‚Ä¢) is the indicator function that returns 1 if the input condition is true and 0 otherwise, and A ‚â∫ B means B dominates A. Then, the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test is applied to the vectors [‚ô¶</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">B 1 :N r A 1 + 1, ‚ô¶ B 1 :N r A 2 + 1, . . . , ‚ô¶ B 1 :N r A N r + 1] and [‚ô¶ A 1 :N r B 1 + 1, ‚ô¶ A 1 :N r B 2 + 1, . . . , ‚ô¶ A 1 :N r B N r + 1].</formula><p>If this test finds a statistically significant difference, the median of each vector can be used to infer which planner dominates the other one. To illustrate the results of the statistical test, Besada-Portas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> suggests a type of graphic presentation (as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>). In each cell of each graphic, we represent when a planner in the Y-axis is better (less dominated, in white), equivalent (not statistically different, in gray), or worse (more dominated, in black) than a planner in the X-axis.</p><p>Despite the statistical analysis of the outputs, we have also constructed the comparisons on the average of the convergence speed and elapse time of each planner. Briefly, we first calculate the generation when all the constraints are satisfied, denoted as G c , the generation when RKill and PLR are satisfied, denoted as G s , and the generation when RRD and FA are satisfied, denoted as G t . And the elapse time ET of each planner in each run is noted. Next, we average each metric above with respect to those runs where the corresponding indices are satisfied, denoted as G c , G s , G t , and ET , respectively. If the objectives/constraints of any planner have never been satisfied through all 25 runs, the corresponding G c / G s / G t will be noted as N/A. Finally, the number of successful runs out of the total 25 runs is also calculated, denoted as SR. Generally, a constraint or an objective is said to be satisfied if its value is less than its preference. If all constraints and objectives are satisfied, it is said to be a successful run. The preferences are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>. As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>, no constraint violation is allowed. The PLR should be less than 1.5, as we have introduced it earlier. The preference of RKill is set to be 0 so that no risk of kill is permitted. That is, the zones within the range of hostile missiles are actually obstacles that are prohibited to fly through. The UAV should fly no higher than 0.5 above the terrain. Since the diameter of range of missiles is also 0.5, the preference of FA in fact prevents the UAV from flying above the missiles. Consequently, the UAV can only bypass the obstacle from its flank. The preference of RRD should be related to the scale of the intensity of the radars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Results and Analyses</head><p>First, the results of all the 25 runs of those eight planners in each scenario have been statistically analyzed. Those results are shown by means of graphic representations in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>. Among all the planners, New 6 , New 12 , and New 18 perform the best when the number of obstacles increases. Within these three new planners, New 6 has slightly better results. However, we cannot claim any superiority of N d = 6 over N d = 12 and N d = 18 as they have different evaluation accuracy. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the DE-based planner (Planner C) is reported to be empirically better than the GA-based planner (e.g., Planner A). The coincident results can be observed in our experimental studies [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(a)-(c)</ref>]. Notice that, when the obstacles increase, both planners A and C get stuck [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(d)-(e)</ref>]. This means both of them cannot handle the scenarios with lots of obstacles. Nevertheless, planners A and C have been shown superior to the other compared planners, except the three proposed ones (in fact, Planner C performs the best among all planners in the scenario with seven obstacles). The advantages of planners A and C over those compared algorithms can be partly owe to the use of the Polar Coordinate System, which has been acknowledged to be able to reduce the search space. Therefore, it can be inferred that the choice of the encoded coordinate system has an important impact on the planners, especially when there are large numbers of obstacles. A similar conclusion can be obtained by comparing New 6 and Planner E. The only difference between these two planners is the coordinate systems that were used. Apparently, New 6 outperforms Planner E in all scenarios. In terms of this pair of comparisons, the advantage of New 6 can be attributed to the rotated coordinate system as it can significantly reduce the search space. Note that the superiority of New 6 is not only based on the rotated coordinate system used. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>, Planner E performs significantly better than Planner D in the latter four scenarios. As the basis planners of New 6 , the performances of Planners D and E reflect the real contributions of the rotated coordinate system and separate evolution to New 6 . From the results, it can be inferred that the rotated coordinate system   contributes less, compared with the proposed idea of separate evolution.</p><p>Besides statistical analyses, the convergence speed, runtime, and successful rate of the eight planners are listed in Tables IV-VIII. Planner New 6 , Planner D, and Planner E consume the least ET due to the small population size, i.e., N p = 10. New 12 and New 18 also have the same population size, while they are more computationally expensive. This is because they evaluate more dividing points for each segment, which elevates the evaluation accuracy while compromising the efficiency. Planners A, B, and C spend much more computational time than the others due to the larger population sizes. However, those larger population sizes cannot remain effective in scenarios involving lots of obstacles due to their poor exploitation of high-quality waypoints. Planners A and C have the ability to generate paths satisfying all four constraints rapidly in all scenarios. This is because the polar coordinate system essentially restricts the turning angle As a result, New 6 maintains high stability on both efficiency and effectiveness in all scenarios. On one hand, its ET is acceptable and its convergence speed is very fast. Note that the ET is the total runtime for 100 generations. Thus, it is easy to see that New 6 spends the least runtime to obtain a feasible solution by calculating G t √ó E T 100 . On the other hand, New 6 keeps very high SR for all scenarios and is statistically the best.</p><p>As analyzed above, New 12 and New 18 also have very good final outputs. It is difficult to tell how N d impacts the proposed planner by statistical analyses. In other words, the evaluation of candidate paths is essentially related to N d . To illustrate the impacts of N d , the best paths, out of 25 runs, of New 6 , New 12 , and New 18 in the five scenarios are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>(a)-(e) in a 2-D view, respectively. In these figures, the ranges of missiles and radars are represented by groups of concentric circles. With the preferences in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>, the paths are forbidden to go through the smaller circles and are better to be out of the bigger circles. The terrain is depicted in color contour lines where higher places are darker. The paths of New 6 , New 12 , and New 18 are presented as star-lines, diamond-lines, and circle-lines, respectively. The stars, diamonds, and circles are the corresponding waypoints. As can be seen, the best paths always remain smooth and avoid all the obstacles, i.e., missiles and mountains, in all scenarios. No significant differences between the best paths of three planners can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>, which implies that N d = 6 is sufficient for planners to detect the radars, missiles, and mountains. In particular, one interesting phenomenon is that the paths of the three planners get closer when obstacles increase. This is because the increasing obstacles reduce the feasible space, and thus, the effective planners have fewer choices for producing feasible paths.</p><p>Despite the use of the polar coordinate system, the superiority of Planners A and C to Planners D and E may also be due to the use of larger population sizes. To verify this viewpoint, we have made another comparison among Planners A, D, and E with the same population size, i.e., N p = 30. As the purpose of this comparison is to show whether or not a larger population size will influence the performances of Planners D and E, we simply give just one example on the scenario with 30 obstacles for Besides the comparisons among planners, we also carry out a parameter-sensitive analysis of the new proposed planners. As most planners employ six dividing points, we thus analyze the parameter sensitivity based on New 6 . There is only one parameter, i.e., N p , that needs to be carefully fine-tuned. To determine a proper N p , the performances of G t , ET , and SR of New 6 with different values of N p , i.e., 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, on the five scenarios are recorded and shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10(a)-(c</ref>). The reason for testing these three metrics is that G t indicates the generation when the path has satisfied all objectives and constraints, i.e., the convergence speed, ET presents the real running time, while SR reflects the stability of the planner. And the reason for testing such small population sizes is because we believe the separately evolving strategy has very effectively exploited the better waypoints during optimization, and thus, the population can be reduced. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10(a)-(c)</ref>, in each scenario, as N p increases, G t remains generally the same, and SR increases. However, ET also generally increases, which means that higher computation times will be required to produce relatively good outputs. These results show that such a small N p appears very sensitive; hence, we need to determine a proper N p . To balance the tradeoff between the effectiveness and efficiency, we suggest N p = 10.</p><p>In the above analyses, the advantages of the proposed idea of separate evolution have been discussed. It is shown that the proposed planner is more effective and efficient than the compared planners. Besides, it is also shown that the separate evolution makes the proposed planner more stable than the compared planners. This stability results from the fact that the separate evolution is insensitive to the quality of the initialized solutions. To illustrate this viewpoint, the process of Planner E on the first scenario is recorded. The reason for choosing Planner E instead of New 6 is to eliminate the influence of the rotated coordinate system. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>, the initialized waypoints are scattered in the mission space, and the candidate paths are far from feasible. Under the impact of the separate evolution, waypoints in each order will finally converge to a rather good state, respectively. This is because, for all the ith waypoints, there will be one or several optimal locations in terms of the global information of all the other waypoints. The process of the separate evolution can be regarded as a subproblem, which consists of finding the optimal solution for the ith waypoint of a path, regarding all the ith waypoints as the candidate population. From this point of view, the separate evolution can have a better ability of convergence and thus is insensitive to the quality of the initialized population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>Path-planning techniques are very important to the autonomy of UAVs. This paper presents an EA-based UAV path planner based on a novel separate evolution strategy. This strategy is inspired by the problem nature of the UAVs path planning, i.e., most of the objective functions and constraints are separable on waypoints. Based on this inspiration, eight commonly used constraints and objective functions are decomposed, and the waypoints of candidate paths are separately evaluated and evolved. In order to further improve the performance of the proposed planner, the waypoints are encoded in a rotated coordinate system with an external restriction. Comparative studies on five scenarios with increasing numbers of obstacles show that the proposed approach outperforms three state-of-the-art EA-based planners. Particularly, advantages of the proposed planner get more significant as the number of obstacles increases.</p><p>Generally speaking, the idea of separate evolution requires the criteria functions to be separable on waypoints. Fortunately, many criteria for UAVs path planning are separable on waypoints. The reason is that planning collision-free paths for UAVs actually works at the geometric level (if the dynamic of actuators are not taken into consideration), where most of our concerns (criteria) are the points, segments, and angles. These geometric relations are all separable on waypoints. From this perspective, we believe that the proposed separate evolution idea can be applied to many EA-based UAV path planners. Further, it may also be adopted in the EA-based planners for the general motion planning problems, which to some extent may also be viewed as geometric planning given the similarity between UAV path planning and the general motion planning.</p><p>Although the advantages of the new proposed planner have been shown, the EA-based offline planners still need to be further studied. For example, our work has to predefine the number of waypoints, i.e., N w , which is still difficult for a UAV to decide on-the-fly. Hence, a strategy that can autonomously choose the number of waypoints for UAV needs to be studied. Furthermore, as the online planning and cooperative planning are based on offline planning, we may further extend our work to those two problems as they are more practical in real-life missions. As a matter of fact, the path planning for single UAV is usually regarded as the cornerstone of cooperative path planning for multiple UAVs. The cooperation constraints, e.g., time cooperation, distance cooperation, are usually independent of the other objectives and constraints. Hence, ideally, we can extend our proposed planner to a cooperative planner by introducing external cooperation constraints as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> does.</p><p>Last but not least, the theoretic guarantees of the EA-based path planners are still in a lack. We hope some theoretic analyses can be made based on this work in the future, such as the probability of producing a satisfactory path.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

As can be seen, when N p increases from 10 to 30, the SR of Planner E improves significantly from 20% to 96%, which means Planner E 30 is more stable than Planner A. Hence, it verifies the point that it is the larger population size that makes Planner A outperform the original Planner E. For Planner D, although Planner D 30 is slightly better than Planner D, it seems that the population size N p = 30 is still not enough for a remarkable promotion. It can be observed that, due to the effective exploitation of waypoints, Planner E 30 benefits much more than Planner D 30 from the increased N p . This comparison shows the advantages of the proposed idea of separate evolution. On the other hand, it again verifies that the separate evolution idea contributes more than the rotated coordinate system to the proposed planner.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Planner</cell><cell>G c</cell><cell>G s</cell><cell>G t</cell><cell>E T (s)</cell><cell>S R (%)</cell></row><row><cell>A</cell><cell>8.92</cell><cell>32.40</cell><cell>29.23</cell><cell>664.71</cell><cell>52</cell></row><row><cell>D</cell><cell>80.67</cell><cell>84.75</cell><cell>84.00</cell><cell>238.14</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>D 3 0</cell><cell>75.20</cell><cell>81.57</cell><cell>91.25</cell><cell>777.99</cell><cell>16</cell></row><row><cell>E</cell><cell>57.00</cell><cell>64.80</cell><cell>65.00</cell><cell>247.90</cell><cell>20</cell></row><row><cell>E 3 0</cell><cell>50.80</cell><cell>59.46</cell><cell>64.46</cell><cell>715.12</cell><cell>96</cell></row><row><cell>illustration.</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
