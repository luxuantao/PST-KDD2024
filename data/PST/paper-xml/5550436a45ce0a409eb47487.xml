<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Small cells overlaid with macrocells can increase the capacity of two-tier cellular wireless networks by offloading traffic from macrocells. To motivate the small cell service providers (SSPs) to open portion of the access opportunities to macro users (i.e., to operate in a hybrid access mode), we design an incentive mechanism in which the macrocell service provider (MSP) could pay to the SSPs. According to the price offered by the MSP, the SSPs decide on the open access ratio, which is the ratio of shared radio resource for macro users and the total amount of radio resource in a small cell. The users in this two-tier network can make service selection decisions dynamically according to the performance satisfaction level and cost, which again depend on the pricing and spectrum sharing between the MSP and SSPs. To model this dynamic interactive decision problem, we propose a hierarchical dynamic game framework. In the lower level, we formulate an evolutionary game to model and analyze the adaptive service selection of users. An evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) is considered to be the solution of this game. In the upper level, the MSP and SSPs sequentially determine the pricing strategy and the open access ratio, respectively, taking into account the distribution of dynamic service selection at the lower-level evolutionary game. A Stackelberg differential game is formulated where the MSP and SSPs act as the leader and followers, respectively. An open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium is considered to be the solution of this game. We also extend the hierarchical dynamic game framework and investigate the impact of information delays on the equilibrium solutions. Numerical results show the effectiveness and advantages of dynamic control of the open access ratio and pricing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE tremendous increase in mobile data traffic and proliferation of bandwidth intensive applications have posed the great challenges in terms of requirements for enhanced coverage, high data rate, and quality of service (QoS) support in cellular wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The advanced transmission and signal processing techniques implemented in the conventional cellular networks may not be sufficient to meet the above requirements. In this context, deployment of low-cost small cells (e.g., microcell, picocell, and femtocell) with small coverage area and low transmission power for efficient frequency reuse and spectrum sharing is a very promising approach. The small cells form the small cell networks (SCNs) overlaid with the macrocell networks and improve the network coverage and capacity.</p><p>Similar to the operations of Wi-Fi networks, the SCNs can be deployed and operated either by the service providers (i.e., small cell service providers [SSPs] 1 ) in the commercial areas (e.g., airports and shopping malls), or they can be deployed by the users in their homes. The SCNs can operate in the hybrid access mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In this mode, the SSPs reserve part of the radio resources for a closed subscriber group, while the rest of the resources can be available to macro users subscribed to a macrocell service provider (MSP). We assume that the MSP and SSPs use non-overlapping spectrum bands (and hence there is no cochannel interference). If this hybrid access is viewed as a cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> between the SSPs and the MSP, two questions arise. Firstly, what is the incentive for an SSP to share its radio resources (e.g., spectrum bandwidth) with macro users? Secondly, how to determine the open access ratio (i.e., the ratio between the amount of spectrum to be used for macro users and the total available spectrum in a small cell)? We address these questions by devising an appropriate incentive mechanism. Specifically, the MSP could pay a certain price to the SSPs for the services opened by the SSPs. Nevertheless, MSP and SSPs optimize the price and the open access ratio, respectively, to maximize their own benefits (i.e., payoffs).</p><p>The problem is more challenging when the dynamic service selection of users is taken into account. Specifically, the users can select the service either from the MSP or from 1. We assume that the SCNs and the macrocell networks are not operated by the same provider. In practice, the low deployment cost is attractive for virtual mobile network operators to act as the SSPs.</p><p>different SSPs. The service selection strategy can be dynamically changed according to the time-varying performance satisfaction level and cost. Therefore, the number of subscribers of a service provider is dynamic. In this case, the MSP and SSPs need to dynamically adjust the price and open access ratio, respectively, to match the time-varying demand of the users.</p><p>To model and analyze the dynamics of interactive decision making for pricing, spectrum sharing (i.e., open access ratio), and service selection, we propose a hierarchical dynamic game framework. This framework consists of the following components:</p><p>• In the lower level, the dynamic service selection of users is formulated as an evolutionary game <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We model the strategy learning and adaptation of users' service selection by using replicator dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. We consider an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) to be the solution of this game.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>In the upper level, the MSP and SSPs sequentially determine the optimal pricing strategy and open access ratio, respectively, based on a Stackelberg game, taking into account the dynamic service selection from the lower-level evolutionary game. Different from the traditional Stackelberg game models in the existing literature in which the strategies of the players are static, we formulate a Stackelberg differential game to enable the dynamic control of these strategies. We consider an open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium to be the solution of this game. Furthermore, due to the limited capacity of the backhaul connections among small cells, the evolution of service selection state and the dynamic control strategies could be delayed. Therefore, we extend the game framework to analyze the impact of information delay. In this case, we present a delayed replicator dynamics for the evolutionary game in the lower level and a delayed Stackelberg differential game in the upper level.</p><p>The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• We propose a hierarchical (i.e., two-level) dynamic game framework based on differential game theory and evolutionary game theory to investigate the incentive mechanism for spectrum sharing between small cells (i.e., SSPs) and macrocell (i.e., MSP). Unlike the traditional static game models in the existing literature, the proposed framework considers dynamic (i.e., time-dependent) behavior of the providers' strategies and users' decisions and also accounts for information delay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>We show the advantages of dynamic strategies (i.e., dynamic pricing and dynamic open access ratio) over static strategies in terms of higher payoff for providers and faster convergence speed of service selection in the lower-level game.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>We show that the replicator dynamics of the lowerlevel evolutionary game for service selection globally converges to the ESS even with small delays in the population state. Also, the stability region of the dynamics against delay is derived.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>We extend the proposed game framework to analyze the impact of information delay on the equilibrium solutions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the system model and the proposed dynamic game framework. The dynamic service selection of users is formulated as an evolutionary game in Section 3. In Section 4, the sequential decision making of pricing and open access ratio is formulated as a Stackelberg differential game. In Section 5, a delayed Stackelberg differential game is analyzed considering the delays in population state and control strategies. Numerical results and analysis are presented in Section 6. The related literature is reviewed in Section 7. Section 8 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">SYSTEM MODEL AND THE GAME FRAMEWORK 2.1 System Model</head><p>We consider K small cell service providers (SSPs) overlaid with one macrocell service provider (MSP) providing services to N users 2 in a particular area 3 of a two-tier cellular network. Denote by K = {1, 2, . . . , K} the set of SSPs.</p><p>Orthogonal radio resources are allocated to marcocell and small cell users <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Therefore, the cross-tier and co-tier interference are completely eliminated. A hybrid access is applied to SSPs which allows the macro users to use part of the small cell resources. The MSP pays the SSPs for the shared resource with uniform price p (in $ per unit spectrum per unit time). This p can be viewed as a function of time and can be denoted as p(t). Once announced by the MSP, this p(t) can be observed by all the SSPs (i.e., the same for all the SSPs).</p><p>The available spectrum bandwidth of SSP i and the MSP are B i Hz and B m Hz, respectively. Considering the price p announced by the MSP and the need for satisfying the resource demand from its own closed subscriber group (CSG), SSP i will determine the optimal bandwidth partition (B s i , B m i ), where B s i is the bandwidth reserved for CSG of SSP i, and B m i = B i -B s i is the bandwidth available for access by macro users. For simplicity, we denote by r i = B m i /B i as the open access ratio, which is the fraction of bandwidth allocated for open access. Apparently, when r i = 1 and r i = 0, the SSP i serves only macro users and only small cell users, respectively. Similar to p(t), we use r i (t) to capture the dynamic variation of r i . Given the open access ratio r i (t), the MSP needs to pay p(t)B i r i (t) to SSP i.</p><p>In the service area with K SSPs and one MSP, the users can select and switch among different providers independently and dynamically according to the perceived instantaneous utility which depends on the price and the achieved throughput. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> discusses the feasibility of users' switching operation in a fine time scale. Denote by p i and p m the prices charged by SSP i and the MSP, respectively (i.e., fixed access fee in $ per user per unit of time). For simplicity, in this paper, we assume that all providers only provide 2. We consider N to be the mean number of users in a certain area. Also, we do not distinguish between macro users and small cell users explicitly.</p><p>3. This area could be the aggregation of multiple overlapped areas of small cells and marcocells deployed by different SSPs and the MSP. one type of service. Note that multiple service classes could be supported using Paris metro pricing (PMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> which differentiates services by charging different prices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Transmission and Channel Model</head><p>We consider a channel model similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Specifically, the channel between each base station (BS) and its associated users is composed of a fixed distancedependent path-loss, a slowly varying component modeled by lognormal shadowing, and Rayleigh fast fading with unit average power. We assume that the adaptive multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) is used and there is no power control. Each BS assigns rate adaptively according to the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) per user. Let G denote the gap between the Shannon capacity and the achievable rate with M-QAM transmission. Using adaptive modulation with L discrete rates, if the instantaneous SNR lies in [ l , l+1 ), the instantaneous rate in a subchannel with bandwidth of W Hz can be expressed as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">b l = W log 2 1 + l G , if SNR ∈ [ l , l+1 ), 1 ≤ l ≤ L.</formula><p>Assuming identical statistics over all frequency subchannels, the long-term expected throughput (in b/s/Hz) is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">η = L-1 l=1 l × Pr[ l ≤ SNR &lt; l+1 ] + L × Pr[SNR ≥ L ] .</formula><p>[7] derived this long term throughput theoretically. For resource allocation among users, we assume that both the SSPs and MSP schedule their users in a round robin (RR) or channel aware proportional fair (PF) manner. Note that the RR and PF scheduling algorithms were considered in small cells in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, respectively. In this case, we can assume that all the users subscribed to the same service provider share the long-term expected throughput equally which is straightforward for the RR scheduling algorithm. For PF scheduling, this assumption is also reasonable when mobility is considered which ensures that all the users in the same subscriber group receive an identical long-term average SNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. η i and η m denote the throughput for SSP i and the MSP, respectively. Therefore, the expected effective throughput for the user subscribing to SSP i and the MSP can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">τ i = B i (1 -r i )η i n i , τ m = B m η m + K i=1 B i r i η i n m ,</formula><p>where i ∈ K, n i and n m represent the numbers of users subscribed to SSP i and the MSP, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">A Hierarchical Dynamic Game Framework</head><p>The proposed hierarchical dynamic game framework is composed of two levels: a lower-level evolutionary game for modeling the dynamic service selection behavior of users, and an upper-level Stackelberg differential game for dynamic pricing of the MSP and optimization of dynamic open access ratios by the SSPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Note that the upper-level Stackelberg differential game itself also has a hierarchical structure (i.e., the MSP is the leader and the SSPs are the followers).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Lower-Level Evolutionary Game</head><p>The users could make the service selection decision dynamically according to the access price and received throughput. The received throughput is time-varying which depends on both the dynamic open access ratio controlled by the SSPs and the number of users subscribed to the same provider. Without complete information, all users gradually learn during the strategy adaptation process. The evolutionary game with users having bounded-rationality is a suitable tool for modeling this learning process. With an evolutionary game model using replicator dynamics, at the equilibrium, all the users in the same population receive the same individual utility as the average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Upper-Level Stackelberg Differential Game</head><p>For motivating the SSPs to open their services, the MSP pays for the services with price p(t). The MSP dynamically adjusts this price to influence the open access ratio according to dynamic traffic demand. Given the dynamic price, the SSPs dynamically control the open access ratio to maximize their own payoffs. We use a noncooperative Stackelberg differential game to analyze the dynamic pricing of MSP and dynamic spectrum sharing of SSPs. The main motivation behind using a differential game is that the upper-level players (i.e., the MSP and SSPs) need to make the optimal decision dynamically according to the time-varying service selection distribution of the lower-level users, while conventional noncooperative game theory can be used mostly for static analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Link Between the Two Levels</head><p>In the proposed two-level dynamic game framework, the population state of the lower-level evolutionary game is also the state of the upper-level differential game. This state establishes the link between the two levels. On one hand, the evolution of a population state of the evolutionary game is governed by the strategies of the upper-level players.</p><p>On the other hand, in the upper-level differential game, the optimization of payoff functions of the players needs to take this state evolution into account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">FORMULATION OF THE EVOLUTIONARY GAME</head><p>The users with bounded-rationality compete for the spectrum resource by selecting different candidate service providers. Initially, all users choose one of the providers randomly. To obtain a better payoff, each user can adapt the service selection decision periodically according to the price and the time-varying observed service quality which depends on both the size of available spectrum and the current congestion condition. Due to the lack of complete information, a user could gradually learn by imitating the strategies with higher payoff during the strategy adaptation process.</p><p>In this section, we first describe the game formulation for evolutionary service selection. Then we introduce an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> as the solution of this evolutionary game. The replicator dynamics is used to model the strategy adaptation process. Although, in general, an evolutionary equilibrium (EE) obtained from the replicator dynamics may not be an ESS <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we establish the connection between the EE and ESS in our model. Furthermore, we show the global asymptotic stability of the obtained ESS. We also investigate the effect of population information delay on the replicator dynamics and derive the stability region versus delay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Game Formulation</head><p>We formulate the service selection competition among users as an evolutionary game as follows:</p><p>• Players: The set of users N = {1, 2, . . . , N} in the service area are the players of the game.</p><p>• Strategy: The strategy of each player (i.e., user) is the selection of a service provider. Accordingly, the strategy set can be denoted as S = {1, 2, . . . , K} ∪ {m} which corresponds to the selection of K SSPs and the MSP.</p><p>• Population: In the context of the evolutionary game, the set of users N which have the same strategy set S also constitute the population. 4   • Population share: Denote by n i the number of users selecting strategy i ∈ S (i.e., the number of subscribers of provider i). Then x i = n i /N is the population share of provider i, where x i ∈ [0, 1].</p><p>• Population state: The population shares of all providers constitute the population state denoted by 4. If we consider service differentiation, the users can be grouped into different populations and the members of the same population have the same characteristics. Without loss of generality, we focus on the analysis of one population and the same analysis can be applied to multiple populations as well.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a vector x = x 1 • • • x i • • • x K x m T ∈ X, where X</formula><p>is the state space which contains all possible population distributions. We have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">|S| i=1 x i = 1, where |S| = K + 1.</formula><p>• Payoff: The expected payoff of a player choosing a certain service selection strategy is the utility. The utility quantifies the service satisfaction level of a user which depends on the achieved throughput and the cost. Specifically, we consider rate utility per unit price to be the payoff function. Denote by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r = r 1 • • • r i • • • r K T</formula><p>the vector of open access ratios of SSPs. In this case, the payoff function for the user selecting provider i given population state x is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">π(i, x, r) = (τ i (x, r))/p i ,</formula><p>where (τ i (x, r)) is the rate utility for which we consider a linear function</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(τ i (x, r)) = ατ i (x, r),</formula><p>where α is a constant. 5 We can see that the payoff depends on all users' service selection strategies in terms of population state as well as the strategies of the providers. Note that the pricing strategy of the MSP has an indirect impact on this payoff by influencing the open access ratios adopted by the SSPs and is not explicitly shown in the payoff function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evolutionary Stable Strategy</head><p>The ESS can be viewed as a steady state strategy that can be reached by a population via evolutionary processes in which more successful strategies spread over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Once the ESS is reached, the population shares will not change.</p><p>With π(i, x, r) being the expected payoff of players using pure strategy i given the current population state x and spectrum sharing strategies r, the average payoff of the population can be derived as π(x, x, r) = |S| i=1 x i π(i, x, r). Now suppose there is a small portion of players switching to a different mixed strategy y = x. This portion of players is viewed as mutants of the population, the size of which can be denoted by a normalized value ε ∈ (0, 1). Then the population state after mutation is (1 -ε)x + εy. With the above notations, we have the definition of an ESS as follows: Definition 1. A strategy x * is an ESS, if for any y = x, there exists some ε y ∈ (0, 1) such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε y ), the following inequality holds</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">π(x, (1 -ε)x + εy, r) &gt; π(y, (1 -ε)x + εy, r),</formula><p>where π(x, (1 -ε)x + εy, r) and π(y, (1 -ε)x + εy, r) are the expected payoffs of nonmutants and mutants, respectively. The ε y can be viewed as an invasion barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> which represents the maximum proportion of users using mutant strategies that can be resisted by the ESS. The larger the ε y , the more robust the ESS is.</p><p>An ESS is also a Nash equilibrium since the ESS is the best response to itself. Furthermore, the evolutionary stability of the ESS provides a strong refinement of the NE. Compared with the NE in which a single user will not benefit by deviating from the equilibrium strategy, the ESS can avoid the deviation behavior of a small group of players.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evolutionary Dynamics of Strategy Adaptation for Service Selection</head><p>In the context of an evolutionary game, each user will adapt the service selection strategy according to its received payoff. In this case, the strategy with a higher payoff (e.g., choosing a provider with larger bandwidth or less number of subscribed users) than the average payoff can be learned and replicated by other users. This is referred to as the evolution of the service selection game during which the strategy adaptation of users will change the population share and therefore the population state will evolve over time. In this case, the population share x i and population state x are functions of time t denoted as x i (t) and x(t), respectively. The strategy adaptation process and the corresponding population state evolution can be modeled and analyzed by replicator dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ẋi (t) = δx i (t) [π(i, x(t), r(t)) -π(x(t), x(t), r(t))] ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with initial population state x(0) = x 0 ∈ X, for all i ∈ S, where δ is the learning rate of the population which controls the frequency of strategy adaptation for service selection.</p><p>According to the replicator dynamics, the number of users selecting provider i will increase if the corresponding payoff is higher than the average payoff (i.e., π(i, x(t), r(t)) &gt; π(x(t), x(t), r(t))). The growth rate ẋi (t) is proportional to the difference between the payoff for that selection strategy and the population's average payoff as well as the current size of population share x i (t).</p><p>The details of the implementation of an algorithm for strategy adaptation motivated by reverse engineering of replicator dynamics can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Note that with this algorithm, only basic calculations are needed for users at each service selection decision epoch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Existence and Uniqueness of Solution Under Control</head><p>Since we consider the cyclic dependence of a service selection decision of users and the spectrum sharing control of providers, the evolution of a population state described by the replicator dynamics is governed by the controls of the providers (i.e., pricing by the MSP and open access ratios adopted by the SSPs). The following theorem discusses existence and uniqueness of the solution under these controls.</p><p>Theorem 1. For the dynamical system defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with initial condition x(0) = x 0 , if r(t) is a vector of measurable functions on [0, ∞), then there exists a unique solution x(t) defined for all t ∈ [0, ∞).</p><p>Proof. Denote by f i (x(t), r(t)) the right hand side of (1). For fixed t, the partial derivative of f i (x(t), r(t)) with respect to x(t) is continuous, and if r(t) is measurable on [0, ∞), then f i (x(t), r(t)) is measurable for fixed x i (t) on the same interval. Moreover, for any given closed bounded set ∈ X and interval [a, b] ∈ [0, ∞), there always exists a positive number q to construct an integrable function <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">q i (t) = δα B i (1 -r i (t))η i Np i + q |D| ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">D = δα B m η m + K i=1 B i r i η i Np m + K i=1 B i (1 -r i (t))η i Np i , (2) such that |f i (x(t), r(t))| ≤ q i (t) and ∂f i (x(t), r(t))/∂x i (t) ≤ q i (t) for all (x, t) ∈ × [a, b].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Delay in Replicator Dynamics</head><p>In the evolutionary service selection game, the payoff of a user at a particular time depends on the service selection strategies of all users in the population (i.e., the population state) at that time. However, in practice, the information about the population could be delayed due to communication latency. Therefore, there is a gap between the time that a population state arises and the time that the population state impacts the payoff of users. Let ς denote the population information delay. Then the service selection decisions of users at time t are made according to the population state at t -ς. This delay has an impact on the strategy adaptation process (i.e., replicator dynamics). Specifically, the rate of variation of population share adopting a particular strategy is proportional to the difference between the delayed payoff for that strategy and the delayed average payoff of the population. In this case, the delayed replicator dynamics for the service selection can be expressed as a set of delayed differential equations as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ẋi (t) =δx i (t -ς) [π(i, x(t -ς), r(t)) -π(x(t -ς), x(t -ς), r(t))] .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DYNAMIC PRICING AND DYNAMIC SPECTRUM SHARING</head><p>The MSP and SSPs need to make the optimal decisions on pricing and open access ratio considering the dynamic service selection of users. For the MSP, increasing the price could incentivize the SSPs to increase the open access ratio. As a result, the quality of the service offered by the MSP improves and the MSP is able to accept more users. However, the total cost also increases which may result in a reduced total profit of the MSP. For the SSPs, increasing the open access ratio could bring more profits. However, the reduced amount of radio resources for the closed access users may stimulate the subscribed users to switch to other providers. To analyze this dynamic interactive decision making problem, we formulate a Stackelberg differential game in which the MSP and SSPs are the leader and followers, respectively. This is the upper-level dynamic game in the proposed two-level dynamic game framework.</p><p>In this section, we will first give the formulation of the Stackelberg differential game. Then an open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium will be derived as the solution.</p><p>The Stackelberg differential game model considering delays in state and strategies will be introduced in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Formulation of Stackelberg Differential Game</head><p>The players of the Stackelberg differential game are the K SSPs and the MSP. The MSP first announces the price according to which the SSPs then decide the open access ratios. In this case, the MSP acts as the leader while the SSPs act as the followers. Different from the bounded rationality assumption for users in the lower-level evolutionary game, the MSP and SSPs are assumed to be rational so that each of them is able to make the best response to others' strategies. In the Stackelberg differential game, both the leader and the followers try to maximize their own payoffs, which are the integration of instantaneous payoffs over the time horizon [0, T ], by controlling their strategies. The strategy of the MSP is the dynamic control of price p(t). The strategy of SSP i is the dynamic control of open access ratio r i (t). These strategies are represented with an open-loop structure. The open-loop strategy spaces of the MSP and SSPs are defined as P = {p(t)|p(t) measurable on [0, T ] and p(t) ≥ 0 for all t ∈ [0, T ]} and R = {r i (t)|r i (t) measurable on [0, T ] and 0 ≤ r i (t) ≤ 1 for all t ∈ [0, T ]}, respectively.</p><p>The MSP (i.e., leader) makes the decision on the price first, and the SSPs (i.e., followers) can observe the decision of the MSP and decide on the best open access ratios (i.e., best responses) accordingly. Although the strategies of the SSPs cannot be observed by the MSP, the MSP tries to make the optimal pricing decision taking into account the expected best responses of the SSPs. The optimal decision making corresponds to the maximization of payoffs by the MSP and SSPs as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Maximization of Payoff of the MSP</head><p>The objective of the MSP can be described both from economic and system performance points of view. Firstly, the MSP aims to maximize profit which is composed of two parts: the revenue from an access fee of subscribed users and the cost incurred for spectrum sharing with the SSPs. Specifically, the profit (i.e., utility) of the MSP can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">U m (p(t), x(t), r(t)) = p m Nx m (t) - K i=1 p(t)B i r i (t).</formula><p>Secondly, the MSP also tries to prevent large disparities between aggregated traffic input flow rate and the system capacity. Specifically, this capacity disparities can be characterized as a performance discrepancy cost function expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">C m (x(t), r(t)) = Nx m (t)ξ -B m η m + K i=1 B i r i (t)η i 2 ,</formula><p>where ξ is a nominal value of the input flow rate for all users. The first term on the right hand side of the cost function represents the aggregate traffic of all subscribed users and the second term represents the total system capacity. In this case, the instantaneous payoff of the MSP can be defined as the difference between the utility and the performance discrepancy cost as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">U m (p(t),x(t), r(t)) = ω u U m (p(t), x(t), r(t)) -ω c C m (x(t), r(t)),</formula><p>where ω u and ω c are positive weighting factors representing relative importance of the payoff components.</p><p>From the payoff function, we can observe that the payoff of the MSP depends on the open access ratios adopted by the SSPs as well as the population state evolved according to the replicator dynamics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In the proposed hierarchical dynamic game framework, the population state x of the lower-level evolutionary game also describes the state of the upper-level Stackelberg differential game. The control strategies of the service providers also influence the evolution of the state. The replicator dynamics in (1) describes how the current state and providers' controls influence the rate of change of the state.</p><p>For the MSP, the maximization of payoff given the control strategies of SSPs becomes an optimal control problem subject to the constraints in population state evolution. With the definition of open-loop strategy, strategy state space, time horizon, and instantaneous payoff, the optimal pricing control problem for the MSP can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">max p(t) U Int m (p(t), x(t), r(t)) = T 0 e -ρt U m (p(t), x(t), r(t))dt, s.t. ẋi (t) = δx i (t) [π(i, x(t), r(t))</formula><p>-π(x(t), x(t), r(t))] ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">x(0) = x 0 , p(t) ∈ P,</formula><p>where ρ is the discount rate influencing the discounted present value of future payoff.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Open-Loop Stackelberg Equilibrium</head><p>For the formulated Stackelberg differential game, an openloop Stackelberg equilibrium is considered to be the solution. Firstly, the optimal control strategies for the MSP and SSPs are defined as follows: To obtain the open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium, the Pontryagin's maximum principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> can be used as the necessary conditions to find the candidate optimal strategies. Then the sufficient conditions are given for proving their optimality. Also, as common in analyzing the equilibrium of a Stackelberg game, backward induction is used. In this case, we first derive the Hamiltonian system of followers (i.e., SSPs) and find the candidate optimal open access ratios given the MSP's strategy. To this end, the present value Hamiltonian function of SSP i can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">H i (r i (t),p(t), x(t), i (t), t) = U i (r i (t), x(t), p(t)) + i (t)ẋ(t)</formula><p>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">where i (t) = λ i1 (t) • • • λ ij (t) • • • λ iK (t), λ im (t)</formula><p>T and λ ij is the costate variable of SSP i associated with state x j .</p><p>With the definition of the Hamiltonian function, the corresponding maximized Hamiltonian function is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">H * i (x(t), i (t), t) = max r i (t) {H i (r i (t), p(t), x(t), i (t), t)|r i (t) ∈ R}.</formula><p>As proven in the optimal control theory, the optimal control strategy of the original problem must also maximize the corresponding Hamiltonian function. Therefore, all candidate optimal strategies have to satisfy the following necessary optimality conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">0 = ∂H i (r i (t), p(t), x(t), i (t), t) ∂r i (t) , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_33">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">λij (t) = ρλ ij (t) - ∂H * i (x(t), i (t), t) ∂x j (t) , (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_35">)</formula><p>where ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">5</ref>) is the adjoint equation to describe the dynamics of a costate variable. In the case that the strategy space R does not depend on the system state x, the maximized Hamiltonian function H * i (x(t), i (t), t) on the right hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">5</ref>) can be replaced by the Hamiltonian function H i (r i (t), p(t), x(t), i (t), t).</p><p>Since the Hamiltonian function for SSP i is strictly concave in the control r i (t), the necessary optimality condition in (4) uniquely determines a candidate optimal control path r * i (t) as a function of the observed MSP pricing strategy p(t), the system state x(t), and the costate i (t). For simplicity of notation, we denote r * i (t) = g i (p(t), x(t), i (t), t). This r * i (t) is the best response of SSP i to the leader's strategy. The MSP makes the optimal decision of pricing taking into account the best responses of all the SSPs.</p><p>Compared with the followers, the Hamiltonian function of the leader in the Stackelberg differential game is more complex since the maximization of payoff of the leader also needs to consider the dynamics of costate variables of all followers (i.e., ˙ = ˙ 1 (t)</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">• • • ˙ i (t) • • • ˙ K (t)</formula><p>T ) as the additional state constraints besides the system state constraints. In this case, similar to the introduction of costate variables for system state in the followers' Hamiltonian functions, both the costate variables for system state and the costate variables for costates of all followers are needed in the Hamiltonian function of the leader. The Hamiltonian function for the MSP is defined as follows:</p><p>H m (p(t), r(t), x(t), m (t), (t), m (t), t)</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">= U m (p(t), x(t), r(t)) + m (t)ẋ(t) + K i=1 θ i (t) ˙ i (t),</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">m (t) = θ 1 (t) • • • θ i (t) • • • θ K (t) T is a matrix for costates with θ i (t) = θ i1 (t) • • • θ ij (t) • • • θ iK (t) for all i, j ∈ K.</formula><p>Similarly, the necessary optimality conditions for the MSP can be derived as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_39">0 = ∂H m (p(t),</formula><p>In a similar way, due to the concavity of Hamiltonian function with respect to p(t), we can obtain the unique candidate optimal strategy p * (t) for the leader which could be denoted as p * (t) = g m (r * (t), x(t), m (t), (t), (t), t). Substituting r * i (t) into p * (t), we can have a function without explicitly showing any control variables. In this case p * (t) can be denoted as p * (t) = g m (x(t), m (t), (t), (t), t).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Discretization Methods</head><p>In this section, we discuss a discretization method for the adjoint equations (i.e., ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_48">9</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_52">12</ref>)) provided by the necessary optimality conditions in the delayed Stackelberg differential game. In this case, the delayed optimal control problem is transformed into a large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP). For this purpose, we first rewrite the payoff function of SSP i in a Mayer form as U i = u i (x(T )). The transformation from the general form to the Mayer form needs to introduce an additional state variable z i where żi = e -ρt U i r i (t), x(t -ς), p(t -σ m ) . Accordingly, the system state is extended to [x, z i ].</p><p>Euler or Runge-Kutta type integration schemes exist for delayed differential equations. For simplicity, Euler's integration method with step size h is used. This h can be viewed as the unit time of the delay. The time horizon T is discretized into M grid points where M = T /h. With the approximations x(t k ) = x k , p(t k ) = p k , and r(t k ) = r k , the optimal control problem can be transformed into the following large-scale nonlinear programming problem: The Lagrange function for the nonlinear programming problem is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">max u i (x M ), s.t. z k i -z k+1 i + hU i r k i , x k-ς , p k-σ = 0, x k -x k+1 + hf(x k-ς , r k-σ ) = 0, for k ∈ [0, 1, . . . , M -1]. The</formula><formula xml:id="formula_55">L(υ, β, μ) = u i (x M ) + M-1 0 β(x k -x k+1 + hf(x k-ς , r k-σ )) + M-1 0 μ(z k i -z k+1 i + hU i r k i , x k-ς , p k-σ ).</formula><p>The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) necessary optimality conditions for the NLP are given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">∂L(υ, β, μ) ∂x k = 0, ∂L(υ, β, μ) ∂z k = 0, and ∂L(υ, β, μ) ∂r k = 0.</formula><p>In a similar way, the optimal control of the MSP can also be transformed into a large-scale nonlinear program. Numerical methods can be used to solve the above nonlinear programming problem. In this case, optimal pricing and open access ratios, which constitute the Stackelberg equilibrium for the delayed Stackelberg differential game, can be obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>For the numerical analysis, we consider a two-tier network with one MSP and two SSPs (i.e., SSP 1 and SSP 2) providing services to 100 users (i.e., N = 100) in a certain geographic area. The available spectrum bandwidth for the MSP and SSPs are assumed to be B m = 20 MHz and B 1 = B 2 = 5 MHz, respectively. The throughput for the macrocell and small cells can be derived for a round robin (RR) scheduler <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> according to which we assume the throughput for the MSP and SSPs to be 1. We first investigate the population state dynamics and service selection evolution trajectory from initial state (i.e., x(0) = [0.3, 0.3, 0.4]) which is subject to the control of service providers' strategies. The dynamic change of population share indicates the service selection adaptation of the users. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, all the population shares converge to the equilibrium state at which no user has the willingness to change her strategy. Although the access price is higher, the number of users subscribing service from the MSP increases from a small initial value to the equilibrium one due to a larger system capacity. In contrast, due to a large initial number of users and limited bandwidth, the small cells operated by the SSPs become congested and some users will churn to other providers. In this case, the population shares of SSPs decrease from the initial distribution to the equilibrium state. The payoff of a user at the ESS under different number of users is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. We observe that when the number of users increases, the payoff of a user will decrease since the number of users sharing the same spectrum resource will increase which results in a decreased amount of allocated resource.</p><p>We also investigate the population state dynamics of multiple SSPs. For example, we consider 6 SSPs which can  be grouped into three sets. Each set has two SSPs with the same parameters (i.e., bandwidth and price). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>, we observe that the population shares of SSPs with the same parameters converge to the same equilibrium from different initial population shares. Also, we observe that the population shares of SSP 5 and SSP 6 are the highest among all SSPs. This indicates that the users prefer to subscribe to providers with lower access price. Note that the number of SSPs also affects the payoffs of the MSP and the SSPs.</p><p>The global asymptotic stability of the ESS can be verified by using a direction field of the replicator dynamics for service selection. We use the evolution of the population share of the MSP as an example. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>, the population share converges from any initial distribution. Viewing a distribution different from the ESS as a mutant, the adaptation process for service selection could eliminate this mutant, which shows the robustness and stability of the ESS.</p><p>The impact of learning rate on the convergence speed of the replicator dynamics is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>. The learning rate represents the frequency of strategy adaptation of the population (e.g., the proportion of users adapting the service selection strategy at each decision epoch) which controls the speed of strategy adaptation. We observe that the convergence speed keeps increasing with increasing learning rate. When all the users are involved in the strategy adaption process (i.e., δ = 1), the convergence speed is the fastest. Throughout the numerical analysis, we use a learning rate δ = 1.  For comparison, we also formulate a static noncooperative Stackelberg game similar to the models proposed in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>) for static pricing and open access ratio optimization in the upper level. This upperlevel static Stackelberg game only considers the equilibrium state of lower-level evolutionary game. A static Stackelberg equilibrium is obtained as the solution. Derivation of this solution for "static" pricing and open access ratio optimization using a backward induction method (which is common for a Stackelberg game) is omitted here for brevity. Also, from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>, we observe that the convergence of replicator dynamics under "static" Stackelberg equilibrium strategies is much slower than that under open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium strategies with the same learning rate. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> shows the impact of population information delay ς on the dynamics of strategy adaptation in the evolutionary game. We observe that when delay occurs (i.e., ς &gt; 0), the trajectory of the dynamics fluctuates. When the delay is small (i.e., ς satisfies the stability condition in Theorem 4), the trajectory can still converge to the equilibrium after fluctuation. However, when the delay is large, the trajectory will fluctuate and the equilibrium will never be reached.   increases the price which gives the motivation for SSPs to increase the open access ratio. The MSP increases the price to have more bandwidth from the SSPs to accommodate the increasing number of users. The impact of delay on the control strategies is also investigated. We observe the fluctuations of the control due to the delay. The larger the delay, the larger the fluctuation is.</p><p>For comparison between the open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium and the static Stackelberg equilibrium, we observe the cumulative payoffs of all providers obtained from the dynamic and static strategies. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">10</ref>, the dynamic strategies yield higher cumulative payoffs for all providers. The reason is that the payoff maximization with dynamic controls considers both the transient period (i.e., the period before reaching the equilibrium) and the equilibrium state (i.e., after reaching the equilibrium) of the underlying evolutionary game. However, static controls in the upper level would only consider the equilibrium state of the lower-level game. Therefore, the dynamic controls have advantages over static controls in terms of higher payoff for players in the upper level and faster convergence speed in the lower level.</p></div>

A tutorial on the mathematical modeling of network selection was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Game theory has also been widely applied for network selection. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, a Bayesian game was used to model the network selection problem in which the users are rational but have only partial information. The strategy evolution with incomplete information was analyzed with Bayesian best response dynamics.

The spectrum allocation in tiered cellular networks was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The impact of access control schemes of the femtocells on the efficiency of joint and disjoint spectrum allocation was investigated considering different femtocell deployment densities.</p><p>A few works also considered the economic issues (e.g., pricing) in small cell networks.

Some state-of-the-art works are introduced below.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the financial impact of deployment of picocell base stations in a macro cell network was investigated. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, the price-based resource allocation strategies in a spectrum sharing femtocell network were analyzed by using Stackelberg game. Specifically, the MBS as the leader prices the transmit power of femtocell users to control their interference power levels at the MBS receiver subject to a maximum tolerable interference margin.

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the user incentives for the adoption of femtocells and their resulting impact on network operator revenues were studied.

Specifically, a Stackelberg game was formulated with the macro service provider as leader making the pricing and spectrum allocation decisions and the users as followers to select the service from macrocell or femtocell.</p><p>Similar incentive mechanisms were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, where Stackelberg games were formulated between an MSP and the femto service providers (FSPs) to solve the problem of optimal spectrum sharing. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, a utility-aware refunding framework was proposed based on Stackelberg game. Specifically, the MSP provides certain refunding to motivate the selfish femtocell holders to share part of their resources to macro users. Femtocell holders allocate their resources among femto and macro users according to the amount of refunding the MSP provides. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the scenario that the FSP does not have its own spectrum is considered. In this case, the FSP can allow hybrid access to motivate the MSP to lease certain amount of spectrum.</p><p>However, none of the existing works in the literature jointly considered the dynamic service selection of users, the dynamic pricing for the MSP, and the dynamic spectrum sharing problem for the SSPs in small cell networks.</p><p>In this paper, the problems of optimizing the open access ratio, spectrum pricing are jointly investigated with a threestage Stackelberg game framework. The novelties of the proposed hierarchical dynamic game framework are three folds. First, we consider dynamic (i.e., time-dependent) strategies for the players in the Stackelberg game. In this case, the stage game in the proposed framework is also a dynamic game (e.g., differential game), while the hierarchical game models in existing literature only considered static stage games which can neither capture the time dependency of strategies nor account for delay. Second, with the proposed dynamic game framework, the optimization of the payoff of service providers considers the transit period (i.e., the period before the game reaches the equilibrium) of the lower-level evolutionary game while most of the existing works only consider the optimization at the equilibrium point. Third, dynamic resource demand from users is analyzed by considering user-controlled dynamic service selection instead of using a demand function for static analysis as is common in most of the existing works.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have presented a hierarchical dynamic game framework to model and analyze the joint cyclic dynamic decision making problems in a two-tier cellular network where multiple small cell service providers (SSPs) compete with a macro service provider (MSP). Specifically, the dynamics of service selection of users is captured by a replicator dynamics in the lower level evolutionary game. An evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) has been obtained as the solution. The pricing issue for the MSP and the optimization of open access ratio for the SSPs have been formulated as a Stackelberg differential game in the upper level. An openloop Stackelberg equilibrium has been obtained as the solution so that the optimal decisions on dynamic pricing and dynamic open access ratios can be determined. Moreover, we have considered the possible delays in state and control strategies. Numerical analysis has been performed and the results have showed the effectiveness and advantages of dynamic controls. Also, the impact of delays on the equilibrium solutions has been investigated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
