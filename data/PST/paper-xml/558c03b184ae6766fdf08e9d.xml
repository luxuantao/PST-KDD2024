<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Vision-based formation control of multiple agents, such as mobile robots or fully autonomous cars, has recently received great interest due to its application in robotic networks and automated highways. This paper addresses the cooperative motion coordination of leader-follower formations of nonholonomic mobile robots, under visibility and communication constraints in known polygonal obstacle environments. We initially consider the case of N = 2 agents moving in L-F fashion and propose a feedback control strategy under which L ensures obstacle avoidance for both robots, while F ensures visibility maintenance with L and intervehicle collision avoidance. The derived algorithms are based on set-theoretic methods to guarantee visibility maintenance, dipolar vector fields to maintain the formation shape, and the consideration of the formation as a tractor-trailer system to ensure obstacle avoidance. We furthermore show how the coordination and control design extends to the case of N &gt; 2 agents, and provide simulation results, which demonstrate the efficacy of the control solutions. The proposed algorithms do not require information exchange among robots, but are instead based on information locally available to each agent. In this way, the desired tasks are executed and achieved in a decentralized manner, with each robot taking care of converging to a desired configuration, while maintaining visibility with its target.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>during the past few years. Research in this area has in part been stimulated by the recent technological advances in communication and computation, which have allowed for the development of multiagent systems that accomplish collaborative tasks in an effective, robust and reliable fashion. Within the field of mobile robotics, L-F formations arise in various applications, from surveillance and monitoring to exploration and coverage. From a practical point of view, the case when robots are subject to limited sensing and communication is of particular interest. For instance, mobile robots operating indoors typically lack access to global positioning measurements, while information exchange is either restricted or obstructed by physical obstacles. Such limitations impose various types of constraints to each robot, which naturally extend to the whole multirobot system. For the desired tasks to be fulfilled, these constraints should be taken into account during the motion planning, coordination, and control design.</p><p>Vision-based sensing and localization have recently become a popular and versatile means of controlling robot formations. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> consider the cooperative formation control of mobile robots and propose switching solutions, which change the formation shape so that obstacle avoidance is achieved. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the authors approach the formation maintenance for nonholonomic mobile robots as a visual servoing task for each one of the followers; the proposed solutions, based on either the concept of Navigation Functions, or on the locally linearized system dynamics, yield leader-to-formation stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Vision-based localization, along with controllers that are based on input-output linearization, for a formation of mobile robots is addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Vision-based controls for similar formation tasks are also proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The common underlying assumption in the aforementioned contributions is that the robots have omnidirectional (or pancontrolled) cameras, and that the linear and angular velocities of l are either communicated to, or estimated by f. However, when communication between robots is absent and/or their onboard sensors have limited capabilities (e.g., limited range and angle of view), then the robots can typically stay connected if and only if L is always visible to F. The latter specification imposes a set of visibility constraints, which should never be violated so that F always maintains visibility with L.</p><p>Formation control under visibility constraints exhibits similarities in terms of problem formulation to the control design for a nonholonomic robot with field-of-view constraints, which needs to maintain visibility with a target, e.g., a fixed landmark or an evader. For the fixed target case, hybrid control strategies are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, whereas optimal paths, which respect the field-of-view constraints are computed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, visibility maintenance for a chain of Dubins-like vehicles is addressed based on the notion of controlled invariance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the authors use a game-theoretic formulation for the problem of tracking an omnidirectional evader with a nonholonomic mobile pursuer of bounded speed. These contributions, albeit significant and elegant, do not consider the presence of physical obstacles.</p><p>Maintaining visibility in polygonal obstacle environments has been mostly addressed with game-theoretic strategies for one pursuer (observer) tracking one evader (target) in an antagonistic fashion (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and the references therein). The corresponding optimal control problems are defined in terms of either the shortest path, or the minimum time, for the evader to escape the visibility region of the observer. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the authors further discuss the applicability of the derived motion strategies in cooperative leader-following scenarios for mobile robots; in these cases, the follower is assumed to have full access on the leader's configuration and velocities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Overview and Organization</head><p>This paper considers the cooperative motion coordination of N ≥ 2 mobile robots with unicycle kinematics in known obstacle environments, using vision-based formation control. This problem is relevant to various multiagent applications, including the exploration and surveillance of cluttered environments with multiple robots of minimal sensing and communication capabilities, as well as the navigation of autonomous vehicle platoons toward fully automated highways.</p><p>The robots are assumed to move in L-F formation under visibility and communication constraints in the following sense. Every robot i (except the leader of the formation) can see at least one other robot j; we refer to a robot j being visible from another robot i as an L-F pair. The onboard sensor systems are of limited range and limited angle of view, defining thus a cone of view for each robot. We assume that robot i is localized with respect to (w.r.t.) robot j if and only if j belongs to the cone of view of i. We also assume that communication among robots for exchanging information is not available. Thus, robots j and i can move as an L-F pair if and only if j is always visible from i, or in other words, if and only if i always maintains visibility with j. The safe and reliable navigation of the robots furthermore dictates that intervehicle collisions and physical obstacles should always be avoided. Consequently, the motion coordination and control problem for the multirobot system reduces into guaranteeing that the objectives of visibility maintenance, collision/obstacle avoidance, and convergence to desired goals are always accomplished.</p><p>To this end, we initially consider N = 2 agents moving as an L-F pair and propose a motion coordination and control strategy, in which L is responsible for ensuring obstacle avoidance for both robots while navigating toward a goal configuration, and F is responsible for ensuring visibility maintenance with L and intervehicle collision avoidance. This strategy can be described as follows.</p><p>1) The first level involves the motion planning and control design for F (see Section III). Inspired by set-theoretic control methods and notions from viability theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for visibility maintenance in obstacle-free environments. We also propose a state feedback control scheme for F, which guarantees visibility maintenance and collision avoidance w.r.t. L, based on dipolar vector fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>2) The second level involves the motion planning and control design for the L-F formation in a known obstacle environment, given a cell decomposition of the free space and a high-level discrete motion plan for L (see Section IV).</p><p>Inspired by the tractor-pulling-trailer paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we propose a hybrid feedback motion plan for L, which guarantees obstacle avoidance for both robots. We furthermore extend this idea and control design to the case of chain formations with N &gt; 2 robots. Our motion coordination and control design is characterized as cooperative, in the sense that the robots are not thought of as antagonistic pairs of one pursuer, one evader, with the latter trying to escape the sensing area of the former, but on the contrary are controlled so that each one always keeps its target visible in its sensing area. The proposed algorithms do not require communication between the robots regarding on their states, but are instead based on information locally available to each agent; only the upper bounds of the velocities of L are assumed to be a priori known to F. In this way, the tasks are executed in a decentralized manner, with each robot taking care of converging to a desired configuration, while maintaining visibility with its target. More specifically, on one hand, F is localized w.r.t. L yet is aware neither of its navigation plan, nor of its velocities at each time instant. On the other hand, L is not aware of the state of F, yet its motion ensures that both robots avoid physical obstacles. The same logic applies also in chain formations of N &gt; 2 agents. The efficacy of our algorithms is demonstrated and evaluated through simulation results in Section V, while Section VI concludes the paper and presents our ideas on future extensions of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contributions</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first contribution addressing the cooperative formation control of multiple robots in obstacle environments under sensing (visibility) and communication constraints, with guaranteed visibility and safety maintenance. The proposed state feedback control strategy ensures the safe navigation of the multirobot formation in known cluttered environments, using minimal vision-based information only and without the need for exchanging or estimating velocities online.</p><p>More specifically, compared with earlier work on visionbased formation control in obstacle environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, our method does not require communication between robots, or state estimation algorithms. Moreover, the onboard cameras are not assumed to be omnidirectional or pan-controlled, but rather fixed and of limited range and field of view. Finally, the consideration of the tractor-trailer paradigm guarantees obstacle avoidance for the formation via a hybrid control strategy for L only, whereas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> the formation switching is based on a coordination protocol involving information on the states of all robots.</p><p>The differences of our approach compared with other visionbased formation control strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> rely on the absence of communication, the consideration of limited field of view, and range constraints, as well as the consideration of physical obstacles. The latter specification is the main difference of this current paper compared with other papers on maintaining visibility problems involving robots with field-of-view constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Finally, compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, here F is not required to have full access on the state vector of L.</p><p>Part of this study has appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The current paper additionally includes 1) the proofs verifying the correctness of our control strategy, which were omitted in the conference paper in the interest of space, and 2) its extension for N &gt; 2 robots, along with illustrative simulation results. Finally, compared with our recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, this paper is different in the following aspects. Here, we consider a multiagent scenario in the presence of physical obstacles, while the problem addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> considers neither multiple robots, nor physical obstacles. Consequently, the current paper differs in the adopted system modeling, considered constraints, and the derived control strategy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Modeling of the Visibility Constraints</head><p>We assume that F is equipped with a fixed onboard camera of limited angle of view 2α &lt; π. Furthermore, we assume that F can reliably detect objects which lie within a limited region w.r.t. the forward-looking direction, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The limited sensing region is modeled as a cone of view for F, which essentially is an isosceles triangle in obstacle-free environments. Finally, we assume that F is localized w.r.t. L, i.e., that the distance r = x 2 + y 2 and the bearing angle φ ∈ [-α, α] are measured. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Consequently, F can detect L if and only if L is in the cone of view, i.e., iff</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">|φ| ≤ α and r ≤ L s cos α cos φ (8)</formula><p>where L s is the length of the equal sides of the cone of view.

The set K includes every configuration q ∈ C for which the visibility is maintained. Controlling F and L so that the resulting trajectories q(t) never escape K, implies that visibility is always maintained.</p><p>Remark 1: Maintaining visibility for the L-F formation described by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) reduces thus into picking control inputs v F = γ F (•) for F, such that the visibility constraints ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) are met ∀t ≥ 0, despite the nonvanishing perturbation g(q, v L ) induced by the control inputs v L = γ L (•) of L.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. VISIBILITY MAINTAINING FORMATION CONTROL</head><p>Let us first consider the system (7) for L moving with some u L = 0, w L = 0, in an obstacle-free environment. As mentioned earlier, we assume that F is localized w.r.t. L, i.e., that F measures its position (x, y) and orientation β w.r.t. the leader frame L. Yet, F does not have access to the navigation plan or the velocities u L (t), w L (t) of L at each time instant t. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that F has some a priori knowledge on the velocity bounds u L , w L of L, in the sense that L is restricted to move with bounded velocities</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">0 ≤ u L ≤ u L , |w L | ≤ w L .</formula><p>The task for F is to (ideally) keep a fixed distance r d w.r.t. L with angle φ = 0, where 2r 0 ≤ r d ≤ L s cos α and r 0 the radius of the robots; in that way, L gets centered in the field of view of F. This requirement specifies a manifold M of desired configurations</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">q d = [ x d y d θ d ] for F M = q d ∈ C x 2 d + y d 2 = r d 2 , θ d = atan2(y d , x d ) + sign(y d )π .</formula><p>Thus, the control design for F reduces into finding a feedback control law γ F (•) so that F converges to a configuration q d ∈ M, with the trajectories q(t) always satisfying the visibility constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. However, since the perturbation g(q, v L ) is nonvanishing ∀q ∈ C, none q d ∈ M is an equilibrium point of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. In that case, the best one can hope for is that the system trajectories q(t) are ultimately bounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Consequently, the task for F reads as to converge into a ball B(r d , r ) of radius r &gt; 0 around a desired position r d ∈ M.</p><p>1) Ultimate Boundedness of the System Trajectories Into a Ball B(r d , r ): Building upon previous work of ours <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we propose a feedback control law yielding ultimate boundedness of the trajectories q(t) of F into a ball around a desired position r d ∈ M; to this end, we use a suitably defined dipolar vector field as a feedback motion plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for F.</p><p>In principle, a dipolar vector field F : R 2 → R 2 has integral lines that all lead to the origin (0, 0) of a global coordinate frame G in R 2 , is nonvanishing everywhere in R 2 except for the origin, and is analytically given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">F(η) = λ(p η)η -p(η η) (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where λ ≥ 2, p ∈ R 2 and η = [ η x η y ] the position vector w.r.t. G . Its characteristic property is that all integral lines converge to the origin (0, 0) parallel to the axis the vector p lies on, (see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Consequently, picking a vector p = [ p x p y ] such that its orientation ϕ p atan2(p y , p x ) w.r.t. G coincides with a desired orientation η θ d , has the effect of reducing the orientation control for a unicycle vehicle into forcing it to align with the integral lines of the dipolar vector field while flowing toward the origin (0, 0). If the vector p is assigned on a desired position η d = [ η x d η y d ] , then one gets a dipolar vector field whose integral lines converge to η d having by construction the desired orientation ϕ p η θ d there.</p><p>In order to get the analytic expression of a vector field F with the desired convergence properties w.r.t. a configuration q d ∈ M in the leader frame L, take p = [ p x p y ] such that ϕ p = atan2(p y , p x ) θ d and substitute η with r 1 rr d in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, where r 1 = [ x 1 y 1 ] .

(<label>11b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Having the vector field <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> at hand, we state the following theorem regarding the position trajectories r(t) of F.</p><p>Theorem 1: The position trajectories r(t) = [ x(t) y(t) ] of the perturbed system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> enter and remain into a ball B(r d , r ) around a desired position</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">r d ∈ M, under the control law v F = [ u F w F ] where u F = -k 1 sgn r 1 cos β sin β r 1 -sgn(p r 1 )u L (12a) w F = -k 2 (β -ϕ) + φ (12b) k 1 , k 2 &gt; 0, ϕ atan2(F y , F x )</formula><p>is the orientation of the vector field (11) at (x, y), u L is the upper bound of the linear velocity of L, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">r &gt; |w L | √ k 1 k 2</formula><p>. The proof is given in the Appendix A. Remark 2: A conservative yet safe (worst case) r can be taken for the bound w L of the angular velocity of L. Note also that as w L → 0, then r → 0 as well.</p><p>2) Maintaining Visibility: The necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring that system trajectories q(t) never escape a set of state constraints K are given by Nagumo's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Briefly, the main idea is that on the boundary ∂K of the set K, the system vector field q ∈ T q C, with T q C being the tangent space of the state space C at the point q, should be tangent to K, for bringing the solution q(t) back in the interior of K. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> Thus, for the visibility set K considered here, the kth constraint ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is always maintained if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">dh k dt = ∇h k q (7) = ∇h k (f (q, v F ) + g(q, v L )) &lt; 0, ∀{q ∈ C | h k (q) = 0} (13)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">∇h k ∂ h k ∂ x ∂ h k ∂ y ∂ h k ∂ β</formula><p>is the gradient of h k (•), and k ∈ {1, 2}. To see why, note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> implies that the value of the constraint function h k (•) : R 3 → R is forced to decrease, which in turn implies that the constraint function h k (•) remains negative, or equivalently, that the resulting trajectory q(t) is forced to lie in the interior of the visibility set K. The necessary and sufficient conditions for maintaining visibility when both constraints are active at the same time are written using the Jacobian matrix J h (q) of the map h = (h 1 (•), h 2 (•)) : R 3 → R 2 as J h (q) q &lt; 0, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">J h (q) = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ ∂h 1 ∂x ∂h 1 ∂y ∂h 1 ∂β ∂h 2 ∂x ∂h 2 ∂y ∂h 2 ∂β ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ .</formula><p>(14) At this point, note that while the control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> does force F to converge into a ball around a desired position r d ∈ M-, which by definition belongs to the visibility set K-it does not necessarily guarantee that the trajectories q(t) do always belong to the visibility set K. In other words, the resulting paths for F as it moves toward q d may be such that L lies out of the visibility cone during some finite-time intervals. For the problem setup and control design considered here, this primarily depends on the choice of the desired configuration q d ∈ M, which in turn dictates the choice for the vector p ∈ R 2 in the definition of the vector field <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, i.e., dictates the reference orientation ϕ(t) that F has to track via (12b).</p><p>In this respect, note that not all possible desired positions r d ∈ M for F belong to its cone of view at each time instant t. For instance, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and assume that t = 0: the desired positions</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">r d ∈ R 2 belong to the circle c = {r ∈ R 2 | x 2 + y 2 = r d 2</formula><p>}, centered at L; however, only the positions on the arc V shown Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In an obstacle-free environment, the viability constraints are active on the boundary of the cone of view (visibility at stake).</p><p>in bold belong to the cone of view of F. Thus, one needs to pick some r d ∈ V, which furthermore guarantees that visibility is always maintained.</p><p>A sufficient option is to choose the position r d ∈ V, which lies on the line that connects the two robots. To see why, let us illustrate the necessary and sufficient visibility conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> for the boundary configurations of the system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>The first visibility constraint is active when h 1 (q) = 0 ⇔ φ = ±α; in this case, L lies on either the side AF, or the side BF of the cone of view. The second visibility constraint is active when h 2 (q) = 0 ⇔ r = L s cos α cos φ ; in this case, L lies on the side AB. In the worst case, the visibility constraints are both active when L lies on either point A or point B. Then, visibility is maintained under the proposed control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> as long as the condition ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) holds. The analytical expression of the visibility conditions and a sufficient tuning of the control gains k 1 and k 2 so that these conditions always hold, are given in Appendix B. With this at hand, we may now state the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 2: The control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> with the control gains k 1 and k 2 satisfying ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, guarantees that the follower F:</p><p>1) converges and remains into the ball B(r d , r ); 2) maintains visibility w.r.t. the leader L; and 3) avoids collision with L.</p><p>Proof: The first two arguments were proved in Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively. For the third argument, let us consider the Lyapunov function</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">V 1 = 1 2 (x 1 2 + y 1 2</formula><p>) encoding the squared distance between F and its goal position r d , and recall from the analysis in Appendix B that its time derivative V1 is negative out of the ball B(r d , r ). This implies that the distance r 1 of F to its goal r d ∈ V is always forced to decrease, until its value becomes lower than r . Furthermore, by definition the goal position r d for F is always picked to lie between the two robots (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Let us assume that for some initial configuration q 0 ∈ K, the proposed control strategy forces F to collide with L; then, this implies that the distance r 1 should increase, which is inconsistent for the system trajectories under <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Therefore, intervehicle collision avoidance is always guaranteed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MOTION PLANNING IN OBSTACLE ENVIRONMENTS</head><p>The L-F formation is assumed to move in a structured workspace W ⊂ R 2 with known obstacles, e.g., in an indoor corridor environment. For ensuring the safe and reliable motion of the robots one should take into account that 1) obstacles may obstruct visibility (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), and therefore if L is not visible to F, then sensing is not effective; 2) the trajectories q L (t), q F (t) should be collision-free. The robots are represented as circular disks of radius r 0 . This radius is added to the obstacles as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Thus, the dark gray region around obstacles reduces the free space of the robots, while it does not affect the visibility; F can still detect L through this region, but both F and L should not enter into it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motion Coordination in a Corridor Environment</head><p>Controlling F via <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> essentially yields the desired formation shape along with guaranteed visibility maintenance. For the navigation of the formation through a corridor environment, we further need a motion plan for L. To this end, we first decompose the free space into cells as described in Appendix C. We also assume that L is given a high-level discrete motion plan indicating the sequence of cells that it has to go through, in order to converge to a goal configuration.</p><p>With these at hand, we are now pursuing a control strategy for L such that its motion guarantees obstacle avoidance for both robots; recall that the motion of F already guarantees the maintenance of the formation shape and visibility with L.</p><p>1) Defining Local Feedback Motion Plans for L: Given the sequence of cells i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N cell } that L has to go through, the motion planning for L follows the spirit presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. More specifically, in each cell i, we define a dipolar vector field F Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> which serves as a local feedback motion plan for L in the following sense: the integral curves of the vector field F Li in cell i point into the interior of the successor cell i + 1 on the exit face of cell i, and into the interior of cell i on each one of the remaining faces (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>The difference compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> is that here the vector fields defined in each cell i are dipolar and thus their integral curves converge by construction to the midpoint of the exit face of cell i. This is ensured by assigning the dipole moment vector p Li of the vector field F Li on the exit point of cell i.  <ref type="formula">15</ref>), tracking the vector fields shown in the free space. The resulting trajectory q L (t) will likely force F to eventually collide with obstacles. Thus, L and F should move with minimum turning radii R L and R F around corners.</p><p>The feedback motion plan for L can then be defined as to orient with and flow along the integral curves of the vector field F Li in each cell i.</p><p>Lemma 1: Let us assume that, in the worst case, L initiates on the boundary of a cell i, with orientation pointing into the interior of the cell. Then, L performs collision-free motion throughout the successive cells i, i + 1, . . ., under the control inputs</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">u L = const ≤ u L (15a) w L = -k L (θ L -ϕ Li ) + φLi (15b)</formula><p>where ϕ Li is the orientation of the vector field F Li in cell i, and k L &gt; 0. Proof: Since each vector field F Li by definition points into the interior of the free space, it follows that obstacle avoidance for L is ensured.</p><p>Remark 3: The motion and resulting trajectories q L (t) of L essentially dictate the desired position trajectories r d (t) ∈ V (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) that F has to track at each t. Clearly, r d (t) should always lie in the free space. To see if this is always the case, let us first consider the motion of the formation when both robots lie in the same cell i.</p><p>Lemma 2: Let us assume that L and F start in the same cell i, at some initial distance r &gt; r d and so that the visibility constraints are not violated. We furthermore assume that when initiating on the boundary of the cell, the orientations of L, F point into the interior of the cell. Then under the control laws ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), the motion of the L-F formation in cell i remains collision-free.</p><p>Proof: In the worst case, both robots start on the boundary of the free space so that at least one of the visibility constraints is active. Then out of Lemma 1 one has that L moves into the interior of cell i. Furthermore, out of Theorem 2 one has that the interagent distance r decreases, implying thus that F is forced to move into the interior of cell i. Thus, both robots avoid static obstacles. Interrobot collision avoidance is also guaranteed out of Theorem 2. Consequently, the motion of the L-F formation in cell i is collision-free.</p><p>Let us now consider the transition when L enters cell i + 1, while F is still in cell i. In this case, it is likely that the trajectory q L (t) will force the desired position r d to eventually enter the obstacle space. To see how, consider Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>: L is forced to track the vector field in cell i + 1 after the exiting cell i and thus moves in the free space but very close to the obstacle, forcing F to eventually collide with the obstacle.</p><p>2) Considering the Formation as a Tractor-Trailer System: This remark essentially implies that L should move with a minimum turning radius R L when entering into cell i + 1 so that the trajectories q F (t) do not enter the obstacle space. A sufficient way to ensure this is to think of the L-F formation as a tractor (L) pulling a trailer (F) with axle-to-axle hitching of length r d <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> when turning around corners. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>Lemma 3: If L starts moving along a circle of center C and radius R L , then F will move on a circle of the same center C and radius R F = R L 2r d 2 .

Then, L switches to the control strategy described in Step ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>), and so on. Remark 5: The worst-case computation of safe R L and R F does not need to be done for L exiting at the midpoint M i of the exit face of cell i. One may tune the proximity of the resulting trajectories q L (t) and q F (t) to the obstacles by sliding the exit point of L along the exit face of cell i.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head><p>This paper presented a motion coordination and control strategy for L-F formations of nonholonomic vehicles, under visibility and communication constraints in known obstacle environments. Visibility constraints arise due to the limited visionbased sensing of the robots and define a visibility cone for each robot i. 7 A robot i is localized w.r.t. a robot j if and only if j belongs into the visibility cone of i. Thus, j and i can move as an L-F pair if and only if j is always visible from i. Intervehicle collisions and avoidance of physical obstacles should also be ensured. For the guaranteed accomplishment of those multiple objectives, ideas from set-theoretic methods in control were combined with feedback motion planning via dipolar vector fields and the consideration of the formation as a tractortrailer system, to the derivation of a hybrid control strategy. The proposed algorithms are decentralized, in the sense that they are dependent on local information only, which is online or a priori available to each robot, without the need for exchanging information.</p><p>It is worth noting that the computation of the safe turning radius for L is done for the worst case scenario, i.e., for the last follower exiting cell i on the boundary of the obstacle. As thus, the consideration of the formation as a tractor-pullingtrailers system serves not only as one of the main contributions of this study, but also eliminates the need for communication among agents (i.e., the followers do not need to communicate their current positions to the leader for safely coordinating their motion, since the safe turning radii for the leader and the last follower are a priori computed for the worst case condition). In this sense, this may be also seen as a robustness feature against communication failures, which may be relevant in other formation/communication topologies and similar multiagent coordination problems in constrained environments, and is therefore an open direction for future investigation.</p><p>Our ongoing work and plans for future extensions are related to investigating switching control designs that may offer enhanced reliability and robustness in the case of malfunctioning, for instance against agent failures and measurement noise. As far as mechanical failures are concerned, let us note that the current approach does offer guarantees in terms of avoiding collisions, since each agent is always guaranteed to keep a fixed distance w.r.t. the agent moving in front of it. Thus, if a robot i accidentally stops moving, then its follower i + 1 will keep a fixed distance w.r.t. the robot i by remaining around its target point, forced there by proposed controllers. Of course, this implies that the formation will unavoidably break; for these reasons, an interesting direction for further investigation is toward adding additional, "recovery control" modes into the existing hybrid system, which will become active in the case that an agent needs to pick a new (local) leader and coordinate its motion around a failed robot. Finally, the adoption of the nominal system so far, i.e., under the assumption of zero noise, is not restrictive in extending and generalizing the proposed control 7 The assumption on the sensor footprint being an isosceles triangle is not restrictive, since the conditions (13) on maintaining visibility apply to any closed convex footprint, described by k inequalities h k (•) ≤ 0.  design, since the ideas and the mathematical framework can incorporate the effect of measurement noise and additive disturbances. Keeping in mind that the problem at hand involves wheeled robots operating in indoor environments, we ran some preliminary simulations with the position measurements of each robot corrupted by zero mean noise; this captures in spirit the observation noise expected in vision-based sensing and estimation, while the process noise in such environments for is typically not that great and thus was neglected. The simulations indicate that the current controller works well for relatively small estimation errors in position (of order 1-2%, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>), while hysteresislike techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> on the orientation control offer enhanced robustness against larger position errors (of order 10-15%, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> a scenario with N = 3 robots). The conditions which couple the admissible noise/disturbance characteristics with the safe turning radii, the environmental clearance and the robots' control gains require an extensive analysis which is out of the scope and the limits of the current paper, and is currently ongoing work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX C CELL DECOMPOSITION</head><p>We perform a cell decomposition into convex polygonal cells by extending the boundaries of each static obstacle until intersecting with another obstacle or the external boundary of the workspace [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12(a)</ref>].

On the common face between two successive cells i and i + 1, we draw the orthogonal vector pointing into cell i + 1 [see the red vectors in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12(a)</ref>].
