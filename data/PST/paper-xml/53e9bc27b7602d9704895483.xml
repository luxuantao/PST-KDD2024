Coetzee*, Associate Member, IEEE, and Ziad Elghazzawi</p><p>Abstract-We describe a noise-resistant pulse oximetry algorithm suited to both signal reconstruction and oxygen saturation estimation. The algorithm first detects relatively clean signal sections from which the heart rate is estimated. The heart rate is used to construct a synthetic reference signal that matches an idealized pulse signal. An adaptive filter continuously processes the sensor signals, reconstructing signals in a linear subspace defined by the reference signal. A projective subspace algorithm is then applied to find the oxygenation level of the blood. We show that under specific circumstances this algorithm solves the sufficiency condition for signal reconstruction in linear saturation estimators. The core principle of using a frequency modulated synthetic reference signal can be applied to adaptive filtering of other physiological signals controlled by the heartbeat, such as blood pressure and electrocardiogram.</p><p>Index Terms-Adaptive filtering, noise suppression, patient monitoring, pulse oximetry, signal reconstruction, subspace filtering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A PULSE oximeter estimates the oxygen saturation level of a patient's blood by measuring the absorption of two frequencies of light by perfused tissues. In a common arrangement, two LED's of differing wavelengths are placed on one side of a finger, and sensors sensitive to these wavelengths detect the transmitted light at the opposite side. The beating of the heart creates a pressure wave that causes perfused tissues to expand and contract, modulating the light intensity. By measuring the differential absorption of the two light components, an estimate of the oxygen saturation level can be calculated.</p><p>Pulse oximetry is noninvasive, inexpensive, simple to apply, and can produce remarkably accurate saturation estimates at saturation levels above 70%. Pulse oximetry has, therefore, become widespread in patient monitoring, and has been adopted as a standard for anesthesia, neonatal care, and post-operative recovery (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for reviews).</p><p>Unfortunately, the reliability of the pulse oximeter is severely reduced by patient movement. Even small patient movements, such as shivering, can cause powerful artifacts that swamp the pulsatile absorption signal. Since the introduction of pulse oximetry, a large number of systems have been developed to address these difficulties. Existing and previous generation systems favored time-domain techniques, where the absorption signals are segmented into pulses that are validated against a set of templates. Most of the processing is expended to detect artifact conditions, following which processing is frequently suspended, with or without physician notification. During this period, the last valid estimate is recycled and displayed until a timeout period is exceeded. A common timeout period can range up to 20 s.</p><p>Since even small artifacts in any frequency band can severely distort the time signal, template-based approaches frequently discard potentially useful data, and timeouts are common. Therefore, frequent false alarms still result that require staff visits, with associated stress, cost, and fatigue.</p><p>Recently, interest has focused on continuous processing techniques using adaptive filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The advantages of these methods are faster response times, the avoidance of pulse segmentation, and the ability to continue processing under moderate artifact conditions. Thus far, the focus has been on stabilizing saturation estimates, and not on accurate reconstruction of the signal waveform. However, since the pulsatile component of the oximetry waveform reflects the arterial pulse pressure waveform, the signal is of interest for noninvasive cardiovascular disease diagnosis and monitoring. Possible uses include hypertension and artificial heart valve monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the design of a noise-resistant pulse oximeter to continuously yield estimates of both the saturation level, and of the absorption signal waveform. The novel core of the algorithm consists of an adaptive filter that uses a synthetically generated reference signal to project the absorption waveform onto a carefully constructed subspace. This algorithm can function under moderate noise conditions and does not require that the signals be segmented.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. First, the principles of pulse oximetry are reviewed in Section II. An analysis of noise in oximetry sensors using linear estimation is presented in Section III. Based on this analysis, we present in Section IV an adaptive filter that serves as a core for a general system to extract the pulsatile waveforms from noise. The practical implementation of the oximeter is described in Section V. Finally, we conclude with illustrative performance results on a patient database, contained in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. NOISELESS PULSE OXIMETRY</head><p>Consider an ideal arrangement of a probe containing two adjacent LED's placed on a stationary finger, where the transmitted light is detected by sensors at the opposite side of the finger. The light absorption process in this scenario is shown schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Under ideal steady-state conditions, the light absorption signal contains both a constant (dc) and a time varying (ac) component. For the purposes of oximetry no specific mechanisms have to be assumed for the dc component; however, this component is generally ascribed to baseline absorption of blood and soft tissue, nonexpansive tissues such as bone, as well reflectance loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The ac component reflects the modification of the effective path length of the light due to expansion of the perfused tissues subject to varying blood pressure.</p><p>For the purposes of this paper we use the widely accepted Beer-Lambert law of light absorption. We discuss the limitations of this model briefly below. The Beer-Lambert law states that the exit intensity of light at wavelength passing through a solution of components each of concentration spanning a path length , satisfies</p><p>where is the input intensity and is the absorption coefficient of component at wavelength . By dividing the signal received, , by the portion of the signal not due to pulsatile variation, , the pulsatile signal, , can be retrieved up to a constant factor. This procedure is equivalent to high-pass base-band filtering of the absorption signal. The log of the extracted pulsatile signal will be denoted in what follows. The ratio of the pulsatile signals at the two wavelengths and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(2)</formula><p>Under the assumption that the only variation occurs in a single layer with effective modulation width , it follows that</p><p>(3)</p><p>We henceforth refer to as the pulse signal. Assuming only two dominant components, oxy-hemoglobin at concentration and deoxy-hemoglobin at concentration , the oxygen saturation ratio can be calculated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> Note that the ratio of the pulsatile signals depends only on the concentrations of the oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin and not on the unknown modulation width of the absorption layer (or artery). This property represents the crucial insight that makes possible pulse oximetry.</p><p>Conversion of the ac absorption signals into a saturation level remains an active area of research. While oximetry was originally motivated by the Beer-Lambert model, it is known that the latter model is not completely correct, especially for saturations below 70%. For these reasons more complicated models have been studied to identify more accurate statistics suited to wider ranges of saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, as of this time, no better statistic than has clearly emerged and manufacturers mostly resort to calibration procedures to improve accuracy. It appears doubtful that a robust statistic suited to general patient monitoring will be forthcoming, since the deviations from Beer-Lambert model predicted by more sophisticated models may be less than the variability of these models across the population of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>It is further known that multiple varying blood components absorb light; in particular, carboxy-hemoglobin can cause large errors due to hemoglobin masquerading <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. While, in principle, additional wavelengths can resolve additional blood components, economics dictate that almost all oximeters currently use the two-component assumption. To ameliorate the problem of multiple blood components, LED wavelengths are carefully selected and calibrated to improve robustness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, or recently, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, targeted at expected blood characteristics of a specific patient population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. NOISE AND SATURATION RATIO CALCULATION</head><p>In practice, during even minor patient movement, the pulsatile oximetry component can be dominated by noise. The neonatal absorption signals shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> are typical and clearly illustrate the severity of the noise signal. It appears that different physical noise sources dominate under different operating conditions. When gross limb movement occurs, such as when neonates kick, noise results from movement of the sensor relative to the skin, as well as deformation of the tissues due to external pressure (usually due to the probe wires). These effects yield a large path-length shift as well as major changes in reflection and absorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. When the movement is more modest, such as occurs when the patient is shivering, or during finger tapping, venous engorgement by blood may be the dominant cause of noise. This postulate has recently gained increased acceptance due to experimental work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and at least one company is investigating using this model to possibly separate venous and arterial saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Knowledge concerning the exact cause of the noise, however, is not required for our algorithm.</p><p>In what follows, it is assumed that the dc baseline has been subtracted from the observed LED signals in a reasonable fashion, yielding (log) observed signals and . We assume that each observed signal is composed of a desired pulsatile signal and a noise component such that . We proceed in standard fashion by considering first the processing of the LED signals that have been sampled to form vectors over an observation interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. When we have solved the problem for this interval, a continuous algorithm is derived that shifts the observation interval over by one sample at a time to include subsequent samples and define a new interval . We let represent the average saturation across the interval , and choose the length of such that this saturation level satisfies the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where lies in the span of the arterial pulse waveform, . For adults this assumption is practical if is less than 10-20 s, and for neonates if is less than 5-10 s.</p><p>We wish to quantify how noise affects the calculation of the saturation ratio estimate , and further, when it is possible to obtain an accurate estimate of or . Before addressing the general problem, it is insightful to consider a special case. Assume the pulse signal is periodic and has an expansion over of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where is the heart rate, denotes the th overtone, and is the th Fourier coefficient. Assume the noise is also periodic with components and but has no first heart rate overtone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculating the saturation ratio directly yields</head><p>This expression shows that naive point by point division can be severely influenced by the noise. In general, when the noise components are not proportional in the same ratio as the desired signal components, there will be an error.</p><p>Note that (5) implies that the ratio of the desired signals is invariant under a linear projection onto a subspace of their range. Linear filtering of the observed signals does not distort the ratio of the two desired signal components. Intuitively, it should, therefore, be possible to extract the saturation ratio by first filtering out all signal components where both noise and signal are present, and then using the filtered signals for ratio estimation. In the above example, such a filter will separate out the first overtone for processing, yielding . We now consider the general problem of using linear projection operators for retrieving estimates of and , and formalize the insights above. From ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), the desired projections lie in a one-dimensional (1-D) subspace; therefore, the general estimator has the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where is a 1-D vector. The expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> involves two opposing effects due to signal and noise on the two leads. Defining the difference signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> the expression for the estimated ratio can be rewritten as NSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where NSR is the noise to signal ratio of the difference signal with respect to the subspace . From ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), it follows that a necessary and sufficient condition for zero error is to have NSR , whence it follows that should satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> This condition formalizes the intuition that the linear operators should have a null space that includes the components of the noise signal that are not in the desired signal ratio. Unfortunately, the condition depends on knowledge of the unknown true ratio , and does not in itself yield a constructive solution for satisfying the constraint. Further, it is not necessarily true that finding such a subspace will yield an undistorted waveform estimate. In the absence of a detailed noise characterization, the latter requirement can only be satisfied given the additional conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Since the noise is not controllable, nor predictable, the existence of such a solution cannot always be guaranteed. In the next section we describe an algorithm that aims to satisfy the conditions ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), when possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NOISE REMOVAL BY SUBSPACE PROJECTION</head><p>The reconstruction problem is to find the signals in a constrained set of allowed waveforms that are in some sense closest to the observations . In our approach the major constraints derive from the physical origin of the pulse pressure waveform. With the exception of congenital heart diseases such as Patent Ductus Arteriosus, the pressure pulse has a characteristic double-gaussian notched shape. This shape results from the well-defined sequence of ventricular contractions and valve operations that occur during each heartbeat <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. We expect the individual patient pulse waveform shape to contain strong invariants over short periods of time. In addition, some invariants (such as slope inequalities) are expected to persist across patients.</p><p>To verify these hypotheses, data from adult volunteers ranging in age from 20-50 years, as well as from a set of neonatal patients, were analyzed. An exhaustive characterization of the data is beyond the scope of this paper. However, under suitable normalization of pulse length and energy, the data supports the above hypotheses. A common basic waveform can be identified. The fine structure of the waveform for each patient is dependent on the electrical stimulation of the heart, the blood pressure, the transmission characteristics of the individual's venous system and, therefore, general health and drug use. Our algorithm is able to represent both common and distinguishing waveform elements.</p><p>The ideal filtering approach is to simply fit the observed data by a synthetic parametric waveform that spans a rich set of allowed waveforms. In particular, for the oximetry problem, an appropriate waveform class is <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> This model generates a signal by tracing a patient-adaptive kernel function at the instantaneous heart rate (of period ) with phase delay . To filter , an appropriate robust metric (such as a Huber metric) between and is minimized by varying the parameters and . Unfortunately, this ideal approach requires global nonlinear optimization, and the convergence of such an approach can not yet practically be guaranteed. In this paper, an approximate solution is proposed that borrows from the above perspective. First, a generic kernel shape is chosen during the design phase or during an initial patient adaptation phase. For each processing interval, the heartrate period separately. The set of allowed functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> above is approximated by the linear subspace defined by To calculate the ratio estimate a subspace has to be selected such that the filtered sensor signals are collinear. This subspace is selected using a minimum disturbance principle which divides the angle between the signal vectors, yielding the final estimated pulsatile signal vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> The saturation ratio estimate is calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> These operations are illustrated graphically using the vector space formulation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (an accessible introduction to the vector-space approach is <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</p><p>The construction of allows for the processing on the interval to be directly extended to continuous filtering using the recursive-least-squares (RLS) adaptive filtering algorithm. The RLS filter moves either a rectangular, or exponential window defining across the data as every new data sample appears, then efficiently recomputes the projections using only the function as the reference signal input <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Our method can be summarized succinctly. The method generates a synthetic basis for the delay subspace spanned by the arterial pulse component, and finds desired signal component estimates within this allowed subspace. During motion conditions, the allowed subspace is matched to the characteristics of the true desired signal components, and is of much lower dimensionality than the measurement space. The received sensor signals are projected onto this subspace and noise is reduced by this operation. The filter will remove all noise not in , i.e., noise which is not perfectly correlated with the signal waveform. Hence, the filter aims to satisfy the necessary conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, by attempting to reconstruct the pulsatile waveform via reference signal superposition. Errors in the saturation ratio estimate will occur when the noise is not perpendicular to . Errors in the waveform estimate will further occur when the true signal waveform does not fully lie in .</p><p>To provide insight into why excellent noise suppression is practically achieved by the above procedure, we now discuss some scenarios.</p><p>First, consider the special case where the patient heartrate is constant. In this case the subspace has a frequency decomposition containing components at the base heartrate, as well as at harmonics, weighted according to the chosen kernel function. The adaptive filter can generate any signal in the linear subspace spanned by a single reference signal and its shifted and delayed versions. This process can be viewed as having the reference signal provide a set of frequencies for use as building blocks in reconstructing the desired signal. As a result, the RLS algorithm functions as a series of weighted and very narrow band-pass filters centered at harmonics of the heartrate, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The algorithm is, therefore, a generalization of the simple approach of using a single bandpass or comb filter around the base heartrate. The algorithm differs significantly from a comb filter in that the weighting and bandwidth of the different frequency bands change as the coefficients of the adaptive filter are adjusted. Further, the weighting is a priori heavily biased toward producing feasible waveforms by the choice of the reference signal kernel function.</p><p>The RLS uses superposition of the reference signal to produce a patient-adapted kernel. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> displays the kernel approximation produced for an adult patient with a distinctive deviation. This adaptation capability of the method is crucial since certain diseases, in particular patent ductus arteriosus, valvular and sub-valvular aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardio-myopathy can cause a noticeable deviation from a normal pulse waveform.  The reference signal and subspace is chosen by numerically optimizing the set of parameters and on a large database of patient data. The exact waveform we use is given in Section V.</p><p>The filter bank perspective also illustrates how noise is reduced. The filter allows through the harmonics of the desired signal, while minimizing the total filter bandwidth and reducing noise at other frequencies. The inability to remove the residual component of the noise in the signal subspace while reconstructing the signal is shared by all linear systems. However, from tests on our database we found that an assumption of orthogonality of noise and signal is reasonably conservative, since over reasonably long periods (roughly 10-15 heartbeats), artifact movement seldom remains strongly correlated with heartbeat.</p><p>We next consider the behavior of the filter when heart rate varies over , and/or arrhythmias are present. Both these distortions influence pulse shape (due to the varying amount of blood filling the left ventricle) and filter bandwidth. Consider first the special case of a patient with a nominal constant sinusoidal rhythm , modulated by a periodic frequency variation of rate and modulation ratio . The pulse waveform is idealized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where the instantaneous phase satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Using Bessel functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> From ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>), modulation increases the bandwidth of the spectrum around the center heart frequency. In the general case, this expansion occurs at each of the heartrate harmonics defining the nominal heart-rate pulse signal. When the heart rate of a patient varies by from the nominal value over s, the modulation ratio is <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> As an example, a 20% variation with a period of approximately 5 s at a nominal heart rate of 60 bpm (i.e., a severe arrhythmia with heart rate ranging from 58-82 bpm every 5 s) has equal to 1.0. The fraction of energy retained in the central lobe is 0.5855, and the dominant lobe is located at the nominal heartbeat. Hence, even for this severe case most of the energy will be located in the main lobe, at the heartrate, and will be extracted by the filter.</p><p>More general signal modulations also tend to increase the bandwidth of the desired signal. The adaptive filter still functions by constructing band-pass filters at the base heartrate and harmonics. The adaptive filter, however, will now also be excited with a modulated synthetic reference waveform. Therefore, the bandwidth of the filter lobes will increase relative to the fixed heartrate case depending on the width of the interval as determined by the RLS decay parameters. However, in the absence of noise, as long as correlation between the reference signal and the a-rhythmic heartrate is retained, the saturation estimate will still be exact, as follows from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. However, as modulation increases, we would expect from ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) that the reconstructed signal shape will deteriorate.</p><p>We note that the nonlinear projection problem has been modified as far as possible into a linear filtering problem. The heart rate parameter still enters as a nonlinear parameter, but this parameter can be estimated accurately by a separate sub-algorithm. The downside of approximating the nonlinear manifold <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> of allowed waveforms by the linear subspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, is the possibility of some nonfeasible waveforms appearing due to superposition. However, the kernel function imposes a strong bias against nonfeasible waveforms. Further, by removing all out-of-band noise, such waveforms require significant sustained components at the heart rate harmonics. It can be strongly argued that no linear adaptive system should be operated under such noise conditions. Operation of the filter in such a regime can also be detected by existing template-based validation techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>As with all biomedical equipment, the core algorithm requires significant support to ensure a robust system. The implementation of our algorithm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. The various logical steps of the algorithm are as follows:</p><p>1) signal conditioning; 2) reference generation and adaptive filtering; 3) saturation estimation; 4) self-monitoring and alarm condition detection; Signal conditioning comprises baseline wander removal and outlier detection. Baseline wander removal also isolates the pulsatile components to perform dc absorption normalization (Section II). Our system has an operating heartbeat range from 15-300 bpm. Spectral analysis of a patient database showed baseline wander spectra in the range of 15-45 bpm, preventing linear filters from removing baseline wander without also filtering out low heart rate signals. We, therefore, use a piecewise linear spline filter, which processes the LED signals morphologically to robustly detect local minima, and perform piecewise linear baseline subtraction between subsequent minima.</p><p>A subsequent outlier detection section learns the gross statistics of the sensor signals and associates with every signal sample a code. The code indicates noise level and is used by the subsequent processing stages to provide confidence estimates. Two test sections determine the code. First, an amplitude outlier section detects large swings that exceed an adaptive threshold . Sudden large spikes that are orders of magnitude larger than the pulse signal value are especially common in neonatal monitoring. This section also compensates for variations in skin-to-probe pressure, skin pigmentation, perfusion level, and analog-to-digital gain changes. The threshold is a fixed multiple of the median ac signal value over a set of past observation periods. This robust statistic exploits the fact that the peak pulse value for a kernel is a fixed multiple of the median signal value (2.228 on our database). We maintain two thresholds: one conservatively set at , and a worst case threshold at 20</p><p>. The second test enforces a minimum correlation between sections of the sensor signals centered around each sample. This test uses the fact the red and infrared LED signals are measured simultaneously.</p><p>The pre-processing produces a code sequence that frequently contains small regions of isolated error codes. A morphological region growing filter revalidates small, isolated regions of invalid data, and removes a few samples at the boundaries of each region that is tagged to be valid.</p><p>A reliable and accurate estimate of the heartrate is crucial. We prefer an ECG signal. However, the heart rate can also be calculated from the oximetry signals, either by mode detection of zero crossings, or by using an appropriately windowed fast Fourier transform. Only clean data samples falling below the lower amplitude outlier threshold are used in the heart rate estimate. The fraction of samples used provides a confidence estimate on the heart-rate. The reference signal is given by (20) where is the instantaneous heart rate and is a phase term. The phase term is constant over the observation period , and ensures continuity of the signal output when the heart rate estimate changes. If at time a new observation period starts, and the heart rate changes from to , then the phase over the new interval is given by the convex combination (21</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>The kernel is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, and generated by <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref> where the coefficients are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</p><p>The red and infrared sensor signals, following baseline removal and set to zero where the upper outlier threshold is exceeded, are adaptively filtered. RLS regression is efficiently performed for both LED channels using a single synthetic reference signal driving a joint-process estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The filter produces the two LED signal projections onto the subspace spanned by the feasible pulse waveform. These projections are combined via ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> to yield the pulsatile signal and saturation estimates, respectively.</p><p>The sequence of saturation estimates is filtered for improved stability. First, a median filter removes outlier values, following which an optional predictor-corrector filter stage is used to limit the output rate of change.</p><p>In patient monitoring equipment, the objective is generally to operate in a conservative regime not approaching the limit of achievable noise reduction performance. We use feedback to detect safe regions of operation. The fraction of samples tagged as outliers, and the fraction of energy filtered out by the RLS filter, are measured against thresholds to suspend or re-initialize operation. The thresholds are set using a rule base that encodes desired clinical guidelines. Existing template pulse-validation technology can also be used as a final check to validate the filtered waveforms.</p></div>

ILLUSTRATIVE ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> illustrates the increased fidelity of the filtering approach on a neonatal waveform. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(a) shows the signals after acquisition, baseline removal and conditioning, as well as after the outlier detection stage. The baseline removal stage fails to find acceptable minima in the observed signal around time period 1709, causing the worst case outlier threshold to be exceeded and the signal to be set to zero for approximately 2 s (we note that to improve clarity, the amplitude outlier thresholds were lowered and the filter adaptation speed was increased relative to normal operation).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="bibr">6(b)</ref> shows in detail the signal from the outlier detector, the synthetic reference signal, and the reconstructed signal.

Therefore, the filter can predict the waveform even when the input signal is temporarily terminated during wild signal swings.</p><p>One of the difficulties with objectively evaluating the algorithm is obtaining a comparison standard. Algorithms are proprietary and performance is heavily dependent on the settings and pre-processing used by the manufacturers. Further, usually no facility is provided for running products on a database or for obtaining time-out statistics. We, therefore, illustrate the improved performance due to our filtering algorithm by comparing performance to that of the baseline algorithm that directly measures the ratio of the energy in the conditioned ac signals across the interval of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We refer to this algorithm by filtered power ratio algorithm (FPRA), and our algorithm by synthetic subspace projection algorithm (SSPA). The FPRA algorithm derives a measure of robustness from using the same outlier detection section as our new algorithm; we, therefore, gain insight into the effectiveness of the adaptive filtering core proposed in this paper.</p><p>We validated our algorithm using a synthetic data set generated using a WindKessel model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, simulating various kernel shapes and arrhythmias including ectopic beat progression, normal and Parkinson-White atrioventricular (AV)-block conditions. Desaturation to low saturation levels (below 70%) was also modeled. As expected, the performance on this data set had zero error in noise-free cases, with performance in noise described by the theory of Section III. We report here only the performance of the algorithm on two real-world data bases.</p><p>1) Eight healthy adult volunteers with ages ranging from 20-50 years, following a prescribed exercise protocol. Reference data were retrieved from a stationary limb. Ten exercises were performed, ranging from slight finger tapping, arm waving, through warm-down after a jogging exercise. A total of 44.6 min of data was recorded. 2) A total of 255 min of neonatal data collected from 11 patients in a clinical setting. This database is characterized by very high noise conditions and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's).  The saturation levels achieved on the human volunteers were not controllable and ranged from 89% to 100%. Signal ratio estimates corresponding to saturations above 100% were allowed, providing a more honest evaluation of ratio estimation reliability.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> shows the standard deviation in saturation error , as well as the fraction of time that the algorithm is within of the true saturation estimate. Of particular interest is , since an automatic alarm is commonly set in clinical practice to detect sudden 10% decreases in saturation. Hence, on this database, the SSPA would have eliminated false alarms on the adult database, as compared to the FPRA. On neonates, a factor of four fewer false alarms would be expected.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref> summarizes the performance of the outlier detector. The mean and standard deviation of the length of each contiguous error code section is shown, as well as the minimum and maximum contiguous lengths recorded (signals were sampled at 100 Hz). At our parameter settings, 92.5% of the data samples are directly used in calculation for adults, and 87% for the neonates. In reality, since the distribution of the error codes lengths exhibits significant asymmetry, for most patients operation proceeds uninterrupted. The distribution is skewed due to an occasional patient that causes extensive high noise regions that persists for a long time. These extreme noise regions can usually be traced to gross limb movements. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the average absolute error in the saturation as a function of the minimal SNR on the adult data set, where a relatively clean reference signal was available. The observed red LED signal and the red reference LED signal were aligned and divided into overlapping sections of 250 samples (2.5 s) each. For each section the SNR calculated by SNR (23)</p><p>and the average absolute error over the section using the two algorithms were obtained. The cumulative graph was constructed using each of the signal sections as a sample pair for SNR and error. The figure shows an expected decline in error with increased SNR (for the SSPA from 4 to 4 dB). We ascribe the error increase of the FPRA as SNR increases from 3 to 5 dB to significant in-band noise for some of the samples within this SNR range. From the figure we conclude that the adaptive filtering inherent in the SSPA algorithm yields a significant performance improvement, especially as the SNR decreases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. DISCUSSION</head><p>We presented an approach for continuous filtering of pulse oximetry signals. A reference signal generated by tracing out a kernel is used to construct a subspace capturing the major harmonics of the signal. The kernel function determines the weighting applied to the different harmonics, while RLS adaptation controls the bandwidth of the resulting filter bank and reduces noise.</p><p>We now compare the current algorithm with other adaptive approaches. One group of adaptive filters, best exemplified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, attempts to learn gross noise states, and switches between algorithm settings according to the state. Due to the difficulty of characterizing the nonstationary noise processes, the present algorithm, as well as algorithms such as the Masimo algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, prefer to exploit mainly knowledge about the physics of oximetry. In particular, these algorithms use the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, and the fact that the pulse signal can be well modeled by an autoregressive process. The Masimo algorithm is one of the best performers in noise. This algorithm attempts to solve the saturation necessary equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> directly by effectively examining the orthogonality of the difference and desired signal subspaces across a range of postulated values of . The excellent saturation stability of the Masimo algorithm results from the fact that satisfying (10) is possible even when satisfying the reconstruction equations ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) is impossible. The Masimo algorithm uses a reference signal obtained directly from the noisy lead signals.</p><p>In contrast to the Masimo method, our approach constructs a synthetic reference signal, yielding a noise-free simplified subspace biased toward maintaining feasible waveforms. We believe that the design and use of this completely synthetic reference model is novel. Our algorithm is intended to be operated only in the more conservative region where both ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) can be approximately satisfied. To perform reconstruction, our algorithm in effect formulates hypotheses concerning the heart rate and waveform shape, and subsequently aggressively filters the LED signals according to these hypotheses. The algorithm, therefore, represents a form of decision-directed filtering. While excellent performance can be achieved, operation should be carefully monitored to ensure operation only in a valid region.</p><p>Our approach can be used for filtering of signals where a slowly varying kernel function is repeated with a time-varying instantaneous frequency. As such, it is suited to processing of other physiological signals controlled by the heart, such as for blood pressure monitoring.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
