<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>With the rapid development of technologies such as speech recognition and the popularity of various web services, virtual assistants have begun to enter thousands of households. Common virtual assistants such as Alexa, Google Home etc, are mostly voice activated. We call these devices smart speakers. Voice interaction with them through VUI (Voice User Interface) can complete a series of tasks from reminder creation to home automation. These functions help users to complete these tasks are called "skills". <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> At the same time, the easy-to-use, functional skill development platform developed by the smart speaker developers can enable all third-party developers interested in the skill market to launch their own skills, which has greatly promoted the development of the skill market. Because this field is relatively new, simple skills are repeatedly developed by developers, which do not meet the user needs well. Moreover, due to the users have insufficient knowledge of the skill market, there is a serious imbalance in the distribution of hot spots in the skill market. The data shows that in the 18 months between July 2016 and December 2017, the 100 most popular Alexa skills (0.4%) accounted for two-thirds of skill-related search clicks. It is unlikely the 99.6% of skills clicked one-third of the time have little or no utility, addressing only highly specific needs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Therefore, how to find a way to analyze the most interesting needs of users becomes very valuable.</p><p>The POIs that users focus on in the use of skills are reflected in the reviews, these POIs can effectively reflect the user's voice. Therefore, extraction and analysis of POIs is conducive to the improvement of skills and the development of new skills, which is helpful to the development of developers.</p><p>Therefore, we have conducted an empirical study that can extract user needs and POIs from the unstructured data of the skill market and analyze the distribution. Based on the analysis results can give suggestions in the development direction and POIs that should pay attention to in development for skill developers.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce the related work in Section 2, methods of empirical study in Section 3 and the related experiments and results in Section 4, which are the most important part of the paper. At last, give the conclusions of the paper in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we introduce the development of the smart speaker and skill market, and the user POIs extraction method to extract POIs from the unstructured data of user reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Smart speakers and skills market development</head><p>The premise of using smart speakers is voice recognition. Difficulties in speech recognition, such as noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, endpoint detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and dialect recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, have been making progress in recent years,ensuring the user experience. Smart speakers can respond to a large number of commands because smart speakers are always connected to the network, every interaction is sent back to the central computing system, which analyzes the user's voice commands and provides appropriate responses to the smart speakers. The user's interaction with skills will be as natural as the interaction with friends. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> The emergence of "skills" greatly enriches the services that smart speakers can provide.</p><p>There are many types of "skills" in many fields, ranging from quiz games that only provide entertainment to online shopping that provides life services. With the introduction of the concept of "smart home", smart home vendors and smart speaker developers cooperate, more and more home control skills appear. At present, more and more researches have begun to focus on the skill field, such as the suggestions on skill discovery proposed by RYEN W. WHITE <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Mateusz Dubiel and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> analyzed the difference in the experience, expectation of effects and privacy issues of two groups of people with different frequencies of smart speakers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. User POIs extraction methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POI (Point of interest) has different concepts in different fields.</head><p>Here, we define it as a user's point of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, meaning the service features that the user is interested in during the interaction between users and service providers. In order to get the user POIs from the user reviews, we need to perform semantic analysis, using text keyword mining algorithm, the mined keywords are the POIs. In terms of text mining, there are many research methods for reference, such as the LDA topic model proposed by Blei et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, but this method cannot extract the fine-grained user POIs; the TF-IDF algorithm proposed by SALTON, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>because user reviews are short text, the use of word frequency to measure the importance of words is not necessarily good;the RAKE(Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm proposed by Stuart Rose et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> The algorithm separates sentences with words in the stopword list to obtain candidate keywords. By scoring keywords and ranking the scores from highest to lowest, the top rankings are the final POIs. This paper selects the RAKE algorithm as the text mining algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. METHODS</head><p>In order to analyze the existing unstructured data from skill market, we have conducted an empirical study to extract data and analyze. The framework is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it is mainly divided into two parts.</p><p>The first part is to analyze the user needs that the skills in the market meet according to the skill description. The raw data is the description text of skills. After the text is preprocessed, uses the BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) multi-label classification model to extract the user needs that meets the Maslow's hierarchy of needs from the skill description, the handled data is analyzed as follows:</p><p>Module1 Analyze the distribution of user needs met by skills in the entire skill market.</p><p>Module2 Analyze the distribution of user needs met by skills in the top 100 skills to analyze the most popular user needs.</p><p>Module3 Analyze the hot spots distribution of user needs in the developer group and the user group to analyze the reasons for the difference in distribution.</p><p>The second part is to extract the user's POIs from the user reviews and do some analysis. The review texts are also preprocessed, then use the RAKE algorithm to mine the user's POIs. The BERT multi-label classification model is used for sentiment scoring to evaluate the user's emotional tendency to different POIs, and then the following analysis is performed:</p><p>Module4,5 Use the knowledge graph to extract the hierarchical and related relationship between POIs.</p><p>Module7,8 POIs distribution with hierarchical and related relationships.</p><p>Module6 Merge POIs with similar semantics. Module9 Distribution of POIs complete set. This section mainly introduces user needs extraction, user POIs extraction, user POI relationships extraction and user sentiment rating for POIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. User needs extraction</head><p>User needs are extracted using the BERT multi-label classification model. BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is a method of pre-training language representations, it trains a general-purpose "language understanding" model on a large text corpus, then use the model for different NLP tasks. Using BERT has two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. We choose to use BERT-Base, uncased model for pre-training. We also need to fine-tune BERT to complete the multi-label classification job.</p><p>According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> human needs can be divided into five levels of major needs, and there are multiple sub-needs under each major type of need. The method picks the appropriate sub-needs to use,and regards all the sub-needs as complete sets of user needs.The hierarchy diagram is shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. Then perform the following steps to extract user needs from skill descriptions:</p><p>Step1 Multi-label some skill descriptions as initial training data.</p><p>Step2 Put the training data into the BERT multi-label classification model and train the model.</p><p>Step3 Use the trained model to make predictions for the unlabeled data. The data returned by the prediction is the probability value that can be judged to belong to each type of user need from the skill description. If the probability value of type A in the prediction data is greater than the threshold, the skill is considered to meet the user need of type A.</p><p>Step4 Label the skill descriptions in the predicted data that does not belong to any classification and add them to the training data, goto Step2.If there is no such data, then end. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. User POIs extraction</head><p>This section's purpose is to extract the user POIs from the raw user reviews. Therefore,we need methods for semantic analysis of unstructured data. Here this paper selects the RAKE algorithm for unsupervised text keyword extraction.</p><p>Before using the RAKE algorithm for extraction, it needs to preprocess the users' reviews. It mainly takes the following three steps.</p><p>Step1 Clause and word segmentation. The clause uses NLP library NLTK, and the word segmentation is simply divided by space. Step2 Spelling error correction. The tool is python's autocorrect library.</p><p>Step3 Word form reduction. The word form reduction also uses the NLTK library. The purpose of this step is to restore the different forms of words to a unified form, such as "questions" to "question" and "sleeping" to "sleep".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. User POIs relationship extraction</head><p>In user reviews, users usually evaluate POIs at different semantic levels, such as "This game is great, but I hope the puzzle can be a little harder." In this review, "game" and "puzzle" forms a hierarchical relationship, and "game" is the upper layer of "puzzle". After extracting the hierarchical relationship, we can analyze the POI at different levels.</p><p>This paper uses the open source general knowledge graph ConceptNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to find the hierarchical relationship between POIs. ConceptNet is a large multilingual knowledge base, which contains a large number of commonly used words, phrases and the conceptual relationship between them. In this paper, we only use English knowledge for calculation. In the ConceptNet knowledge graph, natural language words and phrases are connected to each other through edges with labels and weights, where labels represent the types of edges and weights represent the credibility of the edges.</p><p>In order to find the hierarchical relationship, it looks at the label list of the edges and keeps the relationships listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> as the basis of the hierarchical relationships. For example, in A -PartOf ? B, A is the lower layer of B, and in A -MadeOf ? B, A is the upper layer of B. There is a semantic relevant relationship between POIs. For example, "question" and "answer". Using the edge with the "RelatedTo" label in the ConceptNet knowledge graph, if the shortest path of the distance between two POIs is less than the threshold, the method thinks that the two POIs are related.</p><p>There are a large number of semantically similar POIs in the retrieved POIs, although they are expressed in different ways, the meanings are similar, we need to merge the semantically similar POIs. Here it use python's word2vec tool gensim module trains the Skip-gram model to calculate the semantic similarity between POIs, and merge them when the similarity is above threshold.The corpus of the training model is the text of the user reviews after preprocessing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. User sentiment rating for POIs</head><p>In a user's review, the user will mention multiple POIs, and the emotional inclination for multiple POIs may not be the same. For example, in the user review "This game is good, but the volume is too low and needs to be improved." It can be seen that the user's emotion toward "game" is positive, while the emotion toward "volume" is negative. Therefore, it is also very important to perform corresponding sentiment analysis for each POI in the user reviews. This paper selects the method that uses the BERT multi-label classification model for sentiment analysis.</p><p>The trained model can make a probabilistic prediction of the sentiment tendency of the review, and give the probability value that each review belongs to the corresponding sentiment tendency. It defines the final sentiment score = positive sentiment probability -negative sentiment probability, sentiment score interval is [-1,1], the closer to -1, the more negative, the closer to 1, the more positive. Therefore,it can use this model to evaluate the user's emotional tendency towards each POI.Segment the user reviews, and match the POI in each sentence. Each sentence is scored using the trained model. If there are multiple mentions of the same POI in the review for multiple scores, the average is taken. After the above processing, we have each user score the emotional tendency of each POI in a review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENT AND RESULT</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Experiment setup and evaluation</head><p>BERT training data is in csv format.In the stage of user needs extraction, each line represents a skill. In addition to the "description" of the skill, it uses vector to represent labels of skill. Each position in the vector indicates whether the skill belongs to the user needs of this category. If it belongs, the corresponding position is 1, otherwise it is 0. This method can provide a structured representation of the user needs satisfied by each skill.</p><p>All data are trained by 5 epochs, the overall accuracy reached 0.9963 on the training set and 0.9904 on the valid set.</p><p>In order to verify the accuracy of the POI extracted by the RAKE algorithm, randomly select 2000 user reviews to manually label the POIs and compare it with the POIs extracted by the RAKE algorithm. The calculation method is shown in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), and the accuracy is 60.29%. The recall is 81.17%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accuracy = Number(correct extracted P OIs) N umbe(extracted P OIs)</head><p>(1)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recall = Number(correct extracted P OIs Number(manually marked P OIs)</head><p>(2)</p><p>In the stage of user sentiment rating for POIs, the training data used Douban movie English reviews totaling 25,000, including 12,500 positive reviews and 12,500 negative reviews. Process the data into a csv file and put it into the BERT multilabel classification model for training. The trained model can make a probabilistic prediction of the sentiment tendency of the review. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the model, we randomly select reviews and manually mark emotional tendencies and compare them with the sentiment tendencies predicted by the model to calculate the accuracy can reach 77.5%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Case Study 1) Statistical analysis of the user needs</head><p>The distribution of user needs is shown Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, skills that meet the need for "Gain knowledge and ability" account for the largest proportion in the market, followed by need related to users' "Personal growth".</p><p>User needs distribution of the 100 most popular skills is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The most popular need in the user group include "Sleep", "Gain knowledge and ability" and "Sense of achievement". "Sleep" has the highest proportion, and is much higher than other needs. It may be because in the skills that meet the needs of "Sleep", most of the same series of skills are developed by the same developer, and there are many types of hypnotic audio. Users can basically find a skill that meets their needs in a series, so this kind of skills are more popular. The proportion of "Gain knowledge and ability" need and "Sense of achievement" need is also very high. The main way to get a sense of achievement in skills is to play games. Combined with the "Gain knowledge and ability" need, it can be seen that knowledge quiz games and strategy games are very popular among users;</p><p>Hot spots distribution of user needs in the developer group and the user group is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Since it is not convenient to make a drawing if the abscissa is the name of the user needs, the index of user needs is used instead. The abscissa indexes correspond to the user needs name in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The Spearman coefficient is 0.8803648535879317. It can be seen that the biggest difference in distribution is the need for "Sleep". This is initially reflected in the user needs distribution of the 100 most popular skills.</p><p>Based on the previous analysis, we make the following suggestions.</p><p>(1)When choosing a development direction, developers can consider knowledge-based competitive games or strategy games skills. The needs satisfied by these type of skills accounts for a relatively large proportion in the market, and users are more concerned, but at the same time, high-quality content is needed to make a difference from a large number of similar skills.</p><p>(2)Developers can pay attention to the development of smart home skills. Such skills do not account for a large proportion in the market, but users are more concerned.</p><p>(3)Developers need to consider the advantages of the skills when developing "Sleep" skills. Since the "Sleep" skills on the market are basically saturated in the user base, if the developed skills have no special advantages, it's hard to stand out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) User POIs Analysis</head><p>This module divides all POIs with hierarchical relationships into two levels for analysis.Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> is the distribution diagram of high-level POI mention frequency, and Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> is the distribution diagram of low-level POI mention frequency. It can be seen that the mention frequency of low-level POI is much higher than that of high-level POI. The specific details of skill show more attention. For example, "device" appears in the highlevel distribution, it does not mention whether it is "iPhone" or other devices. However, the "phone" that appears in the low-level distribution represents the specific equipment that the skill carries or controls. The suggestion is: In addition to controlling the overall performance of each module in the skill, developers need to pay more attention to details during the development process, and can meet more user needs by digging into the details.</p><p>Using the correlations extracted before and viewing the Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Low-level POIs mention frequency distribution sentiment distribution of related POIs. For example, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>, it can be seen that except for the median emotions of "bill" and "price", the emotions of the rest of the POIs are negative, combined with specific reviews, "bill" generally appears in the skill to pay bills, "price" generally appears in querying item prices or guessing price game skills. Most of the other POIs except "tax" are related to paid skills, users have higher requirements for paid skills and some users don't accept paid skills, so user emotions are negative. We recommend to developers that the current user acceptance of paid skills is not high. When launching a skill, developers need to consider whether the fee will make the users feel value-for-money.</p><p>After analyzing the hierarchical relationship and the correlation relationship, the POIs with similar semantics are merged. We draw the frequency distribution of the complete set of POI as shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. For example, "work" reflects the skill's playability and running fluency, so developers need to pay attention to the fluency of interaction during the skill development process; "hear" reflects the user's attention to the ability of skill to capture instructions and speech recognition.</p><p>For the POIs that are mentioned more frequently, drawing a box plot of the user's emotional value of POIs as shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, arranged according to the degree of dispersion from small to large. For example,the distribution of "family" and "kid" reflects that skill has a good reputation among family After analysis, it gives the following suggestions:</p><p>(1)Focus on the entire process of user interaction with the service. A good skill must first be done without interruption, stuttering or flashback.</p><p>(2)Improve the ability to logically process user instructions. The backstage should consider as many different ways as possible to express the user's needs in order to deal with the user's intentions better.</p><p>(3)Consider skill audience. Developers should think about how to deal with users of different ages to improve the user experience.</p><p>(4)Improve the quality of content provided by skill. Whether the content is of high quality can be measured from the aspects of richness, amount of information, accuracy, interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper uses the Amazon smart speaker skill market data for analysis. In order to analyze the distribution of user needs from unstructured data, we conducted an empirical study that uses the BERT multi-label classification model to extract user needs that meets the Maslow's hierarchy of needs from the skill description. By counting the distribution of user needs, developers are given suggestions in the development direction.</p><p>This paper uses RAKE algorithm to extract users POIs from user reviews and uses knowledge graph to extract the relationship between POIs. Through the statistics of the distribution of POIs, it gives suggestions in POIs that should pay attention to in development for skill developers.</p><p>The research provides effective suggestions to the developers of the skill market by extracting effective information from unstructured data, which has a better role in promoting the development of the skill market.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
