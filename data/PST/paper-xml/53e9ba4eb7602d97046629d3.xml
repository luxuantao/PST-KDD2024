<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>If one considers life on Earth since its very beginning, three levels of organization can be distinguished: the phylogenetic level concerns the temporal evolution of the genetic programs within individuals and species, the ontogenetic level concerns the developmental process of a single multicellular organism, and the epigenetic level concerns the learning processes during an individual organism's lifetime. In analogy to nature, the space of bio-inspired hardware systems can be partitioned along these three axes, phylogeny, ontogeny, and epigenesis, giving rise to the POE model. This paper is an exposition and examination of bio-inspired systems within the POE framework, with our goals being: 1) to present an overview of current-day research, 2) to demonstrate that the POE model can be used to classify bioinspired systems, and 3) to identify possible directions for future research, derived from a POE outlook. We first discuss each of the three axes separately, considering the systems created to date and plotting directions for continued progress along the axis in question. We end our exposition by a discussion of possible research directions, involving the construction of bio-inspired systems that are situated along two, and ultimately all three axes. This could give rise to novel systems endowed with evolutionary, reproductive, regenerative, and learning capabilities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>hand, is a builder: faced with social and economic needs, he or she tries to create artificial systems (bridges, cars, electronic devices) based on a set of specifications (a description) and a set of primitives (elementary components such as bricks, beams, wires, motors, and transistors).</p><p>These two major branches of human endeavor have been drawing closer together during the past decades. It is common nowadays for scientists to use tools created by engineers. To cite one example of many, we are witness to the systematic use of electronics in the medical world for such tasks as decoding the human genome, visually representing highly complex chemical molecules, computerized tomography, and so on.</p><p>More recently, engineers have been allured by certain natural processes, giving birth to such domains as artificial neural networks and evolutionary computation. Living organisms are complex systems exhibiting a range of desirable characteristics, such as evolution, adaptation, and fault tolerance, that have proved difficult to realize using traditional engineering methodologies. Such systems are characterized by a genetic program, the genome, that guides their development, their functioning, and their death. If one considers life on Earth since its very beginning, then the following three levels of organization can be distinguished <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>-Phylogeny: The first level concerns the temporal evolution of the genetic program, the hallmark of which is the evolution of species, or phylogeny. The multiplication of living organisms is based upon the reproduction of the program, subject to an extremely low error rate at the individual level, so as to ensure that the identity of the offspring remains practically unchanged. Mutation (asexual reproduction) or mutation along with recombination (sexual reproduction) give rise to the emergence of new organisms. The phylogenetic mechanisms are fundamentally nondeterministic, with the mutation and recombination rate providing a major source of diversity. This diversity is indispensable for the survival of living species, for their continuous adaptation to a changing environment, and for the appearance of new species. -Ontogeny: Upon the appearance of multicellular organisms, a second level of biological organization manifests itself. The successive divisions of the mother cell, the zygote, with each newly formed cell possessing a copy of the original genome, is followed by a specialization of the daughter cells in accordance with their surroundings, i.e., their position within the ensemble. This latter phase is known as cellular differentiation. Ontogeny is thus the developmental process of a multicellular organism. This process is essentially deterministic: an error in a single base within the genome can provoke an ontogenetic sequence which results in notable, possibly lethal, malformations. -Epigenesis: The ontogenetic program is limited in the amount of information that can be stored, thereby rendering the complete specification of the organism impossible. A well-known example is that of the human brain with some 10 neurons and 10 connections, far too large a number to be completely specified in the four-character genome of length approximately 3 10 . Therefore, upon reaching a certain level of complexity, there must emerge a different process that permits the individual to integrate the vast quantity of interactions with the outside world. This process is known as epigenesis and primarily includes the nervous system, the immune system, and the endocrine system. These systems are characterized by the possession of a basic structure that is entirely defined by the genome (the innate part), which is then subjected to modification through lifetime interactions of the individual with the environment (the acquired part). The epigenetic processes can be loosely grouped under the heading of learning systems. In analogy to nature, the space of bio-inspired hardware systems can be partitioned along these three axes: phylogeny, ontogeny, and epigenesis; we refer to this as the POE model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The distinction between the axes cannot be easily drawn where nature is concerned; indeed the definitions themselves may be subject to discussion. We therefore define each of the above axes within the framework of the POE model as follows: the phylogenetic axis involves evolution, the ontogenetic axis involves the development of a single individual from its own genetic material, essentially without environmental interactions, and the epigenetic axis involves learning through environmental interactions that take place after formation of the individual. As an example, consider the following three paradigms, whose hardware implementations can be positioned along the POE axes: (P) evolutionary algorithms are the (simplified) artificial counterpart of phylogeny in nature, (O) multicellular automata are based on the concept of ontogeny, where a single mother cell gives rise, through multiple divisions, to a multicellular organism, and (E) artificial neural networks embody the epigenetic process, where the system's synaptic weights and perhaps topological structure change through interactions with the environment. Within the domains collectively referred to as soft computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, often involving the solution of ill-defined problems coupled with the need for continual adaptation or evolution, the above paradigms yield impressive results, frequently rivaling those of traditional methods.</p><p>This paper is an exposition and examination of bio-inspired hardware systems within the POE framework; our goals are: 1) to present an overview of current-day research, 2) to demonstrate that the POE model can be used to classify bioinspired systems, and 3) to identify possible directions for future research, derived from a POE outlook. We begin in the next section with an examination of the phylogenetic axis (due to space restrictions, and in following the main theme of this TRANSACTIONS, this axis shall be given particular attention). In Section III we present the ontogenetic axis, followed by a discussion of the third axis, epigenesis, in Section IV. Our paper ends in Section V with conclusions and directions for future research, based on the POE model. Specifically, we shall consider the possibilities of combining two axes, along with the ultimate goal of combining all three. This presents a vision for the future which may see the advent of novel hardware systems, inspired by the successful examples provided by nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE PHYLOGENETIC AXIS: EVOLVABLE HARDWARE</head><p>In this section we explore the phylogenetic axis of bioinspired systems, also referred to as evolvable hardware. The main motivation is to attain adaptive systems that are able to accomplish difficult tasks, possibly involving real-time behavior in a complex, dynamical environment. We begin by briefly introducing two underlying themes, artificial evolution and large-scale programmable circuits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Artificial Evolution</head><p>The idea of applying the biological principle of natural evolution to artificial systems, introduced more than three decades ago, has seen impressive growth in the past few years. Usually grouped under the term evolutionary algorithms or evolutionary computation, we find the domains of genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, and genetic programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As a generic example of artificial evolution, we consider genetic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>A genetic algorithm is an iterative procedure that consists of a constant-size population of individuals, each one represented by a finite string of symbols, known as the genome, encoding a possible solution in a given problem space. This space, referred to as the search space, comprises all possible solutions to the problem at hand. The algorithm sets out with an initial population of individuals that is generated at random or heuristically. At every evolutionary step, known as a generation, the individuals in the current population are decoded and evaluated according to some predefined quality criterion, referred to as the fitness, or fitness function. To form a new population (the next generation), individuals are selected according to their fitness and then transformed via genetically inspired operators, of which the most well known are crossover and mutation. Iterating this procedure, the genetic algorithm may eventually find an acceptable solution, i.e., one with high fitness.</p><p>Evolutionary algorithms are common nowadays, having been successfully applied to numerous problems from different domains, including optimization, automatic programming, machine learning, economics, immune systems, ecology, population genetics, studies of evolution and learning, and social systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Large-Scale Programmable Circuits</head><p>An integrated circuit is called programmable when the user can configure its function by programming. The circuit is delivered after manufacturing in a generic state and the user can adapt it by programming a particular function. In this paper we consider solely programmable logic circuits, where the programmable function is a logic one, ranging from simple Boolean functions to complex state machines. The programmed function is coded as a string of bits representing the configuration of the circuit. Note that there is a difference between programming a standard microprocessor chip and programming a programmable circuit-the former involves the specification of a sequence of actions, or instructions, while the latter involves a configuration of the machine itself, often at the gate level.</p><p>The first programmable circuits allowed the implementation of logic circuits that were expressed as a logic sum of products. These are the PLD's (programmable logic devices), whose most popular version is the PAL (programmable array logic). More recently a novel technology has emerged, affording higher flexibility and more complex functionality: the fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. An FPGA is an array of logic cells placed in an infrastructure of interconnections, which can be programmed at three distinct levels (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>): 1) the function of the logic cells, 2) the interconnections between cells, and 3) the inputs and outputs. All three levels are configured via a string of bits that is loaded from an external source, either once or several times. In the latter case the FPGA is considered reconfigurable.</p><p>FPGA's are highly versatile devices that offer the designer a wide range of design choices. This potential power, however, necessitates a suite of tools to design a system. Essentially, these generate the configuration bit string, given such inputs as a logic diagram or a high-level functional description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Evolvable Hardware: The Present</head><p>If one carefully examines the work carried out to date under the heading evolvable hardware, it becomes evident that this Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. A schematic diagram of an FPGA. An FPGA is an array of logic cells placed in an infrastructure of interconnections, which can be programmed at three distinct levels: 1) the function of the logic cells, 2) the interconnections between cells, and 3) the inputs and outputs. All three levels are configured via a configuration bit string that is loaded from an external source, either once or several times. mostly involves the application of evolutionary algorithms to the synthesis of digital systems [14] (recently, Koza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> studied analog systems as well). From this perspective, evolvable hardware is simply a subdomain of artificial evolution, where the final goal is the synthesis of an electronic circuit. The work of Koza <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which includes the application of genetic programming to the evolution of a three-variable multiplexer and a two-bit adder, may be considered an early precursor along this line. It should be noted that at the time the main goal was that of demonstrating the capabilities of the genetic programming methodology, rather than designing actual circuits. We argue that the term evolutionary circuit design would be more descriptive of such work than that of evolvable hardware (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>). For now, we shall remain with the latter (popular) term; however, we shall return to the issue of clarifying definitions in Section II-E.</p><p>Evolvable hardware, taken as a design methodology, offers a major advantage over classical methods. The designer's job is reduced to constructing the evolutionary setup, which involves specifying the circuit requirements, the basic elements, and the testing scheme used to assign fitness (this latter phase is often the most difficult). If these have been well designed, evolution may then (automatically) generate the desired circuit. Currently, most evolved digital designs are suboptimal with respect to traditional methodologies; however, improved results are regularly demonstrated. When examining work carried out to date, one can derive a rough classification of current evolvable hardware, in accordance with the genome encoding (i.e., the circuit description), and the calculation of a circuit's fitness.</p><p>1) Genome Encoding:</p><p>• High-level languages. Using a high-level functional language to encode the circuits in question means that the final solution must be transformed to obtain an actual circuit. Thus, such a representation is far removed from the structural (schematic) description. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the evolved solution is a program describing the (desired) multiplexer or adder rather than an interconnection diagram of logic elements (the actual hardware representation). Hemmi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> used a high-level hardware description language to represent the genomes. Koza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> and Kitano <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref> used the rewriting operation, in addition to crossover and mutation, to enable the formation of a hierarchical structure. This is still done within the framework of a high-level language. • Low-level languages. The idea of directly incorporating the bit string representing the configuration of a programmable circuit within the genome was expressed early on by Atmar <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> and more recently by de Garis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> and Higuchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. As a first step one must choose the basic logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, and NOT) and suitably codify them, along with the interconnections between gates, to produce the genome encoding. An example of this approach is offered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. Higuchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> used a low-level bit string representation of the system's logic diagram to describe small-scale PAL's, where the circuit is restricted to a logic sum of products. The limitations of the PAL circuits have been overcome to a large extent by the introduction of FPGA's, as used, e.g., by Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. The use of a low-level circuit description that requires no further transformation is an important step forward since this potentially enables placing the genome directly in the actual circuit, thus paving the way toward truly evolvable hardware (we shall elaborate upon this point in Section II-E). Until recently, however, FPGA's had presented two major problems: 1) the genome's length was on the order of tens of thousands of bits, rendering evolution practically impossible using current technology, and 2) within the circuit space, consisting of all representable circuits, a large number were invalid (e.g., containing short circuits).</p><p>With the introduction of the new family of FPGA's, the Xilinx 6200 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, these problems have been reduced. As with previous FPGA families, there is a direct correspondence between the bit string of a cell and the actual logic circuit; however, this now always leads to a viable system (i.e., with no short circuits). Moreover, as opposed to previous FPGA's where one had to configure the entire system, the new family permits the separate configuration of each cell, a markedly faster and more flexible process. Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> has employed this latter characteristic to reduce the genome's size, without, however, introducing real-time, partial system reconfigurations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Fitness Calculation:</head><p>• Off-line evolvable hardware. The use of a high-level language for the genome representation means that one has to transform the encoded system to evaluate its fitness. This is carried out by simulation, with only the final solution found by evolution actually implemented in hardware. This form of simulated evolution is known as off-line evolvable hardware [14].</p><p>• On-line evolvable hardware. As noted above, the lowlevel genome representation enables a direct configuration (and reconfiguration) of the circuit, thus entailing the possibility of using real hardware during the evolutionary process. This has been called on-line evolution by some of the works found in [14].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Common Features of Current Phylogenetic Hardware</head><p>Examining work carried out to date we find many common characteristics that span most current systems, both on-line and off-line, often differing from biological evolution (this difference is not necessarily disparaging, as discussed in Section V).</p><p>• Evolution pursues a predefined goal: the design of an electronic circuit, subject to precise specifications. Upon finding the desired circuit, the evolutionary process terminates.</p><p>• The population has no material existence. At best, in what has been called on-line evolution, there is one circuit available, onto which individuals from the (offline) population are loaded one at a time, to evaluate their fitness. • The absence of a real population in which individuals coexist simultaneously entails notable difficulties in the realization of interactions between "organisms." This usually results in a completely independent fitness calculation, contrary to nature which exhibits a coevolutionary scenario. • If one attempts to resolve a well-defined problem, involving the search for a specific combinatorial or sequential logic system, there are no intermediate approximations.</p><p>Fitness calculation is carried out by consulting a lookup table which is a complete description of the circuit in question, that must be stored somewhere. This casts some doubts as to the utility of applying an evolutionary process, since one can directly implement the lookup table in a memory device, a solution which may often be faster and cheaper. • The evolutionary mechanisms are executed outside the resulting circuit. This includes the operators (selection, crossover, mutation) as well as fitness calculation. As for the latter, while what has been advanced as on-line evolution uses a real circuit for fitness evaluation, the fitness values themselves are stored elsewhere. • The different phases of evolution are carried out sequentially, controlled by a central software unit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Categorizing Current and Future Evolvable Hardware</head><p>The phylogenetic axis admits four qualitative subdivisions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>• At the bottom of this axis, we find what is in essence evolutionary circuit design, where all operations are carried out in software, with the resulting solution possibly loaded onto a real circuit. Though a potentially useful design methodology, this falls completely within the realm of When the fitness criterion is imposed by the user in accordance with the task to be solved, one attains a form of guided evolution. This is to be contrasted with open-ended evolution occurring in nature, which admits no externally imposed fitness criterion, but rather an implicit, emergent, dynamical one (that could arguably be summed up as survivability).</p><p>traditional evolutionary techniques. As examples one can cite the works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. • Moving upward along the axis, one finds research in which a real circuit is used during the evolutionary process, though most operations are still carried out offline, in software. Examples are <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, where fitness calculation is carried out on a real circuit. Thompson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> evolved a hardware controller for a two-wheeled autonomous mobile robot that was required to display simple wall-avoidance behavior in an empty rectangular arena. A standard genetic algorithm was used, with a population of 30 individuals, each one consisting of a 60-bit representation of a dynamic state machine.</p><p>Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> evolved an FPGA circuit, consisting of 10 10 cells, to discriminate between square waves of 1 kHz and 10 kHz presented as inputs. Again, a standard genetic algorithm was employed, with a population of 50 individuals, each one a string of 1800 bits (18 configuration bits per cell), representing a possible circuit. In both cases, a single real circuit was available (one robot in the first experiment and a single FPGA board in the second), with a sequential evaluation of every individual taking place on that circuit, at each evolutionary generation. An interesting aspect of these works concerns the unconstrained use of hardware. While conventional (human) design requires constraints to be applied to the circuit's spatial structure and dynamical behavior, evolution can do away with these. The circuits evolved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> had no spatial structure enforced (e.g., limitations upon recurrent connections), no impositions upon modularity, nor any dynamical constraints such as a synchronizing clock or handshaking between modules.</p><p>Another example that can be situated within this subdivision of the phylogenetic axis is the works of Murakawa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> and Iwata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. One of the major obstacles which they wished to overcome is that of large genome size (defining the FPGA's configuration). Toward this end they proposed two solutions: 1) variable-length chromosome genetic algorithm (VGA), where the genome does not directly represent the configuration bit string but rather codifies the possible logical operations and interconnections <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. A decoder is therefore necessary to translate the genome into an FPGA configuration string. This decoder is, however, much simpler than the compilation tools associated with high-level hardware description languages (such as VHDL<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> ); therefore this solution reduces the genome's size without incurring a high computational cost. 2) Evolution at the function level, where the basic units are not elementary logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, and NOT), but rather higher-level functions (e.g., sine-wave generator, multiplier) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. Since no such commercial FPGA currently exists, they proposed a novel architecture, dubbed (function-based FPGA). One can combine both solutions, using VGA encoding with an architecture. The methodologies proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> were targeted at applications involving real-time adaptation in a changing environment. This raises a problem regarding fitness evaluation: since each individual in the (off-line) population is sequentially downloaded onto the (single) real circuit available, real-time behavior cannot be attained during the evolutionary phase, but only upon its termination. Their solution to this problem was to use two real circuits, one submerged within the environment in question, executing the configuration of the best evolved individual so far, the other serving for (sequential) fitness calculation. This two-circuit system enables the use of an actual circuit, while additionally exhibiting real-time behavior.</p><p>It is important to note that while experiments of the above type have been referred by some as on-line evolution, there is a prominent off-line aspect since the population is stored in an external computer, which also controls the evolutionary process. It would probably be more appropriate to reserve the term on-line for the next subdivision.</p><p>• Still further along the phylogenetic axis, one finds systems in which all operations (selection, crossover, mutation), as well as fitness evaluation, are carried out on-line, in hardware. The major aspect missing concerns the fact that evolution is not open ended, i.e., there is a predefined goal and no dynamic environment to speak of. An example is the work of Goeke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, where an evolving cellular system was implemented in which evolution takes place completely on-line. It is based on the cellular automata model, a discrete dynamical system that performs computations in a distributed fashion on a spatially extended grid. A cellular automaton consists of an array of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of possible states, updated synchronously in discrete time steps according to a local, identical interaction rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. The state of a cell at the next time step is determined by the current states of a surrounding neighborhood of cells. This transition is usually specified in the form of a rule table, delineating the cell's next state for each possible neighborhood configuration. The cellular array (grid) is -dimensional, where is used in practice. Nonuniform cellular automata have also been considered in which the local update rule need not be identical for all grid cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the cellular programming evolutionary algorithm of Sipper <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>), Goeke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> implemented an evolving, one-dimensional, nonuniform cellular automaton. Each of the system's 56 binary-state cells contains a genome that represents its rule table. These genomes are initialized at random, thereupon to be subjected to evolution. The environment imposed on the system specifies the resolution of a global synchronization task: upon presentation of a random initial configuration of cellular states, the system must reach, after a bounded number of time steps, a configuration whereupon the states of the cells oscillate between all zeros and all ones on successive time steps. This may be compared to a swarm of fireflies, thousands of which may flash on and off in unison, having started from totally uncoordinated flickerings. Each insect has its own rhythm, which changes only through local interactions with its neighbors' lights <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> (for a review on other phenomena in nature involving synchronous oscillation, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>). Due to the local connectivity of the system, this global behavior involving the entire grid comprises a difficult task. Nonetheless, applying the evolutionary process of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>, the system evolves (i.e., the genomes change) such that the task is solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. The evolving cellular system described in the previous paragraph exhibits complete on-line evolution, all operators being carried out in hardware with no reference to an external computer. This demonstrates that evolving ware, evolware <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>, can be constructed (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The evolware board was implemented using FPGA circuits, configured such that each cell within the system behaves in a certain general manner, after which evolution is used to find the cell's specific behavior, i.e., its rule table. Thus, the system consists of a fixed part and an evolving part, both specified via FPGA configuration strings. An interesting outlook on this setup is to consider the evolutionary process as one where an organism evolves within a given species, the former specified by the FPGA's evolving part, the latter specified by the fixed part. This raises the interesting issue of evolving the species itself.</p><p>• The last subdivision, situated at the top of the phylogenetic axis, involves a population of hardware entities evolving in an open-ended environment. When the fitness criterion is imposed by the user in accordance with the task to be solved (currently the rule with artificial evolution techniques), one attains a form of guided, or directed, evolution. This is to be contrasted with openended evolution occurring in nature, which admits no externally imposed fitness criterion, but rather an implicit, emergent, dynamical one (that could arguably be summed up as survivability). Open-ended, undirected evolution is the only form of evolution known to produce such devices as eyes, wings, and nervous systems and to give rise to the formation of species. Undirectedness may have to be applied to artificial evolution if we want to observe the emergence of completely novel systems. We argue that only the last category can be truly considered evolvable hardware, a goal which still eludes us at present. We point out that a more correct term would probably be evolving hardware. A natural application area for such systems is within the field of autonomous robots, which involves machines capable of operating in unknown environments without human intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>. A related application domain is that of controllers for noisy, changing environments. Another interesting example would be what we call Hard-Tierra, involving the hardware implementation (e.g., using FPGA circuits) of the Tierra "world," which consists of an openended environment of evolving computer programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> A small-scale experiment along this line was undertaken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. The idea of Hard-Tierra is important since it demonstrates that open-endedness does not necessarily imply a real, biological environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE ONTOGENETIC AXIS: REPLICATING</head><p>AND REGENERATING HARDWARE The ontogenetic axis involves the development of a single individual from its own genetic material, essentially without environmental interactions. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> (based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>) ontogeny can be considered orthogonal to phylogeny. The main process involved in the ontogenetic axis can be summed up as growth, or construction. Ontogenetic hardware exhibits such characteristics as replication and regeneration which find their use in many applications. For example, replicating systems have the ability to self-repair upon suffering heavy damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> and have been proposed as an economical means of space exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. Replication can in fact be considered a special case of growth-this process involves the creation of an identical organism by Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The firefly evolware board. The system is an evolving, one-dimensional, nonuniform cellular automaton. Each of the 56 cells contains a genome that represents its rule table; these genomes are randomly initialized, thereupon to be subjected to evolution. The board contains the following components: 1) LED indicators of cell states (top), 2) switches for manually setting the initial states of cells (top, below LED's), 3) Xilinx FPGA chips (below switches), 4) display and knobs for controlling two parameters ("time steps" and "configurations") of the cellular programming algorithm (bottom left), 5) a synchronization indicator (middle left), 6) a clock pulse generator with a manually adjustable frequency from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz (bottom middle), 7) an LCD display of evolved rule tables and fitness values obtained during evolution (bottom right), and 8) a power-supply cable (extreme left). (Note that this is the system's sole external connection.) Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The phylogenetic and ontogenetic axes can be considered orthogonal. The figure shows two generations preceded and followed by an indefinite number of generations. Ontogeny involves the development of the phenotype in a given generation (horizontal arrows), while phylogeny involves the succession of generations through reproduction of the genotype (vertical arrows). Note that genes, the basic constituents of the genome, act on two quite different levels: they participate in the developmental process, influencing the development of the phenotype in a given generation, and they participate in genetics, having themselves copied down the generations (reproduction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>.</p><p>duplicating the genetic material of a mother entity onto a daughter one, thereby creating an exact clone. It is important to distinguish between two distinct terms, replication and reproduction, which are often considered synonymous. Replication is an ontogenetic, developmental process, involving no genetic operators, resulting in an exact duplicate of the parent organism (as in the budding process of the hydra, described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>). Reproduction, on the other hand, is a phylogenetic process, involving genetic operators such as crossover and mutation, thereby giving rise to variety and ultimately to evolution (note that reproduction has been justly placed on the vertical axis of Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p><p>Research on ontogenetic systems began with von Neumann's work in the late 1940's on self-replicating machines. This work was later extended by others, and more recently we have seen the emergence of systems that exhibit other ontogenetic mechanisms, such as cellular division and cellular differentiation. This line of research can be divided into four stages, placed along the ontogenetic axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>).</p><p>• Von Neumann <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>) and his successors Banks <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>, Burks <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>, and Codd <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref> developed selfreplicating automata capable of universal computation (i.e., able to simulate a universal Turing machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref>) and of universal construction (i.e., able to construct any automaton described by an artificial genome). While the complexity of these automata is such that no full physical implementation has yet been possible, the von Neumann cell has recently been implemented in hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. • Langton <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref> and his successors Byl <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>, Reggia et al.</p><p>[59], and Morita and Imai <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref> developed self-replicating automata which are much simpler and which have been simulated in their entirety. These machines, however, lack any computing and constructing capabilities, with their sole functionality being that of self-replication. • Tempesti <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref> and Perrier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62]</ref> developed selfreplicating automata inspired by Langton's work, yet endowed with finite <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref> or universal <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62]</ref> computational capabilities. • One of the defining characteristics of a biological cell concerns its role as the smallest part of a living being which carries the complete plan of the being, that is its genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref>. In this respect, the above self-replicating automata are unicellular organisms: there is a single genome describing (and contained within) the entire machine. Mange et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref> and Marchal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref> proposed a new architecture called embryonics, or embryonic electronics. Based on three features usually associated with the ontogenetic process in living organisms, namely, multicellular organization, cellular differentiation, and cellular division, they introduced a new cellular automaton, complex enough for universal computation, yet simple enough for a physical implementation through the use of commercially available digital circuits. They developed an artificial cell, a biodule (biological module), comprising three structures found in living cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>: 1) a plastic box constitutes the external membrane, ensuring the cell's material encasement and realizing all the electronic functions necessary for communication with neighboring cells, 2) a processor responsible for interpreting the genome constitutes the cytoplasm, in analogy to a ribosome, and 3) a random access memory (RAM) acts as the cell's nucleus, containing a copy of the entire genetic makeup, i.e., a genome composed of a linear sequence of genes.</p><p>The biodule cell is used as an elementary unit from which multicellular organisms can ontogenetically develop to perform useful tasks (e.g., act as universal Turing machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>). Cellular differentiation takes place by having each cell compute its coordinates (i.e., position) within a two-dimensional space, after which it can extract the specific gene within the genome responsible for the cell's functionality. Cellular division occurs when a mother cell, the zygote, arbitrarily placed within the twodimensional grid, multiplies to fill a large portion of the space, thus forming a multicellular organism. In addition to self-replication, this artificial organism also exhibits self-repair capabilities, another biologically inspired phenomenon. To embed universal construction, Mange et al. are designing the basic cell with a molecular organization, similar to that of the transcription-translation mechanism (ribosome) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>. Such self-replicating machines are multicellular artificial organisms, in the sense that each of the several cells comprising the organism contains one copy of the complete genome. Several other works can be placed along the ontogenetic axis, including, e.g., L-systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>, cellular encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref>, graph generation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>, and self-replicating programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>. We have not discussed these at length as they are currently implemented solely in software, while our emphasis is on hardware systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. THE EPIGENETIC AXIS: LEARNING HARDWARE</head><p>The epigenetic axis involves learning through environmental interactions that take place after formation of the individual. To the best of our knowledge, there exist three major epigenetic systems in living multicellular organisms: the nervous system, the immune system, and the endocrine system, with the first two having already served as inspiration for engineers. The nervous system has received the most attention, giving rise to the field of artificial neural networks. This will be Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. An artificial cell: the biodule. A processor responsible for interpreting the genome constitutes the cytoplasm, in analogy to a ribosome, along with a RAM acting as the cell's nucleus, containing a copy of the entire genetic makeup, i.e., the genome. Displayed on the top cover are the cell's coordinates, as well as the specific gene within the genome that determines its functionality; these are acquired during cellular differentiation. The KILL button is used to induce the self-repair (regeneration) mechanism.</p><p>the focus of our discussion below. The immune system has inspired systems for detecting software errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>, controllers for mobile robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>, and immune systems for computers <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref>. Immunity of living organisms is a major domain of biology. It has been demonstrated that the immune system is capable of learning, recognizing, and, above all, eliminating foreign bodies which continuously invade the organism. Moreover, when viewed from the engineering standpoint, it is most interesting that immunity is maintained when faced with a dynamically changing environment. This feature leads us to surmise that the immune system, if implemented as an engineering model, can provide a new tool suitable for confronting dynamic problems, involving unknown, possibly hostile, environments. The human endocrine system is made up of a large number of glandular tissues that have in common the fact that they secrete directly into the blood stream chemical messengers, known as hormones, that regulate and integrate bodily functions (such as reproduction). This system resembles in some of its functionalities the nervous system in that both help the individual cope with changes in its environment.</p><p>The nervous system remains the most popular epigenetic source of inspiration for engineers. From a biological point of view, it has been determined that the genome contains the formation rules that specify the outline of the nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. It is primarily the synapses, the zones of contact between two neurons, where learning takes place, through interactions with the environment during the organism's lifetime. The nervous system of living organisms thus represents a mixture of the innate and the acquired, the latter precluding the possibility of its direct hereditary transmission under Darwinian evolution.</p><p>A predominant approach in the field of artificial neural networks consists of applying a learning algorithm to the modification of synaptic weights, using a predesigned network topology. A prime difference between simple rote learning and intelligent learning is the generalization process taking place in the latter. One can view a predesigned network as an implementation of a learned system that exhibits instinctive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref>. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the human brain has many more such instinctive networks than is usually acknowledged <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref>, possibly due to their being faster and less resource-demanding with respect to learning systems, which adapt continuously within a dynamic environment. Learning networks exhibit the plasticity necessary to confront complex, dynamical tasks and must be able to adapt at two distinct levels, changing the dynamics of interneuron interactions (usually through changes in synaptic weights) as well as modifying the network topology itself. Topology modification has proven to be a successful solution to a problem known as the stability-plasticity dilemma, i.e., how can a learning system preserve what it has previously learned, while continuing to incorporate new knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref>. Evolution may ultimately replace such learning networks by instinctive ones, e.g., via the Baldwin effect, whereby a learned (acquired) behavior becomes embedded within the organism's genome (i.e., its innate behavioral repertoire) through evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref> (this may be considered a melange of phylogeny and epigenesis, an issue which shall be expanded upon in Section V).</p><p>Artificial neural networks have been implemented many times, mostly in software rather than in hardware, though only the latter concern us here. On-line learning is essential if one wishes to obtain learning systems as opposed to merely learned ones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref>). While neural network hardware had already appeared in the 1980's <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83]</ref>, only today are we seeing the birth of the technology that enables true on-line learning.</p><p>Several network models with modifiable topologies have been proposed, including growing neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[84]</ref>, neural networks with incremental learning algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[85]</ref>, and construction algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[86]</ref>. To our knowledge, none of these have been implemented as on-line hardware, probably due to the high cost incurred. Recently, a number of FPGAbased neural network systems have appeared, though without dynamic restructuring <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[87]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. Perez and Sanchez <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref> have developed a network architecture dubbed FAST (flexible adaptable-size topology) that implements an unsupervised clustering algorithm, where the network must discover correlations within the input data and cluster, or categorize them accordingly. The network's topology changes dynamically, Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. Combining POE axes to create novel bio-inspired systems: The PO plane involves evolving hardware that exhibits ontogenetic characteristics, such as growth, replication, and regeneration, the PE plane includes, e.g., evolutionary artificial neural networks, the OE plane combines ontogenetic mechanisms (self-replication, self-repair) with epigenetic (e.g., neural network) learning, and finally, the POE space comprises systems that exhibit characteristics pertaining to all three axes. An example of the latter would be an artificial neural network (epigenetic axis), implemented on a self-replicating multicellular automaton (ontogenetic axis), whose genome is subject to evolution (phylogenetic axis).</p><p>with a new neuron being added when a sufficiently distinct input pattern is encountered, and an active neuron being deleted through the application of probabilistic deactivation. Each neuron maintains an -dimensional reference vector and a threshold, both of which determine its sensitivity region, i.e., the input vectors to which it is maximally sensitive. The network adapts to a particular environment (problem) through an interplay between three processes: 1) classical learning (through modifications to reference vectors and thresholds), 2) incremental growth (addition of new neurons), and 3) pruning (deactivation of active neurons). To date, a four-neuron prototype has been implemented using FPGA's and FPIC's (field-programmable interconnection circuits) and applied to the solution of pattern recognition and enhancement problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref>. This latter approach is currently being applied to the construction of an on-line robotic neurocontroller. Moreno <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[92]</ref> examined a number of topology-restructuring neural network algorithms with respect to their amenability to VLSI implementation. Other interesting paths are those that combine two or three axes of the POE model, as discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS: TOWARD NOVEL BIO-INSPIRED HARDWARE SYSTEMS</head><p>We presented the POE model for classifying bio-inspired hardware systems, based on three axes: phylogeny, ontogeny, and epigenesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We described each axis and provided examples of systems situated along them. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> A natural extension which suggests itself is the combination of two, and ultimately all three axes, to attain novel bio-inspired hardware (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). As examples we propose the following.</p><p>• The PO plane. This involves evolving hardware that exhibits ontogenetic characteristics, such as growth, replication, and regeneration. For example, Sipper and Tomassini <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[93]</ref> evolved nonuniform cellular automata to act as random number generators. Mange et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> showed that such evolved generators can be implemented by a multicellular automaton that exhibits self-replication and self-repair. Thus, the eventual combination of these two projects can be considered to be in the phylogeneticontogenetic plane. • The PE plane. The architecture of the brain is the result of a long evolutionary process, during which a large set of specialized subsystems interactively emerged, carrying out tasks necessary for survival and reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94]</ref>. Learning (epigenesis) in biological neural systems can be considered to serve as a mechanism for fine-tuning these broadly laid out neural circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[95]</ref>. Although it is impossible that the genes code all structural information about the brain (Section I), they may be the ultimate determinant of what it can and cannot learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref>.</p><p>The idea of evolutionary, artificial neural networks, situated in the PE plane, has received attention in recent years. This involves a population of neural networks, where evolution takes place at the global (population) level, with learning taking place at the individual (neural network) level. Examples are the works of Liu and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[97]</ref>, Nolfi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[98]</ref>, and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[99]</ref>, though they are currently completely off-line. Another interesting (natural) example that may be considered to reside within the PE plane is that of the Baldwin effect, which exhibits an intricate interplay between phylogeny and epigenesis (see Section IV). The use of this process in simulated systems has been explored, e.g., by <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[100]</ref>. As a final case in point regarding the PE plane in nature one can consider the issue of language acquisition in human beings, specifically, to what extent is this remarkable ability innate (phylogenetic) or acquired (epigenetic). (For a recent discussion and brief historical perspective, see Dennett <ref type="bibr">[101, ch. 13]</ref>. For an exploration of this issue in artificial settings, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[102]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[104]</ref>.) • The OE plane. According to selectionism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[105]</ref>), selective pressures operate on epigenetic variation during the ontogeny of the individual (in "somatic" time), not on a phylogenetic time scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[106]</ref>. This suggests the possibility of combining the ontogenetic mechanisms discussed above, with the epigenetic (neural network) learning algorithms. As an example, one can cite the works of de Garis <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[107]</ref> and Gers and de Garis <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108]</ref>, which involve the ontogenetic growth of a neural network that can then undergo epigenetic learning. Currently, only the ontogenetic part has been reported upon, with learning yet to be demonstrated. The FAST neural network with its dynamically changing topology (Section IV) can be extended into the OE plane by obtaining the topology via an ontogenetic process (e.g., as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>). Inductive learning can be interpreted as the capability to infer a response to an unknown situation, achieved through generalizing from previously encountered, known situations. Engineers are perpetually confronted with a tradeoff between generalization and robustness. While adding a multitude of neurons increases the system's fault tolerance, there is a risk of overfitting if we do not attempt to generalize <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[109]</ref>. Implementing neurons in hardware is generally quite expensive, so it is imperative that cost-effectiveness be considered, trying to obtain the smallest possible network. Once a good generalization is obtained (with respect to a certain problem or situation), fault tolerance can be achieved through other self-repair mechanisms, e.g., those used by the embryonics system (Section III).</p><p>• The POE space. The development of an artificial neural network (epigenetic axis), implemented on a selfreplicating multicellular automaton (ontogenetic axis), whose genome is subject to evolution (phylogenetic axis), constitutes a possible example situated in the POE space (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). Bio-inspired hardware systems to date mostly exhibit a clear separation between the POE axes, each plainly situated along a single one. Possible extensions were noted above, including systems that reside in one of the three planes, and eventually within the POE space. In fact, the success of the "POE community's" endeavor can be measured by the disappearance (extinction?) of the POE model (or rather its utility). This will ensue from the composition of future systems which may eventually exhibit characteristics of all three axes, i.e., reside within the POE space. At such time, the POE model will have outlived its usefulness.</p><p>Note that the systems considered in this paper are bioinspired. This means that, while motivated by observations of nature, strict adherence to her solutions is not a sine qua non. As an example, consider the issue of Lamarckian evolution, which involves the direct inheritance of acquired characteristics. While the biological theory of evolution has shifted from Lamarckism to Darwinism, this does not preclude the use of artificial Lamarckian evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110]</ref>. Another example concerns the time scales of natural processes, where phylogenetic changes occur at much slower rates than either ontogenetic or epigenetic ones, a characteristic which need not necessarily hold in our case. Thus, deviations from what is strictly natural may definitely be of use in bio-inspired systems.</p><p>Comparing our current artificial systems with those found in nature is beyond the scope of this paper. Moreover, this would require devising a sophisticated scheme, involving a set of comparison criteria and measures. Nonetheless, it is interesting to consider one aspect, that of genome size. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> presents the genome sizes of some natural and artificial systems, clearly demonstrating our present, comparatively primitive, state. Even one of the most complex artificial systems (in terms of genome size), namely, von Neumann's self-replicating universal constructor, is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than a simple bacterium. Furthermore, this system was not evolved, but rather designed by hand, and is highly intolerant of errors-inversion of a single bit in the genome will almost always result in the machine's complete destruction. For the evolved systems it is evident that we are still far removed from even the simplest natural organisms.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113]</ref> AS QUOTED IN <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[114]</ref>. THE ESTIMATE OF THE SIZE OF VON NEUMANN'S SELF-REPLICATING UNIVERSAL CONSTRUCTOR IS BASED ON <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>)</p><p>Note that not only is genome size much smaller for artificial systems, there is also an absence of noncoding "DNA," a prominent feature of natural organisms. The importance of this phenomenon is not yet fully understood (for studies of this issue within an artificial evolution framework see <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[111]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112]</ref>). On a more reflective (and somewhat philosophical) note, one can consider the works described herein as a collective effort in what amounts, perhaps, to the origins of a new biology. The evolutionary history of our planet has seen the nascence and, more prominently, extinction, of untold numbers of species. An analogous process is taking place at this very instant in several research facilities around the globe. Artificial species, such as those described in this paper, are being born (currently through design, but ultimately, perhaps, via evolution), to be immediately subjected to competition with their congeners, giving rise to selection forces at the species level. In analogy to nature, the years to come may see the appearance and disappearance of entire artificial species. Granted, we are currently at the "primordial-soup" stage, yet it would be interesting to take, especially at this early point, a historical stance. Our current position is unique in that we can trace out the entire phylogenetic tree of this new biology, including the discontinued kingdoms, phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species, thereby obtaining a complete history, or lineage. This is in contrast to nature, where we can observe only those species that have survived the millenia, or have left prominent footmarks in the fossil record (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[101]</ref> for interesting discussions on some of the issues pertaining to natural evolution).</p><p>Looking (and dreaming) toward the future, one can imagine nano-scale (bioware) systems becoming a reality, which will be endowed with evolutionary, reproductive, regenerative, and learning capabilities. Such systems could give rise to novel species which will coexist alongside carbon-based organisms. and suggestions. They also thank A.

In contrast to evolutionary algorithms where fitness is defined by the user, the Tierra "creatures" (programs) receive no such direction. Rather, they compete for the natural resources of their computerized environment, namely, CPU time and memory. Since only a finite amount of these are available, the virtual world's natural resources are limited, as in nature, giving rise to competition between creatures. Ray observed the formation of an "ecosystem" within the Tierra world, including organisms of various sizes, parasites, and hyper-parasites<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>.</p></note>
