<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rapidly Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov</head><p>Functions and Hybrid Zero Dynamics Aaron D. Ames, Kevin Galloway, Koushil Sreenath, and Jessy W. Grizzle, Fellow, IEEE Abstract-This paper addresses the problem of exponentially stabilizing periodic orbits in a special class of hybrid models-systems with impulse effects-through control Lyapunov functions. The periodic orbit is assumed to lie in a submanifold that is contained in the zero set of an output function and is invariant under both the continuous and discrete dynamics; the associated restriction dynamics are termed the hybrid zero dynamics. The orbit is furthermore assumed to be exponentially stable within the hybrid zero dynamics. Prior results on the stabilization of such periodic orbits with respect to the full-order dynamics of the system with impulse effects have relied on input-output linearization of the dynamics transverse to the zero dynamics manifold. The principal result of this paper demonstrates that a variant of control Lyapunov functions that enforce rapid exponential convergence to the zero dynamics surface, , can be used to achieve exponential stability of the periodic orbit in the full-order dynamics, thereby significantly extending the class of stabilizing controllers. The main result is illustrated on a hybrid model of a bipedal walking robot through simulations and is utilized to experimentally achieve bipedal locomotion via control Lyapunov functions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION</head><p>F OR finite-dimensional nonlinear systems, exhibiting a Lyapunov function has been the gold standard for establishing stability properties of equilibrium points. Indeed, under mild conditions, the existence of a Lyapunov function with particular properties is equivalent to stability in the sense of Lyapunov, asymptotic stability, or exponential stability of an equilibrium point <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Moreover, once a Lyapunov function has been found, a region of attraction can be estimated; albeit, the estimate is often very conservative. Lyapunov functions have also been used to define and characterize input-to-state stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Recently, Lyapunov functions have seen a further surge of interest in the nonlinear systems community through powerful tools for obtaining them as sum of squares <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. All of this points to the power of Lyapunov functions in understanding nonlinear systems.</p><p>In the context of nonlinear control systems, since the groundbreaking work of Sontag <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and Artstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> control Lyapunov functions (CLF) have become central to feedback design. Roughly speaking, given a nonlinear control system with equilibrium point at the origin a positive definite function is a control Lyapunov function if, for each in the state space, there exists such that Domains of application include nonlinear adaptive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, robust nonlinear feedback design <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, receding horizon control of nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and stabilization of hybrid systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, to name only a few. An important aspect of using the control Lyapunov approach is that the designer is free to choose among an infinite number of feedback control laws that render the time derivative of the Lyapunov function negative definite. Of particular interest is the so-called "point-wise minimum norm" controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which at each instant of time selects the control value of minimum norm among all values rendering " " negative definite. If the set where the control takes values is convex, then it can be shown that this controller is also Lipschitz continuous <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The point-wise minimum norm controller is optimal with respect to a cost function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> therefore, control Lyapunov functions not only establish proofs of stability for nonlinear control systems through the generation of a family of controllers, but simultaneously have a direct relationship with optimality. The primary goal of this paper is to extend the control Lyapunov methodology to a class of hybrid systems that includes bipedal robots. The work is motivated by the practical problem of enlarging the class of feedback controllers that can create exponentially stable periodic walking gaits; such gaits correspond to exponentially stable periodic orbits in a class of systems with impulse effects. In the context of the overarching goal, and motivated by the application of robotic locomotion, this work presents three main novel results: extending control Lyapunov functions to allow direct control over the rate of exponential convergence to a (hybrid) zero dynamics surface; proving that exponentially stabilizing control Lyapunov functions allow for the extension of the stable periodic orbits in the (hybrid) zero dynamics to stable periodic orbits in the full-order dynamics; and finally demonstrating these concepts both in simulation and experimentally on bipedal walking robots.</p><p>In order to put these results in context, it is necessary to review hybrid zero dynamics and the current paradigm for constructing controllers relative to the zero dynamics manifold. The notion of hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> as a feedback design method that could accommodate underactuation in bipedal robots and thereby move beyond quasi-static, flat-footed walking gaits. At its most basic level, the hybrid zero dynamics is an extension of the Byrnes-Isidori notion of zero dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to a hybrid setting, with the additional requirement that the invariant manifolds on which the zero dynamics is defined must also be invariant under the discrete reset maps. Outputs satisfying a vector relative degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> condition are designed for each phase of a hybrid model with the objective of creating an exponentially stable periodic orbit in the hybrid zero dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The feedback design is completed by rendering the zero dynamics manifold sufficiently rapidly exponentially attractive <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The motivation for assuring a sufficiently fast rate of exponential convergence is that the reset maps can be (and in practice, often are) "expansive", taking a solution that does not lie in the zero dynamics manifold and "pushing" it "further away" from the manifold. Hence, the convergence of the continuous dynamics to the manifold must be sufficiently "attractive" to overcome the "repulsion" of the reset map.</p><p>To date, the design of the controller assuring convergence to the zero dynamics manifold has been approached in three ways. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Hölder continuous feedbacks based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> were used to assure finite-time convergence. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, specially selected variables transverse to the zero dynamics manifold are Jacobian linearized and an exponentially stabilizing feedback is computed on the basis of LQR for periodic systems (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> (to only name a few), the transverse dynamics were input-output linearized and a high-gain time-invariant linear feedback was then employed; for example, when the outputs have vector relative degree 2, after creating a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs, the feedback is chosen to be Therefore, the vast body of work that utilizes hybrid zero dynamics for controller design essentially considers PD control on the outputs.</p><p>The objective of the present paper is to significantly expand the set of feedback controllers that can be used to render the zero dynamics sufficiently rapidly attractive to exponentially stabilize the periodic orbit in the full-dimensional hybrid model. A control Lyapunov function approach is taken, starting with a review of CLFs for periodic orbits of non-hybrid systems in Section II. Section III then revisits input-output linearization from a Lyapunov perspective and subsequently presents a CLF approach to obtaining exponential convergence bounds similar to the linear case. This section culminates with the derivation of the control <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, which is based on Sontag's construction. In Section IV we address the more general setting of affine control systems with an invariant zero dynamics surface. The goal is to analyze the full system dynamics in terms of the reduced system dynamics coupled with a CLF which converges sufficiently rapidly in the transverse dynamics. Such a CLF can be used in conjunction with the pointwise min-norm control described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. The main result of this paper, presented in Section V and proved in Section VI, applies the CLF approach in the context of hybrid systems. In particular, we show that for a CLF that is rapidly exponentially stabilizing, the existence of an exponentially stable periodic orbit in the hybrid zero dynamics implies the existence of a feedback rendering the periodic orbit exponentially stable in the full dynamics. The key difference with <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> is that asymptotic stability of the zero dynamics is not strong enough to achieve stability of the closed-loop system with the type of reset maps encountered in bipedal locomotion. Finally, Section VII describes simulation results for the CLF-based controllers implemented on a five-link bipedal walker model and Section VIII reports on experimental results.</p><p>The results presented in this paper were initially reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The present paper adds to the original contribution in the following important ways: the non-hybrid case is fully developed through Theorem 1; the proof of the main result-Theorem 2-is carried out in full while it was omitted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; and the theoretical results are verified experimentally. These factors combine to create a complete exposition on the application of control Lyapunov functions to hybrid zero dynamics with application to bipedal robotic locomotion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. EXPONENTIALLY STABILIZING CLFS AND PERIODIC ORBITS</head><p>The goal of this section is to provide conditions for establishing the exponential stability of a periodic orbit of a system on the basis of two lower-dimensional problems, specifically, establishing the exponential stability of a periodic orbit contained in an invariant submanifold and constructing a control Lyapunov function for the dynamics transverse to the submanifold. The problem of stabilizing a periodic orbit was first posed in these terms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We begin by considering an affine control system of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where, are the controlled (or output) states, are the uncontrolled states, is the set of admissible control values for , and , , and are open subsets of appropriately dimensioned Euclidean spaces. The vector fields , , and are assumed to be locally Lipschitz continuous. In addition, we assume that , so that the surface defined by with dynamics is invariant. \Because systems having the form of(1) naturally arise in the study of systems with zero dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, will be referred to as the zero dynamics manifold and the reduced system as the zero dynamics. The -dynamics are sometimes called the transverse dynamics. Models having the form of (1) also arise in the study of underactuated mechanical systems (i.e., fewer inputs than degrees of freedom) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, where the configuration variables are split into "actuated" and "unactuated" coordinates.</p><p>Moreover, the actuated configuration variables can be interpreted as a set of outputs with vector relative degree 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, meaning the inputs show up in the second derivative of the outputs, and the matrix multiplying the inputs, called the decoupling matrix, is square and full rank in a neighborhood of interest. In this case, the unactuated configuration variables and their first derivatives constitute the zero dynamics and the actuated variables and their first derivatives constitute the transverse dynamics.</p><p>Definition 1: (Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for continuous-time systems and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> for discrete-time systems.) For the system (1), a continuously differentiable function is an exponentially stabilizing control Lyapunov function (ES-CLF) if there exists positive constants such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(2)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>for all . We are interested in how the zero dynamics and an ES-CLF allow us to understand the stability of periodic orbits. To make the discussion precise, some elementary definitions and notation are recalled.</p><p>Motivated by the constructions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we define the set (4) consisting of the control values that result in .

The flow is periodic with period and fixed point if . Associated with a periodic flow is a periodic orbit . Similarly, we denote the flow of the zero dynamics by and for a periodic flow we denote the corresponding periodic orbit by . Due to the assumption that the zero dynamics surface is invariant, a periodic orbit for the zero dynamics, , corresponds to a periodic orbit for the full-order dynamics, , through the canonical embedding given by . Without loss of generality, we can assume that the norm on is constructed from norms on and respectively by . The distance of a point from a periodic orbit then satisfies (6)</p><p>A periodic orbit is exponentially stable if there exist such that if it follows that . The exponential stability of a periodic orbit in can be similarly defined. Theorem 1: (based on [19,Thm.2,]) For the system (1), let be an exponentially stable periodic orbit for the zero dynamics . If there exists an ES-CLF , then for all locally Lipschitz continuous feedbacks taking values in , is an exponentially stable periodic orbit of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><p>The proof is given in Appendix A, along with a result in Appendix A that highlights the connections between this part of the paper and Section V.</p><p>Theorem 1 provides conditions under which the exponential stability of a periodic orbit of a system can be determined from two lower-dimensional problems, specifically, establishing the exponential stability of a periodic orbit contained in a zero dynamics submanifold and constructing an ES-CLF for the dynamics transverse to the submanifold. The primary goal of this paper is to establish a similar result for a class of hybrid systems, where the zero dynamics will be replaced with the hybrid zero dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. In the hybrid context, a stronger notion of convergence is needed for the transverse dynamics because the reset map in a hybrid system may act as a persistent disturbance <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and may push solutions away from the desired orbit <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The need for a stronger form of convergence to counter the action of the reset map will lead to the notion of a rapidly exponentially stabilizing control Lyapunov function. Rather than directly introducing this notion, we will first motivate it by revisiting input/output linearization in the context of Lyapunov functions.</p></div>

Analogous to the case of non-hybrid systems in (1), we will begin with the assumption that the hybrid system already has a hybrid zero dynamics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>), which is a manifold that is invariant under both the continuous and the discrete dynamics of the hybrid system. The goal is to provide conditions for establishing the local exponential stability of a periodic orbit of a hybrid system on the basis of two lower-dimensional problems, namely, establishing the exponential stability of a periodic orbit contained in the hybrid zero dynamics and constructing a RES-CLF for the dynamics transverse to the submanifold.</p></div>

Because we focus on periodic orbits and solutions that evolve in a neighborhood of such orbits, we are primarily interested in the Poincaré map, which can be defined rather easily for the hybrid systems considered here.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. APPLICATION TO BIPEDAL WALKING</head><p>In this section we apply the main result of this paper in simulation with the model of a planar five-link bipedal robot which has a torso and two legs with revolute knees. The particular model we use is based on RABBIT (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), a robotic testbed developed at Laboratoire D'Automatique de Grenoble to explore fundamental issues in dynamic walking <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and running <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. RABBIT has four actuators to control hip and knee angles, and is connected to a rotating boom which constrains the robot to walk in a circle, approximating planar motion in the sagittal plane. MATLAB code for generating the equations of motion for RABBIT is available at http://web.eecs.umich.edu/ grizzle/biped_book_web/.</p><p>Detailed descriptions of RABBIT and the associated mathematical model can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>; we briefly summarize the model construction as follows. In the stance phase, a suitable set of coordinates is given by as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, where and are the femur angles (referenced to the torso), and are the knee angles, and is the absolute angle of the torso. The method of Lagrange yields the standard second order system (68) which is easily rearranged into the form (69) analogous to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. (Note that denotes the input torques provided by the four actuators.) To implement the control designs of Sections III-B and IV-B, we define output functions (70) where for some 1 5 row vector and is a 4 5 matrix satisfying (i.e., full rank). Our goal is to drive the controlled variables to match , which is the desired trajectory of the controlled variables as a function of , thereby imposing virtual constraints on the system. As is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, we parametrize as a Bezier polynomial. Also, note that has vector relative degree 2.</p><p>The impulsive nature of walking renders this a hybrid system, with the switching surface defined by the conditions under which the swing leg impacts the ground in front of the stance leg, i.e., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>, is the height of the foot. In particular, defining as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> results in a hybrid control system that can be expressed in the form of (49) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> for the specific construc-Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

In this case, describes the change in velocity due to foot strike <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>As described in Chapter 6 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, selection of the parameters for the Bezier polynomial can be accomplished by numerical solution of a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. By incorporating appropriate constraints into the optimization problem, we ensure that the selected parameters render the zero dynamics surface (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>) invariant and that the zero dynamics surface contains an exponentially stable periodic orbit transverse to the switching surface. Therefore, by design, the assumptions of Theorem 2 are satisfied. In order to render this orbit exponentially stable for the full-order dynamics, we first obtain a symmetric positive-definite matrix by either solving the Lyapunov equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) (with the matrix appropriately defined through choice of and ) or the Riccati <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, and then define as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Then employing the RES-CLF and applying either the Sontag control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> or the pointwise min-norm control law(45) results in a closed-loop hybrid system . Moreover, in both cases Theorem 2 implies that the periodic orbit is exponentially stable for sufficiently small.</p><p>The control approach described here was tested with computer simulations of four walking steps of the biped model. Plots of the associated CLF function for various values of are depicted for the Sontag controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(a) and for the pointwise min-norm controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b</ref>). In each case, the matrix was generated using the Lyapunov equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>). The middle graph in each figure shows slow convergence for one choice of ; smaller values result in faster convergence (top graphs), and values which are too large result in instability (bottom graphs). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>, we illustrate convergence to the periodic orbit for the coordinate for an extended version (16 steps) of the simulation depicted in the middle plot of Fig. <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>. Note that saturation was not implemented on the commanded control torques for any of the simulations, and peak torques were in the range of 60 Nm for the min-norm controller and 100 Nm for the Sontag controller. (See Section VIII for an experimental implementation in which saturations are applied.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>Having demonstrated the effectiveness of the CLF controllers in simulation, we now describe experimental results from implementation on the robotic testbed MABEL <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, a planar five-link bipedal robot similar to RABBIT, having a torso, two legs with revolute knees, and four actuators. (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>.) However, unlike RABBIT, MABEL has large springs in series with two of its actuators for improving energy efficiency and agility, resulting in a system model that is compliant and has a higher degree of underactuation. In the experiments on MABEL, the model used in the estimation of the derivative of the Lyapunov function, and hence in the computation of the CLF-based control law, is of course an approximation of the dynamics of the true system <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In addition, the angular measurements are made with encoders that have finite precision and the angular rates are estimated numerically <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Finally, the motors have torque limits. It is shown that the CLF-based controller nevertheless achieves a stable walking gait with MABEL and that the min-norm controller in particular reduces undesirable oscillations or "chatter" of the motor torques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Control Laws</head><p>As noted, MABEL has compliance and additional degrees of underactuation. However, we can still employ the same modeling and control approach based on virtual constraints, as described in Section VII. Thus our system model again takes the form (69), with coordinate labeling as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>(b), and with output functions of the form (70). For the experimental implementation, we apply the pre-control law (71) which is a variation of the pre-control given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Then transforming to the variables as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, we have the dynamics for the transverse variables <ref type="bibr">(72)</ref> where and are defined as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. In what follows, we present experimental results for a CLF controller based on the pointwise min-norm controller described in Section IV, and compare with experimental results based on an input-output linearizing controller with PD. The input-output linearizing controller has been employed in previous experiments with MABEL (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>) and takes the form (71) with given by <ref type="bibr">(73)</ref> which is equivalent to the version given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Description of Experiments and Results</head><p>Two experiments were conducted for the purpose of comparing the controllers just described. In Exp. 1, we employed the input-output linearizing controller (73) with gains set as described above, and obtained 85 steps of walking. For Exp. 2, we started the robot under the same input-output linearizing controller but then transitioned to the pointwise min-norm controller (77) after 28 steps. The robot then walked for an additional 77 steps under CLF control, as can be seen in the video in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> we display the motor torques for the stance and swing legs for 4 consecutive steps of walking under the inputoutput linearizing controller in Exp. 1, and the CLF controller in Exp. 2, respectively. (Torque saturation constraints were active in both experiments, as can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. The torque saturation for the leg shape was inadvertently raised from 10 to 12 Nm between the experiments, but the affect on experiment comparison is negligible.) Note the reduced motor torque oscillations for the controller based on the CLF approach. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> illustrates the desired and achieved virtual constraints for the stance leg under the two controllers, displaying very close tracking of the virtual constraints by the input-output linearizing controller and rather loose tracking of the virtual constraints by the CLF-based controller. In fact, this should be expected, since the CLF-based controller always uses the minimum torque required to meet the RES-CLF convergence bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, essentially trading off tracking performance for control efficiency as long as the required convergence bound is satisfied.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, we display plots of the Lyapunov function and its calculated derivative for 4 consecutive steps of walking under CLF control in Exp. 2. The thin black line on the bottom plot (denoted -online) depicts the online calculation of along trajectories of the partially linearized system (72) (in terms of (75)), and does not factor in the torque saturations  which are later applied to the full control (71) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . The thick red line on the same plot (denoted -offline) was calculated offline along trajectories of the full system dynamics (69) with the saturated versions of the control (71) with (77). The effects of these saturation constraints, along with model uncertainty, are the most likely reason that does not exactly follow the theoretical bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presented a method for enlarging the class of controllers that exponentially stabilize periodic orbits in hybrid systems. Beginning with (hybrid) zero dynamics that contain an exponentially stable periodic orbit, we presented a control Lyapunov function approach to designing controllers that stabilize the orbit in the full order dynamics. This was achieved by introducing a notion of control Lyapunov functions that allows for direct control of the rate of convergence to the (hybrid) zero dynamics surface: RES-CLF. Explicit motivation for this formu-lation was given, and an explicit means of constructing control Lyapunov functions of this form was presented. The culmination of the ideas presented in the paper was given in the main result which states that given an exponentially stable periodic orbit in a hybrid zero dynamics, the existence of a RES-CLF implies that this periodic orbit is exponentially stabilizable in the full-order dynamics. Since the theoretical results presented were originally motivated by bipedal robotic walking, they were applied in simulation to a model of the robot RABBIT. To provide further evidence of the practicality of the theoretical results, they were also applied experimentally to MABEL. The end result is that CLFs provide an interesting alternative to previous control methods, and that the CLF methodology presents a systematic approach for constructing stabilizing control laws for systems of this type. In a separate publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, it will be shown how the results of the paper allow control bounds to be explicitly incorporated into an online implementation of a RES-CLF controller.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEOREM 1 AND THEOREM 2</head><p>A natural consequence of Theorem 2 is a variant of Theorem 1.

However, the Lyapunov function (78) utilized in the proof of Theorem 1 includes a scale factor to weight the ES-CLF, and therefore both approaches rely on to "control" the convergence to the zero dynamics surface, i.e., ensure that it is fast enough to guarantee stability of the entire system.</p><p>We finally note that the techniques used to prove Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, while similar in many respects, are actually quite different. This difference lies in the fact that for Theorem 2 a Lyapunov function on the Poincaré section is used, while for Theorem 1 a Lyapunov function for the continuous dynamics (and the periodic orbit) is utilized. Extending the proof considered in the continuous case to the hybrid case is an interesting problem for future research since it would allow for a better estimate of the domain of attraction over the entire continuous dynamics rather than just the Poincaré section. Doing so would require an extension of the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to hybrid systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.

Plots of the Lyapunov function and its time derivative for 4 consecutive steps of walking. (Vertical dotted lines delineate data for individual steps.) Note that the increase in during the initial part of the gait is most likely due to torque saturation (see Fig. 6(b)) and model uncertainty. In the plot for , the thin black line depicts the derivative calculated in terms of the partially linearized dynamics (72) (without accounting for control saturation), which always satisfies the desired RES-CLF bound . The thick red line illustrates an offline calculation of along trajectories of the full dynamics, which incorporates torque saturation.</figDesc><graphic coords="13,39.00,268.14,252.00,126.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>

That is, the non-hybrid system is conceptually viewed as a "trivial" hybrid system. With this setup, the proof of Theorem 2 establishes Corollary 1.</p></note>
