Owing to the continuous evolution of new attacks and ever-increasing number of vulnerable hosts on the Internet, many DDoS attack detection or prevention mechanisms have been proposed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of DDoS attacks, detection methods and tools used in wired networks.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The minimal processing and best-effort forwarding of any packet, malicious or not, was the prime concern when the Internet was designed. This architecture creates an unregulated network path, which can be exploited by any cyber attacker motivated by revenge, prestige, politics or money. Denialof-service (DoS) attacks exploit this to target critical Web services <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This type of attack is intended to make a computer resource unavailable to its legitimate users. DoS attack programs have been around for many years. Old single source attacks are now countered easily by many defense mechanisms and the source of these attacks can be easily rebuffed or shut down with improved tracking capabilities. However, with the astounding growth of the Internet during the last decade, an increasingly large number of vulnerable systems are now available to attackers. Attackers can now employ a large number of these vulnerable hosts to launch an attack instead of using a single server, an approach which is not very effective and detected easily. A distributed DoS (DDoS) attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> is a large-scale, coordinated attack on the availability of services of a victim system or network resources, launched indirectly through many compromised computers on the Internet.</p><p>The first well-documented DDoS attack appears to have occurred in August 1999, when a DDoS tool called Trinoo was deployed in at least 227 systems, to flood a single University of Minnesota computer, which was knocked down for more than 2 days. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The first large-scale DDoS attack took place on February 2000 (see footnote 1). On February 7, Yahoo! was the victim of a DDoS attack during which its Internet portal was inaccessible for 3 h. On February 8, Amazon, Buy.com, cable news network and eBay were all hit by DDoS attacks that caused them to either stop functioning completely or slowed them down significantly (see footnote 1).</p><p>DDoS attack networks follow two types of architectures: the agent-handler architecture and the Internet Relay Chat (IRC)based architecture as discussed by Specht and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The agent-handler architecture for DDoS attacks is composed of clients, handlers and agents. The attacker communicates with the rest of the DDoS attack system at the client systems. The handlers are often software packages located throughout the Internet that are used by the client to communicate with the agents. Instances of the agent software are placed in the compromised systems that finally carry out the attack. The owners and users of the agent systems are generally unaware of the situation. In the IRC-based DDoS attack architecture, an IRC communication channel is used to connect the client(s) to the agents. IRC ports can be used for sending commands to the agents. This makes DDoS command packets more untraceable. Moreover, it is easier for an attacker to hide his presence in an IRC channel as such channels tend to have large volumes of traffic. A recent attacking tool by Anonymous based on the IRC protocol is Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It includes three primary methods of attacks for transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and is found in two versions: binary and web-based. It allows clients to connect remotely via the IRC protocol and to be a part of a system of compromised hosts. The bigger the size of compromised hosts, the more powerful the attack is. Between these two architectures, the agent-handler architecture is commonly found in use in the literature.</p><p>Along with the evolution of new DDoS attack tools, many DDoS defense mechanisms have also been proposed. These approaches are of three types depending on their locality of deployment: source-end approach, victim-end approach and innetwork approach. Detecting any DDoS attack at the victim end is easy, but often not useful after legitimate clients have been denied access. Source-end detection is a very challenging task. Detection approaches used include statistical, soft computing, clustering, knowledge-based and classifiers. These approaches can also be classified as supervised or unsupervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Statistical techniques fit a statistical model to the given data and then apply a statistical inference test on an unseen instance to determine if it belongs to this model. In knowledgebased methods, predefined rules or patterns of attack are checked against connection events to test their legitimacy. Soft computing techniques apply problem-solving technologies such as fuzzy logic, probabilistic reasoning, neural networks and genetic algorithms. Clustering is a data mining technique, which is also known as unsupervised classification. It does not need to be trained with a training dataset and the strength of clustering lies within the algorithm itself. Hence, it is very popular. Classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and hidden Markov model are also used in many detection approaches. Detailed discussion of these approaches can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In the past few years, several significant surveys have been published <ref type="bibr">[1-3, 6, 7, 10, 11]</ref> to highlight the architectures and methods developed for network defense mechanisms, attack taxonomies, attack launching mechanisms and their pros and cons. However, our survey differs significantly from them in the following ways.</p><p>(i) We present an attack taxonomy based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, in our taxonomy there are seven distinct possibilities in which an intruder can attempt to launch DDoS attacks. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we include a detailed discussion of various DDoS defense mechanisms and their architectures and methods under the broad categories of statistical, knowledge-based, soft computing, data mining and other machine learning methods. We also include a list of practical issues and research challenges, which is not available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. (ii) Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we report and analyze a large number of defense mechanisms, architectures, methods, tools and solutions countering DoS of attacks. However, unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we include recent defense solutions and tools and discuss latest DDoS attack strategies. Also, unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we attempt to provide a possible solution to counter the attacks in the context of latest DDoS attack scenarios. (iii) Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, our survey is focused on DDoS attack detection methods, tools and research directions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a major portion is dedicated to DoS research solutions only and that too for a period upto 2009. Also, unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we present several research issues and open challenges from a more practical point of view, considering the latest DDoS attack scenarios. (iv) Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we present possible solutions for DDoS attacks in detail and with a practical viewpoint. Also, we broadly categorize the detection methods as statistical, knowledge-based, soft computing, data mining and other machine learning. We also include tools related to DDoS attacks. (v) Only a brief overview of DDoS taxonomies, tools and countermeasures is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> without any possible solutions for DDoS attacks. In contrast, we present a list of methods, tools, possible solutions and future research directions for DDoS attacks in detail. (vi) In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the authors present several anomaly detection techniques w.r.t. diverse domains but our work is mainly focused on DDoS attack detection architectures, methods and tools.</p><p>Our survey begins in Section 2 with the introduction of DDoS attacks and generic architectures of DDoS defense mechanisms classified with their locality of deployment. Section 3 discusses various methods for DDoS attack detection. Different strategies to evaluate the performance of DDoS attack detection methods are described in Section 4. The challenges faced by DDoS defenders are reported in Section 5 followed by concluding remarks in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DDoS ATTACKS AND THEIR ARCHITECTURES</head><p>As stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a DDoS attack can be defined as an attack which uses a large number of computers to launch a coordinated DoS attack against a single machine or multiple victim machines. Using client/server technology, the perpetrator is able to multiply the effectiveness of the DoS attack significantly by harnessing the resources of multiple unwitting accomplice computers, which serve as attack platforms. Approximate attack statistics for DDoS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for the year 2011 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A DDoS attacker is considered more intelligent than a DoS attacker. It is distinguished from other attacks by its ability to deploy its weapons in a 'distributed' way over the Internet and to aggregate these forces to create lethal traffic. Rather than breaking the victim's defense system for fun or to show prowess, a DDoS attack aims to cause damage on a victim either for personal reasons, material gain or for popularity. A taxonomy of DDoS attacks based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. We see in the taxonomy that intruders attempt to launch DDoS attacks based on exploitation of various means (shown in the left column) and their resultant effects can be observed at various levels or magnitudes.</p><p>DDoS attacks mainly take advantage of the architecture of the Internet and this is what makes them powerful. While designing the Internet, the prime concern was to provide for functionality, not security. As a result, many security issues have been raised, which are exploited by attackers. Some of the issues are given below.</p><p>(i) Internet security is highly interdependent. No matter how secure a victim's system may be, whether or not this system will become a DDoS victim depends on the rest of the global Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.  (v) The handlers or the masters, which are compromised hosts with special programs running on them, are capable of controlling multiple agents. (vi) The attack daemon agents or zombie hosts are compromised hosts that are running a special program each and are responsible for generating a stream of packets toward the intended victim. These machines are commonly external to the victim's own network to disable an efficient response from the victim, and external to the network of the attacker to forswear liability if the attack is traced back.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">DDoS strategy</head><p>A DDoS attack is composed of several elements as shown in Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.</p><p>There are several steps in launching a DDoS attack. These are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>.</p><p>(1) Selection of agents. The attacker chooses the agents that will perform the attack. Based on the nature of vulnerabilities present, some machines are compromised to be used as agents. Attackers victimize these machines, which have abundant resources, so that a powerful attack stream can be generated. In early years, the   attackers attempted to acquire control of these machines manually. However, with the development of advanced security tool(s), it has become easier to identify these machines automatically and instantly.</p><p>(2) Compromise. The attacker exploits security holes and vulnerabilities of the agent machines and plants the attack code. Not only that, the attacker also takes necessary steps to protect the planted code from identification and deactivation. As per the direct DDoS attack strategy, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the compromised nodes, i.e. zombies between the attacker and victim are recruited unwitting accomplice hosts from a large number of unprotected hosts connected through the Internet in high bandwidth. On the other hand, the DDoS attack strategy shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> is more complex due to inclusion of intermediate layer(s) between the zombies and victim(s). It further complicates the traceback mostly due to (i) complexity in untangling the traceback information (partial) with reference to multiple sources, and/or (ii) having to connect a large number of routers or servers. Self-propagating tools such as the Ramen worm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and Code Red <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> automate this phase. Unless a sophisticated defense mechanism is used, it is usually difficult for the users and owners of the agent systems to realize that they have become a part of a DDoS attack system. Another important feature of such an agent system is that the agent programs are very cost effective both in terms of memory and bandwidth. Hence, they affect the performance of the system minimally. In the past decade, attackers and agents have started using a multiuser, online chatting system known as IRC <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This is because IRC chat networks allow users to create public, private and secret channels. An IRC-based DDoS attack network is similar to the agent-handler DDoS attack model except that instead of using a handler program installed on a network server, an IRC server tracks the addresses of connected agents and handlers and facilitates communication among them. The discovery of a single participant leads to the discovery of the communication channel, but other participants' identities remain protected. Such multiuser online chatting systems or IRC systems have several other significant advantages for launching DDoS attacks. Among the three important benefits are: they afford a high degree of anonymity, they are difficult to detect and they provide a strong, guaranteed delivery system. Furthermore, the attacker no longer needs to maintain a list of agents, since he can simply log on to the IRC server and see a list of all available agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. IRC channels receive communications from the agent software regarding the status of the agents (i.e. up or down) and participate in notifying the attackers regarding the status of the agents. In an IRC-based DDoS attack, the agents are often referred to as 'Zombie Bots' or 'Bots'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Generic architecture of DDoS attack defense mechanisms</head><p>Based on the locality of deployment, DDoS defense schemes can be divided into three classes: victim-end, source-end and intermediate router defense mechanisms. All of these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages. We discuss them one by one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Victim-end defense mechanism</head><p>Victim-end detection approaches are generally employed in the routers of victim networks, i.e. networks providing critical Web services. A generic architecture of such schemes is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. Here the detection engine is used to detect intrusion either online or offline, using either misuse-based intrusion detection or anomaly-based intrusion detection. The reference data stores information about known intrusion signatures or profiles of normal behavior. This information is updated by the processing elements as new knowledge about the observed behavior becomes available. The security manager often updates the stored intrusion signatures and also checks for other critical events such as false alarms. The processing element frequently stores intermediate results in the configuration data. Detecting DDoS attacks in victim routers is relatively easy because of the high rate of resource consumption. It is also the most practically applicable type of defense scheme as Web servers providing critical services always try to secure their resources for legitimate users. But the problem with these  approaches is that, during DDoS attacks, victim resources, e.g. network bandwidth, often gets overwhelmed and these approaches cannot stop the flow beyond victim routers. Another important disadvantage is that these approaches detect the attack only after it reaches the victim and detecting an attack when legitimate clients have already been denied is not useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Source-end defense mechanism</head><p>A generic architecture of source-end preventive schemes is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. This architecture is similar to the victim-end detection architecture. Here, a throttling component is added to impose a rate limit on outgoing connections. The observation engine compares both incoming and outgoing traffic statistics with some predefined normal profiles.</p><p>Detecting and stopping a DDoS attack at the source is the best possible defense. It prevents the possibility of flooding not only on the victim side, but also in the whole intermediate network. The main difficulty with this approach is that detecting DDoS attacks at the source end is not easy. This is because in these attacks, sources are widely distributed and a single source behaves almost similarly as in normal traffic. Another problem is the difficulty of deploying system at the source end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Intermediate network defense mechanism</head><p>The intermediate network defense scheme balances the trade-offs between detection accuracy and attack bandwidth consumption, the main issues in source-end and victim-end detection approaches. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> shows a generic architecture of the intermediate network defense scheme, one that can be employed in any network router. Such a scheme is generally collaborative in nature and the routers share their observations with other routers. Like a source-end scheme, these schemes also impose rate limits on connections passing by the router after comparing with stored normal profiles.</p><p>Detection and traceback of attack sources are easy in this approach due to collaborative operation. Routers can form an overlay mesh to share their observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The main difficulty with this approach is deployability. To achieve full detection accuracy, all routers on the Internet will have to employ this detection scheme, because unavailability of this scheme in only a few routers may cause failure of the detection and traceback process. Obviously, full practical implementation of this scheme is extremely difficult by reconfiguring all the routers on the Internet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EXISTING METHODS FOR DDoS ATTACK DETECTION</head><p>In this section, we present a summary of existing literature on DDoS attack detection methods. These methods are based on the architectures discussed above, namely, victim-end, source-end and in-network. We discuss these schemes without considering their practical deployability in real networks. Recent trends show that soft computing approaches have been used heavily for DDoS attack detection. Ensembles of classifiers have also performed satisfactorily with high detection rates (DRs). We classify methods for DDoS attack detection into four major classes as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Statistical methods</head><p>Statistical properties of normal and attack patterns can be exploited for detection of DDoS attacks. Generally, a statistical model for normal traffic is fitted and then a statistical inference Detecting DDoS Attacks 543 refuted, it gradually allows increased traffic rate. Saifullah <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposes a defense mechanism based on a distributed algorithm that performs weight-fair throttling at upstream routers. The throttling is weight-fair because the traffic destined for the server is controlled (increased or decreased) by leaky buckets at the routers based on the number of users connected, directly or through other routers, to each router. In the beginning of the algorithm, the survival capacity is underestimated by the routers so as to protect the server from any sudden initial attack. The rate is updated (increased or decreased), based on the server's feedback sent to its child routers and eventually propagated downward to all routers, in the subsequent rounds of the algorithm with a view to converging the total server load to the tolerable capacity range.</p><p>Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> presents a new detection method for DDoS attack traffic based on the two-sample t-test. It first obtains statistics for the normal SYN arrival rate (SAR) and confirms that it follows the normal distribution. The method identifies an attack by computing (a) the difference between incoming SAR and normal SAR and (b) the difference between the number of SYN and ACK packets. Unlike most previous DDoS defense schemes that only deal with either flooding or meek attack, the proposal uses two statistical tests to identify malicious traffic. It first compares the differences between the overall means of the incoming traffic arrival rate and the normal traffic arrival rate by the two-sample t-test. If the difference is significant, it concludes that the traffic may include flooding attack packets. However, the low-rate attack traffic may pass the arrival rate test and make the backlog queue full. The approach then compares the two groups that contain different numbers of SYN and ACK packets by the two-sample t-test. If there is a significant difference, it recognizes that the attack traffic is mixed into the current traffic. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> propose a prediction method for the available service rate of a protected server by applying the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. They use available service rates to qualify the server's availability to detect DDoS attacks. Their prediction method divides server resources into CPU time, memory utilization and networking buffer. Based on the prediction, they use abnormal detection technology to analyze the consumption of server resources to predict whether the server is under a DDoS attack.</p><p>Akella et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> explore key challenges in helping an Internet service provider (ISP) network detect attacks on itself or attacks on external sites which use the ISP network. They propose a detection mechanism where each router detects traffic anomalies using profiles of normal traffic constructed using stream sampling algorithms. Initial results show that it is possible to: (1) profile normal traffic reasonably accurately;</p><p>(2) identify anomalies with low false positive and false negative rates (locally, at the router) and (3) be cost effective in terms of memory consumption and per packet computation. In addition, ISP routers exchange information with each other to increase confidence in their detection decisions.A router gathers responses from all other routers regarding suspicions and based on them decides whether a traffic aggregate is an attack or is normal. The initial results show that individual router profiles capture key characteristics of the traffic effectively and identify anomalies with low false positive and false negative rates. Peng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> describe a novel approach to detect bandwidth attacks by monitoring the arrival rate of new source internet protocol (IP) addresses. The detection scheme is based on an advanced non-parametric change detection scheme, CUSUM. Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> propose the IP Flow Feature Value algorithm based on the essential features of DDoS attacks, such as abrupt traffic change, flow dissymmetry, distributed source IP addresses and concentrated target IP addresses. Using a linear prediction technique, a simple and efficient auto regressive moving average prediction model is established for normal network flow. Then a DDoS attack detection scheme based on anomaly detection techniques and a linear prediction model (DDAP) is used. Udhayan and Hamsapriya <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> present a statistical segregation method (SSM), which samples the flow in consecutive intervals and compares the samples against the attack state condition and sorts them with the mean as the parameter. Then correlation analysis is performed to segregate attack flows from legitimate flows. The authors compare the SSM against various other methods and identify a blend of segregation methods for alleviating false detections.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, the authors introduce a generic DoS detection scheme based on maximum likelihood criterion with random neural networks (RNNs). The method initially selects a set of traffic features in the offline mode to obtain pdf estimates and to evaluate the likelihood ratios. During decision making, it measures the features of incoming traffic and attempts to decide according to each feature. Finally, it obtains an overall decision using both feedforward and recurrent architectures of the RNN. A brief summary of these methods is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Soft computing methods</head><p>Learning paradigms, such as neural networks, radial basis functions (RBFs) and genetic algorithms, are increasingly used in DDoS attack detection because of their ability to classify intelligently and automatically. Soft computing is a general term for describing a set of optimization and processing techniques that are tolerant of imprecision and uncertainty. Jalili et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> introduce a DDoS attack detection system called SPUNNID based on a statistical preprocessor and unsupervised artificial neural nets (ANNs). They use statistical preprocessing to extract features from the traffic, and an unsupervised neural net to analyze and classify traffic patterns as either a DDoS attack or normal.</p><p>Karimazad and Faraahi <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> propose an anomaly-based DDoS detection method based on features of attack packets, analyzing them using RBF neural networks. The method can be applied to edge routers of victim networks. Vectors with seven features are used to activate an RBF neural network at each time window. The RBF neural network is applied to  <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> propose to detect DDoS attacks using decision trees and gray relational analysis. The detection of the attack from the normal situation is viewed as a classification problem. They use 15 attributes, which not only monitor the incoming/outgoing packet/byte rate, but also compile the TCP, SYN and ACK flag rates, to describe the traffic flow pattern.</p><p>The decision tree technique is applied to develop a classifier to detect abnormal traffic flow. They also use a novel traffic pattern matching procedure to identify traffic flow similar to the attack flow and to trace back the origin of an attack based on this similarity. Nguyen and Choi <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> develop a method for proactive detection of DDoS attacks by classifying the network status. They break a DDoS attack into phases and select features based on an investigation of DDoS attacks. Finally, they apply the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method to classify the network status in each phase of the DDoS attack. A method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> detects DDoS attacks based on a fuzzy estimator using mean packet inter-arrival times. It detects the suspected host and traces the IP address to drop packets within 3-s detection windows.</p><p>Lately, ensembles of classifiers have been used for DDoS attack detection. The use of an ensemble reduces the bias of existing individual classifiers. An ensemble of classifiers has been used by Kumar and Selvakumar <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> for this purpose where a resilient back propagation (RBP) neural network is chosen as the base classifier. The main focus of this paper is to improve the performance of the base classifier. The proposed classification algorithm, RBPBoost combines the output of the ensemble of classifier outputs and Neyman Pearson cost minimization strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, for final classification decision.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Knowledge-based methods</head><p>In knowledge-based approaches, network events are checked against predefined rules or patterns of attack. In these approaches, general representations of known attacks are formulated to identify actual occurrences of attacks. Examples of knowledge-based approaches include expert systems, signature analysis, self-organizing maps and state transition analysis. Gil and Poletto <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> introduce a heuristic along with a data structure called MUltiLevel Tree for Online Packet Statistics (MULTOPS) that monitors certain traffic characteristics which can be used by network devices such as routers to detect and eliminate DDoS attacks. MULTOPS is a tree of nodes that contains packet rate statistics for subnet prefixes at different aggregation levels. Expansion and contraction of the tree occurs within a prespecified memory size. A network device using MULTOPS detects ongoing bandwidth attacks by the presence of a significant and disproportional difference between packet rates going to and coming from the victim or the attacker. Depending on their setup and their location on the network, MULTOPS-equipped routers or network monitors may fail to detect a bandwidth attack that is mounted by attackers that randomizes IP source addresses on malicious packets. MULTOPS fails to detect attacks that deploy a large number of proportional flows to cripple a victim. Thomas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> present an approach to DDoS defense called NetBouncer and claim it to be a practical approach with high performance. Their approach relies on distinguishing legitimate and illegitimate use and ensuring that resources are made available only for legitimate use. NetBouncer allows traffic to flow with reference to a long list of proven legitimate clients. If packets are received from a client (source) not on the legitimate list, a NetBouncer device proceeds to administer a variety of legitimacy tests to challenge the client to prove its legitimacy. If a client can pass these tests, it is added to the legitimacy list and subsequent packets from the client are accepted until a certain legitimacy window expires.</p><p>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> present a formal and methodical way of modeling DDoS attacks using augmented attack tree (AAT), and discuss an AAT-based attack detection algorithm. This model explicitly captures the particular subtle incidents triggered by a DDoS attack and the corresponding state transitions from the view of the network traffic transmission on the primary victim server. Two major contributions of this paper are: (1) an AAT-based DDoS model (ADDoSAT), developed to assess the potential threat from malicious packets on the primary victim server and to facilitate the detection of such attacks; (2) an AAT-based bottom-up detection algorithm proposed to detect all kinds of attacks based on AAT modeling. Compared with the conventional attack tree modeling method, AAT is advanced because it provides additional information, especially about the state transition process. As a result, it overcomes the shortcomings of CAT modeling. There is currently no established AAT-based bottom-up procedure for detecting network intrusions. Limwiwatkul and Rungsawang <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> propose to discover DDoS attack signatures by analyzing the TCP/IP packet header against well-defined rules and conditions, and distinguishing the difference between normal and abnormal traffic. The authors mainly focus on ICMP, TCP and UDP flooding attacks.</p><p>Zhang and Parashar <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> propose a distributed approach to defend against DDoS attacks by coordinating across the Internet. Unlike traditional IDS, it detects and stops DDoS attacks within the intermediate network. In the proposed approach, DDoS defence systems are deployed in the network to detect DDoS attacks independently. A gossip-based communication mechanism is used to exchange information about network attacks between these independent detection nodes to aggregate information about the overall network attacks. Using the aggregated information, individual defence nodes obtain approximate information about global network attacks and can stop them more effectively and accurately. For faster and reliable dissemination of attack information, the network grows as a peer-topeer overlay network on top of the Internet. Previously proposed approaches rely on monitoring the volume of traffic that is received by the victim. Most such approaches are incapable of differentiating a DDoS attack from a flash crowd. Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> describe a perimeter-based anti-DDoS system, in which the traffic is analyzed only at the edge routers of an ISP network. The anti-DDoS system consists of two major components: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> temporal correlation-based feature extraction and (2) spatial correlation-based detection. The scheme can accurately detect DDoS attacks and identify attack packets without modifying existing IP forwarding mechanisms at routers. A brief summary of these knowledge-based methods is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Other data mining and machine learning methods</head><p>An effective defense system to protect network servers, network routers and client hosts from becoming handlers, zombies and victims of DDoS flood attacks is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The NetShield system protects any IP-based public network on the Internet. It uses preventive and deterrent controls to remove system vulnerabilities on target machines. Adaptation techniques are used to launch protocol anomaly detection and provide corrective intrusion responses. The NetShield system enforces dynamic security policies. NetShield is especially tailored for protecting network resources against DDoS flood attacks. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> present a comprehensive framework for DDoS attack detection known as DDoS Container. It uses a network-based detection method to overcome complex and evasive types of DDoS attacks. It works in an inline mode to inspect and manipulate ongoing traffic in real time. By continuous monitoring of both DDoS attacks and legitimate applications, DDoS Container covers stateful inspection on data streams and correlates events among different sessions. It proactively terminates the session when it detects an attack. Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> propose a method for proactive detection of DDoS attacks by exploiting an architecture consisting of a selection of handlers and agents that communicate, compromise and attack. The method performs cluster analysis. The authors experiment with the DARPA 2000 Intrusion Detection Scenario Specific Dataset to evaluate the method. The results show that each phase of the attack scenario is partitioned well and can detect precursors of a DDoS attack as well as the attack itself. Sekar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> investigate the design space for in-network DDoS detection and propose a triggered, multistage approach that addresses both scalability and accuracy. Their contribution is the design and implementation of large-scale automated DDoS detection System. The system makes effective use of the data (such as NetFlow and simple network management protocol feeds from routers) readily available to an ISP. Rahmani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> discuss a joint entropy analysis of multiple traffic distributions for DDoS attack detection. They observe that the time series of IP-flow numbers and aggregate traffic sizes are strongly statistically dependent. The occurrence of an attack affects this dependence and causes a rupture in the time series for joint entropy values. Experimental results show that this method could lead to more accurate and effective DDoS detection.</p><p>A low-rate DDoS (LDDoS) attack has significant ability to conceal its traffic because of its similarity with normal traffic. Xiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> propose two new information metrics: (i) generalized entropy metric and (ii) information distance metric, to detect LDDoS attacks. They identify the attack by measuring the distance between legitimate traffic and attack traffic. The generalized entropy metric is more effective than the traditional Shannon metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. In addition, the distance metric outperforms the popular Kullback-Leibler divergence approach. Francois et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> present a method called FireCol based on information theory for early detection of flooding DDoS attacks. FireCol is composed of an intrusion prevention system (IPS) located at the ISP level. The IPSs form virtual protection rings around the hosts to defend and collaborate by exchanging selected traffic information. The approach reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> analyzes DDoS and flash crowd characteristics and provides an effective way to distinguish between the two in VoIP networks. The authors validate the method by simulation. A wavelet transformation and probability theory-based network anomaly detection approach is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The approach is able to identify known as well as unknown attacks. Zhong and Yue <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> present a DDoS attack detection model that extracts a network traffic model and a network packet protocol status model and sets the threshold for the detection model. Captured network traffic values are clustered based on the k-means clustering algorithm to build initial threshold values for network traffic. All captured packets are used to build the packet protocol status model using the Apriori <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and fuzzy c-means (FCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> algorithms. Whenever the current network traffic is over the threshold value, the network packet protocol status is checked to detect abnormal packets. If there are no abnormal packets, the current network traffic is clustered again by the k-means module to build a new threshold value model. A two-stage automated system is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> to detect DoS attacks in network traffic. It combines the traditional change point detection approach with a novel one based on continuous wavelet transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. The authors test the system using a set of publicly available attack-free traffic traces superimposed with anomaly profiles. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, Li and Lee present a systematic wavelet-based method for DDoS attack detection. They use energy distribution based on wavelet analysis to detect DDoS attack traffic. Energy distribution over time has limited variation if the traffic keeps its behavior over time. Gupta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> use ANN to estimate the number of zombies in a DDoS attack. They use sample data to train a feed-forward neural network generated using the NS-2 network simulator. The generalization capacity of the trained network is promising and the network is able to predict the number of zoombies involved in a DDoS attack with test error. A port-to-port specific traffic in a router, called IF flow is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. An important feature of IF is that it can amplify the attack to normal traffic ratio. An recursive least square filter is used to predict IF flows. Next, a statistical method using a residual filtered process is used to detect anomalies. Finally, the authors applied the method to three types of traffic: IF flows, input links and output links within a router, and compare the anomaly detection results using receiver operating characteristics curves. Results show that IF flows are more powerful than input links and output links for DDoS attack detection. Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> propose the IP Address Interaction (IAI) Feature algorithm considering interactions among addresses, abrupt traffic changes, manyto-one asymmetries among addresses, distributed source IP addresses and concentrated target addresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The IAI algorithm is designed to describe the essential characteristics of network flow states. Furthermore, an SVM classifier, which is trained by an IAI time series from normal flow and attack flow, is applied to classify the state of current network flows and identify the DDoS attacks. Experimental results show that the IAI-based detection scheme can distinguish between normal flows and abnormal flows with DDoS attacks effectively, and help identify fast and accurate attack flows when the attacking traffic is hidden among a relatively large volume of normal flows or close to the attacking sources. In addition, it has higher detection and lower false alarm rates (FARs) compared with competing techniques.</p><p>The method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> can identify flooding attacks in real time and also can assess the intensity of the attackers based on fuzzy reasoning. The process consists of two stages: (i) statistical analysis of the network traffic time series using discrete wavelet transform and Schwarz information criterion to find the change point of the Hurst parameters resulting from a DDoS flood attack, and then (ii) identification and assessment of the intensity of the DDoS attack adaptively based on an intelligent fuzzy reasoning mechanism. Test results by ns2based simulation with various network traffic characteristics and attack intensities demonstrate that the method could detect DDoS flood attack timely, effectively and intelligently. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> present a Congestion Participation Rate (CPR)based approach to detect LDDoS attacks using flow level network traffic. A flow with higher CPR value leads to LDDoS and consequent dropping of the packets. The authors evaluate the mechanism using ns2 simulation, testbed experiments and Internet traffic trace and claims so that the method can detect LDDoS flows effectively. Another protocol specific featurebased DDoS attack detection mechanism is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It identifies a most relevant subset of features using correlation and can detect DDoS attacks with high detection accuracy.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, a mathematical model is presented to provide gross evaluation of the benefits of DDoS defence based on dropping of attack traffic. Simulation results and testbed experiments are used to validate the model. In the same work, the authors also consider an autonomic defence mechanism based on the cognitive packet network (CPN) protocol and establish it to be capable of tracing back flows coming into a node automatically. Ghanea-Hercock et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> provide a survey of the techniques within the Hyperion project. They also suggest an overall system architecture to improve the situational awareness of field commanders by providing an option to fuse and compose information services in real time. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, Gelenbe describes an approach to develop self-aware networks to provide end users the option to explore the state of the network to find the best ways to meet their communication needs. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, a model is introduced for searching by N agents in an unbounded random environment. The model allows for the loss or destruction of searchers and finite lifetime. A summarized presentation of these methods in this category is given in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Discussion</head><p>Exact comparison of DDoS attack detection schemes is not feasible because some papers do not specify their results clearly, whereas others evaluate their schemes using different datasets or in different testing conditions. A comparison (as shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>) establishes that most papers do not consider all the issues that are pertinent. For example, the DCP detection method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> performs well for TCP SYN attacks, but its performance degrades for UDP attacks with large packet sizes. D-WARD <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> fails to detect pulsing attacks, especially when the inactive period is large. For NetBouncer <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the legitimacy tests may not be exhaustive and certain illegitimate clients may also pass the test. In addition, Netbouncer is overwhelmed by flash crowds. Moreover, the delay introduced by the test affects new legitimate clients. The DDoS detection system based on K-means and FCM clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> performs well for unknown attacks, but the trade-off between detection accuracy and speed is high. Detection using RBF neural networks and statistical features <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> performs well for known attacks, but no dynamic modification can be performed easily for unknown attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</head><p>Performance evaluation is important for any DDoS attack defense system. Performance evaluation is highly dependent on (i) the approach, (ii) deployment status and (iii) whether there is facility for dynamic updation of profiles. While designing a DDoS attack defense scheme, these parameters should be taken into consideration. In this section, we primarily discuss the datasets that have been used for evaluating performance of detection methods. We also briefly introduce DDoS tools.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">OPEN ISSUES AND CHALLENGES</head><p>Many methods for DDoS detection have been reported in the literature, but only a few of them have been applied in a real network environment and work effectively. Designing and implementing an ideal and practical DDoS defense system is really difficult. The main challenges that any DDoS defense scheme must overcome to become ideally usable are presented below.</p><p>(i) In a DDoS attack, attackers try to make a service unavailable to its legitimate clients and launch the attack using a large number of zombies distributed in different networks. It takes only a few seconds to exhaust the bandwidth and other resources of the victim. A faster detection scheme usually consumes higher processing power and, at the same time, it adversely affects detection accuracy. In such a situation, for a DDoS defense mechanism aiming to provide a near real-time solution may have to be based on an incremental clustering algorithm to segregate the attack from normal traffic. This requires an appropriate proximity measure that works sensibly, quickly and reliably. (x) The detection method should be dependent on a minimum number of input parameters if not independent of parameters and should also be based on a minimum number of traffic parameters or features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AGAINST DDOS ATTACKS</head><p>DDoS defense schemes are of three types based on their deployment: source-end, victim-end and intermediate router defense mechanisms. Among these three, most researchers are in favor of using the victim-end approach. However, a common disadvantage of this scheme is the consumption of a huge amount of resources to provide a fast detection response. In the latest DDoS attacks scenarios, once the attackers gain access, they can increase the attack intensity instantly, and after acquiring a majority of available resources, they can launch attacks without spoofing IPs and they may extend activities to complex database query transactions also. Generally, segregation of such transactions from the legitimate queries is a difficult task. Current DDoS attacking tools are capable of launching attacks in different modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> such as increasing rate, constant rate, pulsing (attack rate oscillates between maximum to 0) and gradual pulsing (e.g. attack rate achieves a maximum in 20 s and reduces to 0 in 10 s). These various forms of attacks may involve single as well as multiple attack sources, that too using single as well as multiple source addresses. Defenders are interested in providing a semi-automatic solution with an objective of achieving reduced false alarm with minimum resource consumption. A solution we propose at a high level is based on an ensemble approach working in a distributed framework using appropriate fusion techniques for decision making. Protocol-specific feature extraction in a distributed environment involving multiple sensors and detecting DDoS attacks based on a class-specific subset of features at the individual level will provide the base for the underlying layer of the proposed solution. Finally, the individual decisions can be combined using an appropriate combination rule at the upper layer at any of the participating nodes in the distributed framework for the final inference. Once the attack occurrence is confirmed, the next task is to limit the attack rate instantly in a selective manner without affecting service to legitimate users, so that subsequent damage can be minimized immediately. However, for significant reduction of the FAR, involvement of human experts is often useful. Especially, in the case of LDDoS attacks, an appropriate diagnosis of false alarms with the help of human analysts, and then providing feedback to the detecting sensors, are very essential. The three major advantages of our solution are: (i) it helps achieve an unbiased and high DR at reduced false alarms, (ii) it minimizes resource consumption by sharing the computation cost and (iii) it achieves a scalable, real-time detection performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>While developing a DDoS defense scheme, the issues discussed in this paper need to be deliberated and considered with due seriousness. In this paper, we have presented an overview of DDoS attacks, detection schemes and finally research issues and challenges. In addition, we provide a comparison among current detection methods. Practically designing and implementing a DDoS defense is very difficult. The comparison of the existing detection mechanisms shows that most schemes are not capable of fulfilling all the requirements for real-time network defense. Different performance parameters need to be balanced against each other delicately and appropriately. A possible solution to counter DDoS attacks is also briefly outlined in this paper.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.

But it is difficult to ensure that the generated traffic correlates well with real network traffic. (iii) Private datasets: The best approach for testing any intrusion detection system or DDoS attack detection method is to create a real network testbed with a large number of host and network components. Then one can generate normal as well as attack traffic and capture them using standard tools, used for high-speed networks. After capture, one preprocesses the raw data and extracts features in a distributed manner and finally correlates each feature to create a complete dataset.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Name and ref.</cell><cell>Description</cell></row></table></figure>

(v) Accurate segregation of high-rate DDoS attack traffic from normal flash crowds with minimum resource consumption or low FAR in real-time or near real-time is a challenging task. (vi) Transparency to existing Internet infrastructure is very important in terms of deployment. It should not be allowed to slow down the processing of normal packets from legitimate clients, which itself is DoS. Moreover, the defense system itself should not be vulnerable to attacks, creating unavoidable breakdown of service. Most importantly, a DDoS defense scheme should be deployable in real networks. (vii) High-speed traffic analysis for detecting DDoS attacks is a challenging task. A defense scheme can get overwhelmed in real networks, particularly at the time of a DDoS attack. So, the defense scheme should be able to handle the crowd and still function properly. A defense scheme capable of real-time detection should perform well with high-speed traffic. Offline schemes suffer in high-speed traffic because of the overhead created by processing delay, which can slow down detection speed further or can cause total breakdown in extreme cases. (viii) Real-time updation of network statistics and fast identification of randomized spoofed IP addresses are challenges. (ix) In DDoS attacks with a large number of agents, attack behavior often conforms well with normal behavior.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Detecting DDoS Attacks</cell><cell>553</cell></row><row><cell>both known and</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">generally ensures good performance as classification</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">can be performed in a more sophisticated manner in</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">comparison with real-time detection.
