<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper investigates a novel multi-objective model for a no-wait flow shop scheduling problem that minimizes both the weighted mean completion time ðC w Þ and weighted mean tardiness ðT w Þ. Obtaining an optimal solution for this type of complex, large-sized problem in reasonable computational time by using traditional approaches and optimization tools is extremely difficult. This paper presents a new hybrid multi-objective algorithm based on the features of a biological immune system (IS) and bacterial optimization (BO) to find Pareto optimal solutions for the given problem. To validate the performance of the proposed hybrid multi-objective immune algorithm (HMOIA) in terms of solution quality and diversity level, various test problems are examined. Further, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, based on various metrics, is compared against five prominent multi-objective evolutionary algorithms: PS-NC GA, NSGA-II, SPEA-II, MOIA, and MISA. Our computational results suggest that our proposed HMOIA outperforms the five foregoing algorithms, especially for large-sized problems.</p></div>

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.ins.2007.06. <ref type="bibr">001</ref> In most manufacturing environments, a set of processes is sequentially performed in several stages to complete a job. Such a system is referred to as the flow shop environment, and belongs to a class of scheduling problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In a flow shop problem, we consider n different jobs that are to be processed on m machines in the same order so that the performance measures are optimized. Common measures are the makespan, earliness, tardiness, mean completion time, work-in-process penalty, number of tardy jobs, and idle time. It is suggested in the review of recent literature that flow shop scheduling problems have been among the most prevalent problems in the area of scheduling. Numerous papers have investigated this issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. A comprehensive review of flow shop scheduling problems over the last 50 years is provided by Gupta and Stafford <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>In some practical applications, such as the metal, plastic, chemical and food industries, jobs must be processed on m machines continuously; therefore, intermediate storage does not exist between successive machines. This type of flow shop scheduling problem addressed in the literature is referred to as a no-wait flow shop problem. Hall and Sriskandarajah <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> provided a useful survey for scheduling problems with blocking and no-wait in process. Espinouse et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> considered a two-machine no-wait flow shop scheduling problem by minimizing the makespan with limited machine availability. Bertolissi <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposed a heuristic algorithm for a no-wait flow shop scheduling problem, in which the total flow time was considered as the primary criterion. Hong and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> considered a fuzzy approach for a generalized flow shop scheduling problem. They used triangular membership functions for a flexible flow shop problem with two machining centers examining processing-time uncertainties in order to make scheduling more suitable for real applications. Fink and Vob <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> considered the application of different metaheuristics such as neighborhood search, simulated annealing and Tabu search to solve a continuous flow shop problem with a practical approach. They further examined the trade-offs between the running time and the solution quality as well as the knowledge and effort needed to implement and calibrate their proposed algorithm. Thornton and Hunsucker <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> developed a new heuristic that minimizes the makespan in a flow shop scheduling problem with multiple processors and no intermediate storage.</p><p>Bouquard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> provided complexity classification for various versions of a two-machine permutation flow shop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan, in which some jobs processed with no-wait in process. Spieksma and Woeginger <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> considered a no-wait flow shop paradox. They showed that increasing the speed of some machines in a no-wait flow shop instance may worsen the optimal makespan. Grabowski and Pempera <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> developed and compared different local search algorithms for a no-wait flow shop problem with the makespan criterion. Kumar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proposed a Psycho-Clonal algorithm-based approach to solve a nowait flow shop scheduling problem with the total flow times as the main criterion. Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> considered general, no-wait, and no-idle flow shop scheduling problems with deteriorating jobs. Oulamara <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> investigated a task-scheduling problem in a no-wait flow shop with two batching machines by minimizing makespan as an objective. Su and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> studied a two-machine flow shop no-wait scheduling problem with a single server, in which the performance measure was the total completion time. They provided both heuristic and branch-andbound (B/B) algorithms to tackle the given problem. Kalczynski and Kamburowski <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> dealt with minimizing the makespan in m-machine no-wait and no-idle permutation flow shops. Pan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> developed and successfully applied a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve a no-wait flow shop scheduling problem with bi-criteria of the makespan and the total flow times.</p><p>Some researchers have addressed multi-objective flow shop scheduling problems. Murata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> considered a flow shop scheduling problem in two variants; first, with the two objectives of the makespan and total tardiness penalties, and second, with the three objectives of the makespan, total tardiness penalties, and total flow times. To do so, they proposed a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Ponnambalam et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> proposed a multi-objective TSP-GA algorithm for a flow shop scheduling problem, in which they used the weighted sum of multiple objectives, i.e., minimizing makespan, mean flow times, and machine idle times. Toktas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> considered a two-machine flow shop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan and maximum earliness. Ravindran et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proposed three heuristic algorithms to solve a bi-objective flow shop scheduling problem, in which makespan and total flow times are considered. Rahimi-Vahed and Mirghorbani <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> devised a multiobjective particle swarm algorithm for a bi-criteria flow shop scheduling problem to minimize the weighted mean completion time and weighted mean tardiness. They empirically showed that their method outperforms a multi-objective genetic algorithm on a set of representative problems. Tavakkoli-Moghaddam et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> proposed a multi-objective immune algorithm for a flow shop scheduling problem and compared this algorithm with a conventional multi-objective genetic algorithm, i.e., SPEA-II.</p><p>In this paper, we address a multi-objective no-wait flow shop scheduling problem, in which weighted mean completion time and weighted mean tardiness must be optimized simultaneously. To tackle this problem, a hybrid multi-objective immune algorithm (HMOIA) is proposed to search for the locally Pareto-optimal frontier. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Basic definitions of the multi-objective optimization are presented in Sections 2 and 3 gives the problem definition, and in Section 4, background of the immune algorithm approach is described and the proposed algorithm is outlined. The computational results and numerical comparisons are reported in Section 5, and the conclusions are presented in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Multi-objective optimization</head><p>Many real-world problems involve simultaneous optimization of several objective functions. In general, these functions often compete and conflict with themselves. Multi-objective optimization with such conflicting objective functions provides a set of optimal solutions (called Pareto-optimal), rather than one optimal solution. This set includes the solutions that no other solution is better than with respect to all objective functions. Without loss of generality, let us consider a typical multi-objective minimization problem with p decision variables and q objectives (q &gt; 1): Min y ¼ f ðxÞ ¼ ðf 1 ðxÞ; f 2 ðxÞ; . . . ; f q ðxÞÞ; ð1Þ</p><p>where, x 2 R p , and y 2 R q .</p><p>Definition 2.1.

Vector a is a globally Pareto-optimal solution if vector b does not exist such that b dominates a.</p><p>The set of all Pareto-optimal solutions is also called the Pareto-optimal set, or the efficient set. The corresponding images of the Pareto-optimal set in the objective space are called the Pareto-optimal frontier.</p><p>The development of various methodologies to solve multi-objective problems has been an on-going effort by researchers. There are various methods for solving multi-objective optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These methods can be classified into five categories as follows: (1) scalar methods, (2) interactive methods, (3) fuzzy methods, (4) metaheuristic methods, and (5) decision aid methods. Among these methods, metaheuristic methods seem to be practically suited for solving multi-objective optimization problems. Different approaches appear in the literature, for example, Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NPGA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA and NSGA-II) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>), Pareto Stratum-Niche Cubicle Genetic Algorithm (PS-NC GA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Multiple Objective Genetic Local Search (MOGLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA and SPEA2) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>), Micro-Genetic Algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Pareto Archive Evolution Strategy (PAES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Multi-Objective Tabu Search (MOTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and Multi-Objective Scatter Search (MOSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Problem definition</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">No-wait flow shop scheduling problem</head><p>A flow shop scheduling problem concerns a set of n jobs, I = {1, 2, . . ., n}, that must be processed on a set of m machines, J = {1, 2, . . ., m}, with the same processing order for jobs. Job i 2 I consists of a sequence of m operations O i1 , O i2 , . . ., O im ; operation O ij denotes the processing of job i on machine j during uninterrupted processing time p ij . Each schedule of jobs can be represented by permutation u = (u(1), . . ., u(n)) on set I.</p><p>Given job permutation u, completion time C u(i)j of job u(i) on machine j can be computed by using the following recursive formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C uðiÞj ¼ C uðiÀ1Þ;1 þ X j l¼1 P uðiÞl þ EðuðiÞÞ i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m;<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">EðuðiÞÞ ¼ max 0; max C uðiÀ1Þ;j À C uðiÀ1Þ;1 þ X jÀ1 l¼1 P uðiÞl ! !

This particular form of the flow shop scheduling problem has been referred to as a no-wait flow shop problem, in which each job must be processed from start to finish without any interruption. In other words, to fulfill the no-wait restrictions, the completion time of operation O ij must be equal to the starting time of operation</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">O ij + 1 , j = 1,2,. . ., m À 1, i 2 I.</formula><p>It is worth noting that a no-wait flow shop scheduling problem with availability constraints is NP-hard in the strong sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This means that no pseudo-polynomial time algorithm can optimally solve the bi-criteria no-wait flow shop scheduling problem considered in this paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Artificial immune systems</head><p>The biological immune system is a robust, complex, and adaptive system that defends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells (or molecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. Depending on the type of pathogen and the way it inters the body, the immune system uses different response mechanisms to either neutralize the pathogenic effect or destroy the infected cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The immune defense mechanism is either non-specific (innate) or specific (acquired) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The former is obtained through evolution from generation to generation and the latter is learned through its own encounters with antigens. The clonal selection and affinity maturation principles are used to explain how the immune system reacts to pathogens and how it improves its capability of recognizing and eliminating them <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The immune system mostly consists of the immune cells. The most common type of immune cells is lymphocytes (i.e., B-cells and T-cells). Both cells have receptor molecules on their surfaces that are able to recognize disease-causing pathogens (antigens). The B-cell receptor molecule is also called an antibody <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Clonal selection states that by pathogen invasion, a number of immune cells (lymphocytes) that recognize these pathogens will proliferate; some of them will become effecter cells (plasma cells), while others will be maintained as memory cells. The effecter cells secrete antibodies in large numbers, and the memory cells have long life spans and can therefore act faster and more effectively in future exposures to the same or a similar pathogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. During cellular reproduction, the cells suffer somatic mutations at high rates, and are also subjected to a selective force; the cells with higher affinity to the invading pathogen differentiate into memory cells. Generally, cells with low affinity receptors mutate at a higher rate, whereas cells with high affinity receptors will have a lower mutation rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. This whole process of somatic mutation plus selection is known as affinity maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>A novel computational intelligence technique inspired by immunology has emerged, known as artificial immune systems (AISs), in which several concepts from immunology have been extracted and applied to the solution of real-world science and engineering problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Previous work in artificial immune systems</head><p>Recently, artificial immune systems have attracted special attention in various applications. Dasgupta and Forrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> considered using a negative selection algorithm for tool breakage detection in milling operations. Zak <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> addressed the physical model of immune-inspired computing and introduced stochastic models that mimic the phenomenology of basic functions of immune systems such as self and non-self discrimination, selfrepair, predator-prey pursuit, and reproduction. De Castro and Von Zuben <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> used the clonal selection principle to perform machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, and to solve optimization problems. Luh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed an immune-based algorithm to find Pareto optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization problems. Coello and Cortes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> applied the clonal selection principle to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Guimaraes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> addressed a mixed H 2 /H 1 control design with optimization algorithms inspired by the immune system. Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> developed a dynamic immune optimization algorithm for constrained non-linear multi-objective optimization problems over continuous domains. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of Pareto optimality and simple interactive metaphors between antibody population and multiple antigens as well as ideas of T-cell regulation. Yuan and Chu <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> used an immune algorithm to optimize the parameters in support vector machines problems.</p><p>Khilwani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> designed a clonal algorithm to solve various numerical and combinatorial real-world optimization problems. They also used an artificial immune algorithm to tackle scheduling problems. Alisantoso et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> considered a flexible PCB flow shop scheduling problem by using an immune algorithm. Khoo and Situmdrang <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> dealt with the design of an assembly system for modular products by using an approach based on the principles of natural immune systems. Engin and Doyen <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> applied clonal selection principles and an affinity maturation mechanism to a hybrid flow shop scheduling problem. Kumar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> used an artificial immune system to tackle a continuous flow shop problem with total flow times as the principal criterion. Zandieh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> used an immune algorithm to solve hybrid flow shop scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The proposed hybrid multi-objective immune algorithm (HMOIA)</head><p>The algorithm proposed in this paper is based on the clonal selection principle, which recognizes that only the highest affinity antibodies will proliferate. The criterion distinguishing between antigens and antibodies is Pareto dominance. In other words, non-dominated solutions are the antigens and dominated solutions are the antibodies. The HMOIA implementation is described in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">General scheme of HMOIA</head><p>The pseudo-code of HMOIA is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Antibody representation</head><p>A typical representation in a scheduling problem is the job-to-position representation, in which a single-row array whose size is equal to the number of jobs is created. The first element of the array denotes the first job in a sequence; the second element of the array denotes the second job, and so on (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). The inherent characteristics of particle swarm optimization (PSO) suggest difficulties in applying this type of representation; the operators applied on real values often need to be redefined in order to make them applicable to a permutation of jobs. Although several researchers have successfully defined new operators, others have utilized real-coded representation with their respective decoding to obtain a permutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, real-coded representation is used along with job-to-position representation whenever immune algorithm operators are to be applied to a solution. In a problem with n jobs, a real-coded representation is an array containing n real values. These values indicate a antibody's position in each dimension of the n-dimensional space they move into. However, an upper bound for these values, referred to as X max , places a limit on the maximum distance each solution is permitted to travel in each dimension. In this paper, X max is set to 4. Consequently, a strategy (which is described later in this section) to convert the two representation types together when needed is necessary.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> illustrates a sample of the job-to-position representation. To construct the continuous version of this representation, we first need to generate 7 (the number of jobs to be produced) random numbers between [0, x max ] = [0, 4]. These numbers are then sorted, and the smallest is assigned to the position that contains the first job, which is job number 1. The next smallest is assigned to a position that contains the second job, which is job number 2, and so on. We can suppose that the numbers shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> are the random numbers obtained.</p><p>To build the continuous representation, we assign 0.46 to job number 1, 1.54 to job number 2, 1.77 to job number 3 and so on. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows the associated representation.  To illustrate how the job-to-position representation is obtained from the representation shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, we need to schedule the first job in the place of the first smallest values of the continuous representation, the second job in the place of the next smallest values, and so on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Antibody initialization</head><p>Most evolutionary algorithms use a random procedure to generate an initial set of solutions. However, since the output results are strongly sensitive to the initial set, we propose a new Elite Tabu Search (ETS) mechanism to construct this set of solutions. The main purpose of applying this metaheuristic method is to build a set of potentially diverse and high quality antibodies in the job-to-position representation form. Before describing the elements of the proposed Tabu search, we need to define the notion of the ''Ideal Point''. The ideal point for a multi-objective problem is a virtual point whose coordinates are obtained by separately optimizing each objective function with the same Pareto.</p><p>Determining the ideal point requires separately optimizing each of the objective functions of the problem. However, optimizing even a single objective non-linear problem is a difficult task. To overcome this obstacle, the problem is first linearized. Then, each of the objective functions is solved to optimality with available optimization software packages, such as Lingo 8. Another problem in the process of finding the ideal point, even after linearization, is the NP-hardness of the problems, which prohibits finding the global optimum (even a strong local optimum) in a reasonable time. As such, an approximation of the Ideal Point is used instead. The approximation involves interrupting the optimization software (Lingo 8) f seconds after the first feasible solution is found. The best solution found in this way is considered as the corresponding coordinate of the ideal point. The value of f is determined after running various test problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.1.">ETS implementation.</head><p>The desired size of the antibody repertoire, which is shown by N, remains constant during the optimization process. To construct N diverse and good antibodies, the proposed Elite Tabu Search (ETS) must be conducted a • N times, where a is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The Tabu Search starts from a predetermined point, called the Starting Point, which can be set to the sequence of either of the two values obtained for coordinates of the ideal point. In our paper, the string of objective function (1) is considered as the starting point. Then, the current solution is saved in a virtual list and is replaced by a desired solution in its neighborhood that meets the acceptance criterion. This process continues until the pre-specified termination criterion is met. The detailed description of the proposed Tabu search is given in the next section.</p><p>4.3.3.1.1. Move description. The proposed move procedure, which is used to generate a neighborhood subset l, is based on an implementation of what is known in the GA literature as the inversion operator. Inversion is an array operator that first chooses two random cut points in an antibody. The elements between the cut points are then reversed. An example of the inversion operator is presented below.</p><p>Before inversion: 2 1 3 j 4 5 6 7 j 9 8. After inversion: 2 1 3 j 7 6 5 4 j 9 8. 4.3.3.1.2. Tabu list. The move mechanism uses the intelligent Tabu Search strategy, whose principle is to avoid returning to the solution recently visited by using an adaptive memory called Tabu List. The proposed Tabu list is attributive and consists of a list of pairs of integers (i, j), where i,j 2 {1,. . .,n}. It means that it is forbidden to inverse the subsequence of jobs between the position i and the position j, if the pair (i, j) exists in the Tabu List. The Tabu List size, shown as w, is pre-determined and has a sufficiently large value. To diversify the search, long-term memory is employed and the Tabu Tenure (Tmax) is set to infinity. In addition, decencybased and frequency-based memories are used.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.1.3.">Search direction.</head><p>To simultaneously maintain intensification and diversification, we introduce a new function based on a Goal Programming method. This function can be shown as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f ¼ X k i¼1 jf i À F i j w i ;<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where, f i is the ith objective function value of the solution, F i is the ith coordinate value of the ideal point, and w i is the weight of the ith objective function. The motivation for using this metric is that it provides a solution as close as possible to the true Pareto front for a given set of weights w if it minimizes the value of f. The main difference between the proposed function and existing functions is that it facilitates working with a set of solutions that is not necessarily convex. This advantage makes the proposed ETS very convenient to be implemented in every optimization problem with every search space pattern. Another advantage is achieved by generating w i randomly. According to this approach, the proposed ETS can search the solution space in various directions, so that high diversification is maintained.</p><p>To explain the acceptance criteria of a new solution, the variable g is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">g ¼ f B À f A ;<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>where A is the current solution and B is generated from A by a recent move. Therefore, the acceptance criteria can be defined as:</p><p>1. If g 6 0 and the move is not Tabu, solution A is replaced by B.</p><p>2. If g 6 0 but the move is Tabu, the aspiration strategy is used and solution A is replaced by B.</p><p>3. If g &gt; 0 and the move is not Tabu, solution A is replaced by B when solution B is not dominated by solution A. 4. If g &gt; 0 and the move is Tabu, solution A does not change.</p><p>4.3.3.1.4. Stopping criteria. We can use many stopping criteria depending on the nature of the problem being investigated. The most common criterion employed in this paper is the maximum number of iterations. In other words, the proposed ETS is iterated for a • Ntimes. After completing the ETS iterations, a • N solutions will be selected from among the whole set of visited solutions by ETS to be as close to the Pareto front as possible. To prepare the initial set for the HMOIA algorithm, we select those N solutions with the shortest distance to the dynamic ideal point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Adaptive Pareto archive set</head><p>In many investigations, a Pareto archive set is provided to explicitly maintain a limited number of nondominated solutions. This approach is incorporated to prevent losing certain portions of the current non-dominated front during the optimization process. This archive is iteratively updated to get closer to the correct Pareto-optimal front. When a new non-dominated solution is found, it enters the archive set if the archive set is not full; otherwise, it is ignored. When a new solution enters the archive set, any solution in the archive dominated by this solution is removed from the set.</p><p>Once the maximum archive size is exceeded, removing a non-dominated solution may destroy the characteristics of the trade-off front. There are many different and efficient methods to deal with the updating procedure when the archive size is exceeded. The most widely adopted techniques are clustering and k-nearest neighbor methods; however, most of these algorithms do not preclude the problem of temporary deteriorating the solution, and delaying the convergence to the Pareto set.</p><p>In this study, we propose an adaptive Pareto archive set updating procedure that attempts to prevent losing new non-dominated solutions when the Pareto archive has reached its maximum size.</p><p>The archive size, which is shown by Arch_size, is a pre-specified value and must be set at the beginning of the algorithm. When a new non-dominated solution is found, one of the two following possibilities may occur.</p><p>1. The number of solutions in the archive set is less than Arch_size, thus this solution joins the archive set. 2. The number of solutions in the archive set is equal to (or greater than) Arch_size, thus the new solution will be added if its distance to the nearest non-dominated solution in the archive is greater-than-or-equal-to the ''Duplication Area'' of that nearest non-dominated solution in the archive. Consequently, the size of the Pareto archive increases.</p><p>The duplication area of a non-dominated solution in the Pareto archive is defined as a bowl around the solution, with radius k. This area is used as a measure of dissimilarity in order to find diverse non-dominated solutions. The distance between the new non-dominated solution and the nearest non-dominated solution in the archive is measured based on the Euclidean distance. In other words, if the new non-dominated solution is not located in the duplication area of its nearest non-dominated solution, it is considered as a dissimilar solution and added to the Pareto archive set.</p><p>The main advantage of this procedure is that it allows saving dissimilar non-dominated solutions without losing any existing non-dominated solutions in the archive. It must be noted that, the Pareto archive is updated at the end of each iteration of the proposed algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.5.">Cloning</head><p>In clonal selection, only the highest affinity antibodies will be selected to go into the pool. In our proposed approach, antibodies gain membership to the pool according to their quality or diversity. In other words, the pool is a subset of both diverse and high quality antibodies that consists of an approximation of the Pareto-optimal set.</p><p>The construction of the pool starts with the selection of all non-repeated, non-dominated antibodies from the Pareto archive set. If the number of such non-dominated antibodies is smaller than the required pool size, the remaining antibodies are selected from among the dominated antibodies. For this purpose, the dominated antibodies are divided into various fronts, and the required numbers of antibodies are selected with the selection mechanism shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>In this study, the hamming distance is used as a measure to diversify the solution space. This measure is the number of positions in two strings of equal length for which the corresponding elements are different. It allows measuring the number of substitutions required to change one into another.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.6.">Hyper mutation</head><p>The high affinity antibodies selected in the previous step are submitted to the process of hyper mutation. This process consists of two phases that are implemented in a sequential manner, as follows.</p><p>4.3.6.1. Antibodies combination. The combination method that we implemented is based on linear combination. Each time the combination procedure is used, a pre-specified number of clones (b) are selected randomly and linearly combined to produce a new antibody. Let b be 3 and x i , x j and x k be the selected antibodies being combined, then the new antibody x l is obtained with the following line search: It is important to note that the selected clones must be in their continuous representations and that w i , i = 1, 2, 3 are generated at random. 4.3.6.2. Antibodies improvement. Each of the antibodies obtained from the previous step goes through to the improvement method. This method aims to enhance the quality of these solutions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x l ¼ w 1 x i þ w 2 x j þ w 3 x k ; X 3 i¼1 w i ¼ 1:</formula><p>Two operators of the bacterial method, known as bacterial mutation and gene transfer, are applied consecutively when the improvement method is implemented. Bacterial optimization was first introduced by Botzheim and Koczy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and is inspired by the microbial evolution phenomenon. The bacterial mutation operation tries to optimize a single solution, while gene transfer provides the opportunity for the solutions in the population to transfer information by recombination. These operators are described in the next section.</p><p>4.3.6.2.1. Bacterial mutation. Bacterial mutation starts by creating a number of copies of the solution. These copies then go through the mutation operator. Next, all the copies and the original solution are evaluated, and only the best of these solutions survive. The details of this operator are described below.</p><p>1. N clones copies of the solution are generated so that there are (N clones + 1) identical solutions available. 2. The inversion operator is applied to each of the N clones copies. 3. The solution surviving the mutation is the non-dominated solution among the mutated solutions and the original one with the highest crowding distance. All other solutions are discarded. 4. The above procedure is repeated for all of the solutions in the pool. 4.3.6.2.2. Gene transfer. Another operation of bacterial optimization is gene transfer, which suggests that antibodies are allowed to transfer information by recombination. For this purpose, the pool is first divided into two dichotomies of superior and inferior antibodies. Then, two antibodies from each of the dichotomies are randomly selected, and the inferior solution is worked on to improve it towards the superior solution. This operator functions through the following steps.</p><p>1. The pool is divided into two groups: non-dominated and dominated antibodies. 2. One solution is randomly chosen from the non-dominated antibodies and another from the dominated antibodies. 3. In order to improve the dominated antibody towards the non-dominated antibody, each gene of the dominated antibody is checked against its corresponding gene in the non-dominated antibody for equality. If they contain identical values, the dominated antibody maintains the gene; otherwise, the gene becomes empty.</p><p>Next, the values missing in the dominated antibody are identified and inserted into the empty genes in a random manner. This operator is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. In this figure, the values of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th gene are directly copied into the improved solution and the remaining genes are randomly filled with {7, 5, 2, 1}.</p><p>Steps 1, 2, and 3 are repeated N inf times, where N inf is the number of ''infections'' per generation.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table">8</ref> represents the average computational times consumed by each algorithm. These results illustrate that the proposed HMOIA consumes more computational time than the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

The validation of the proposed multi-objective immune algorithm necessitated the design of various test problems and evaluated the performance and reliability of the proposed HMOIA in comparison with five multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely PS-NC GA, NSGA-II, SPEA-II, MOIA, and MISA, to solve the given problems. Some useful comparison metrics, such as the number of Pareto optimal solutions found by the algorithm, error ratio, generational distance, spacing metric, and diversity metric were applied to validate the efficiency of the proposed HMOIA. Our experimental results indicated that the proposed HMOIA outperforms the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and improves the quality of the obtained solutions, especially for large-sized problems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
