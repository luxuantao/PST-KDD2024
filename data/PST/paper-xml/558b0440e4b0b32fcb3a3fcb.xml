<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>For discrete-time Markov chains with translation invariance of transition probabilities on polyhedra, we have exploited the structure of the average cost inequality and obtained computational performance bounds. Simple quadratic forms were considered as surrogates for the differential cost function in an inequality relaxation of the average cost equation. The framework enables the modeling of multiclass queueing networks and failure prone manufacturing systems under a rich class of scheduling policies. The bounds are less afflicted by the curse of dimensionality than exact dynamic programming approaches and reduced complexity bounds were obtained for linear switch curve policies. The use of piecewise quadratic surrogates will improve the tightness of the bounds at the cost of increased computational complexity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recent technological advances are revolutionizing our ability to build large scale distributed networked control systems (NCS). One of the major problems associated with NSC is that measurements arrive at the decision-making location with a nondeterministic delay or can be totally lost along the way, therefore it is important to simultaneously evaluate the impact of random packet delay and packet loss in the overall system performance.</p><p>Recently several groups have looked at networked control systems with large random delay or packet loss, an area that has been recently surveyed in the context of packet-switched networks by Hespanha et al. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In particular, there has been considerable effort in analyzing the effect of variable and random delay but no packet loss, such as in <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, or the effect of packet loss but no delay such as in <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. The aforementioned works are just a small fraction of all the available literature on the subject and we refer the interested reader to <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Nonetheless, very little work has been done to simultaneously take into account packet drop and packet delay, leading to somewhat conservative results based on worst-case scenarios <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by these considerations, the goal of this work is to study optimal estimator design for systems subject to random packet delay and packet loss. We derive the minimum error covariance estimator and we show that it is equivalent to a time-varying Kalman filter with a buffer. We also present two alternative estimator architectures which are computationally more efficient. In the first architecture, the estimator gains are constrained to be constant rather than stochastic as in the time-varying optimal estimator. In the second architecture, smart sensors are used to preprocess data and to improve estimation performance. Also necessary and sufficient conditions for stability for these estimators are provided, as well as numerical algorithms and simulations. In the interest of space, some proofs, detailed mathematical derivations and additional numerical examples are omitted, and can be found in a longer version of this work available as a technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>Consider the following discrete time linear stochastic plant:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">xt+1 = Axt + wt (1) y t = Cx t + v t (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where t 2 ; x; w 2 n ; y 2 m ; A 2 n 2 n ; y 2 m ; C 2 m 2 n ; (x0; wt; vt) are Gaussian, uncorrelated, white, with mean ( x 0 ; 0; 0) and covariance (P 0 ; Q; R) respectively. We also assume that the pair (A; C) is observable, (A; Q 1=2 ) is reachable, and R &gt; 0 1 .</p><p>Measurements are time-stamped, encapsulated into packets, and then transmitted through a digital communication network (DCN), whose goal is to deliver packets from a source to a destination. Time-stamping of measurements is necessary to reorder packets at the receiver side since they can arrive out of order. Modern DCNs are in general very complex and can greatly differ in their architecture and implementation depending on the medium used, and on the applications they are meant to serve. In our work we model a DCN as a module between the plant and the estimator which delivers observation measurements to the estimator with possibly random delays. We assume that all observation packets correctly delivered to the estimator site are stored in an infinite buffer, as shown in left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The arrival process is modeled via the random variable t k defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">t k =</formula><p>1; if y k is at the estimator before or at time t; t k 0; otherwise.</p><p>(3)</p><p>From this definition it follows that ( t k = 1) ) ( t+h k = 1; 8h 2 ), which simply states that if packet y k is present in the receiver buffer at time t, then it will be present for all future times. We also define the packet delay k 2 f ; 1g for observation y k as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">k = 1; if t k = 0; 8t k t k 0 k; otherwise; where t k = minft j t k = 1g (4)</formula><p>where t k is the arrival time of observation y k at the estimator site. Since the packet delay can be random, observation measurements can arrive out of order at the estimator site. Also it is possible that between two consecutive sampling periods no packet or multiple packets are delivered. If observation y k is not yet arrived at the estimator at time t, we assume that a zero 2 is stored in the k-slot of the buffer, as shown in left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. More formally, the value stored in the k-slot of the estimator buffer at time t can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ỹt k = t k y k = t k Cx k + t k v k :<label>(5)</label></formula><p>1 These assumptions can be relaxed to (A; C ) detectable, (A; Q ) stabilizable, and R 0, however the proofs of the following theorems would be more involved, therefore we prefer to adopt the stronger hypotheses. 2 In practice, any arbitrary value can be stored in the buffer slots corresponding to the packets which have not arrived, since as it will be shown later, the optimal estimator does not use those values as they do not convey any information about the state x . Our choice of storing a zero simply reduces some mathematical burden. Our goal is to compute the optimal mean square estimator xt j t which is given by xt j t = [x t j ỹt ; t ;</p><p>x 0 ; P 0 ] where ỹt = (ỹ t 1 ; ỹt 2 ; . . . ; ỹt t ) and t = ( t 1 ; t 2 ; . . . ; t t ). It is important to remark that the estimator above has the information whether a packet has been delivered or not, and it is not equivalent to computing xt j t 6 = x t j t = [x t j ỹt ;</p><p>x 0 ; P 0 ]. The latter estimator would, in fact, consider the zero entries of the buffer as true measurements and not as dummy variables, thus providing a lower performance. It is also useful to define the estimator error e t j t = x t 0 xt j t and error covariance P t j t = [ e t j t e T t j t j ỹt; t ; x0; P0]. The estimate xt j t is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the error covariance, i.e., given any estimator xt j t = f (ỹ t ; t ), where f is a measurable function, we always have</p><p>[(x t 0 xt j t )(x t 0 xt j t ) T j ỹt ; t ;</p><p>x 0 ; P 0 ] P t j t :</p><p>Another property of the mean square optimal estimator is that xt j t and its error e t j t = x t 0 xt j t are uncorrelated, i.e., [e t j t xT t j t ] = 0.</p><p>This is a fundamental property since it is necessary to give rise to the separation principle for the LQG optimal control, which is one of the most widely used tools in control system design <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MINIMUM ERROR COVARIANCE ESTIMATOR DESIGN</head><p>In this section we want to compute the optimal estimator given by <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. First, it is convenient to define the following variables: xt k j h = x k j t h ; . . . ; t 1 ; ỹt h ; . . . ; ỹt 1 ;</p><p>x 0 ; P 0 P t k j h = (x k 0 xt k j h ) x t 0 xt k j h T j t h ; . . . ; t 1 ; ỹt h ; . . . ; ỹt 1 ;</p><p>x 0 ; P 0 from which it follows that, with a little abuse of notation, xt j t = xt t j t and P t j t = P t t j t .</p><p>It is also useful to note that at time t the information available at the estimator site, given by (5), can be written as the output of the following system:</p><p>x k+1 = Ax k + w k (7) ỹt k+1 = C t k+1 x k+1 + ṽt k+1 ; k = 0; . . . ; t 0 1 <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref> where the random variables ṽt k = t k v k are uncorrelated, zero mean white noise with covariance R t k = [ṽ t k (ṽ t k ) T ] = t k R, and C t k = t k C. For any fixed t this system can be seen as a linear time-varying system with respect to time k, where the only time-varying elements are the observation matrix C t k and measurement noise covariance R t k . We can now state the main theorem of this section. Theorem 1: Let us consider the stochastic linear system given in (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>), where R &gt; 0. Also consider the arrival process defined by <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>, and the mean square estimator defined in <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. Then we have the following.</p><p>a) The optimal mean square estimator is given by xt j t = xt t j t where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">xt k j k = Ax t k01 j k01 + t k K t k ỹt k 0 CAx t k01 j k01<label>(9)</label></formula><p>K t k = P t k j k01 C T CP t k j k01 C T + R 01 (10)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P t k+1 j k = AP t k j k01 A T + Q 0 t k AK t k CP t k j k01 A T<label>(11)</label></formula><p>for k = 1; . . . ; t and xt 0 j 0 = x0; P t 1 j 0 = P0. b) The optimal estimator xt j t can be computed iteratively using a buffer of finite length</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">N if t k = t01 k ; 8k 1; 8t k + N . If</formula><p>this property is satisfied, then xt j t = xt t j t where xt t j t is given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">9</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">11</ref>) for t = 1; . . . ; N and as follows for t &gt; N</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">xt t0N j t0N = xt01 t0N j t0N<label>(12)</label></formula><p>P t t0N+1 j t0N = P t01 t0N+1 j t0N <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(13)</ref> Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">9</ref>), <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">11</ref>) k = t 0 N + 1; . . . ; t <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(14)</ref> Proof: a) Since the information available at the estimator site at time t is given by the time-varying linear stochastic system of ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), the optimal estimator ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">9</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">11</ref>) can be easily obtained by substituting</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C t k+1 = t k+1 C and R t k = t k R into the standard Kalman filtering equations. b) Let us consider t &gt; N. If t k = t01 k ; 8 k 1; 8 t k +</formula><p>N , then also P t k+1 j k = P t01 k+1 j k and xt k j k = xt01 k j k hold under the same conditions on the indices. In particular, it holds for k = t 0 N which implies P t t0N+1 j t0N = P t01 t0N+1 j t0N and xt t0N j t0N = xt01 t0N j t0N . Therefore, it not necessary to compute P t t+1 j t and xt t j t at any time step t starting from k = 1, but it is sufficient to use the values xt01</p><p>t0N j t0N and P t01 t0N+1 j t0N precomputed at the previous time step t 0 1, as in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), and then iterate ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">9</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">11</ref>) using the latest N observations. In practice, the optimal estimator corresponds to a time-varying Kalman filter with a possibly infinite buffer, unless there is a guarantee that if a packet arrives at the receiver then it does within N time steps. It is important to remark that differently from the standard Kalman filter for a time-invariant system, neither the optimal gain nor the error covariance converges to a steady state value, therefore up to N matrices have to be inverted per each time step.</p><p>The time-varying Kalman filter described above is optimal for any packet delay generating process, however from an engineering perspective it is important to determine the performance of the estimator. In this scenario a natural performance metric is the expected error covariance, i.e., [P t+1 j t ], where the expectation is performed with respect to the arrival process t k . However, it is not clear whether such quantity converges to a steady state, therefore rather than trying to bound performance of the time-varying optimal estimator as suggested in <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, in the next section, we will focus on filters with constant gains and with a finite buffer dimension, i.e., we will consider K t t0h = K h for all t 2 ; h = 0; . . . ; N 0 1. The gains K h will then be optimized to achieve the smallest expected error covariance at steady-state. The advantage of using constant gains is that, differently from the optimal time-varying filter, it is not necessary to invert any matrix at all, thus making it attractive for on-line applications. Moreover, since filters with constant gains are necessarily suboptimal, the computation of their error covariance is useful per se since they provide upper bounds for the error covariance of the optimal minimum error covariance filter given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">9</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">11</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OPTIMAL ESTIMATION WITH CONSTANT GAINS</head><p>In this section, we study minimum error covariance filters with constant gains under stationary independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) arrival processes.</p><p>Assumption: The packet arrival process at the estimator site is stationary and i.i.d. with the following probability function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">[t h] = h (15)</formula><p>where t 0, and 0 h 1 is a nondecreasing in h = 0; 1; 2; . . ., and t was defined in (4). Equation ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) corresponds to the probability that a packet sampled h time steps ago has arrived at the estimator.</p><p>Obviously, h must be nonincreasing since h = [ t h 0 1] + [t = h] = h01 + [t = h]. Also, we define the packet loss probability as loss = 1 0 supf h j h 0g. otherwise.</p><p>(16) Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows some typical scenarios that can be modeled under the previous hypotheses. Scenario (A) corresponds to a deterministic process where all packets are successfully delivered to the estimator with a constant delay. This scenario is typical of wired systems. Scenario (B) models a DCN that guarantees delivery of all packets within a finite time window max, but the delay is not deterministic. This is a common scenario in drive-by-wire systems. Scenario (C) represents a DCN which drops packets that are older than max and consequently a fraction loss &gt; 0 of observations is lost. This scenario is often encountered in wireless sensor networks. Scenario (D) corresponds to a DCN with no packet loss but with unbounded random packet delay. One example of such a scenario is a DCN that continues to retransmit a packet till it is not delivered.</p><p>In the rest of the note, we will use the following definition of stability for an estimator.</p><p>Definition: Let xt j t = f (ỹ t ; t ) be a generic estimator, where f is a measurable function, and ẽt j t = x t 0 xt j t and Pt j t = [ẽ t j t ẽT t j t j ỹt ; t ] its error and error covariance, respectively. We say that the estimator is mean-square stable and asymptotically unbiased if and only if lim t!1 [ẽ t j t ] = 0 and [ Pt j t ] M for some M &gt; 0 and for all t 1. The previous definition can be rephrased in terms of the moments of the estimator error. In fact the conditions above are equivalent to limt!1 [kẽ t j t k] = 0 and [kẽ t j t k 2 ] trace (M).</p><p>Let us consider the following constant-gain estimator xtjt = xt t j t with finite-buffer of dimension N , where xt t j t is computed as follows:</p><p>xt t0k j t0k = Ax t t0k01 j t0k01 + t t0k K k (ỹ t t0k 0 CAx t t0k01 j t0k01 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(17) xt t0N j t0N = xt01 t0N j t0N<label>(18)</label></formula><p>xt 0k j0k =</p><p>x 0 ; t 0k = 0; ỹt 0k = 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(19)</formula><p>for k = N 0 1; ... ; 0, where the last line includes some dummy vari- ables necessary to initialize the estimator for t = 1; ...; N . Note that the constant-gain estimator structure is very similar to the optimal estimator structure given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">9</ref>) since the estimate is corrected only if the observation has arrived, i.e., t t0k = 1, otherwise only the open loop prediction is considered. However, differently from (9), the gains K k ; k = 0; ...; N 0 1 are constant and independent of t, and the computation of the estimate xtjt does not require any on-line matrix inversion.</p><p>We also define the following variables that will be useful to analyze the performance of the estimator:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">xt k+1 j k = Ax t k j k (20) ẽt k+1 j k = x k+1 0 xt k+1 j k (21) Pt k+1 j k = [ẽ t k+1 j k ẽt k+1 j k j ỹt; t ]<label>(22)</label></formula><p>P t k+1 j k = [ẽ t k+1 j k ẽt k+1 j k ] = Pt k+1 j k (23</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>where t k 1.

To obtain the previous equations we invoked independence of t k ; v k ; w k , and ẽt k j k01 , and the fact that v k and w k are zero mean. For ease of notation, let us define the following operator:</p></div>

In particular, if we define S t = P t01 t0N+1 j t0N , then (28) can be written as St+1 = L (KN01;St):</p><p>(30) Since all matrices P t t0k+1 j t0k ; k = 0; . ..;N 0 1 can be obtained from S t it follows that stability of estimator can be inferred from the properties of the operator L (K; P ). The following lemma provides these properties.</p><p>Lemma 1: Consider the operator L (K; P ) as defined in (27). As- sume also that P 0; (A; C) is observable, (A; Q 1=2 ) is reachable, R &gt; 0, and 0 1. Also consider the following operator:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">8 (P) = AP A T + Q 0 AP C T (CPC T + R) 01 CP A T (31)</formula><p>and the gain K P = P C T (CPC T + R) 01 . Then the following statements are true: a) L (K; P ) = 8 (P) + A(K 0 KP )(CPC T + R)(K 0 K P ) T A T . b) L (K; P ) 8 (P) = L (K P ; P ); 8 K. c) (P1 P2) =) (8 (P1) 8 (P2)). d) ( 1 2 ) =) (8 (P) 8 (P)); 8 P . e) If there exists P 3 such that P 3 = L (K; P 3 ), then P 3 &gt; 0 and it is unique. Consequently this is true also for K = KP , where P 3 = 8 (P 3 ). f) If ( 1 2 ) and there exist P 3 1 ; P 3 2 such that P 3 1 = 8 (P 3 1 )</p><p>and P 3 2 = 8 (P 3</p><p>2 ), then P 3 1 P 3 2 .</p><p>g) Let S t+1 = L (K; S t ) and S 0 0. If S 3 = L (K; S 3 ) has a solution, then lim t!1 S t = S 3 , otherwise S t is unbounded. h) If there exists S 3 ; K such that S 3 = L (K; S 3 ), then also P 3 = 8 (P 3 ) exists and P 3 S 3 . i) If A is strictly stable, then P 3 = 8 (P 3 ) has always a solution.</p><p>Otherwise, there exist c such that P 3 = 8 (P 3 ) has a solution if and only if &gt; c . Also min c max , where max = 1 0 (1= i j u i j 2 );min = 1 0 (1=maxi j u i j 2 ), and j u i j 1 are the unstable eigenvalues of A. In particular c = max if rank(C) = 1, and c = min if C is square and invertible. j) The critical probability c and the fixed point P 3 = 8 (P 3 ) for &gt; c can be obtained as the solutions of the fol- lowing semi-definite programming (SDP) problems: c = inff j 9 (Y; Z) &gt; 0; 0 Y I; for some Z; Y 2 n 2 n g, and P 3 = argmaxftrace(P) j 2 (P) 0;P 0g where we have the equation shown at the bottom of the next page. k) If there exist P 3 &gt; 0 and K such that P 3 = L (K; P 3 ), then the matrix A c = A(I 0 KC) is strictly stable.</p><p>Proof: See Appendix. The previous lemma provides all tools necessary to analyze and design the optimal estimator with constant gains. In particular, fact (g) indicates that the constant gain K 3 that minimizes the steady state error covariance P 3 can be derived from the unique fixed point of the non- linear operator P 3 = 8 (P 3 ), where K 3 = K P . If the optimal gain K 3 is used, then the expected error covariance converges to P 3 regard- less of the initial conditions (P 0 ;</p><p>x 0 ), as it follows from fact (f). Fact (i)</p><p>shows that if the system A is unstable the arrival probability needs to be sufficiently large to ensure stability, and that the critical value c is a function of the unstable eigenvalues of A. Finally, although c and the fixed point P 3 = 8 (P 3 ) cannot be computed in closed form, from fact (j) it follows that they can be efficiently computed using numerical optimization tools. Finally, fact (k) will be used to show that if the error covariance is bounded then the estimator is also unbiased. The following theorem shows how to compute the optimal estimator with constant gains.</p><p>Theorem 2: Let us consider the stochastic linear system given in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>), where (A; C) is observable, (A; Q 1=2 ) is reachable, and R &gt; 0.

The previous theorem shows that the optimal gains can be obtained by finding the fixed point of a modified algebraic Riccati Equation ( <ref type="formula">33</ref>) and then iterating N times an operator with the same structure but with different k . The theorem also demonstrates that a stable estimator with constant gains exists if and only if the optimal estimator with constant gains exists, therefore the optimal estimator design also implicitly solves the problem of existence of stable estimators. If the system to be estimated is unstable, then the estimator is stable if and only if the packet loss probability loss is sufficiently small, independently of the packet delay max , thus recovering the same stability conditions de- rived in <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. Moreover, the performance of the estimator, i.e., its steady error covariance limt!1 P t+1 j t = limt!1 [e t+1 j t e T t+1 j t ] =</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">K N k = V N k C T CV N k C T +</formula><p>V N 0 , improves as the buffer length N is increased, which is to be ex- pected since more information is stored. However, if the maximum packet delay is finite max &lt; 1, then the performance of the estimator does not improve for N &gt; max . From a practical perspective, the previous tools can be used by the designer to evaluate the tradeoff between the estimator performance V N 0 and buffer length N which is directly related to computational requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. OPTIMAL ESTIMATION WITH COLOCATED SMART SENSORS</head><p>In this section, we describe an alternative estimator architecture based on data preprocessing at the sensor location to improve the overall performance. This approach, independently proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[14]</ref> in a scenario where no delay was present but only packet loss, suggests to compute and transmit the state estimate rather than the raw measurement. This approach gives an estimator that has a better performance as compared with the time-varying Kalman filter of Section IV. and it also provides a computable lower bound for the performance of the time-varying Kalman filter of Section III. However, it is applicable only if some computational resources are available at the sensor, commonly known as "smart sensor," and if all entries of the observation vector y t are collected from sensors which are colocated.</p><p>Rather than sensing the raw measurements y t over the DCN the sensor computes the minimum error covariance state estimate xe t = [x t j y t ; . ..;y 1 ] whose estimation error e e t = x t+1 0 Ax e t has co- variance cov(e e t ) = [e e t e e t j yt; . ..; y1] = P e t . The state estimate computed by the sensor encoder is then transmitted over the DCN to the decoder estimator. Using the same notation as in <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref> the value stored at the buffer can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">ỹt k = t k xe k :<label>(37)</label></formula><p>Let us define the delay of the most recent packet arrived at the decoder estimator as t = t 0 maxfk j t k = 1g if 9 t k = 1, or t = t, otherwise. The estimate of the current state at the decoder estimator xd t is computed as follows: receiver side; in fact it suffices to store the most recent packet arrived at the receiver and then to compute the best state estimate at current time by premultiplying the packet data with a matrix that depends on the packet delay. Moreover, as for the estimator of Section III, the estimator based on colocated smart sensors neither requires any statistical a priori knowledge of the arrival process. However, if the packet arrival statistics are stationary and i.i.d., then it is possible to give stability criteria and to compute the expected error covariance as shown in the following theorem: Theorem 4: Let us consider the stochastic linear system given in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>), where (A; C) is observable, (A; Q 1=2 ) is reachable, and R &gt; 0. Also consider the arrival process defined by ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), and the es- timator architecture given by (38). Then the estimator is stable if and only if A is stable, or loss &lt; (1=j u max (A)j 2 ), where u max (A) is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix A.  Proof: The proof follows along the same lines as Theorem 2, and can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The previous theorem shows that performance of the smart optimal estimator under the assumption of i.i.d. packet arrival process, can be obtained by solving the Lyapunov Equation (40) and then iterating (41)</p><p>for N = max times if max is finite. Otherwise if max = 1, then D 1 can be computed within any arbitrary precision through the sequence D N 0 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES</head><p>Here we illustrate the use of the tools developed in the previous sections with the aid of a numerical example. Additional examples can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[12]</ref>. Let us consider the following probability function of packet delay:  <ref type="figure">3</ref>. As mentioned in Section III, the expected error covariance for time-varying optimal estimator of Theorem 1 cannot be computed explicitly but it is upper-bounded and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Trace of the steady-state error covariance for the optimal estimator with constant gains (V ), for the optimal estimator with a smart sensor (D ). The horizontal line P corresponds to the trace of the error covariance in the ideal scenario with no delay and no packet loss, i.e., = 1 for all h, while T is the actual steady-state error when using the Kalman gain K .</p><p>lower-bounded by V N 0 and by D N 0 , respectively. It is interesting to compare the performance of these estimators with the error covariance P e 1 = 8 1 (P e 1 ) corresponding to the ideal case when there is no packet loss and no delay, since it gives an idea of the degradation due to the communication network. It is also relevant to evaluate the performance of an estimator with constant gains designed without exploiting the prior knowledge about the packet arrival statistics. A natural choice is to use the standard Kalman gain K e 1 = P e 1 C T (CP e 1 C T + R) 01 , i.e., K k = K e 1 ; k = 0; . . . ; N rather than the optimal constant gains K N k defined in Theorem 2. The corresponding expected error covariance T N 0 can be obtained by ( <ref type="formula">35</ref>)-(36) and it is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. From this example it is clear that the tools developed in this note can help to substantially reduce the degradation of performance when statistics of packet arrival are available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work, we proposed a framework to optimally design and analyze the performance of estimators subject to simultaneous random packet delay and packet drop. The tools developed in this note are useful from both a control system design perspective and a communication design perspective. In fact, from a control perspective they can help to evaluate the tradeoffs between performance (error covariance), memory requirements (buffer length), and the hardware resources ("smart" sensor and fast matrix inversion). While, from a communication perspective, they can be used to compare different communication protocols specifically designed for real time applications. A possible future avenue of research is the extension of this work to the design of estimators with multiple distributed sensors y i t , each with a different packet arrival statistics. Although it has been shown that the time-varying Kalman filter and the filter with constant gains can be extended to this scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[15]</ref>, the scheme based on a smart sensor does not generalize easily because it is well known that it is not always possible to reconstruct the optimal filter from local estimates.</p></div>

Differently, if the encoder sends the raw measurement similarly to the time-varying Kalman filter of Theorem 1, then the estimate at the decoder will be xy t = [xt j yt0 ; . ..;yi+1; yi01; ...; y1] = [xt j Ỹt0 ], where some of measurements y i might be lost. Since we always have Y t0 Ỹt0 , then the error covariance of the smart estimator xd t will always be smaller than the error covariance of the time-varying Kalman filter xy t independently of the arrival sequence. From this observation, it follows the following theorem. Theorem 3: Let us consider the stochastic linear system given in (1)-(2), where R &gt; 0. Also consider the packet arrival process defined by (3). Let xy t = xt t j t be the optimal estimator given by (9)-(11) when raw measurements yt are transmitted over the network.

Clearly L (K; P ) = F(P) + D, where D 0. Consider the sequences S t+1 = L (K P ; S t ); T t+1 = L (K P ; T t ) with initial condition T 0 S 0 = 0. Note that S t = t01 k=0 F k (D) and Tt = F t (T0) + t01 k=0 F k (D) for t 1, where we define F 0 (D) = D and F k+1 (D) = F F k (D).
