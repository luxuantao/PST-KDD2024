<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation</head><p>INCE the first launch of Sputnik 1 in October of 1957, nearly five thousand satellites have been sent into space during the last 59 years. When a satellite enters into orbit, it brings along several separated debris in orbit, as well. According to a report by Telegraph Media Group Ltd, approximately 370,000 pieces of space debris are currently orbiting the Earth, traveling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph.</p><p>The scenario is especially problematic in the valuable geostationary orbit (GEO). In GEO, hundreds of satellites are with high commercial and military value. If the satellites are not maneuvered properly, longitude drifting and orbit plane precession are inevitable due to orbital perturbations. The growing GEO population has resulted in a high-risk environment for the sizable number of active spacecraft operations within the orbital regime. This environment is conducive to collisions between the spacecrafts and the debris such as exhausted satellites or fractions of previous collisions or explosions; and worse, because the aerodynamic force is extremely low at GEO altitude, this debris will remain in the vicinity of the GEO orbit in perpetuity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. If the space debris problem is not effectively resolved, mankind may lose its geosynchronous satellite orbit within the next 20 years.</p><p>This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 11272256. * Corresponding author, Prof. Panfeng Huang, School of Astronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University. The authors are with the National Key Laboratory of Aerospace Flight Dynamics and Research Center for Intelligent Robotics, School of Astronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China. E-mail: pfhuang@ nwpu.edu.cn.</p><p>In effort to respond appropriately to the urgency of the GEO situation, we propose a novel on-orbit mechanism for capturing large non-cooperative debris targets called the DTSR system which has three especially notable characteristics: dexterity, light-weight, and cost-effectiveness. The DTSR, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, is comprised of a Robot Platform, a 200-meter long Space Tether, and an Operational Robot. In the scenario referred to in this paper, the tethered Operational Robot is released from the Robot Platform, approaches and secures the debris object (i.e., -target‖), and then accomplish its mission. The DTSR has a large operational radius, great flexibility, and can effectively drag dead satellites into -graveyard orbits‖ via its space tether. It is also expected to move derelict satellite into new orbits by the DTSR. In practice, these treatments would spare valuable orbital paths and minimize collisions among working satellites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Related Works</head><p>Several space debris retrieval and de-orbiting solutions have been already proposed in response to the growing problem of potentially devastating collisions; these include giant tethered harpoons, tethered nets, magnets, earth-bound lasers, and even a gigantic plate or umbrella-shaped machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In USA, DARPA project would launch a harvester spacecraft called Phoenix to collect valuable parts of passive satellites such as antennas and solar panels <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, creating -zombie satellites‖ capable of executing missions (e.g., signal relay). The TAMU Sweeper, an efficient mission structure proposed by Texas A&amp;M University <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, was designed to de-orbit space debris by capturing and properly expelling them. Unfortunately, TAMU's hemispherical capture device is too small in diameter to capture full-size satellite debris. The design is also flawed in that it necessitates skeptical rigid impact for capturing debris <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>In Europe, Astrium UK designed a shooting system for capturing passive satellites or other debris with a tethered harpoon carried by a -chaser satellite‖ <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The connected tether drags the debris into an atmospheric descent where it self-ignites. The device consists of a terminal harpoon, a connected space tether, and a releasing subsystem; the harpoon itself, which is mounted on the chaser satellite and fired with compressed nitrogen, is composed of a barbed gripper which firmly grasps targets, a crush to control the gripper's penetration depth, and a shaft that forms an interface with the firing system. The Swiss Space Center developed a 30-40 kg microsatellite called CleanSpace One (CSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> designed to rendezvous, attach to, and de-orbit the SwissCube CubeSat by means of a grabbing system. CSO employs two different design schemes: One is a stowed grasping system with a robotic arm and deployment mechanism, the other is a deployed grasping system with an electroactive polymer. This system, though complicated mechanically, has been demonstrated successfully between cooperative objects. The DEOS (German orbital servicing mission) project <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> of the DLR Space Administration was designed to capture a tumbling passive satellite debris in an LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and de-orbit it via a chaser satellite. The system contains a -tug boat‖ <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> that docks on high value satellites, then takes over their attitude and orbit control to extend their lifespan. There are drawbacks to this type of design, for example, precise and highly fuel-consumptive rendezvous and docking maneuvers are required prior to capture. Moreover, the systems are complex and costly, as well. The capture operation is limited only to targets suited to the capture mechanism, and any problem that arises during capture can gravely endanger the service satellite.</p><p>In Asia, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Institute of Aerospace Technology is developing a space debris de-orbiting system for active space targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. A small electro-dynamic tether (EDT) package is under research that is composed of a bare electric-tether which collects electrons from ambient plasma, as well as field emitter cathodes (FECs) with carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) that emit electrons. This package is designed to reduce the target's orbit altitude and remove the target without consuming any fuel. It is not known how the system would recognize and measure non-cooperative targets, and its insulation layer is difficult to fabricate.</p><p>In summary, there have certainly been many valuable contributions to the literature, but the LEO debris removal system has been attracted more attentions since it is relatively easier to be designed. Until now, there is not an efficacious GEO debris removal system. Although it has been proposed over the decades, each of these proposals can be shown to have some problems in implementation and cost. Thus, GEO debris problem is far from settled.</p><p>In this study, we designed a novel GEO debris removal system called the Dexterous Tethered Space Robot to clear away retired or failed targets (with special focus on large, non-cooperative satellites). Actually, a typical DTSR mission is not a simple task. Once in orbit, the DTSR must adjust its trajectory in order to match its target's orbital plane, then capture and stabilize the target with its gripping mechanism once within the capture range of the target. When the capture has been accomplished, the Robot Platform de-orbits the target to a graveyard orbit and jettisons the debris.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Contribution</head><p>The primary contributions of our paper are: 1) We present a novel system for GEO debris removal tasks with a large working radius and enhanced capability; 2) We propose a orbit and attitude control method that coordinates thrusters and space tether to minimize fuel consumption; 3) Novel, non-cooperative target recognition algorithms are used in the proposed visual perception subsystem which realize accurate pose measurement.</p><p>The DTSR system has several attractive characteristics. It is dexterous, highly flexible, and has a large operational distance facilitated by the tether. It is also lightweight and relatively simple; the Operational Robot component, for example, has only 10 kg mass. It is also cost-effective to build, reusable, and can be launched easily. These factors are all described in greater detail below. Space debris removal is not the only purpose of DTSR and the use can be extended other space manipulations, such as spacecraft rescue.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the system design and advisable mission scenarios of the DTSR in detail. Section III and IV discuss the vision-based pose measurement and coordinated control methodologies in regards to tracking optimal trajectories. Numerical simulations and ground semi-physical experiments are described in Section V, and conclusions are provided in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. DTSR SYSTEM DESIGN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Design Considerations</head><p>The DTSR was designed to eliminate the limitations of previously proposed debris removal spacecraft. The targets of DTSR are those expensive, useful, and un-tumbling (or slow-tumbling) passive GEO satellites. Because many of such targets are uncooperative and ill-suited to a typical capture device, we designed the DTSR with a dexterous and flexible Operational Robot with a three-finger -hand‖. We also designed the Operational Robot to be as light-weight as possible to lower the total cost of any space debris removal mission by a substantial margin. We also carefully considered the tradeoff between commercial efficiency (e.g., cost, fuel consumption) and operational efficiency (e.g., successful debris removal) as it applies to the real-world deployment of the DTSR.</p><p>&gt; IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AES, &lt; 3 The Operational Robot has a total mass of 10 kg, length of 480 mm, and diameter of 260 mm. It is a free-flying element that is connected to the Robot Platform via the Space Tether. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2</ref>, the Operational Robot is hexahedron in shape and composed of seven subsystems: structure subsystem, power supply subsystem, thermal control subsystem, propulsion subsystem, guide, navigation and control (GNC) subsystem, visual perception subsystem, and central processing subsystem. Two stereo camera sets, two light emitting diodes (LEDs), and a three-finger gripping element (-hand‖) are mounted on the front panel. Cooperative visual markers fixed on the back panel are used for relative pose measurement between the Operational Robot and Robot Platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. System Composition</head><p>The schematic diagrams of the thruster and tether release mechanisms are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The motions of the Operational Robot are performed via a cold gas propulsion system which includes 12 thrusters of 0.5 N thrust force each and a tank containing about 1 kg liquid nitrogen. High performance IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is used for attitude measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. During deployment, the reel motor (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) is in constant torque mode to deliver a slight damping which keeps the tether under a constant micro-tension.</p><p>The DTSR's Space Tether is non-conductive and of high strength. It is not able to transmit information or supply electric power. We use the tether mainly to provide tension for coordinated control and to de-orbit target debris while consuming minimal fuel. Furthermore, the tether is assumed to be inelastic because the elastic effects exert only slight influence on the DTSR's performance.</p><p>The Robot Platform is a large-scale, general space platform capable of autonomous orbit transfer and multiple space tasks. Several functional loads (one or several types) can be mounted on it. Likewise, it can be designed with several sensors (e.g., stereo cameras, laser range finder, microwave radar) to inspect, track, and measure targets. It can freely fly to any point about 200 m away from the target, then the Operational Robot can be released from the launch subsystem at said point. The Operational Robot is fixed on the Robot Platform only by pulling and fixation of the space tether via the reel and motor mounted in the launch subsystem. The Robot Platform also provides the relative pose information between the Operational Robot and the non-cooperative target through its various sensors. All the position and attitude information and the commands are transmitted to the Operational Robot through 2.4GHz wireless network. Since the Robot Platform is a standard space platform and has been extensively studied in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>[10], we omit the detailed descriptions in this paper. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the DTSR's mission scenario (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>) begins with the launch of heavy rockets (e.g., CZ-3) capable of transporting a 3800 kg spacecraft into a geostationary orbit. When the DTSR reaches deep space and is separated from the rocket, it performs an injection maneuver (apogee maneuver) via its own propulsion system to enter nearby GEO, allowing for phasing to an orbit position from which a rendezvous maneuver to the first target can be implemented. The entire rendezvous is divided into several sub-maneuvers in order to minimize the effects of uncertainties, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>, where -R-bar‖ and -V-bar‖ describe the tangential direction and radial direction of the orbit, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Mission Scenario</head><p>1) Orbital inclination sub-maneuver. After the inclination sub-maneuver, the system is located at a point (S1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>) about 230 km below and 500 km behind or in front of the target, with the same inclination as the target but not the same altitude. This sub-maneuver is implemented under the guidance of the ground station.</p><p>2) Homing sub-maneuver. A thrust maneuver (homing) allows for drifting to the point (S2) on the same orbit altitude as the target but 15 km behind it. This sub-maneuver is also guided by the ground station, but once it has been accomplished, the target is within the sensing range of the Robot Platform's measuring and inspection system.</p><p>3) Approaching sub-maneuver. An approaching maneuver with thrust impulses guides the DTSR to point S3, about 1 km away from the target.</p><p>4) In-plane inspection sub-maneuver. An in-plane ellipse inspection is conducted to detect the geometric parameters of the target. These parameters are used to estimate whether the target satisfies the Operational Robot's constraints. This maneuver also leads the DTSR to point S4, about 200 m away from the target. At this point, the Operational Robot is launched from the launch subsystem mounted on the Robot Platform and flies to the target automatically.</p><p>5) Final maneuvers. Once launched, the Operational Robot flies to the target and is connected to the Robot Platform via the Space Tether. From 200 m to 20 m, the Robot Platform estimates the pose information (relative position and orientation) of the non-cooperative target and the Operational Robot using various sensors, as mentioned above. The relative pose information between the target and Operational Robot can then be indirectly calculated and sent to the Operational Robot's GNC subsystem. Optimal trajectory planning and coordinated controller are utilized to make the Operational Robot approach the target stably throughout this process. From 20 m to 0.15 m, the Operational Robot measures the relative pose information of the non-cooperative target satellite using its own independent visual perception subsystem. The visual servoing control strategy is applied in this final stage to ensure the Operation Robot approaches the target's region of interest (ROI) properly. Once the relative pose satisfies the capture conditions, the three-finger hand points to the ROI of the target, grasps the solar panel, and manipulates and locks it down <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>6) De-orbit maneuvers. The thrusters of the Robot Platform are engaged again and the target debris is de-orbited to the graveyard orbit after being set free by outstretching the three fingers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. VISION BASED POSE MEASUREMENT</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Description</head><p>Autonomous rendezvous and docking (ARVD) is critical for planned space programs such as space attack and defense, on-orbital servicing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>[25], and other rendezvous and proximity operations. Microwave radar, laser radar, satellite navigation, and vision-based measurements are often used in GNC system of ARVD tasks. The PRISMA mission has both a passive optical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and RF (Radio Frequency) system <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>; the OLEV navigation system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> uses a set of six rendezvous cameras (long-, mid-, and close-range). For DEOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the sensor package consists of two LIDAR heads, two long-range monocular cameras, one mid-range stereo camera, one close-range stereo camera, and one docking monocular camera. From the above work, it is concluded sensing capability is a crucial component of ARVD that has been addressed by many previous researchers over recent decades.</p><p>As discussed above, when the Robot Platform arrives at point S3 about 1 km away from the target, it begins to detect, track, and measure the non-cooperative target based on its own onboard sensors. After an 800-m approaching maneuver, the Robot Platform arrives at point S4 about 200 m away from the target. The Operational Robot is then launched and flies freely towards the target while the Robot Platform measures the relative pose information between the non-cooperative target satellite and the Operational Robot. Once they are only 20 m apart, the Robot Platform becomes unable to provide their relative pose information (mainly due to the occlusion of the viewing field). The visual perception subsystem mounted on the Operational Robot instead measures the navigation information autonomously within this last 20 m, and detects the capture ROI of the target to guide the three-finger hand as it manipulates the target.</p><p>As discussed above, the DTSR was designed to be as light and economical as possible; this design methodology does indeed restrict the choice of sensors for ARVD. After comprehensive analysis, we established a visual perception system built on four charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras for the Operational Robot. CCD cameras are commonly used in modern rendezvous missions due to their relatively low cost, small size, and low energy consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Here, we will focus our discussion on the visual perception subsystem of the Operation Robot.</p><p>The shape of a given target satellite's main body is usually cubical, polyhedral, or cylindrical. When the image of the target satellite is coupled with advanced image processing and estimating algorithms, it is possible to obtain fast, effective, and accurate sensing capability to capture six-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) relative pose information (three DOF positions and three DOF attitudes) during the ultimate approaching phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Vision-based Autonomous Navigation Algorithm 1) Visual perception system overview</head><p>As mentioned above, we focus here on the visual perception subsystem mounted on the Operational Robot. A pair of 1,280 pixel × 960 pixel CCD cameras with 20° field of view (FOV) lens angles are used for long-range and mid-range (200 m~20 m) rendezvous. The two cameras are redundant devices for the sensors of the Robot Platform, because the Robot Platform is tasked with pose estimation at this range level. For close-range (20 m~0.15 m) measurements, two 704 pixel × 576 pixel CCD cameras with 40° FOV lens angles are used. The baselines of these collaborative detectors are both 0.26 m. Two LEDs are used for potential illumination compensation. The CCD sensor transforms a 3D space view into 2D features in photographed images. The visual perception algorithms are necessary to exploit the natural features extracted from the non-cooperative target.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Key technologies of vision-based pose estimation</head><p>During the approaching task, the manner in which the target is detected, recognized, and trackedas well as the relative pose between the Operational Robot and the targetare the most important functions of the visual perception algorithms. We propose a visual perception scheme containing four technologies to fulfill this purpose: Detection, Recognition, Tracking, and Pose Estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(a) Detection of target in dynamic scene</head><p>The Operational Robot and the non-cooperative target have independent motions during the approach process. These dynamic motions make the extraction and segmentation work very complicated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> recently proposed a sparse scene flow segmentation method for moving object detection. Similarly, it is possible to detect moving objects in dynamic scenarios with high accuracy according to a scene flow generated by two consecutive stereo image pairs. In the present study, the satellite target's least circumscribed rectangle was obtained accurately via the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The least circumscribed rectangle image can be extracted as the initial input of the recognition and tracking algorithms described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) Object recognition</head><p>Once the target's circumscribed rectangle has been extracted, the targets must be recognized accurately. Non-cooperative targets fall into one of three categories according to their known structure and motion specifications. The first category includes targets with unknown geometrical characteristics; the second includes targets with unknown motion models; and the third contains targets where none of these characteristics are known. In this study, we assume the target type to be roughly known (e.g., a communication satellite) and thus it is reasonable to assume partial geometrical characteristics of non-cooperative target to be known as wellthese include the expected shapes and general size of the target, among other basic characteristics. Feature-based matching algorithms such as improved speeded-up robust features (SURF) and template matching are thus appropriate for recognizing the extracted target <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Once the target recognition issue is settled, ROI localization plays an important role in refined capture manipulation. Common parts of non-cooperative space targets are usually considered as the ROI to be manipulated by the Operational Robot; for example, the bolts that can separate satellite from the rocket, the docking ring, the apogee rocket motor injector, or the span of solar panels <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Most of these parts share similar feature shapes. Here, we concentrate on the recognition of only two shapes (circle and quadrangle) that are the most common shapes in GEO satellites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c) Robust tracking</head><p>Throughout the entire approaching phase, tracking the target or ROI is also extremely important. Unfortunately, the span of solar panels and the docking ring is mostly smooth metal or is occasionally with burnished membrane for thermal control, from which feature points are difficult to extract or track. Tracking algorithms based on color histograms, such as CAMSHIFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, may not work well because the colors of the ROIs are similar to those of the satellite's main body. In effort to remedy these issues, we propose a novel feature tracking algorithm called the monocular real-time robust feature tracking algorithm (MRRFT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. To generate a robust target model, SURF is used to extract features from a marked target box.</p><p>The tracker then employs the pyramid Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (P-KLT) matching algorithm and effectively eliminates mismatched points via statistical method. The Greedy Snake algorithm is also applied to obtain exact locations and to automatically update the target box.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(d) Pose estimation.</head><p>The relative pose between the Operational Robot and the target must be estimated properly for the GNC system to function. In this study, the binocular stereo vision system and visual information of the selected ROIs are used to compute pose parameters (three relative positions and three relative orientations) which are transmitted to the GNC system.</p><p>The essential feature points of ROI can be captured in the previous steps described above. After extracting the necessary feature points, binocular vision and PnP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> algorithms are utilized to process pose reconstruction and solve the six pose parameters. To this effect, it is crucial to extract the essential features from non-cooperative target images appropriately. Below, we discuss the objection recognition and feature point extraction of the DTSR in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. ROI Recognition</head><p>As mentioned above, we focus here on two types of ROI: circular and quadrangular. They can be used for the recognition of the most common components mounted on debris targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Circle detection</head><p>Because the target is non-cooperative, the only a priori knowledge available is that the target has circular modules. We designed a fast and robust circular object detection method built on arc support region (ASR) detection accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(a) Arc support region</head><p>We use an algorithm for straight segment detection provided by previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The critical technique of the approach is to use gradient orientation as a criterion to identify straight segments. We also use a neuroperception approach to determine the gradient threshold. These treatments significantly improve the detection performance of aligned line segments. We modified the algorithm for arc segment detection for application in the DTSR.

Each region starts with one pixel. The region angle is first set to the level-line angle at that pixel (orthogonal to the gradient angle), then, pixels adjacent to the region are tested. Those with similar level-line orientation within the tolerance are added to the region. In each step, the region angle is updated to a pseudo-mean level-line orientation of the region's pixels. The process is iterated until no new points can be added.</p><p>Seed pixels with larger gradient magnitude are tested first as they are more likely to be located on the border. When a pixel is added to a region, it is marked and never visited again. From extensive real experiments, we obtained satisfactory performance in the search for different ASRs when τ=60°a nd ρ=69.3.</p><p>After the region growing process, arc support regions are obtained while some short line or curve segments are extracted in mistake.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) Estimation of circle parameters</head><p>For an ASR, its corresponding circle equations with circular parameters (a, b, r) can be calculated via three non-collinear coordinatestwo endpoints (x 1 , y 1 )，(x 2 , y 2 ) and one midpoint (x 3 , y 3 ). The three points are used to compute the circle equations as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 ( )<label>( ) , ( ) ( ) , ( ) ( ) .</label></formula><p>x a</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">y b r x a y b r x a y b r            <label>(8)</label></formula><p>It is worth mentioning that each ASR obtained through Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">8</ref>) has many inner points that can be identified without necessitating a parallel thinning process. The parameters cannot be directly utilized as idealistic parameters, so we establish a Square Fitting Area (SFA) by (a, b, r) with the center (a, b) and side length of r/2. We then fuse the SFA with a circle detection via histogram-based accumulator space <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> to ultimately obtain accurate circular parameters with low computational burden.</p><p>To be more specific, in this study, we defined square </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Q(r/2,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">    ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where Dis(i, j) is a vector with the distances between any pixel (x i , y i ) on each ASR and coordinate (x j , y j ) of the ASR's corresponding SFA. We then used a histogram to count the frequency of the distances participating in the accumulator. Each ASR found in the image was processed in the same manner. If there is a real circle in the image, it can be detected and described by several ASRs and the distances between each point on the ASR and the true center can be measured. The highest frequency of distances is the real radius, so the parameters of each circle are effectively acquired after the frequency count.  </p><p>2) Quadrangle extraction The span that connects the main body of a typical target and solar panel is usually quadrangle or triangle. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> [44], we designed a new method to recognize the span and extract its vertices as feature points.</p><p>Generally speaking, the span has obvious line features. Compared to the point features, line features can be made obvious with a small amount of information and small amount of calculations. We developed a method for doing so based on the Line Segment Detector (LSD). (a) Line extraction via LSD After applying the edge extraction algorithm, binary images containing the edge information can be obtained. In order to recognize the sides of the quadrangle, the LSD is used to extract lines in the images. This primarily includes extracting the line-support region, a rectangular approximation of the region, and validating the line segment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) Recognizing the main body's rectangular sides</head><p>Many lines are extracted by the LSD approachthe outlines of the spacecraft, the grid of the solar array, and the solar panel support, for example. We select only the lines of interest from the total. Considering the line features of solar panel bracket (the two midsections of the span are parallel lines, the distance between each parallel line is small, and the angles are identical), it is actually fairly easy to identify the line segment of interest by standard image processing treatments. We omit the details of this process here <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p></div>

To this effect, it is very important to coordinate the tether and thrusters appropriately to realize attitude or orbit control while consuming very little fuel.</p><p>We designed a specific mechanism for the DTSR to allow it to realize coordinated control of the orbit and the attitude simultaneously. The device provides control torque by adjusting the position of the mobile tether attachment point. The tether force and thruster force are controlled to achieve tracking control of the desired approaching trajectory and to stabilize the attitude of the Operational Robot. This means that the tether force is utilized not only for orbit control but also for attitude control.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Overall Visual Servoing Control Scheme</head><p>The relative position and attitude of the DTSR needs to be adjusted during the approaching phase according to those ROI positions. The measurement accuracy of the binocular vision system increases substantially when the distance of the Operational Robot and the target is short. The required information for the approaching control of the DTSR is mainly comprised of three DOF relative positions and three DOF relative attitudes of the DTSR in regards to the target. Such vision-based information is provided to the coordinated controllers as inputs.</p><p>A block diagram of the visual servoing control framework based on Section III and Section IV is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">9</ref>. We conducted detailed ground experiments to validate the feasibility of the visual servoing control framework, as discussed below. </p></div>

The coordinated controller based on sliding mode control eliminates the influence of tether tension fluctuation; the position deviations are eliminated after about 10 seconds and the tracking errors are all less than 5 cm, which satisfies the performance requirements for the task. The Operational Robot approaches the target from the t x -axis, so tether force occurs mainly along the t x -axis as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">13</ref> plots the thruster force of the Operational Robot.    The trajectory of the mobile tether attachment point is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">15</ref>. The position of the mobile tether attachment point is located at the boundary of the feasible region at the beginning of the attitude control process. Large control torque is necessary to stabilize the initial attitude tracking errors, and the position of the mobile tether attachment point changes slowly as the desired attitude varies in the final stage of the attitude control process. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">16</ref> shows the length changes of the four tethers.

The final fuel consumption of the coordinated control was 1.27, while that of the thruster control was 3.06almost 2.4 times that of the former. In effect, the simulation results indicate that the coordinated control mechanism of the DTSR reduces fuel consumption via the combination of the thrusters and Space Tether. Future studies will focus on influence factors such as measurement noise and model errors, which are outside of the scope of the present study. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>) Ground experimental setup</head><p>To further validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DTSR, we also conducted several semi-physical ground experiments to simulate the very last stage (about 4 m range) of the approaching task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">19</ref>). A Chang'e-II satellite model was used as the non-cooperative target. Its main body is a 70 × 70 × 60 (mm) cube. We designed a six-DOF motion platform comprising a two-DOF slipway, two-DOF (pitch and yaw) revolving table, and two-DOF lifting and roll platforms to simulate the space dynamic model of the Operational Robot. In the experiments, cameras (704 pixels ×528 pixels) mounted on the slipway were used to record videos. The six-DOF motions can be controlled separately or jointly</p><p>The main procedures of the ground experiment are demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">20</ref>. The relative positions and attitudes surrounding the grasp position of the ROI are obtained via the binocular vision components. The coordinated controller of the Operational Robot is responsible for the corresponding thruster on/off commands that control the motions in the approaching phase. A computer receives the control commands and calculates the dynamic model of the Operational Robot, controlling the motion platform to move according to the robot's dynamics. In this way, we effectively simulated the relative motions of the Operational Robot and the target in space with the setup we established. The results of the proposed binocular vision algorithm are similar to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, so we omit them here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Experimental results and discussions</head><p>Assuming the DTSR is moving towards the target in the orbital plane, the initial relative position between the DTSR and target was set to [-4.22, 0, 0.74] m due to the limitations of the ground platform. The corresponding initial relative linear velocity is [0.09, 0,-0.05] m/s. Because the distance between the Operational Robot and the target is very close, the attitude control is already complete by the time the final capture manipulation begins, so attitude dynamics were not involved in the ground experiments. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">21</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">22</ref> show the positions of the Operational Robot along r</p><p>x -and r z -axes in the orbital plane. The desired position for the capture manipulation is [0.20, 0, 0] m. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">21</ref>, the approaching process is smooth and the r x -axis's final position is -0.209, implying that the corresponding control error is very small (only about 0.009 m). The control error of the r z -axis is about 0.06 m, which also satisfies the position control requirement for the final capture manipulation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">23</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">24</ref> show the velocity results of the Operational Robot, where the velocities along r x and r z - axes are less than 2 cm/s at the destination point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In order to address the growing problems of GEO debris, an active space debris removal system called DTSR was designed and preliminarily tested for GEO capture and removal in this study. Compared to the other existing solutions, the DTSR has three particularly notable characteristics: dexterity, light-weight, and cost-effectiveness. This paper presented the mission sequence, system composition, and mechanical designs in detail. The two key technologies, vision-based pose estimation and coordinated controller design, were also discussed at length as they apply to the DTSR. Simulation and ground experiments altogether proved that the DTSR is a feasible and practical solution for GEO debris removal.</p><p>In the future, the DTSR will be furthered validated through real on-orbit demonstrations. We will report these results as we continue improving the design of the DTSR. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Composition of the DTSR System</figDesc><graphic coords="1,337.53,354.95,125.09,131.07" type="bitmap" /></figure>
