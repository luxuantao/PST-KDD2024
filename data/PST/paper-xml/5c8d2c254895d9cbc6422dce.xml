<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>E LECTRICAL machinery research and development is facing the problem that the field of electromechanics is considered mature and no big needs for future research are seen by the financiers. However, the field of applications is so widespread that only local optima can be found and new research and development efforts must be continuously taken. The following gives a brief overview and introduction why optimization of electrical machines is continuously required and related research is a very up-to-date topic.</p><p>The total amount of electric energy generated globally projected by year 2020 is 26000 TWh and it is about to increase towards 30000 TWh <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Great proportion of this energy will be produced by electromechanical conversion process considering the many different types of mechanical power sources available, like renewable (wind, marine, geothermal, etc.), coal, natural gas, nuclear, with several topologies for generators. After the energy was transmitted to the place where it is utilized and distributed according to the voltage requirement, significant portion is converted back to mechanical using the same principle. There are about 300,000,000 industrial electric motors installed and the amount is increasing by 15% annually.</p><p>Millions of motors are embedded in consumer products, while modern internal combustion engine car may have 60 individual electric motors for all kinds of auxiliary systems. Electric motors for industrial applications use more than 40% of the total energy produced worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>.</p><p>From power generation to final user, electrical machinery vary in terms of power from several megawatts to few milliwatts; in size, from several meters diameter to just few millimeters; according to the use particular restrictions on efficiency, reliability, controllability and availability are set. Also requirements on the energy conversion process (constant or variable speed, linear or rotational motion) increase the diversity of machine designs.</p><p>The squirrel cage induction motor and the wound rotor synchronous machine are still the main industrial machine types used. The induction motor is even called the workhorse of the industry. Lately, the authorities have launched regulations that followed new challenges to the efficiency development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. Efficiency classes, i.e. IE1 (Standard Efficiency); IE2 (High Efficiency); IE3 (Premium Efficiency); IE4 (Super Premium Efficiency), were introduced. Present-day IE3 efficiency requirements for direct-on-line (DOL) induction motors are already fairly tight, and there are IE4, IE5 yet to come. Permanent magnet synchronous machines, synchronous reluctance machines, switched reluctance machines, flux switching (permanent magnet) machines, etc. can be shown optimal for certain applications and purposes.</p><p>Selection becomes even more complicated considering that all types may be realized as inner rotor, outer rotor, axial flux versions or variants with translational movement and the constructions can feature single rotor and stator or multiple ones. Motors for DOL applications and speed-controlled powerelectronic applications should be different because of adverse effects caused by the converter. Insulation is more stressed, more losses are generated and bearing currents are more severe in PWM-supplied systems. Electric vehicles demand their own dedicated motors and especially the driving cycles of traction motors differ much from the industrial motor applications cycles such that optimal designs may be far off the industrial machine ideal counterpart.</p><p>What was written above already shows that optimizing an electrical machine is a question where no universal optimum can be found. We must remember that utilizing machines for different applications, e.g., for high-speed, sets totally different boundary conditions than a typical industrial drive at normal speed ranges. While in former times optimal designs were found by just investigating the electromagnetic part, nowadays rotor dynamics, heat transfer and fluid-flow analyses need to be included following an optimal design that is highly likely far off any "traditional optimum". This article is organized as follows. Section II gives a brief introduction in techniques for evaluating machine designs for getting started. Consequently, Section III is about techniques for optimizing machine designs. It comprises the definition of the optimization scenario by considering objectives and constraints as well as the investigated search space defined by the applied geometry definition, materials selection and associated boundaries. Section IV is about recent examples from the field of electric machine optimization. As the optimization scenarios get more and more comprehensive, the more developments and achievements in associated fields impact the machine design optimization. For instance, both improvements in the power electronics, e.g., in the field of new switching devices, as well as achievements in Mathematics and Computer Science, by allowing to efficiently consider robustness and reliability during optimization, take effect on the optimality of designs. Hence, an extensive but still not exhaustive collection of recent examples graded according to major trends is presented. To round out this survey, two particular examples are illustrated in more detail highlighting current research in the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. TECHNIQUES FOR EVALUATING MACHINE DESIGNS</head><p>Selecting a dedicated technique for modeling and evaluation is crucial for the investigation and comparison of different machine design candidates.</p><p>In the early beginning, analytical equations were applied to characterize the performance of machine configurations by relating electric, magnetic, and mechanical variables. Many modeling strategies based on analytical equations were continuously adjusted and improved based on experimental results such that the therewith predicted machine performance often is of high accuracy. On the other hand, those models usually focus on a single machine topology. Thus, the developed techniques lack universality. In addition, emphasis is laid on deriving accurate performance criteria at the price of not providing the opportunity to study local effects. Nevertheless, those techniques are still very useful, especially if there is need for a very rapid evaluation of a huge number of different machine designs, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>.</p><p>The nonlinearity of the magnetic circuit makes even the electromagnetic optimizing tasks complicated and it is often not possible to analytically calculate the torque or losses in motors with sufficient accuracy for optimization. In order to allow for investigating machine designs in more detail, finite element analyses (FEA) are adopted. Due to limits in computational power, most often two-dimensional scenarios are applied. Thanks to dramatically increased performance of computers, nowadays electric machines are often analyzed in 3D comprising the simultaneous investigation of different physical aspects at once, e.g., the combination of electromagnetic and thermal aspects as well as mechanical stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. Moreover, the analysis often comprises the entire drive to consider interactions of control, power electronics and the machine design to find the overall best configuration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. Using FEA makes it possible to obtain sufficient accuracy with some restrictions. For example, assessing iron losses accurately in FEA still builds a challenge. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. TECHNIQUES FOR OPTIMIZING MACHINE DESIGNS</head><p>The range of problems in terms of selected objectives and parameters and applied techniques for design candidate modeling, evaluation, and optimization is very widespread. Citing all different scenarios thus would go beyond the scope of this article. Instead, the authors try to give the reader an overview about integral components and most popular methods for defining and solving such kind of problems in the field of electric machine design.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> a typical structure of an optimization process is illustrated. To take respect of the diversity of the optimization problems considered in the field, an abstract overall setup is presented. The typical work flow is indicated by arrows on bold black lines and the four relevant steps are introduced as</p><p>‚Ä¢ definition of objectives and constraints,</p><p>‚Ä¢ definition of the search space,</p><p>‚Ä¢ exploration of the solution space and the ‚Ä¢ evaluation and interpretation of the results. Practicing engineers know that very often solving an optimization problem is an iterative process instead of a purely sequential procedure. Due to obtained findings, the problem might be reconfigured, e.g., by reformulating the objectives and constraints, redefining the search space for machine design candidates, or modifying the applied technique(s) for the exploration of the solution space. Most often, the reconfiguration is done by engineers themselves. However, at least some reconfiguration parts can also be automatized, as for instance a dynamic change of the design parameter discretization. Possible iterative loops are illustrated using thin dashed lines with arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>In the following, crucial methods and techniques used for solving optimization problems are itemized and explained. This comprises basic mathematical definitions and equations. Engineers often avoid studying pure mathematical explanations and definitions as they prefer gaining hands-on experience. Nevertheless, understanding the basic ideas of typically applied techniques is important for feasibly configuring the optimization process. To accomplish this balancing act, the fundamental mathematical principles are briefly described providing references where they are adopted in the field of electric machine design. This should enable the interested readers to get a good overview about this particular field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Definition of Objectives and Constraints</head><p>To efficiently run and solve an optimization problem and to obtain reliable results, it is crucial to correctly define the problem. This comprises the variables (continuous or discrete), the objectives to be maximized (or minimized) and the conditions (constraints) under which the problem has to be solved. The relationship of variables, objectives, and constraints further allows for classifying problems.</p><p>1) Single objective: For sake of completeness and as an introduction, a general definition of a single-objective problem is presented. This comprises an objective function F (x) and vectors for equality and inequality constraints, g(x) and h(x):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min x F (x) subject to g(x) ‚â§ 0 and h(x) = 0 ,</formula><p>where x is the design vector which specifies the design under optimization. In electric machine design, typical objectives are cost, efficiency, torque or power density, Back-EMF waveform, and reliability regarding mechanical stress, thermal aspects, etc. Examples can for instance be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. While in the past a single operational point was investigated, nowadays analyses evermore comprise multiple load points, e.g., for electric vehicles with particularly defined driving cycles or other applications with operating cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</p><p>All the listed quality indexes can also be considered as constraints, e.g., motor efficiency must not be less than y % or cost should not be more than z USD. Usually, some constraints are determined by the construction space, the maximum operational temperature in specific parts of the motor (e.g., permanent magnets), the minimum value of the magnetic field in the permanent magnets to avoid demagnetization, etc.</p><p>It comes as no real surprise that optimizing electric machine designs typically comprises the consideration of several performance measures. Thus, the multiple objectives approach must be adopted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Multiple objectives:</head><p>A multi-objective problem is defined as min</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x q T F(x) or min x F(x) ,</formula><p>while the same definition of constraints as for the singleobjective case can be applied. Using the definition on the left, introducing a vector of weighting factors q is required. This vector is of same size as F which comprises all objectives. The advantage of this definition is that standard optimization techniques developed for single-objective scenarios can be applied. Moreover, design candidates are characterized by a single measure allowing for an easily comparison. On the other hand, the definition of the weighting factors has a crucial impact on the results and objectives are very different, e.g., efficiency and cost. Hence, defining these factors is a difficult task as each weighting results in different optimum and it requires wide experience about the considered application field.</p><p>Instead, most of the engineers today are choosing the righthand definition presented above, i.e. a vector-based approach is applied. This requires more complex optimization algorithms, which will be presented in section III-C, and normally the runtime is increased. Typically some objectives are contradictory in electric machine design. Thus, Pareto fronts of optimal solutions are obtained. A 2D-example is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. As a common optimization problem is about maximizing efficiency while minimizing cost, the upper and more left a point is located, the better. The red crosses give the Pareto-optimal points which often are called non-dominated points. The latter designation implies that there is no solution that is better in all objectives compared to a Pareto-optimal point. From this it follows that all the Pareto points are optimal and it is up to the engineer's choice to select one of those designs by trading cost vs. efficiency. By contrast, the blue crosses in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> give dominated points, which are not Pareto-optimal.</p><p>Even though some extra effort is required when using the vector-based multi-objective optimization approach, it gives beneficial ancillary information about the relationship of different objectives. The engineer can investigate these coherences and can specify the weighting based on these findings. The additional expense is especially justified if different weightings need to be analyzed. While the first definition of the multi-objective problem necessitates a separate run per each weighting factor set, using the second definition only post-processing of the results needs to be run multiple times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Definition of the search space</head><p>Besides selecting appropriate objectives, the definition of the search space provides the basis for the results that can be obtained. When optimizing electric machine designs, the definition of the respective geometry is crucial. In the following, the two most prominent formulations are presented. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Definition of the geometry:</head><p>The geometry of machine designs must be characterized with regard to the analyses that are carried out during optimization, e.g., magnetostatic, thermal, mechanical, etc., and the level of detail which is required for the investigations. Basic definitions usually encompass the dimensions and shape of stator and rotor components (or equivalent components for actuators) comprising the material distribution of (laminated) ferromagnetic components, material for the conductors and for the permanent magnets. a) Parametrized geometry: An example for a parametrized geometry is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, where a rotor with embedded magnets is presented. The topology of the geometry is predefined, but changing the parameters, e.g., the rotor outer or inner diameter, takes effect on the shape of the rotor design. The parameters can comprise both continuous variables like dimensions as well as discrete parameters, such as number of pole pairs or the number of slots for the rotor of an induction machine.</p><p>Even though design parameters for such geometries can be arbitrarily defined, the definition of the geometry has a significant impact on its applicability and also on the runtime of optimization problems. For instance, the rotor inner and outer diameter can be independently defined by using parameters d ri and d re , respectively. It is obvious that d ri &lt; d re must hold. However, a breach of this inequality constraint is possible if both parameters are varied in a wide range requiring overlapping parameter ranges. One possibility to overcome this problem is to use an alternative definition for d ri , for example d ri = Œ±√ód re . Hence, d ri is scaled by Œ± with regard to the rotor outer diameter. Thus, an alternative parameter (Œ±) is varied during optimization.</p><p>A parametrized geometry offers possibilities for finding the best machine design configuration for an optimization problem. However, by selecting a particular geometry like the rotor in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, the engineer restricts the potential solution space to, e.g., rotors with buried magnets. Thus, even if a rotor with surface-mounted magnets would feature superior performance, using the geometry of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> will not allow to derive machine designs of this rotor type.</p><p>While this conclusion seems obvious, very often more sophisticated limitations with less priorly available knowledge have to be considered. For instance, minimizing torque rip-ple of synchronous reluctance machines typically works best with a particular number of barriers and respective shapes (rectangular or round) depending on the number of stator slots, the stator winding configuration and the number of rotor poles. By contrast, maximizing the mean torque and thus the output power often requires a different number of barriers and barrier shape. If the engineer fixes those two barrierrelated parameters in advance, the obtained solution space might not comprise the best possible solutions with regard to both performance parameters torque ripple and mean torque.</p><p>Hence, parametrized geometries are applied if the geometry is fixed to particular shapes anyway or if expert knowledge for the considered scenario is already available. Otherwise, non-parametric geometries are utilized with increasing frequency which will be explained in the following. b) Non-parametric geometry: If no expert knowledge about the ideal machine design structure for particular optimization scenarios is available, non-parametric geometries can be a good choice to find an optimal machine design. Moreover, such geometry representations are also used if new topologies should be discovered. Even though those geometry definitions are designated as non-parametric, they feature parameters for defining the structure of the assembly. However, just a few classical parameters, e.g., dimensions, are used, while the other parameters have rather less physical meaning. In the following, the most prominent methods used for optimizing electric machine designs are presented which typically are summarized by the umbrella term topology optimization (TO).</p><p>One prominent example for an optimization comprising a non-parametric geometry definition is binary optimization (BO). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> gives the basic idea of BO illustrated for the definition of the rotor of a synchronous reluctance machine.  The rotor surface bounded by some rotor inner and outer diameter is discretized into a particular number of elements.</p><p>The surface can feature equal discretization in size or number of elements in both radial and circumferential direction or could also be defined by a non-uniform discretization. A certain number of material properties is defined and usually to any element one of those material properties can then be assigned to. Even though defining more than two distinct properties follows more than two possible states for an element, the term binary optimization is also frequently used in that case. For the synchronous reluctance machine presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, the two material properties laminated steel and air were selected. A particular aspect that has to be considered are detached particles of a material which is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>. Techniques for deriving feasible designs both online or as post-processing action after the optimization were developed in the past. While the first one is comparably more difficult to join with the optimization technique, the latter one can follow that the optimization algorithm focuses on non-feasible design regions while the optimal feasible designs cannot be obtained.</p><p>Another crucial aspect to keep in mind is the huge number of possible designs when dealing with useful discretization levels. The overall number of potential design candidates n d for number of materials and elements n mat and n el , respectively, can be computed using</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">n d = n nel mat .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>For the two-materials example, an exemplary computation for different discretization levels is provided by Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>. As can be noticed, a discretization of 15 √ó 15 follows 5.4 √ó 10 67 possible design combinations. Even though today's optimization algorithms allow for significantly reducing the number of required design candidate evaluations compared to the overall number of possible designs, one has to be aware of these numbers and consider them with regard to the run time, the number of evaluated designs, etc. In addition, any way of reducing the number of degrees of freedom is beneficial, e.g., by defining a symmetric rotor structure or by just discretizing the rotor surface close to the air gap very fine and using a coarse grid for the remaining rotor surface.</p><p>Examples for binary optimization applied for deriving optimal electric machine designs can for instance be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. Some authors consider the reduction of number of degrees of freedoms by keeping the definition of the rotor structure quite flexible. For instance, they use a fine discretization, but the material assignment of the elements is not totally independent, but based on parametrized spatial distribution  functions, e.g., Gaussian <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. As by applying such optimization scenarios very often rotor structures with thin ribs are derived, a computation of the mechanical stress in the rotor is favorable. Moreover, as the mass-production of electric machines follows a degradation of the material properties along the cutting edges, it is beneficial to also cover those effects, as the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> did. Besides binary optimization, where the analyses of different rotor structures are independently computed, further non-parametric approaches for the optimization of geometries exist. Common examples are gradient-based techniques. At first, a typically nonlinear evaluation of a machine design is performed. Using the obtained element-wise results, it requires low computational effort to derive the sensitivities of the outputs of the FE-analyses with regard to a change of the permeability of any element. Thus, one can derive which finite element featuring properties of laminated steel should be changed to air or vice versa.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the change of one element would require another nonlinear computationally expensive analysis and, consequently, deriving the sensitivities again. However, very often a particular number of elements is changed at once to save computation time. This is justified by the assumption that changing a comparably low number of elements does not take much effect on the overall sensitivities. The number of elements per step is a crucial parameter for this iterative optimization technique. Typically, two different materials are considered. While some researchers apply techniques that just allow for changing from laminated steel properties to air or the other way round, other techniques allow for continuously changing in both directions.</p><p>A significant advantage of this technique is the low computational effort compared to binary optimization, as deriving the sensitivity information comes at low computational cost. The drawback, as with any gradient-based technique, is that it is prone to get stuck in local minima. Hence, the analysis of multiple attempts with different or even adaptive numbers of elements to be changed per iteration step, different starting points, etc. is required in order to increase confidence for particular solutions. An example can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Another technique is to define a finite element mesh and consider the respective nodes to be moved within the design domain. Hence, almost free shapes can be obtained following optimal contours of components. Recently, Li et al. presented this technique applied to electromechanical devices, e.g., for switched reluctance motors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>.</p><p>2) Definition of the materials: A typical machine design comprises soft magnetic components as core material, copper or aluminum for the conductors and, depending on the machine type, possibly permanent magnets are employed. Nowadays, the optimization of electric machine designs usually comprises the minimization of material cost. While in the past particular material types were selected and the overall volume was subject to minimize, nowadays often multiple winding materials, permanent magnet materials and/or laminated steels are simultaneously investigated and solving the optimization problem also requires selecting the best material <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Besides optimizing machine designs itself, the characteristics of materials are particularly optimized for electric machine application. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>, optimization of permanent magnet materials was reported, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> gives status and trends of soft magnetic materials in electric machines comprising soft magnetic composites and cobalt iron. We also have novel heat tolerant Samarium-Cobalt permanent magnet materials (e.g., RECOMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>) that can operate at high temperatures around 300 ‚Ä¢ C and maintain high remanence. Besides better magnetic circuit materials, conductive materials much better than copper seem to be within reach for the future development step of electric machinery <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. For instance, carbon nanotube materials at the moment feature the specific conductivity at the same level as aluminum. The big future promise in carbonnanotube-based conductors is based on the fact that individual best nanotubes demonstrate conductivity levels higher than 100 MS/m corresponding to resistivity levels of 1√ó10 -8 ‚Ñ¶m. These kind of conductors enable no practical space for eddy currents. As a consequence, a new machine design paradigm is needed when they will be available <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Cooling of the machine is always a central aspect that affects machine performance and material selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. There is no globally optimal cooling means for a machine. For instance, the totally-enclosed fan-cooled squirrel-cage induction motor does not offer the highest possible efficiency, it is heavy and its power factor is low at least for multiple-pole machines. But the machine is cheap and satisfies many of the boundary conditions set by manufacturers and customers. Hence, present solutions in practice typically constitute optimal designs with regard to particularly set cooling options.</p><p>The definition of the materials involves a computationallyefficient and highly-accurate formulation and evaluation of their properties, including the impact of manufacturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> and the evaluation of associated losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Techniques for efficiently exploring the search space / obtaining the solution space</head><p>Due to limitations in computational power, the number of evaluated candidates for a typical machine design process was rather limited in former times. Hence, usually a grid search of a few most relevant parameters was applied for finding the best machine design. The amount of data was easily manageable and engineers normally did not care about topics like efficient exploration of the design space.</p><p>Nowadays, this topic is highly relevant in machine design. Due to (economic) competition, engineers try to find optimal solutions for particular applications and try to consider multiple design parameters, physical domains, and objectives and constraints. Thus, optimization problems are very complex and techniques for exploring the parameter space efficiently are developed by considering the minimization of time-consuming evaluations. In the following, some major aspects are described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Design of Experiments:</head><p>Design of experiments (DOE, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>) is a field of research that is about retrieving as much information as possible from a minimum number of experiments. Originally, the development of these techniques was inspired from experimental practices. The maximum number of experiments is always bounded to obtain results at reasonable effort and within acceptable time. Even though the simulation of a device is much faster and cheaper than manufacturing and measuring a prototype, limitations regarding computational power and analysis time still apply. Thus, DOE techniques are also utilized in electric machine design for simultaneously varying multiple design parameters and retrieving the impact of each parameter on the objective functions. If a suitable technique is applied, it allows for significantly reducing the number of required design evaluations compared to a full grid analysis while providing comparable informative content. Thus, the overall effort and runtime for solving optimization problems can be minimized. Famous DOE techniques are Latin-Hypercube-Sampling, Fractional or Full Factorial tests, Central Composite Design or the Box-Behnken sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> gives an example for the Box-Behnken approach. A grid of three design parameters with three levels each is considered, thus analyzing all possible combinations would require 3 3 = 27 evaluations. By contrast, with the Box-Behnken approach less calculations are required, i.e. the combinations defined by red crosses in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Any other result is then calculated based on the obtained results and, e.g., a consequently created surrogate model. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> gives an example of Latin-Hypercube-Sampling. The design parameter ranges of x 1 and x 2 are discretized and every parameter section is used once (or multiple times, but usually same frequency is applied). The crosses in the figure denote the (randomly) defined combinations of the sections. Very often, design of experiments is used as initial stage during the optimization process in order to derive useful information about the problem and to obtain a practicable initial situation for applying an optimization technique.</p><p>2) Deterministic optimization: This concept refers to techniques with no random component, i.e., running the same optimization problem with exactly the same settings multiple times always leads to the same results. Prominent examples are the aforementioned Grid search and Derivative-based optimization like Newton's method. If properly configured, such methods can converge very fast to local extrema. A crucial drawback of these techniques is that they are usually not feasible for problems with multimodal characteristics, as they get stuck in local extrema. Today's problems typically have very complex functional relationships and they are unknown beforehand.</p><p>3) Stochastic optimization: This section encompasses techniques with some random aspects. This should allow to evolve and release the optimization technique to not hang on to local extrema. Another aspect is to scan the promising regions in the design space finer than areas with less good prospects. Many different techniques were developed and applied in the past. Thereby, evolutionary population-based algorithms that are typically inspired by mechanisms in nature gained most attraction. Examples are Genetic Algorithms (GAs) like the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref> and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. Further important procedures are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref> and Differential Evolution (DE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>.</p><p>Also hybrid algorithms comprising multiple stochastic optimization techniques, multiple deterministic techniques, or combinations of both were introduced in the past. Thus, the attempt is to gain an additional performance increase by a perfect combination and matching of different techniques. However, in machine learning and optimization, it can be concluded from the well known no-free-lunch-theorem that for certain types of problems the averaged computational cost for finding a solution over all problems of that type is the same for any optimization technique. Thus, if particularly adapted techniques perform best on certain problems, they probably will do worse on other problems in the field. Hence, selecting a suitable algorithm with regard to the requirements based on the optimization problem is one of the most crucial aspects in solving optimization tasks. Examples of evolutionary algorithms applied to electric machine design can, e.g., be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Reduction of computational effort and runtime:</head><p>In the previous subsections of III-C the focus was on efficiently scanning the design space by minimizing the number of required evaluations of design candidates. By contrast, this section is about how to minimize the evaluation time for any single design candidate. As usually the candidates are evaluated by means of finite element (FE-) simulations, obtaining the performance of a considered design requires significant computational effort. Hence, most relevant techniques related to (a) the field of electric machine design, (b) Mathematics and / or (c) the field of Computer Science are presented in the following: a) Symmetries and Discretization: Very often, symmetries in the machine design are not applied when using finite element analyses. As this might carry no weight for a single run, usually solving an optimization problem comprises the evaluation of thousands of different designs. Those problems take hours to weeks to be solved with FEA to be the most considerable part and bottleneck of the analysis. Hence, any information about symmetries of the assembly or in the machine characteristics (i.e. periodic behavior) with regard to the rotor angle / translational degree of freedom should be utilized. This was also pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, engineers should always consider the tradeoff accuracy vs. runtime of the optimization problem when specifying a project. E.g., if only the mean value of the load torque, or particular low-order harmonics are relevant, or if it is sufficient to have a coarse approximation of iron losses, there is no need for a fine discretization of the rotor movement.</p><p>Even though those measures can be designated as wellknown facts, they are very often disregarded. Consequently, this increases the runtime many times over. b) Surrogate models: If the analysis of design candidates takes considerable time, interpolation techniques are often considered. Nowadays surrogate models are applied more and more frequently. They represent a (simplified) model of the original problem. Based on initial results, e.g., obtained by DOE, a model is found that maps the input-output functional relationship of (parts of) the optimization problem. Reconsidering step 3 of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, surrogate modeling can be utilized to replace parts or the entire evaluation process of that step. For instance, it can be applied to directly map the impact of the design parameters on the objectives and constraints. Relevant examples of this approach applied to electric machine design can for instance be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, surrogate models are frequently applied to replace parts of the individual analysis of machine designs. For instance, the nonlinear machine characteristics can be defined using a surrogate model. This approach typically is considered if the design candidates are investigated using FEsimulations. Based on initial results obtained using FEA, a model is developed that reproduces the attributes of the design. Any further evaluation can be conducted by using that model. Hence, the number of required finite element computations can be significantly minimized. Interesting implementations are, e.g., presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> gives an example for interpolating the load torque characteristics as function of the dand q-axis current based on just 12 sample points.</p><p>From a mathematical point of view, prominent techniques applied for surrogate modeling or interpolation are the response surface methodology (RSM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>, artificial neural networks (ANNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref>, Kriging <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>, support vector machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref> and radial basis functions (RBFs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref>. A comprehensive fitness approximation survey can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c) Computer cluster and parallel computing:</head><p>In order to speed up the optimization run, parallel computing is a viable technique. Parallel computing can be used for solving particular tasks, as for instance a finite element simulation, by distributing a single problem to multiple cores / computers. More often, the analysis of multiple designs or of multiple current vectors of a design is analyzed using parallel computing. This follows that independent tasks are run on the processors while the host computer defines the designs to be analyzed and the tasks to be solved. Moreover, the optimization algorithm is run at the host. A dedicated software is required to distribute the tasks to a cluster. A prominent example is HTCondor <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RECENT EXAMPLES FROM LITERATURE</head><p>Various optimization scenarios were investigated in the past. Thus, the following list is not intended to be exhaustive. Instead, it should serve as starting point for interested researchers and practitioners to delve into electric machine optimization and its multifaceted aspects. Some typical optimization scenarios where evolutionary algorithms are applied can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref>. A collection of speed improvements comprising an exemplary optimization problem is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. A trend is to investigate machine designs from a multiphysics point of view, e.g., by adding mechanical or thermal aspects or aspects related to the power electronics or control to the optimization of electric machine designs. Thus, more system-level based optimization scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[80]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref> are considered which requires enhanced computational frameworks. A major trend, e.g., for traction applications, is further to combine magnetic gears with electric machine designs, for instance investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[82]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[84]</ref>.</p><p>Due to improvements in power electronics, SiC and GaN MosFETs came into the picture. They have the capability to replace low-voltage IGBTs in some fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[85]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. New machine design optimization is required to profit at best.</p><p>When dealing with electric machine design optimization, the obtained arrangements are typically highly-utilized. This is a consequence of objectives like power or torque density, cost, etc. As tolerances in dimensions or material characteristics are unavoidable, the performance of the design should be insensitive to such variations. Lately, more and more investigations optimal robust x y Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>: 1D-explanation of optimality vs. robustness. The red square denotes the overall optimum if the target is to minimize y. However, a more robust solution is given by the green square. This is indicated by a normal distribution around the two respective x-values and their corresponding target distributions along the y-axis.</p><p>were carried out with regard to the robustness of designs in context of optimization. Typical keywords are sensitivity, robustness, reliability, tolerance analysis, etc. Hence, during optimization the tradeoff rated performance vs. sensitiveness must be considered. By way of explanation, a 1D-example is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Some recent examples from literature can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[95]</ref>.</p><p>In the following, two representative optimization problems that recently have been published are briefly introduced. While in subsection IV-A the focus is on multi-physics optimization of an induction machine with severe boundaries, e.g., regarding the ambient conditions, in subsection IV-B scenarios are presented where the cost versus efficiency tradeoff is analyzed. For the latter, DOE techniques, evolutionary algorithms, surrogate modeling, and a computer cluster were applied. Moreover, symmetries of the machine designs were automatically detected and utilized and the discretization in the finite element software was automatically adapted. While these two examples cover all relevant topics discussed throughout this article, the comprehensive collection of references allows for delving into the wide field of electric machine optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Solid-rotor induction machine for natural gas compression</head><p>Recently, an optimization process for a multiple-step natural gas compressor motor with 8MW power at 12000 min -1 was presented. The optimization process comprised</p><p>‚Ä¢ the selection of a rugged enough machine topology for a rough environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref> ‚Ä¢ the design of an active magnetic bearing system ‚Ä¢ the investigation of rotor (and stator) dynamics, e.g., (AMB) eigenfrequencies</p><p>‚Ä¢ the investigation of cooling of the machine by the compressed gas itself and</p><p>‚Ä¢ the analysis and selection of suitable materials for high pressure gas and high temperature humidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[97]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[98]</ref>. As a consequence, such a scenario requires a multi-physics approach where electrical engineers have to understand the boundary conditions set by the machine driven. It is important that the "optimized" electrical machine itself represents a suitable compromise satisfying the conditions of the scenario. The flow chart of the optimization process is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, while the first prototype integrated with the compressor is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>. The assembly should withstand very high   pressure of 130 bar. Hence, the frame was designed as a strong pressure vessel where frame thickness was set to 100 mm at 750 mm stator stack outer diameter. This further ensured that the AMB control is not adversely affected by the frame eigenfrequencies, as they are at very high levels.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">‚úÆ ‚úØ ‚ú∞ ‚ú± ‚ú≤ ‚ú≥ ‚ú¥ ‚úØ ‚ú≥ ‚úµ ‚ú∂ ‚ú¥ ‚ú∂ ‚úµ ‚ú∑ ‚ú≥ ‚ú∏ ‚úπ ‚ú≤ ‚ú± ‚ú∂ ‚úµ ‚ú¥ ‚úØ ‚ú≥ ‚úµ ‚ú∂ ‚ú¥ ‚ú∂ ‚úµ ‚ú∫ ‚ú∞ ‚ú¥ ‚ú≥ ‚úµ ‚úπ</formula><p>The investigation of the rotor dynamics was a crucial part of the analysis. The final design features 6.6kV having prefabricated windings and open stator slots. Semimagnetic wedges offer a solution to mitigate permeance harmonics' effects on the solid rotor surface and, thus, minimizing the rotor surface losses. As the magnetizing inductance is inversely proportional to the square of the number of pole pairs p, p was set to 1 to get an acceptable power factor. The final design has an electrical efficiency of 96.5%, while the power factor and the rated slip are 0.7 and 0.7%, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Optimization and Comparison of Different Machine Topologies</head><p>In recent time, optimization scenarios comprising a comparison of different machine topologies were presented. As mentioned in the introduction, efficiency-driven machine design optimization gets more and more important. On the other hand, the price of the designs is crucial to stay competitive on the market and thus the best tradeoff is sought by researchers and practitioners. Investigating different scenarios in terms of requirements, i.e., boundaries and objectives, e.g., efficiency, cost, construction space, ambient conditions, operating mode,   power supply, materials, it soon becomes apparent that it is impossible to derive a universal solution. Instead, the optimal machine designs obtained are as diverse as the optimization tasks considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficiency in percent</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> gives an example for a comparison of induction machines (IMs) with permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). The two objectives considered are efficiency and material cost and Pareto-optimal solutions are shown in the figure . As recently the raw materials for permanent magnets were subject to significant price fluctuations, two different cost scenarios were investigated regarding their respective costs.</p><p>By contrast, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref> gives a comparison of PMSMs and synchronous reluctance machines (SyncRMs) with regard to magnet position (surface mounted or buried), magnet type (ferrite or Neodymium-Iron-Boron) as well as material selected for the conductors (copper or aluminum). Again, objectives material cost and efficiency were considered, while some constraints, e.g., on maximum permissible torque ripple, were set. Both studies were conducted for rated power of 3kW and rated speed of 1500rpm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[99]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK</head><p>This article is about the state-of-the-art and emerging trends in the field of electric machine design optimization. Thanks to advances in Mathematics and Computer Science, nowadays electric machine optimization scenarios can be investigated at very high level of detail. Besides traditional electromagnetic analyses, the currently considered problems evermore comprise rotor dynamics, thermal aspects, impact of power electronics and control strategy, etc. Dozens of variables are used to define a design under investigation.</p><p>Apart from optimizing geometrical aspects, material science finds way in the scenarios and optimized material distributions or material characteristics are object of research. Manufacturing aspects are incorporated by either improving the applied models via additional layers for the zone of manufacturing influence, or, globally, by conducting a tolerance analysis or investigating the design performance with regard to reliability.</p><p>Most scenarios deal with multiple objectives and constraints. Besides classical machine performance ratings like efficiency, torque ripple, power factor, power or torque density, installation space, and cost, further objectives like radiated noise, robustness, etc. are investigated.</p><p>Hence, both scenarios and respective solutions are multifaceted and rich in variety. As a consequence, optimal designs must be found case by case and no universal machine design exists that can be considered as global optimum. As electric machine design optimization encompasses multiple topics of Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science, innovations from various fields influence this field of research. One can await with bated breath new developments to optimize in greater detail, faster, and for obtaining better and better results. However, even though significant advances in multiple fields allow for optimizing more and more in detail, engineers should always find the right balance regarding computational effort made and modeling accuracy.</p><p>Even in the long-term view, solving electric machine design optimization scenarios at the touch of a button is not within sight. Thus, it requires experts from electrical engineering to properly address electric machine design optimization problems, to develop and evaluate techniques for solving the scenarios, and to check reasonableness of the obtained results.</p><p>Last, but not the least, the interest of the power and industrial electronics researcher community on topics related on the optimization of electromagnetic electrical machines is fully demonstrated by the recently publication of the Special Section on Optimization of Electric Machine Designs in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[100]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[101]</ref>. This successful editorial project includes 46 papers related practically to all the types of electrical machines -namely, the synchronous reluctance machine, interior permanent magnet machine, permanent magnet synchronous machine, induction machine, switched reluctance machine, flux switching machine, magnetic-geared motor, magnetic gear, and total enclosed fan cooled electrical machine. Also, various optimization algorithms have been deeply discussed. From this point of view, it is worth to cite the following methods: genetic algorithm, differential evolution, response surface methodology, grid search, particle swarm optimization, multi-dimensional secant method, sequential quadratic programming, global search, tabu search, evolutionary algorithm, heuristic algorithm, Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, sequential-stage optimization strategy, gradient-based strategy, social network optimization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: Pareto front for an optimization problem with two objectives relative cost and efficiency.</figDesc></figure>
