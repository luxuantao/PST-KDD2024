<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a new method for the evolution of inextensible vesicles immersed in a Stokesian fluid. We use a boundary integral formulation for the fluid that results in a set of nonlinear integro-differential equations for the vesicle dynamics. The motion of the vesicles is determined by balancing the non-local hydrodynamic forces with the elastic forces due to bending and tension. Numerical simulations of such vesicle motions are quite challenging. On one hand, explicit time-stepping schemes suffer from a severe stability constraint due to the stiffness related to high-order spatial derivatives and a milder constraint due to a transport-like stability condition. On the other hand, an implicit scheme can be expensive because it requires the solution of a set of nonlinear equations at each time step. We present two semi-implicit schemes that circumvent the severe stability constraints on the time step and whose computational cost per time step is comparable to that of an explicit scheme. We discretize the equations by using a spectral method in space, and a multistep third-order accurate scheme in time. We use the fast multipole method (FMM) to efficiently compute vesicle-vesicle interaction forces in a suspension with a large number of vesicles. We report results from numerical experiments that demonstrate the convergence and algorithmic complexity properties of our scheme.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Vesicle flows model numerous biophysical phenomena that involve deforming particles interacting with a Stokesian fluid. The evolution dynamics are characterized by a competition between membrane elastic energy, inextensibility, and non-local hydrodynamic forces. Inextensible vesicles have received a lot of attention in the physics community as they are considered good models of biological cells. In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient numerical schemes for such flows. In the case where the fluids both inside and outside of the vesicle are the same, the equations that govern the motion of a single vesicle are In this figure, we demonstrate the capabilities of our method, in particular the running times per time step and the ability to resolve complex interactions between multiple vesicles. We simulated the motion of 256 vesicles driven by an external flow that has a parabolic profile. In this simulation, we used 64 discretization points per vesicle and we took a total of 1000 time steps. The wall-clock time per time step was 40 s (on average) on a Xeon workstation. The computations were performed using MATLAB, accelerated by external FFT, FMM, and LAPACK libraries. In the left column, we show four snapshots of the overall simulation and in the right column, we zoom in the region marked by the broken-line square to show the details on the shapes of individual vesicles. Here, t is a nondimensional time t 2 ð0; 1Þ. The initial state is a rectangular array of vesicles in a non-equilibrium shape configuration (top row). Due to bending, the vesicle shapes are quickly smoothed. Then, the vesicles are dispersed by the shear of the background flow. We resolve high curvature regions (e.g., fourth row, second column), conserve vesicle areas and lengths, and compute the hydrodynamic interactions with sufficient accuracy to avoid collisions without employing a collision detection algorithm. Details on the accuracy and complexity of our method are presented in later Sections.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">@x @t ¼ v 1 þ S½f b þ f r ðvesicle position evolutionÞ x s Á ðS½f r Þ s ¼ Àx s Á ðv 1 þ S½f b Þ s ðinextensibilityÞ;</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithmic complexity.</head><p>Computing the single-layer potential at M target locations fx k g M k¼1 from given source locations (quadrature nodes) fy j g M j¼1 is OðM 2 Þ. This would severely limit the scope of computation, when one wants to simulate large number of vesicles and/or for large number of time steps. Synopsis of our method. Inspired by the work of Hou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Kropinski <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and Tornberg and Shelley <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> on fast, highaccuracy solvers for problems with moving interfaces, we propose two computational schemes for simulating the motion of inextensible vesicles in two-dimensions. Our schemes address all of the issues outlined above but the accuracy in time. Both schemes are based on Lagrangian tracking of marker particles placed on the membrane of the vesicle and a semi-implicit time discretization, which, experimentally, appears to have no time-stepping stability constraints. High-order accuracy in space is ensured by using a Fourier basis discretization for all functions and computing derivatives in Fourier domain, and special high-order Gauss-trapezoidal quadrature rules, introduced by Alpert <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, designed to resolve the logarithmic singularities that appear in single-layer potentials. For the position update in time, we use two variants of a semi-implicit marching scheme first derived for advection-diffusion equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and then applied on integral equation based fluid-structure interaction problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> (for rod dynamics modeled by slender-body theory integral formulations -a different formulation from the one we use for vesicles); for certain flow regimes both schemes attain high-order accuracy. The timemarching schemes require the solution a linear system of equations for each time step, which is solved using a Krylov iterative method (GMRES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The problem of poor conditioning is addressed by a preconditioner based on the analytically obtained spectrum of the operators in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> for the special case (unit circle). The complexity of matrix-vector multiplication for the dense system is reduced to linear in the number of variables using FMM. As a result, we are able to achieve high-accuracy while using a small number of unknowns per vesicle for the spatial discretization, while taking large time steps with relatively low computational cost per each time step. These improvements enable the simulation a large number of interacting vesicles, as described in Section 5 and depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Contributions. We would like to emphasize that the use of boundary spectral representations, semi-implicit schemes, and fast summation schemes in the context of interface problems is not novel. However, we are not aware of any previous analysis and application of implicit time-stepping schemes combined with fast solvers to vesicles suspended in Stokesian fluids. Two features distinguishing vesicles from droplets and bubbles are the bending forces related to curvature and the surface inextensibility constraint.</p><p>The contributions of this paper are: (1) the spectral analysis of the different operators related to vesicle dynamics for the unit circle and their use to derive preconditioning techniques; (2) the extension of the techniques developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> to vesicle flows; (3) the numerical investigation of the stability and accuracy of the time-stepping schemes; and (4) a preliminary validation of our methodology by comparing our results to results in the literature.</p><p>Limitations. We restrict our attention to dilute suspension of vesicles in fluids with unbounded domains. The model of vesicle flows we consider here does not include forces due to gravity, electrostatics or adhesion, or inertial effects due to the mass of the fluid or the membrane. Also, we do not consider topological changes, which are often present in many biophysical phenomena involving vesicles.</p><p>Maintaining high-accuracy for vesicles closely approaching each other requires incorporation of specialized quadrature rules for nearly-singular integrals, as well as appropriate models for short-range interaction forces and efficient collision detection schemes. We do not consider such cases here, which is an important limitation. For an example of related work on this topic see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In our examples, we assume that the interior and exterior of the vesicles are filled with the same liquid. The algorithm extends to the more general case, which requires evaluation of double layer potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Our numerical experiments indicate a time step stability that is proportional to the shear rate, but it is independent of the spatial discretization size; experimentally, we have observed that the overall accuracy of our method is dictated by the accuracy of the time stepping scheme and is up to third-order for non-vanishing shear rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Related work</head><p>Vesicles (also known as fluid membranes) attracted the attention of scientists and engineers as they are present in many biological phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and can be used experimentally to understand properties of biological membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In addition, vesicle mechanics have been used as models for red blood cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> and drug-carrying capsules <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Vesicle simulations have been based both on molecular dynamics models <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and on continuum mechanics models of the fluid and the vesicle membrane. Here, we focus on numerical schemes for continuum models of vesicle dynamics. We start by briefly reviewing the more general topic of Stokesian particulate flows. Numerical methods for Stokesian flows can be classified to unstructured finite element methods, Cartesian-grid based methods, and integral equation methods. We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for a review of these methods for boundary value problems. Integral equation methods have been used extensively for the simulation of Stokesian particulate flows. Integral equations were introduced in Youngren and Acrivos <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for a flow past a rigid particle of arbitrary shape. The same authors used integral equations to study the shape of a bubble in an extensional flow. Our work is based on a formulation derived by Rallison and Acrivos <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> for two fluids separated by an interface with surface forces. For a detailed presentation of the theory of integral equations for Stokes flows see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>Typical spatial discretizations of integral equation formulations are based on Galerkin or collocation projection schemes using polynomial bases -also referred as boundary element methods (BEM). Such methods have been used extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> to study the dynamics of a single vesicle (with compressible interfaces) suspended in Stokes flow. Most existing numerical methods use relatively low-order representation of the interface boundary, at most second order (circular arcs) or third order (cubic splines) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, together with consistent quadrature rules. Spectral representations for twodimensional interfacial flows with stiffness appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. In the context of Stokesian flows, the closest work to ours is that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> for extensible interfaces without bending energy. Another spectral approach has been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> in which the tension is calculated to enforce inextensibility but the position of the vesicle is updated explicitly. Also, a low-accuracy representation is used for the boundary, so the overall accuracy is of low-order. One advantage to our approach is its highorder of spatial accuracy and its ability to treat very large numbers of vesicles with a smaller number of marker points per vesicle.</p><p>One of the greatest challenges in numerical schemes for vesicle dynamics is the numerical stiffness. The overwhelming majority of work on particulate flows uses explicit schemes that pose severe restrictions on the time step. A powerful method in treating stiffness is related to the so-called ''small-scale decomposition" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> in which appropriate linearizations reveal the higher derivative terms that are responsible for the numerical stiffness; these terms are treated implicitly whereas the remaining terms are treated explicitly. In our work, we use a related but different idea, in which we analytically construct a partial-linearization Jacobian in the spectral domain for the case of a circle and then, we use it as a preconditioner in the two semi-implicit schemes we propose in which we treat only the higher order terms implicitly. Another approach that allows stable time-stepping is to use Newton's method with exact Jacobians <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> but such an approach will have quite large computational costs per time step. To our knowledge, no work on implicit schemes exists for incompressible vesicles.</p><p>The literature on numerical methods for incompressible vesicles appears to be somewhat limited; only three papers discussing numerical schemes for such problems: Kraus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Zhou and Pozrikidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and Sukumaran and Seifert <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. All these works use the forward Euler discretization method in time, which is computationally inefficient because (1) is stiff. In problems with vesicles, the elastic and incompressibility properties of the membranes must be taken into account and the numerical schemes must be modified in order to solve the resulting set of boundary integral equations. Details of the BEM for elastic interfaces and incompressible vesicles can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. In the present study, we will use the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> for the bending energy and for the surface tension.</p><p>Other related work includes methods to compute the vesicle shape that corresponds to an elastic equilibrium (minimum L 2 -norm of curvature) under area and length (volume and area in 3D) constraints without hydrodynamic interactions (this methods consider a single vesicle). Examples include a phase field method, proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, that can handle topological changes and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> that uses a shell finite element based algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Contents</head><p>In Section 2, we present a summary of the derivation of the integro-differential equations (1) that govern vesicle dynamics. A qualitative understanding of stiffness can be obtained from the knowledge of the spectrum of the Jacobian of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Parts of the Jacobian can be analytically computed using the Fourier transform on the unit circle. We discuss the behavior of the spectrum in Section 2.1. The source of the high-order stiffness will be evident from this analysis.</p><p>In Section 3, we present two numerical schemes that overcome the high-order stiffness, are spectrally accurate in space and, for certain flow regimes, attain high-order accuracy in time; we extend these schemes to deal with multiple vesicles. Both schemes lead to systems of linear equations that need to be solved at each time step. The spectral analysis of the problem on the unit circle is used to construct preconditioners for the iterative linear solvers required in the time-stepping schemes.</p><p>In Section 5, we present numerical results for a number of problems involving single and multiple vesicles suspended in a viscous fluid. We conduct numerical experiments to investigate the stability and convergence order of different time-stepping schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Problem formulation</head><p>Consider a single vesicle suspended in a 2D viscous fluid domain X and whose membrane is denoted by c. Assume that the interior of the vesicle is filled with the same fluid. The fluid flow is modeled by the Stokes equations,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">rp À lMv ¼ f; div v ¼ 0 in X n c;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where pðxÞ and v(x) are the pressure and velocity fields, and l is the viscosity of the fluid. The no-slip boundary condition at the vesicle boundaries and the free-space boundary condition require that vðxÞ ¼ _</p><p>x on c and lim x!1 vðxÞ À v 1 ðxÞ ¼ 0; ð3Þ where _</p><p>x is the velocity of a point on c and v 1 is the far-field fluid velocity.</p><p>The elastic energy of the membrane is given by eðj; rÞ ¼ R cðsÞ 1 2 j B j 2 þ rds where j is its curvature, r is the tension, and j B is the bending modulus. The forces due to bending, f b , and tension, f r , are obtained by taking the L 2 -gradient of e with respect to xðsÞ (Appendix A). The total force, f b þ f r is balanced by the jump of the fluid stress vector across the vesicle membrane, f, across the vesicle membrane. We assume that no other forces (e.g., gravitational) are present in the system. Using potential theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the solution of (2) can be written as vðxÞ ¼ v 1 ðxÞ þ S½f b þ f r ðxÞ. The single-layer potential S½f is defined as S½fðxÞ ¼ R c Gðx; yÞfðyÞ dcðyÞ, where the 2D Stokes free-space kernel, G, is given by Gðx; yÞ ¼ 1 4pl</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">À ln qI þ r r q 2 ; r ¼ x À y; q ¼ krk 2 :<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>Enforcing the no-slip boundary condition, we get the first equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The tension r can be viewed as a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the local inextensibility constraint. It is computed by requiring the 'surface' divergence, div c of the interfacial velocity field is zero, that is, x s Á v s ðxÞ ¼ 0.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> This leads to the second equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>To construct and analyze our numerical scheme, we introduce the operators B; T ; D; L; M, defined on the interface xðsÞ, for any point y 2 R 2 ; f is a smooth vector field on c and r is a smooth scalar field on c:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Bðy; xÞf :¼ ÀS½f ssss ðyÞ; T ðy; xÞr :¼ S½ðrx s Þ s ðyÞ; DðxÞf :¼ x s Á f s ;<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>LðxÞ :¼ DðxÞT ðx; xÞ;</p><p>MðxÞ :¼ T ðxÞL À1 ðxÞDðxÞ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">If f ¼ j B x, Bf</formula><p>gives the single-layer potential at y due to the bending force on the interface. Similarly, T r gives the singlelayer potential due to the tension force. We define BðxÞ ¼ Bðx; xÞ and T ðxÞ ¼ T ðx; xÞ. Following this notation, we can rewrite the governing equations for a single vesicle as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">_ x ¼ v 1 ðxÞ þ j B BðxÞx þ T ðxÞr; LðxÞr ¼ ÀDðxÞ½v 1 ðxÞ þ j B BðxÞx:<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>Alternatively, we can eliminate the equation for the surface tension.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">_ x ¼ v 1 ðxÞ þ j B BðxÞx À T ðxÞL À1 ðxÞDðxÞ½v 1 ðxÞ þ j B BðxÞx; ¼ ð1 À MðxÞÞ½v 1 ðxÞ þ j B BðxÞx;<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where the M operator, which we call stretching operator, modifies the interface velocity field _ x to enforce the inextensibility constraint.</p><p>Scaling. In most of our numerical experiments we focus in the case in which v 1 is a simple shear flow. Following the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we define different scales as follows. The velocity is given by v 1 ¼ vðx 2 ; 0Þ, where v is the shear rate. The length scale R 0 is determined by the perimeter L of the boundary, given by R 0 ¼ L=2p, which is the radius of circle having the same perimeter. Then, the time scale s is defined by s ¼ lR 3 0 =j B . The dimensionless shear rate is defined by ṽ ¼ _ clR 3 0 =j B . The governing equation in the nondimensional form, for a vesicle suspended in simple shear flow, becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">_ x ¼ ṽ1 þ Bð xÞ x þ T ð xÞr;<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">where x ¼ x R 0 ; r ¼ R 2 0 r</formula><p>j B and ṽ1 ¼ ṽðx 2 ; 0Þ. Hence, ṽ and s characterize the vesicle dynamics. From now on, unless stated otherwise, all the equations are written in nondimensional form and for simplicity of notation and we suppress ' $' in the notation. Another parameter that we use is the so-called reduced area denoted by m and defined as m</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">¼ A pR 2 0 ¼ 4 Ap L 2 ,</formula><p>where A is the area of the vesicle. It is the ratio of the vesicle area over the area of circle of the same perimeter. It is used extensively in the literature to classify vesicle shapes.</p><p>Multiple vesicles. If K vesicles are suspended in the shear flow, equations (1) can be expanded into the following equations for the evolution of the jth vesicle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">_ x j ¼ v 1 ðx j Þ þ Bðx j Þx j þ T ðx j Þr j þ X K k¼1 k-j Bðx j ; x k Þx k þ T ðx j ; x k Þr k ;<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">Lðx j Þr j ¼ ÀDðx j Þ½v 1 ðx j Þ þ Bðx j Þx j À Dðx j Þ X K k¼1 k-j Bðx j ; x k Þx k þ T ðx j ; x k Þr k :<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>The fluid velocity at a point x away from the vesicle boundaries is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">vðxÞ ¼ v 1 ðxÞ þ X K k¼1 Bðx; x k Þx k þ T ðx; x k Þr k :<label>ð11Þ</label></formula></div>

The results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We can see that the overall stiffness is dominated by the stiffness of B. We conclude that, an implicit time-stepping method is essential for computational efficiency. Solving (7) using an implicit scheme requires using a nonlinear solver and calculating rather complicated operator derivatives if exact Jacobians are to be used. An alternative is to use a linearly-implicit scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, with ð1 À MÞB being used as an inexact Jacobian in place of J . Stiffness implies a rapid growth of the condition number of J . To efficiently solve linear systems involving ð1 À MÞB we use an iterative Krylov method, which requires preconditioning. It turns out that the inverses of the analytically obtained operators on the unit circle yield good results when used as preconditioners for the operators defined on general geometries. The details on the time-stepping and the linear solvers are given in the following section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Discretization in time</head><p>The existing literature on vesicle simulations is based on explicit-time stepping schemes for <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Such schemes are expected to suffer from severe stability constraints the size of time step. Here, we discuss two semi-implicit schemes that avoid such stringent constraints. 2 We have computed the Jacobian numerically for different mesh sizes and we discovered that it is a non-normal operator. Thus, the eigenvalues give an incomplete picture of the stability properties. For a more accurate analysis of the numerical stability of the linearized case the pseudospectrum of the Jacobian should be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. There are several ways of tracking the one-dimensional interface. (1) One can track points uniformly-distributed in the arclength <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, which requires resampling at each time step. (2) The shape of the interface is altered only by the normal component of the velocity field. Hence, an arbitrary tangential velocity can be imposed without altering the shape. This is often used to maintain good sampling on the interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. (3) A Lagrangian formulation, in which, we always track the motion of the initial set of material points on the interface.</p><p>We have adopted a Lagrangian formulation for several reasons. First, due to the local inextensibility of the interface, point clustering does not happen. If the parametrization at time t ¼ 0 is uniform in the arclength, it remains so for all times -up to discretization errors. Second, it simplifies implementation of high-order multistep schemes since it does not require interpolation. Third and most important, methods requiring resampling are far more difficult to extend to surfaces. Next, we describe two variants of a semi-implicit first-order scheme. The first variant has more work per time step but better stability properties.</p><p>Scheme I. Let Mt be the time step size and let x n ðaÞ be a point on the vesicle interface at nMt.

Scheme II. This scheme is inspired by the scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> for the simulation of flexible fibers in viscous flows.

Its main advantage over Scheme I is that the discrete equation for the tension is decoupled from the evolution equation. In our numerical experiments, we have observed that the stability properties of Scheme II are somewhat inferior to that of scheme I for certain flow regimes. Despite this, however, we found Scheme II quite attractive in the case of high-shear flows in which both schemes require time steps of similar sizes for stability. Finally, notice that in both schemes, the dependence of all linear operators on x is treated explicitly. High-order schemes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Preconditioners</head><p>As discussed, the time-stepping Schemes I and II require solution of systems with the operators L; 1 À DtðA þ BÞ, and 1 À Dtð1 À MÞðA þ BÞ. Based on our spectral analysis, the corresponding condition numbers should be behave as OðMÞ, OðM 3 =NÞ, and OðM 3 =NÞ, where M is the number of modes in space, and N is the number of time steps. 4  We propose low-cost preconditioners for these operators: the inverses of the corresponding operators for the unit circle. For example, the discretized inextensibility constraint has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">L M r M ¼ f M :<label>ð21Þ</label></formula><p>where M is the number of discretization points. We have shown in Section 2.1 that the eigenvalues of L are given by k k ¼ jkj 4 ; k 2 Z. Hence, on a circle, the condition number of L M is OðMÞ, assuming the null space is removed. We conducted numerical experiments to test how good an approximation the L spectrum on the unit circle is to the spectrum of L on a general boundary (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the spectrum of L M for different boundary configurations that have the same perimeter. We observe that the spectrum agrees quite well with the spectrum of a circle of same perimeter. This motivates the following preconditioner for (21):</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">P ¼ F À1 K À1 c F ; K c ¼ diag k À M 2 ; k À M 2 þ1 ; . . . ; kM 2 À1 n o ;<label>ð22Þ</label></formula><p>where k k is the kth-eigenvalue of L M defined on unit circle (we set k 0 ¼ 1) and F is the Fourier transform operator i.e., F f ¼ f . Since the entries of K c are known (Section 2.1) and FFT can be used for accelerating F f , the cost of applying P is OðM log MÞ per GMRES iteration. Tables <ref type="table">4</ref> and<ref type="table">7</ref> show the effectiveness of P. Without any preconditioner, the number of GMRES iterations increases with M (roughly as Oð ffiffiffiffi ffi M p Þ). When using the preconditioner, the number of GMRES iterations for a fixed tolerance remains approximately the same.</p><p>Next, we present a preconditioner to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Let us write <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">½I À Mtð1 À MÞðA þ BÞx nþ1 ¼ x n ;<label>ð23Þ</label></formula><p>where the operator A gives the far-field velocity, 5 v 1 ¼ Ax. 3 The quadrature rules of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> are designed to compute integrals of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">IðxÞ ¼ R 1 0 / 1 ðxÞ log x þ / 2<label>ðxÞ</label></formula><p>dx. The integral operators that we compute are of the form IðxÞ ¼ R 1 0 / 1 ðxÞ logðwðxÞÞ þ / 2 ðxÞ dx, where wðxÞ is a smooth function with wð0Þ ¼ 0. We can show that we still get the expected order of convergence. For details see Appendix C. 4 Note that if we had bending only, we would expect an M 4 =N behavior; the convolution with the Stokes single-layer potential has a smoothing effect.</p></div>

If the interior and exterior of the vesicle are filled with the same fluid, the vesicle undergoes a tank-treading motion at its equilibrium configuration.

To determine Dt, we start from an arbitrarily large time step Dt 0 and if the numerical simulation is stable, we set Dt ¼ Dt 0 . Otherwise, we reduce Dt 0 by half and repeat the experiment. All calculations are run until the vesicle shape reaches steady state. In the case of an explicit scheme, we can observe that asymptotically Dt / M Àp , where p is greater than three. Hence, irrespective of the accuracy requirements, we have to take a smaller time step to satisfy the stability criterion. The time step required for stability is asymptotically mesh-independent for both semi-implicit schemes. The maximum time step required for stability depends on the shear rate.

Such erratic convergence behavior was also observed for the same semi-implicit BDF schemes in Tornberg and Shelley <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> (p. 30), and in Kropinski <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> (p. 498).</p><p>The performance of the spectral preconditioners in accelerating the solution of the linear systems that appear in the timestepping algorithm is presented in Tables <ref type="table">7</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>We have presented two semi-implicit schemes to simulate the motion of inextensible vesicles suspended in a viscous fluid. Unlike a fully explicit scheme, these schemes do not exhibit a mesh-dependent high-order stability constraint on the time step size. The only stability restriction on is that the time step must be inversely proportional to the shear rate. For several important cases, we have numerically demonstrated that four orders of magnitude bigger time step can be taken when compared to a fully explicit scheme, even for a modest (32) number of spatial discretization points. Our schemes exhibit high-order accuracy in space and time. We have presented efficient low-cost preconditioners to solve the discrete evolution equations by iterative solvers. We incorporated FMM to compute the interaction forces in a suspension of large number of vesicles. We included analytical results for the unit circle case, and we conducted numerical studies that confirm our convergence and complexity estimates.</p><p>The vesicle-vesicle interaction forces are computed using the trapezoidal rule, which yields spectral accuracy for dilute suspension of vesicles. However, when two vesicles come closer, we need to modify the quadrature rules to compute the interaction forces because of the logarithmic singularity of the Stokes kernel. To resolve this issue, we plan to explore correction methods like the one suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. One additional extension is to circumvent the time stability dependence on the shear rate. Such an algorithm however, would require nonlinear solvers and contact detection algorithms that fully couple the vesicle position updates.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to conduct simulations of deformable incompressible vesicles in three-dimensions. We plan to built on our past work on fast Stokes solvers in complex geometries <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> that includes accurate quadratures, surface parameterization, and FMM. Nevertheless, computing high-order derivatives in high-accuracy will be challenging; and unlike the 2D case, the incompressibility constraint does not prevent mesh distortion: accurate tracking the moving interface will require additional work. Furthermore, the bending and stretching operators have more complicated form and coming up with effective linearizations and preconditioners will be more challenging.</p></div>

In this figure, we demonstrate the capabilities of our method, in particular the running times per time step and the ability to resolve complex interactions between multiple vesicles. We simulated the motion of 256 vesicles driven by an external flow that has a parabolic profile. In this simulation, we used 64 discretization points per vesicle and we took a total of 1000 time steps. The wall-clock time per time step was 40 s (on average) on a Xeon workstation. The computations were performed using MATLAB, accelerated by external FFT, FMM, and LAPACK libraries. In the left column, we show four snapshots of the overall simulation and in the right column, we zoom in the region marked by the broken-line square to show the details on the shapes of individual vesicles. Here, t is a nondimensional time t 2 ð0; 1Þ. The initial state is a rectangular array of vesicles in a non-equilibrium shape configuration (top row). Due to bending, the vesicle shapes are quickly smoothed. Then, the vesicles are dispersed by the shear of the background flow. We resolve high curvature regions (e.g., fourth row, second column), conserve vesicle areas and lengths, and compute the hydrodynamic interactions with sufficient accuracy to avoid collisions without employing a collision detection algorithm. Details on the accuracy and complexity of our method are presented in later Sections.</figDesc></figure>
