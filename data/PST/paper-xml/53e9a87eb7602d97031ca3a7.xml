In order to model and compute motion, we need to understand how images (and, therefore, image motion) formed. Motion in image sequences acquired by a video camera is induced by the movements of objects in a 3D scene and by cam era motion. Thus, a camera's parameters, such as its 3D motion (rotation, translation) or focal length, play an important role in image motion model ing. If we know these parameters precisely, only object motion needs to be recovered. However, this scenario is rather rare, and both object and cam era motion usually need to be com p uted. The 3D motion of objects and cameras induces 2D motion on the image plane via a suitable projection s y stem. It is this 2D motion, also called apparent motion or optical flow ! , that needs to be recovered from intensity and color information of a video se-</p></div>

Let its position at time t be Xo:X(t)=(X(t),Y(t),Z(t»), EIR3 expressed in camera coordinates. (X (t), t) defi nes a curve in 3D space over t ime which we refer to as the world motion trajectory. for any two timc instants t and t, the world mot ion traj ectory identifies a 3D displace ment in position TJt, (Xl = X(T) -X(t).</p><p>For a review of 3D motion and its relatiunship to the ap parent 2D motion of interest here, the reader is referred to Lll, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[63]</ref>.</p><p>An image acquisition system projects the 3D world onto a 2D imag c p lan e ' with image co ordinates x 0: (x, y)1" E A, where A is a sampling grid, usually an or� thogonallattice. Upon this projection, wor ld motion tra jectories result in (2D) motion tr ajectories (x(t), t). We adopt the definition of a 2D motion trajectory proposed in [24]: a trajectory is defined only in the time interval in which the associated point is visible in the image. Thus, assuming that we are dea ling with non-trans p arent ob jects, each spatio-temporal position (x, t) belongs to a motion trajectory of only one visible point.

In practical applications, this fW1Ction is often described in a parametr ic form using a finite, usually small, number of parameters.</p><p>Since 2D motion results from the projection of mov ing 3D objects onto the image plane, a model for 2D mo tion fields can be derived from models describing 3D motion, 3D surface function, and camera projection ge om etry. If these models are parametric, the resulting 2D motion model will be parametric as well. As a simple ex ample, consider a 3D planar patch undergoing 3D affine motion under orthographic projection. The 3D affine motion can be written as follows D(X) "" (R -I)X +s.</p><p>(2)</p><p>In gener al, the 3x3 m atrix R = (ri j ) has nine degrees of freed om, and the translational mo tion vector s = (s 1 , S 2 ,s 3 ) T has another three degrees of freedom.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[61]</ref>. Clearly, a 2D mo tion model does not uniquely correspond to one 3D model; identica12D motion models may result from dif ferent assumptions about 3D motion, surface and camera projection models.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> summarizes some parametric models for 2D motion a n d provi des p ossible tmderlying assumptions. The first four models are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; for each model, an example of a motion vector field is shown along with the corresponding motion-compensated square. The simplest (translational) model for 2D motion is used in the existing coding standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref>.</p><p>It accounts for a rigid translational 3D motion under or thographic projection, resulting Ul a spatially constant 2D motion. Clearly, m otion compensation with such fields preserves any 2D shape. With affine motion, parallel lines remain parallel in the motion-compensated linage. The 3D affme motion of planar p atches under a perspective camera model leads to an eight-parameter model that is linear in projective coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[90]</ref>. We can easily see that this model includes the 2D aff ine model as a special case; lines remain lines after motion compensation. A quadratic model was proposed in <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>    A different description of motion fields can be provided by vector fields represented on a rectangular lattice or a mesh. In this way, the number of pa rameters varies with the number of considered pixels. Off-lattice vectors of the motion field can be approxi-mated by suitable interpolation of the sampled tleld <ref type="bibr">[66]</ref>.</p><p>In general, the interpolation kernel H (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>) has a small support, such that a motion vector is usually inter polated from, at most, four samples. The frequently used bilinear interpolation kernel is a tensor p roduct of hori zontal and vertical 1 D triangular kernels. Recently, an in teresting generalization of this model has been presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[65]</ref>, where H is a complete multiresolution basis imple mented using a perfect-reconstruction, non-separable subband scheme. When the motion sampling lattice in volves at least one site per image PL'{el, thc motion fields are called dense. Obviously, dense motion fields provide a fairly general description of motion, but estimation, in terpretation, and transmissioll thereof involve large amounts of data.</p><p>Another frequently used model employs a trian,gular mesh; motion vectors of a dense tield arc interpolated from three motion vectors at the corners of each trian gle. When the moti on is sampled on a predetermined mesh, the interpolation will be, in general, imprecise at disconti nuities in the motion field. Therdc)re, adaptive meshes have been proposed [86 J, f92] that select the sampling points in such a way that the interpolated area of the mo tion field contains pixels from only one moving object. Typically, those points lie on intensity edges of the image.</p><p>As with image intensity patterns, motion fields are highly correlated spatially. Therefore, it can be expected th at such tlelds can be efficicntly represented using linear transforms followed by zeroin g of high-frequency com ponents. for example, the polynomial transform given in the last row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> includes most of the parametric models as special cases for relatively few coeftlcients. For JC = {(O,O), (0,1), (1,0)}, the polynomial description re duces to a 2D affine description, while the quadratic model is obtained for J( = {(O,O), (0,1), (1,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)}.</p><p>The number of coefficients can be adapted to the actual complexity of the scene, e.g., such that the error of mo� tion-compensated p rediction is sufficiently small [511, l82]. Clearly, tor a sufiiciently large set of parameters, the polynomial dcscri ptioll allows representation of arbitrary motion fields.</p><p>By its definition, the displacement (1) can only capture the first-order dynamics of a moving point (con stant-velocity motion). However, it has been shown that second-order temporal models capturing both velocity and acceleration can substantially improve the perfor mance of motion-compensated predictive coding l29] and standards conversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[71]</ref>. To capture these sec ond-order effects, each motion trajectory must be mod eled explicitly. For example, it may be represented by two vectors: instantaneous velocity x and acceleration x [13]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x(t) X(1) '" x(t) + x(t) (1 -t) + 2:-(1 -t)2.</formula><p>(5)</p><p>Such a temporal modeling can be applied in addition to the spatial modeling described thus far in Tahle 1. Al though representation of motion trajectory fields rather than displacement tlelds is advantageous in certain appli cations, larger amounts of motion information must be processed and/or transmitted [13 J.</p><p>In the remainder of this article,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">vex) '= x(t) = (tt, (x), v, (x») T</formula><p>denotes the velocity of an image point at: (x, t); tt, and v, are horizo ntal and vertical velocity cornponents, respec tively .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Region of Support for Motion Rep"esentaticifl</head><p>As discussed in the preceding section, 2D motion in an image can be described spatially by a model from Table <ref type="table">l</ref>.</p><p>Models from this table differ in terms of the number of parameters and in terms of the function:al dependence of d( x) on tbose parameters. In general, the higher the num ber of parameters, and thus the higher the function order, the more precise the description of the motion field. At the same time, however, an excessive number of parame ters may result in motion "overmodding" (excessive number of degrees of freedom-important in video pro cessing and computer vision), and increased coding cost (important in video coding). In this case, the motion esti mation accuracy may acmally decrease. This is due to ill-posedness of motion estimation ; for example, no unique solution may exist. The p recision of the motion field also depends on the region of support R c ;\ for tl1e model, i.e. , the set of image points to \\jlich the model ap plies. Since the true motion field d is rarely purely translational or divergent or exhibits other regularity, the smaller the region of support R., the better the approxi mation. The quality of approximation for a given motion field d can be measured, for exam p le, by the mean-squared error (6)</p><p>Thus, for a given num ber of parameters the precision of a motion field can be adjusted by I:boDsin!; a suitable region of support R. jJni(Jrtllnately, the error EJ can be mea sured only if d is known, i.e., fcx computer-generated (synthetic) images. Tn tl1e following sections, we discuss different support regions proposed in the literature, with both flXed and variable sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Motion</head><p>The most constrained, yet simplest case is gwbal motion, i. e., motion such that all image points are displaced in a uniform manner.

It is the simplest case because the motion of all the image points can be described by a small set of parameters (e.g., affine; </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motion of Individual Image Points</head><p>At the other extreme of the spectrum, the region of sup port may consist of a single image point (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>) [2J, [43J, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[59]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[68]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Rx = {x}, XEA.</formula><p>Then, motion of each image point can be described by a set of parameters, such as displacement in the case oflin-  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1&lt; :� . � . �</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motion of Regions</head><p>Between the two extremes above, one can find m ethods that apply motion models from whole image (fi g . 3c):</p><p>R",,, = {x= (i,JV EA:(m-l)Rl( &lt;i&lt;;;. mBl(, (n -l)Br &lt; f:::; nELL m = 1, . .. ,IC / B Affi ne motion of rectangular blocks of image points is hardly a precise model for arbitrary motion in image se quences; objects in natural 3D scenes rarely result in rect angular projections onto the i mage plane. Thus, a more general image partitioning is necessary. The reasoning is that for objects with suffi ciently smooth 3D surface and 3D motion, the induced 2D motion fields in the image plane can be suitably described by models from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> if applied to the area of object projection. A natural image partitioning can be provided by the image acquisition process itself. Becanse several 3D objec[s typically move in front ofa camera, it is straightforward to group all pix els arising from one surface of a 3D object into one re gion. Not all 3D objects, however, move independen tly (e.g_, car and its driver). Therefore, it is more interesting to find image partitioning such that all image points in a region arise from objects that undergo one motion. Then, motion parameters can be estimated from all the image points in a moving region. In both cases, however, a re gion is described as follows (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3d</ref>) where all arb i t r ar ily s h a p e d r egi o ns �" arc non-overlapping and their union covers tile complete im age. To f i nd a motion-induced partition, certain knowl edge about motion is necessary, and conversely, to find motion par::uneters a partition is needed. The problem is often solved by fi rst applying a segmentation followed by motion estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[94]</ref>, or by first estimating motion pa rameters and then following with segmentation [25J .</p><p>Since the two processes are not independent, a more ap propriate solution is to carry out j oint motion estimation and motion-based image segmentation. This can be done model has tl1e ca p acity to perform better image matching at the cost of a more complex representation. This trade-off is well-known in video compression, since both intensity/color residual (image matching error) and mo tion information must be transmitted over a lim ited-capacity channel. The difficulty lies in findin g a compromise between a precise, but rate-costly, motion representation that gives a small intensity/color residual and coarse motion information that results in an in� creased residual [25], <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[85]</ref>. This is a vcry active area of research today. The resulting region-based image de scription is similar to tl1e description language of com puter graphics, thus somewhat merging worlds that, for a long time, have been considered unrelated. This enriches both worlds; for exam p le, objects from natural imagery can be added to computer graphics, while functionalities, so far reserved for computer graphics, can be applied to natural imagery (object�based image manipulation).</p><p>In general, image partitioning based on fixed rectangu lar blocks under translations is outperformed, in terms of intensity/color residual, by region�based affme motion models <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. While the former is simple to implement in hardware, the latter requires fairly so p histicated image analysis. As a compromise, partitioning methods based on rectangular variable-size blocks have been investigated</p><p>[14 J, [26], <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[70]</ref>. In such an a p proach, bloclcsize is reduced locally wherever a smaller block size improves motion compensation, i.e., reduces the intensity/color residual. Certainly, this increases the complexity of the image parti tion, but for simple tree-based schemes, such as quad-tree block splitting, the overhead is small <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[70]</ref>. Motion estima tion with variable-size blocks has been shown to give sub stantial gains in practice, and is presently used in the H.263 video compression standard [49]; 16 x 16 blocks can be individually split into four 8 x 8 blocks.</p><p>Motion compensation using arbitrarily shaped regions has been adopted in the MPEG-4 standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[47]</ref>. Al though only local translational motion of (partial) blocks is exploited, rather than higher-order parametric motion of complete regions, the approach results in substantial compression gains. Conse q uently, the visual quality of images is significantly improved around object bound aries (reduced "mos q uito effects").</p><p>To demonstrate the impact of various regions of sup port on the motion estimates, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows results for     </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">.-----------------------------------,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hierarchical Motion Models</head><p>The practical concept of a variable-size block for motion models [14], [26 j, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[70]</ref> call be regarded as a special case of hierarchical representation that has often been exploited in computer vision applications <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[76]</ref>. In such a represen tation, the estimate (in tllis case motion) can be modeled at multiple levels of detail, making it possible to extract coarse characteristics first and add finer detail, later [371.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>, we show a multiresolution representation of a motion field in dual form. On the left, a motion fi eld is rep resented at multiple resolutions and scales at the same time.</p><p>Note that we follow the defi nitions of resolution and scale proposed in 191]. On the right, is shown an equivalent rep resentation that can be obtained from the left representa tion by upsampling and interpolation. This representation is at multiple resolutions, but at a single scale.</p><p>The mllitiresolution/multisealc representation from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref> (left) captures coarse motion properties at the higher levels of the pyramid while allowing for progressively more detail when descending in the pyramid. Due to scale change, motion vectors located two pixel1; apart at the low est resolution are eight pixels apart at full resolution for a three-level pyramid with dyadic subsampling. Conse quently, for models imposing spatial inw'action between neighboring motion vectors (e.g., smoothness), lon ger-range interactions are enforced at lower resolution (higher scale) levels while shorter-range ones are recovered at higher resolution (lmver scale) levels of the pyramid.</p><p>As mentioned above, the two representations in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref> are equivalent. The multiscale represent3tion (left) is used in practical estimation algorithms due to its computa tional efficiency, whereas the single-scale representation (right) is more transparent for certain theoretical consid erations, for exam p le, to assure consistency of motion models between different resolutions <ref type="bibr">[4:</ref>01. This will be discussed further in "Hierarchical Optimization".</p><p>The single-scale representation can be also thought of as a motion model with an adjustable region of support.</p><p>An early example of such a model, where motion parame ters are confined to large blocks first and then fine tuned using smaller blocks, is shown in [3]. This allows early capture of macroscopic motion properties and their sub sequent refinement. This approach can be taken further by allowing a spatially nonuniform adjustment of the size of the region of support as is done, for example, in quad-tree splitting [26], <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[70]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdependence of Motion and Image Data</head><p>At the very essence of every motion-estimation algorithm lie assmnptions about the relationship between motion pa rameters and image intensity. Let g, (x) be the image in� In video p rocessing,. motion analysis is used for standards conversion,. noise suppression, and debhuring. tensity at position (x,t). The usual, and reasonable, assumption made is that ima g e intensity remains constant along the motion trajectory. This assumption implies, among others, d1at any intensity chan g e is due to motion, that scene illumination is constant, and that obj ect surfaces are opaque (Lambertian surfaces) . Although mese con straints are almost never satisfied exactly, the con stant-intensity assumption approximately describes the dominant properties of natural image sequences, and mo tion estimation methods based on it usually work welL</p><p>Let s be a variable along a motion traj ectory. Then, the constant-intensity assumption translates into the follow ing constraint equation dg =0. denotes the spatial gradient and v = (u , v) T is the velocity.</p><p>The above constraint equation, whether in the continuous fo rm or as a discrete approximation, has recently served as the basis fo r many algoriilims estimating linear motion [8], <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[58]</ref>. Since color is a very important attribute of images, a possible extension of the above model would be to include chromatic image components into me constraint equa tion. The motivation is that: in areas of uniform intensity, but substantial color detail, the inclusion of a color-based constraint could prove beneficial. Let g == (g 1 , •.• , g K ) T be a vector of attributes associated with an image; for ex ample, its luminance and two chrominances as defined in the ITU -R 601 recommendation. Then, the con-stant-intensity and constant-color constraints can be written jointly in a vector fo rm as fo llows :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">aa CIa aa � �u+ �v+�=O. Clx dy CIt (10)</formula><p>In general, estimates obtained using this constraint are more reliable than those calculated using (9) due to the additional information exploited. However, although ( 1 0) is a vector equation, different components of g may be closely related and therefore additional constraints may be needed. We will return to these constraints in the next section.</p><p>The assumption about intensity constanc y is usually only approximately satisfi ed, but it is particularly violated when scene illumination changes . As an alternative, a constraint based on the spatial gradient's constancy in the direction of motion has been proposed [5J, <ref type="bibr">[88]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">dVg = 0.</formula><p>ds This equation can be rewritten as fo llows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">[CllglaXl Cl2 g I ClxC!J' (11) (12)</formula><p>It relaxes the constant-intensity assumption, but requires that the amount of dilation and rotation in the image be negli g ible, a limitation often satisfi ed in practice3. Note that although both (11) and (12) are linear vector equations with two unknowns (u and v), in practice the y do not lend themselves to me direct computation of motion, but need to be supported by an appropriate motion model. The primary reason fo r this is iliat, in practice, the constraints are not sat isfi ed exactly. Furthermore, the constraint (12) is based on second-order image derivatives. They are difficult to com pute reliably due to the high-pass naillre of the opera tor-usually data smoothing must be performed first [21],</p><p>[88]. To assure smoothness of me resulting motion fi eld�, post-fIltering is often applied as well <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. In order to allevi ate problems associated with noise, vanishing gradients, etc., mat may lead to ill-posedness, an alternative approach based on the minimization of a norm of dV g / ds under a smootlmess constraint has been developed <ref type="bibr">[89]</ref> . The ap proach has been demonstrated to be very robust in the pres ence of time-varying illumination.</p><p>A different approach to handling nonconstant inten sity in the direction of motion is through ex p licit model ing of the illumination <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[64]</ref> . The approach is promising, although it requires complex minimization since, in addition to me motion field, illumination fields must also be estimated.</p><p>The constraints discussed above find different applica tions in practice. A discrete version of the con stant-intensity constraint (9) is often applied in video compression since it results in small motion-compensated prediction error. Although motion can also be computed based on color using thc vector cons traint (10), experience shows that the small gains achieved do not justif)! the substan tial increase in complexity . However, motion estimation from color data is useful in video processing tasks (e.g., mo tion-compensated filtering, resampl ing) , where any motion error ma y result in visible distortion. Moreover, the vector constraint is interesting fo r estimating motion from multiple data sources (e.g., range/intensity data). Finally, the gra(u ent -based constraint (11) is oftcn employcd in computer vi sian to fInd thc tme motion despitc varying ill wnination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation Criteria</head><p>Various motion representations as well as the relation ship between motion and images discussed in the previ ous section can be used now to fo rmulate an estimation criterion . There is no uniqlle criterion fo r motion estima tion, however. The difficulty in establishing a good crite rion is primarily caused by the fa ct that motion in images is not directly observable4 and that particular dynamics of intensity in an image sequence may be induced by more than one motion (nonuniqueness) . Another problem is that most of the models discussed above are far fro m ideaL For example, the constant-intensity model ex pressed through the motion-constraint equation (9) is underconstrained and, at the same time, is often violated due to factors such as noise, nonopaque surface reflec tions, occlusions, or spatio-temporally varying illwnina tion. Therefore, all attempts to establish suitable criteria for motion estimation require fu rther implicit or explicit modeling of the image sequence.</p></div>

Motion estimation became a fundamental component of such standards as H.261, H.263, and the MPEG family [461, [45J, [49]. Although motion models used by the older standards are very sim ple (one 2D vector per block), the new MPEG-4 stan darctl otfers an alternative (region-based) model tha t al lows increased efficiency and flexibility [47], [75]. In video processing, motion information is used for stan dards conversion (motion-compensated 3D samp ling structure conversion), noise suppression (m otion compe nsated filtering) [11], or deblurring (motion compensated res tora tion) [86J.

The choice of models and their parame ters is application�depcndent. For exam p le, t h e occlusion model may not be relevant for a block-based compression, whereas it would be essential in image analysis. Second, an estimation criterion must be identi fied. Such a criterion may take different forms, such as a simple mean-squared error over a block, a robust crite rion (e.g., with saturation for large errors), or a complex rate-distortion or Bayesian criterion invo lving multiple terms. Third, a search strategy must be implemented to determine the motion parameters that optimize the se lected criterion. In general, by a suitable selection of search strategy, one can trade, to a large extent, optimi zation performance against com p utational load. The strategy may be deterministic or stochastic in nature. Ex haustive and s implified search methods as well as deter ministic relaxation belong to the most popular schemes and include, as special cases, b lock matching and gradi ent-based m ethods. Among the best-lmown determinis tic relaxation methods arc Iterated Conditional Modes and Highest Confidence First. Mean-tleld techniques stemming from statistical mechanics are important de terministic optimization techniques based on the ap� proximation of a parti tion function. Stochastic relaxat ion techniques, including simulated a nnealing, arc dominant among the stochastic approaches. An im portant element of the optim ization strategy is its hierar chical implementation in order to avoid the violation of some underlying assumptions (e. g ., local i ntensity lin earity) and/or reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm.</figDesc></figure>

This pixel-based or dense motion representation is the least constrained one since at least two parameters describe movement of each image point, and thus, at least 2 x K x L parameters are used to repre sent motion in an image. Conse q uentl y , a very large num ber of motion fields can be represented by all possible combinations of parameter values. At the same time, the method is the most complex due to the number of par::uTI eters involved. Although, from a purely computational point of view, it may not be the nwst demanding tech nique, pixel-based motion estimation is definitely one of the most demanding approaches. Dense motion repre sentation has found applications in computer vision, e.g., for the recovery of 3D structure, and in video processing (standards con"version, deblurring, noise reductio n) . Its direct use in video compression has only shown reason able success in the form of pel-recursive motion estima tion. In this approach, fi rst, a motion vector for each im age point is causally predicted from previously esti mated and transmitted motion vectors. Then, an update to this prediction is computed while minimizing the mo tion-compensated prediction error [73] . Clearly, there is no physical rcason for causal spatial prediction of motion or for the choice of any particular direction in this predic tion. However, noncausal estimation and transmission of pixel-based motion fields has not proved successful to date; the potential gains from a more precise motion de scription arc usually outweighed by the need to transmit thousands of motion parameters.

		<title level="a" type="main">Endnotes 1 Although in computer vision literature a distinction is often made between 2D motion and optical flow [42], here we will use the term 2D motion to denote either ap parent motion or opti cal flow. This is consistent with video compression terminology where the description of variations in an image is of direct interest regardless of its compliance with the physical cause of that variation. 2Detailed information about MPEG standards can be ob tained from MPEG home page at www.cselt.it/mpcg. 3rt is worthwhile noting that even when the con stant-intensity assumption is valid, the intensity gradient changes its amplitude under dilation and its direction un der rotation. 4We can only see the result of motion, not the motion it self</title>
