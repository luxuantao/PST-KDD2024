<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Currently, research, development and standardization activities for the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks are in full action. Critical capability objectives, such as 20 Gbits/s peak data rate, 10 6 devices/km 2 connection density and 1 ms latency for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and ultrareliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) services respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, present serious challenges on 5G commercial deployments. On the other hand, wide available spectrum in millimeter-wave bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, as well as numerous emerging advances in waveforms, modulation and coding schemes, multiple access schemes, antenna technologies, network technologies and system architectures, are considered as key enablers for 5G <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; filtered orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (f-OFDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, sparse code multiple access (SCMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, polar code <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, network densification, to name a few.</p><p>Waveforms have been consistently and fundamentally shaping the development of wireless communications. As a latest example, the success of 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is largely based on the flexibility, efficiency and robustness provided by cyclically prefixed OFDM (CP-OFDM) and its low peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) variant discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) for MBB services <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, in the era of 5G, it is required to re-visit the competence of traditional CP-OFDM and to seek possible enhancements. This is due to the following main characteristics which differ 5G from its precedent:</p><p>• Mixed numerologies: 5G aims at providing diverse services, e.g., eMBB, mMTC and URLLC. Instead of uniformly distributing time/frequency resources as in LTE, the 5G waveform should support a more flexible allocation and the coexistence of multiple numerologies for various services. For instance, URLLC services are preferred to be transmitted in a shorter time interval with a larger subcarrier spacing compared to LTE to meet 1 ms round time constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. • Higher spectrum efficiency: The spectrum efficiency of 5G is expected to be three times higher than its precedent for eMBB services <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In LTE, 10% of the bandwidth is reserved as guard bands for the signal to meet the spectrum mask and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ALCR) requirement. Towards a more efficient spectrum utilization, the 5G waveform has to reduce this guard bands tremendously. • Asynchronous transmissions: In LTE, the base station (BS) must send frequent timing advance (TA) signals to user equipment (UE) to maintain stringent synchronization in order to mitigate inter-carrier interference (ICI).</p><p>The associated overhead can be heavy, particularly in uplink. It is certainly not favorable for the services like mMTC, which are featured with massive connections in particular. Instead, the 5G waveform needs to support asynchronous transmissions to avoid such overhead and to guarantee massive connectivity.</p><p>Motivated by these considerations, notable waveforms have been proposed and investigated over past years, including f-OFDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, windowing-OFDM (W-OFDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, filter-band multi-carrier (FBMC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and generalized frequency-division multiplexing (GFDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Interested readers are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for an overview as well as qualitative and quantitative comparisons among different waveforms. Very recently, considering the performance-complexity trade-off, technology maturity, MIMO friendliness, especially the backward compatibility and forward compatibility, an agreement on the 5G waveform was reached by member companies of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which claimed that, at least up to 40 GHz for eMBB and URLLC services, CP-OFDM based waveform is supported, and spectral confinement techniques such as filtering and windowing for a waveform at the transmitter should be transparent to the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Inheriting all merits of CP-OFDM, the most obvious advancement in W-OFDM and f-OFDM is to use filtering and windowing respectively to reduce the OOB emission to improve spectrum utilization efficiency by limiting the guard bands. As 3GPP is one of the major contributors on the standards of global cellular networks, from implementation and deployment perspective, for upcoming 5G, it is encouraged to concentrate on more careful and thoughtful design, evaluations, realizations and comparisons of CP-OFDM waveform and its enhancements, i.e., f-OFDM and W-OFDM, to better fit the aforementioned 5G characteristics, especially to support various services with diverse requirements. The following contributions are worth mentioning.</p><p>• In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the authors propose applications of f-OFDM to enable asynchronous transmissions and the performance of f-OFDM is shown to outperform UFMC. • In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the authors design a general framework to support different services by using f-OFDM. Performance in terms of out-of-band (OOB) emission and block error rate (BLER) are evaluated and compared with traditional CP-OFDM.</p><p>• In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the authors discuss the design and implementation of f-OFDM and verify the capability of supporting asynchronous transmissions by f-OFDM in a field trial.</p><p>• In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the authors build a lab experiment to demonstrate about 5 times better latency performance than LTE can be achieved by using a new frame structure with OFDMbased waveforms and a larger subcarrier spacing.</p><p>• In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the authors propose a solution to enable diverse services by flexible and adaptive filtering while the regular resource grid is maintained.</p><p>Compared to these contributions, this paper presents field trial results in time division duplex (TDD) downlink (DL) in the presence of mixed numerologies. Three different 3GPP waveform candidates for 5G, i.e, CP-OFDM, W-OFDM and f-OFDM are evaluated. In particular, we split the bandwidth into several subbands with different numerologies, and focus on the spectrum efficiency in terms of throughput and the robustness in terms of block error rate (BLER) to evaluate the impact of the inter-numerology interference. Field trial results are obtained in a realistic environment with a configurable testbed prototype, which is capable of supporting up to 200 MHz signal bandwidth in the 4.5 -4.8 GHz frequency bands with maximum 64 BS radio frequency (RF) chains and 8 UE RF chains. The maximum transmit power is 46 dBm and 23 dBm for BS and UE respectively. The main contribution of this present paper is three-fold:</p><p>• Testbed and field trials: We focus our attention firstly on building a practical and flexibly configurable testbed, as a general platform for research, development and verification of various 5G-specific technologies. Measurement results in a real-world environment can be served as useful supplements to simulations, as well as convincing evidences of technology feasibility. Meanwhile, details revealed about the implementations can be references for the readers who are willing to conduct a trial. • Design guidance to improve spectrum efficiency and robustness: Being compliant with 3GPP agreements, we have further discussions and comparisons on the different waveforms, i.e, CP-OFDM, W-OFDM and f-OFDM, with corresponding parameter selections. Based on the obtained field trial results, f-OFDM can achieve a higher gain in both spectrum efficiency and robustness compared to traditional CP-OFDM and W-OFDM. In some cases, with f-OFDM, the performance degradation is negligible even without a guard tone. We also provide insights on the impact of several important system parameters, e.g., guard bandwidth, data bandwidth, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), transmit power spectrum density (transmit PSD) offset.</p><p>• Mixed numerologies performance: To emulate the support of diverse services in 5G, in the reported field trial, the bandwidth is flexibly divided into several subbands, each with a different numerology, and the performance of different waveforms is measured accounting intersubband OOB emission. It confirms the possibility of the coexistence of different services, for example, eMBB and URLLC services. In addition, it provide insights on resource allocation to support diverse services. The remaining part of this present paper is structured as follows. In Section II, an overview of the testbed is provided. In particular, the detailed baseband processing procedures of f-OFDM and W-OFDM are presented, respectively. In Section III, field trial environment is introduced and experimental design of test cases is proposed. In Section IV, different waveforms and parameter selections are validated and compared via both simulations and field trials. The relevant performance trends are discussed in-depth as well. Finally, Section V concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. TESTBED OVERVIEW</head><p>The most reliable way to investigate the candidate technologies is a field trial on a realistic testbed for experimenting in a real-world environment. In this section, an overview of testbed architecture is provided, with a special focus on the baseband processing on waveforms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Overall Architecture</head><p>The testbed consists of a prototype BS and a prototype UE, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and operates in TDD mode. A common design principle applies for both BS and UE implementations and mainly four units, i.e., baseband unit, In addition, for BS, baseband unit and digital unit can be deployed in the room, while IF Unit, RF Unit and antennas can be deployed on the tower or the roof. Fiber connections between the room and the tower can be up to dozens of kilometers. For UE, on the other hand, the prototype can be simpler and more compact. For example, digital, IF and RF units can be more integrated, crest factor reduction (CFR) and digital pre-distortion (DPD) modules are not necessarily needed. It is worth mentioning that only one RF chain is explicitly depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the ease of presentation.</p><p>The testbed is capable of supporting maximum 64 and 8 RF chains at BS and UE respectively.</p><p>As an example, more details on each of four units at the BS are revealed as follows.</p><p>• Cloud baseband unit: Baseband unit is responsible for physical layer processing, e.g., channel coding, QAM modulation, waveform generation and shaping, MIMO precoding, etc. The cloud baseband is software-based and implemented in the commercial servers by C/C++ language.  <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the softwarebased baseband processing procedures on the transmitter (BS side) and receiver (UE side), respectively. To emulate the coexistence of multiple numerologies, the system bandwidth is divided into several subbands, and each subband may have a different numerology. Subband signals are added together before being sent to RF for transmission. Compared to traditional CP-OFDM, one notable difference of f-OFDM and W-OFDM is that, at the transmitter, the CP-OFDM modulated baseband signal is filtered with a subband-specific filter for f-OFDM, or  is windowed by a well-chosen window function for W-OFDM. Accordingly, at the receiver, before CP-OFDM demodulation, the received signal is filtered/windowed.</p><p>2) Filtering: f-OFDM introduces subband-specific filters to suppress the OOB emission. The main objective of filter design is to achieve a reasonable balance between time and frequency localization. More specifically, the filter design criteria for f-OFDM can be concluded as follows.</p><p>• The pass-band of the filter should be as flat as possible to ensure the distortion on the data subcarriers especially on the edge subcarriers as minimal as possible.</p><p>• The frequency roll-off of filter should start from the edges of the pass-band and the transition band of the filter should be sharp. Thus the spectrum can be utilized efficiently, i.e., the guard band overhead between adjacent subbands can be minimized. • The filter should have a sufficient stop-band attenuation to guarantee a negligible interference leakage to the neighboring subband.</p><p>The windowed-Sinc finite impulse response (FIR) filter design method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which multiplexes an ideal low-pass filter like a Sinc function and a finite time domain window, e.g., a carefully-modified root raised cosine (RRC) window, could meet aforementioned requirements. It can be presented in time domain by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h(n) = sin(ω c n)/(ω c n) • W (n), where W (n) = W RRC (n) = [0.5 (1 -cos (2πn/(N -1)))] α , ω c</formula><p>is the cut-off frequency, N is the filter length and α is the window shape parameter. In our field trial, α = 0.6. More details about the windowed-Sinc filter design are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Typically, in terms of OOB emission suppression capability, filtering outperforms windowing at the cost of a higher complexity. In particular, frequency domain localization implies time domain dispersion, which induces high-order filtering and thus a high complexity. However, thank to the power of modern processors and many complexity reduction schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>, a high-performance filter with a tolerable complexity can be implemented efficiently. For example, in our testbed, a filter with the order up to 1024 can be realized without any noticeable negative impact.</p><p>Filtering on an OFDM signal burst may bring extra overhead due to the filtered symbol tails. In frequency division duplex (FDD) mode, since the tails of consecutive transmission time intervals (TTIs) are overlapped with each other, there is no extra tail overhead. On the other hand, in TDD mode, the signal tails appear at the beginning and the end of each DL (or UL) transmission burst, where a DL/UL switching is done. To address this issue, noted that the original f-OFDM signal burst tails are well-localized in time, a soft truncation by a smooth window (increasing slope from 0 to 1 for reserved pre-tail and decreasing slope from 1 to 0 for reserved post-tail) with an appropriate length can be used to reduce the tail overhead at both ends, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Since the truncated tails are much shorter than the length of a guard period (GP), they can be completely absorbed into GP to achieve zero overhead in time-domain for TDD.</p><p>3) Windowing: W-OFDM introduces simple windows to control the OOB emission. Figures <ref type="figure">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> illustrate the baseband signal processing of W-OFDM transmitter and receiver, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. The boundaries of each OFDM symbol are multiplied with a smooth window in time domain, e.g., a Hanning window, a RRC window. The increasing window is applied at the beginning of the CP while the decreasing window is applied on an extra added cyclic postfix after the core OFDM symbol. Furthermore, the increasing-windowed signal of the next OFDM symbol overlaps with the decreasingwindowed signal of the previous neighboring OFDM symbol. At W-OFDM receiver, a smooth window instead of a rectangle window in CP-OFDM is used to extract the useful samples of the received signal for further fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations. The end partition of cyclic prefix of each OFDM symbol is multiplied with an increasing window, and then shifted and overlapped with the end partition of the core OFDM symbol multiplied with a decreasing window. If the smooth window fulfills Nyquist criteria, the core OFDM signal transmitted can be restored perfectly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. FIELD TRIAL ENVIRONMENT AND DESIGN</head><p>Extensive measurements in TDD DL using the testbed introduced in the previous section were performed in downtown Yokohama, Japan. The field trial environment is as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. It covers a representative urban region. The BS antennas are placed at a height of 108 meters and UE antennas are placed on a movable van at a height of about 3 meters. The distance between BS and UE is 330/880 meters for the test in a high/low SNR condition respectively. The propagation can be considered as line-of-sight throughout the trial. To evaluate CFR functionality can be considered as turned off in our field trial since the total transmission bandwidth is only about half of maximum supported bandwidth. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, one filter is applied per carrier (i.e., 19.83 MHz for test subband and 19.815 MHz for each carrier of interfering subband) and the highlighted data band at the right edge of test subband is our major focus, since it is the most probable frequency position suffering the internumerology OOB emission from the neighboring band. To increase the resource allocation flexibility, the data band can occupy 360 KHz bandwidth on resource block 1 (RB1) or RB2 (which is 360 KHz closer to the interfering subband compared to RB1). It can span on 720 KHz bandwidth on both RB1 and RB2 as well. This arrangement allows us to study the impact of frequency location and bandwidth of the data band. To better quantitatively evaluate the performance of guard bands in the presence of inter-numerology OOB emission, in this field trial, we introduce a terminology "guard tone", which is defined as a unit of frequency band between the last subcarrier of test subband and the first subcarrier of interfering band, as illustrated in Figures <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>. Zero guard tone is defined as 30KHz between last subcarrier of test subband and first subcarrier of interfering subband, accordingly.</p><p>With these in consideration, the test cases in the field trial are designed in a way of providing comprehensive comparisons of CP-OFDM, W-OFDM and f-OFDM on spectrum efficiency and robustness, accounting important system parameters, such as guard bandwidth, data bandwidth, SNR condition and transmit PSD offset. Ultimately, based on the field trial results, we are able to prove the feasibility of the OFDMbased 5G waveform to support mixed numerologies, to provide design insights on waveform enhancement technologies and to make a wise waveform selection in different scenarios for 5G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head><p>In this section, selected sets of measurement results are reported and analyzed. In particular, we focus on the spectrum efficiency in terms of data throughput and the robustness in terms of BLER with the impact of the inter-numerology interference. Performance comparisons of different waveform candidates, i.e., CP-OFDM, W-OFDM and f-OFDM are conducted in various scenarios with a different guard bandwidth, data bandwidth, SNR condition and transmit PSD offset, respectively. A brief summary of field trial setups and parameters is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>. It is worth mentioning that higher layer algorithms and protocols like hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) are not integrated in the field trial. a) Window Size Selection: For W-OFDM, the window sizes used in our field trial reflect recent 3GPP progresses. By considering the trade-off between OOB emission suppression and inter-symbol interference, the transmit window size is agreed by many companies in 3GPP to be 5% of OFDM length, e.g., 52 samples for a length-1024 OFDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. On the receive window size, it is expected to be fixed to avoid exhausting signaling. Considering overall CP overhead no more than LTE, i.e., 6.67% and the aligned frame structures of different numerologies, we have designed a long CP of 80 samples and a short CP of 64 samples for a length-1024 OFDM. For the short CP, reserving 2 samples to combat intersymbol interference, a 10-sample receive window is selected, which is also similar to the size suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</p><p>b) Filter Order Selection: For f-OFDM, RRC windowedsinc filter is used as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and signal burst truncation is applied, as introduced in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. However, the filter order still needs a thorough investigation to minimize the interference from adjacent band. In this trial, orders of 256, 512 and 1024 are studied.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>, we validate the correctness of our testbed by comparing the 19.83 MHz bandwidth baseband and RF signal spectrum of f-OFDM with a different filter order, as well as the spectrum of CP-OFDM and W-OFDM. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> shows that the f-OFDM spectrum of a 1024-ordered filter has the sharpest transition band and almost the same stop-band attenuation as a 256/512-ordered filter, which complies the discussion in previous section II-B2 that a narrower transition band in frequency domain corresponds to a longer filter length in time domain. More specifically, zooming the transition band in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>, at the 10 MHz, the OOB leakage power of a 1024-ordered filter attenuates more than 30 dB compared to the pass-band, which is almost negligible to the neighboring band. Therefore, the remaining results of f-OFDM are based on a 1024-ordered filter.</p><p>In addition, for f-OFDM, signal burst truncation is applied as introduced in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. The pre-tail and post-tail of the filtered signal burst are truncated with a rectangle window and only 65 samples are reserved before being multiplied by a Hanning window. It is worth mentioning that the truncated tails can be absorbed in a guard period (which is at least as long as one OFDM symbol duration according to LTE) without bringing any extra delay and performance loss.</p><p>c) Impact of guard tones and data bandwidth: In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>, we study the impact of guard tones on the data throughput in a high SNR (about 24 dB) condition. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10 (a),</ref><ref type="figure">(b</ref>) and (c), data band occupies RB1, RB2 and spans on both RB1 and RB2, respectively and data is transmitted with adaptive modulation and coding scheme (MCS). The results suggest that f-OFDM archives a higher spectrum efficiency than CP-OFDM and W-OFDM in all scenarios accounting inter-numerology interference. For instance, f-OFDM provides a 39.11% and 28.52% throughput gain over CP-OFDM and W-OFDM respectively in the scenario that data transmitted on RB2 only and 1 guard tone reserved. In addition, f-OFDM provides a 25.25% and 17.22% throughput gain over CP-OFDM and W-OFDM respectively in the scenario that data transmitted on both RB1 and RB2 and 0 guard tone reserved.</p><p>By intuition, without the protection of guard bands, throughput is low when the data band occupies only RB2 since it is close to the interfering subband and suffers severe inter-numerology OOB interference, which is confirmed by the field trial. It can be observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref> (b) that at least 1 guard tone is needed for f-OFDM to guarantee the OOB emission from interfering subband attenuated to a negligible level to data band at RB2. On the other hand, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref> (a) and (c), for f-OFDM, performance degradation is negligible even with 0 guard tone if data band is RB1 or it spans on both RB1 and RB2. d) Robustness: In Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>, we study the robustness of CP-OFDM, W-OFDM and f-OFDM in a high SNR regime, in terms of BLER at a different MCS level according to LTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. More specifically, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref> reports cases that data transmitted on RB2 and Table III reports cases that data band spans on RB1 and RB2. Based on these results, f-OFDM is believed to be more robust than CP-OFDM and W-OFDM. It is confirmed again that for f-OFDM, the internumerology interference is negligible with 1 guard tone if data band occupies 360 KHz on RB2 and with 0 guard tone if data band spans 720 KHz on both RB1 and RB2.  e) Impact of SNR: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> is obtained under a low SNR (about 7 dB) assumption. In this scenario, rather than the OOB emission from interfering subband, noise becomes the major limiting factor. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> shows that a small gain can be obtained by f-OFDM with a 360KHz data band but no obviously consistent gain of filtering or windowing can be found compared to traditional CP-OFDM if the data bandwidth is larger.</p><p>f) Impact of transmit PSD offset: In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">12</ref>, we study data throughput when interfering subband is transmitted at a 3 dB higher transmit PSD than test subband. f-OFDM again outperforms CP-OFDM and W-OFDM and the gain increases     compared to 0 transmit PSD offset in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>. For instance, f-OFDM provides a 56.34% and 38.75% throughput gain over CP-OFDM and W-OFDM respectively in the scenario that data transmitted on RB2 only and 1 guard tone reserved. In addition, f-OFDM provides a 36.94% and 25.2% throughput gain over CP-OFDM and W-OFDM respectively in the scenario that data is transmitted on both RB1 and RB2 and 0 guard tone is reserved. This performance trend indicates that f-OFDM has a better OOB emission control of the interfering subband.</p><p>V. CONCLUSION 5G is coming. As a fundamental component, the underlying 5G waveform is expected to be able to support the coexistence of diverse services. In this paper, we provide details and guidances on the testbed design and implementations for a fast technology verification. In particular, we conduct a filed trial in TDD DL to compare different 3GPP 5G waveform candidates, i.e., CP-OFDM, W-OFDM and f-OFDM in the presence of mixed numerologies. It shows that the largest improvement on spectrum efficiency and robustness can be obtained by filtering on OFDM signals with a well-designed filter. Field trial results also provide insights on the impact of several important system parameters, e.g., guard bandwidth, data bandwidth, SNR, transmit PSD offset. It is shown that the gain of f-OFDM over CP-OFDM and W-OFDM increases with a higher inter-numerology interference caused by the OOB emission. In some specific scenarios, by using f-OFDM, the guard band can be completely removed, thus a full spectrum utilization can be achieved. Based on the field trial results, it is safe to recommend f-OFDM as the 5G waveform in the presence of mixed numerologies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Overall architecture.</figDesc></figure>
