<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Shannon introduced the notion of information theoretic secrecy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> assumed that the transmission is noiseless, and used a key K to protect the confidential message W . Taking the transmission uncertainty into consideration, Wyner introduced the wiretap channel in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the three-terminal wiretap channel, a source wishes to transmit confidential messages to a destination while keeping the messages as secret as possible from a wiretapper. The wiretapper is assumed to have an unlimited computation ability and to know the coding/decoding scheme used in the main (source-destination) channel. Under the assumption that the source-wiretapper channel is a degraded version of the main channel, Wyner characterized the trade-off between the throughput of the main channel and the level of ignorance of the message at the wiretapper using the rate-equivocation region concept. Loosely speaking, the equivocation rate measures the residual ambiguity about the transmitted message at the wiretapper. If the equivocation rate at the wiretapper is arbitrarily close to the information rate, the transmission is called perfectly secure.</p><p>Csiszár and Körner extended this work to the broadcast channel with confidential messages, where the source sends common information to both the destination and the wiretapper, and confidential messages are sent only to the destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Our work here is motivated by the fact that if the wiretapper channel is less noisy than the main channel <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> , the perfect secrecy capacity of the channel is zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In this case, it is infeasible to establish a secure link under Wyner's wiretap channel model. Our main idea is to exploit user cooperation in facilitating the transmission of confidential messages from the source to the destination. More specially, we consider a four-terminal relay-eavesdropper channel, where a source wishes to send messages to a destination while leveraging the help of a relay node to hide those messages from the eavesdropper. The eavesdropper in our model can be viewed as the wireless counterpart of Wyner's wiretapper. This model generalizes the relay channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and the wiretap channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The relay channel without security constraints was studied under various scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In most of these works, cooperation strategies were constructed to increase the transmission rate and/or reliability function. In this paper, we identify a novel role of the relay node in establishing a secure link from the source to the destination. Towards this end, several cooperation strategies for the relay-eavesdropper channel are constructed and the corresponding achieved rateequivocation regions are characterized. An outer-bound on the optimal rate-equivocation region is also derived. The proposed schemes are shown to achieve a positive perfect secrecy rate in several scenarios where the secrecy capacity in the absence of the relay node is zero. Quite interestingly, we establish the deaf-helper phenomenon where the relay can help while being totally ignorant of the transmitted message from the source. Furthermore, we show that the relay node can aid in the transmission of confidential messages in some settings where classical cooperation fails to offer performance gains, e.g., the reversely degraded relay channel. Finally, we observe that the proposed Noise-Forwarding (NF) is intimately related with the multiple access channel with security constraints, as evident in the sequel.</p><p>At this point, we wish to differentiate our investigation from earlier relevant works. The relay channel with confidential messages was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, where the relay node acts both as an eavesdropper and a helper. In the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the source sends common messages to the destination using the help of the relay node, but also sends private messages to the destination while keeping them secret from the relay. In contrast with <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the relay node in our work acts as a trusted "third-party" whose sole goal is to facilitate secure communications (imposing an additional security constraint on the relay node is also considered in Section IV). The idea of using a "third-party" to facilitate secure communications also appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Contrary to our work, which considers noisy channels, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> focused on the generation of common random secret keys at two nodes under the assist of a third-party using a noiseless public discussion channel. The users then use the secret key to establish a secure link between the source-destination pair. Other recent works on secure communications investigated the multiple access channel (MAC) with confidential messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the multiple access channel with a degraded wiretapper <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and MIMO secure communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In summary, it appears that our relay-eavesdropper model is fundamentally different from the models considered in all previous works. Throughout the paper, upper-case letter X denotes a random variable, lower-case letter x denotes a realization of the random variable, calligraphic letter X denotes a finite alphabet set.</p><p>Boldface letter x denotes a vector, {•} T denotes transpose and {•} H denotes conjugate transpose. We also let [x] + = max{0, x}.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we introduce the system model and our notations. Section III describes the proposed cooperation strategies and characterizes the corresponding achievable performance. The rate-equivocation outer-bound is also developed in this section. In Section IV, we discuss several examples that illustrate interesting aspects of the relay-eavesdropper channel. Finally, Section V offers some concluding remarks and briefly outlines possible venues for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE RELAY-EAVESDROPPER CHANNEL</head><p>We consider a four-terminal discrete channel consisting of finite sets X 1 , X 2 , Y, Y 1 , Y 2 and a transition probability distribution p(y, y 1 , y 2 |x 1 , x 2 ), as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>. Here, X 1 , X 2 are the channel inputs from the source and the relay respectively, while Y, Y 1 , Y 2 are the channel outputs at the destination, relay and eavesdropper respectively. We impose the memoryless assumption, i.e., the channel outputs (y i , y 1,i , y 2,i ) at time i only depend on the channel inputs (x 1,i , x 2,i ) at time i. The source wishes to send the message W 1 ∈ W 1 = {1, • • • , M} to the destination using the (M, n) code consisting: 1) a stochastic encoder f n at the source that maps the message w 1 to a codeword x 1 ∈ X n 1 , 2) a relay encoder that maps the signals</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(y 1,1 , y 1,2 , • • • , y 1,i-1</formula><p>) received before time i to the channel input x 2,i , using the mapping</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ϕ i : (Y 1,1 , Y 1,2 , • • • , Y 1,i-1 ) → X 2,i , 3) a decoding function φ: Y n → W 1 .</formula><p>The average error probability of a (M, n) code is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P n e = w 1 ∈W 1 1 M Pr{φ(y) = w 1 |w 1 was sent}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MAIN RESULTS</head><p>Our first result establishes an outer-bound on the optimal rate-equivocation region of the relay-eavesdropper channel.</p><p>Theorem 1: In the relay eavesdropper channel, for any rate-equivocation pair {R 1 , R e } with</p><p>P n e → 0 and the equivocation rate at the eavesdropper larger than R eǫ, there exist some random variables</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">U → (V 1 , V 2 ) → (X 1 , X 2 ) → (Y, Y 1 , Y 2 ), such that (R 1 , R e ) satisfies the following conditions R 1 ≤ min{I(V 1 , V 2 ; Y ), I(V 1 ; Y, Y 1 |V 2 )}, R e ≤ R 1 , R e ≤ [I(V 1 , V 2 ; Y |U) -I(V 1 , V 2 ; Y 2 |U)] + . (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>Proof: Please refer to Appendix I.</p><p>We now turn our attention to constructing cooperation strategies for the relay-eavesdropper channel. Our first step is to characterize the achievable rate-equivocation region of Cover-El Gamal Decode and Forward (DF) Strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In DF cooperation strategy, the relay node will first decode codewords and then re-encode the message to cooperate with the source. Here, we use the regular coding and backward decoding scheme developed in the classical relay setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, with the important difference that each message will be associated with many codewords in order to confuse the eavesdropper.</p><p>Theorem 2: The rate pairs in the closure of the convex hull of all (R 1 , R e ) satisfying</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R 1 &lt; min{I(V 1 , V 2 ; Y ), I(V 1 ; Y 1 |V 2 )}, R e &lt; R 1 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">R e &lt; [min{I(V 1 , V 2 ; Y ), I(V 1 ; Y 1 |V 2 )} -I(V 1 , V 2 ; Y 2 )] + , for some distribution p(v 1 , v 2 , x 1 , x 2 , y 1 , y 2 , y) = p(v 1 , v 2 )p(x 1 , x 2 |v 1 , v 2 )p(y 1 , y 2 , y|x 1 , x 2</formula><p>), are achievable using the DF strategy.</p><p>Hence, for the DF scheme, the following perfect secrecy rate is achievable</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R (DF ) s = sup p(v 1 ,v 2 ) [min{I(V 1 , V 2 ; Y ), I(V 1 ; Y 1 |V 2 )} -I(V 1 , V 2 ; Y 2 )] + . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Proof: Please refer to Appendix II.</p><p>The channel between the source and the relay becomes a bottleneck for the DF strategy when it is noisier than the source-destination channel. This motivates our Noise-Forwarding (NF) scheme, where the relay node does not attempt to decode the message but sends codewords that are independent of the source's message. The enabling observation behind this scheme is that, in the wiretap channel, in addition to its own information, the source should send extra codewords to confuse the wiretapper. In our setting, this task can be accomplished by the relay by allowing it to send independent codewords, which aid in confusing the eavesdropper. </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">) | ; ( 2 1 X Y X I ) | ; ( 2 2 1 X Y X I &lt; ) | ; ( 2 1 X Y X I ) | ; ( 2 2 1 X Y X I &gt; Fig. 2:</formula><p>The rate region of the compound MACs of the relay eavesdropper channel for a fixed input distribution p(x 1 )p(x 2 ).</p><p>Our NF scheme transforms the relay-eavesdropper channel into a compound multiple access channel (MAC), where the source/relay to the receiver is the first MAC and source/relay to the eavesdropper is the second one. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the rate region of these two MACs for a fixed input distribution p(x 1 )p(x 2 ). In the figure, R 1 is the codeword rate of the source, and R 2 is the codeword rate of the relay. We can observe from Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) that if the relay node does not transmit, the perfect secrecy rate is zero for this input distribution since R 1 (A) &lt; R 1 (C). On the other hand, if the relay and the source coordinate their transmissions and operate at point B, we can achieve the equivocation rate R e , which is strictly larger than zero. On the other hand, in Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>), we can still get a positive perfect secrecy rate by operating at point A in the absence of the relay. But by moving the operating point to B, we can get a larger secrecy rate. This illustrates the main idea of our Noise-Forwarding scheme. The next result establishes the achievable rate-equivocation region for the NF scheme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">December 8, 2006</ref> DRAFT Theorem 3: The rate pairs in the closure of the convex hull of all (R 1 , R e ) satisfying</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">R 1 &lt; I(V 1 ; Y |V 2 ), R e &lt; R 1 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">R e &lt; [I(V 1 ; Y |V 2 ) + min{I(V 2 ; Y ), I(V 2 ; Y 2 |V 1 )} -min{I(V 2 ; Y ), I(V 2 ; Y 2 )} -I(V 1 ; Y 2 |V 2 )] + , for some distribution p(v 1 , v 2 , x 1 , x 2 , y 1 , y 2 , y) = p(v 1 )p(v 2 )p(x 1 |v 1 )p(x 2 |v 2 )p(y 1 , y 2 , y|x 1 , x 2 ),</formula><p>are achievable using the NF scheme.</p><p>Hence, for the NF scheme, the achievable perfect secrecy rate is</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">R (N F ) s = sup p(v 1 )p(v 2 ) [I(V 1 ; Y |V 2 ) + min{I(V 2 ; Y ), I(V 2 ; Y 2 |V 1 )} -min{I(V 2 ; Y ), I(V 2 ; Y 2 )} -I(V 1 ; Y 2 |V 2 )] + . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>Proof: Please refer to Appendix III.</p><p>The following comments are now in order.</p><p>1) The NF scheme is customized to the relay channel with security constraints which make the transmission of codewords that are independent of the source message reasonable.</p><p>Also, in the NF scheme, the relay node does not need to listen to the source, and hence, this scheme is more suited works for relay nodes limited by the half-duplex constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>2) In NF cooperation, each user sends independent messages to the destination, which resembles the MAC. Hence, NF cooperation can be adapted to the multiple access eavesdropper channel where the multiple users in the MAC channel can help each other in communicating securely with the destination without listening to each other (note that the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> were limited only to the case where the eavesdropped channel is a degraded version of the channel seen by the destination). Our related results will be reported elsewhere.</p><p>Now, we study another cooperation scheme that does not require decoding at the relay:</p><p>Compress and Forward (CF). The CF cooperation strategy can be viewed as a generalization of NF where, in addition to the independent codewords, the relay also sends a quantized version of its noisy observations to the destination. This noisy version of the relay's observations helps the destination in decoding the source's message, while the independent codewords help in confusing the eavesdropper. The following result establishes the achievable rate-equivocation pair in the </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">(R 1 , R e ) satisfying R 1 &lt; I(X 1 ; Ŷ1 , Y |X 2 ), R e &lt; R 1 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">R e &lt; R 0 + I(X 1 ; Ŷ1 , Y |X 2 ) -I(X 1 , X 2 ; Y 2 ) + , subject to min{I(X 2 ; Y ), I(X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 )} -R 0 ≥ I(Y 1 ; Ŷ1 |X 2 ),<label>(12)</label></formula><p>for some distribution p(</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">x 1 , x 2 , y 1 , y 2 , y, ŷ1 ) = p(x 1 )p(x 2 )p(y 1 , y 2 , y|x 1 , x 2 )p(ŷ 1 |y 1 , x 2 )</formula><p>, are achievable using CF strategy.</p><p>Proof: Please refer to Appendix IV.</p><p>Three comments are now in order.</p><p>1) In Theorem 4, R 0 is the rate of pure noise generated by the relay to confuse the eavesdropper, while min{I(X 2 ; Y ), I(X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 )} -R 0 is the part of the rate allocated to send the compressed signal Ŷ1 to help the destination. If we set R 0 = min{I(X 2 ; Y ), I(X 2 ; Y 2 |X 1 )}, this scheme becomes the NF scheme.</p><p>2) In order to enable analytical tractability, the coding/decoding scheme used in the proof is slightly different from that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the destination uses sliding-window decoding, while our proof uses backward decoding. Hence, the bound for R e provided here is a lower-bound for the R e achieved by the CF scheme. One may be able to achieve a larger R e using exactly the CF scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. But, unfortunately, we are not yet able to bound R e when sliding-window decoding is used.</p><p>3) Compared with CF decoding, the proposed NF strategy enjoys the advantage of simplicity.</p><p>Also, if one only focuses on the perfect secrecy rate, it is easy to see that these two schemes achieve identical performance. Again, this observation is limited to our lower bound on R e in Theorem 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXAMPLES</head><p>This section discusses several examples that illustrate some unique features of the relayeavesdropper channel. For simplicity, we only focus on the perfect secrecy rate of various schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Deaf Helper Phenomenon</head><p>The security constraints imposed on the network bring about a new phenomenon which we call the deaf helper phenomenon, where the relay node can still help even it is totally ignorant of the message transmitted from the source. In this setup, we impose an additional security constraint on the relay node, and say a rate R s is achievable for a deaf helper if for any ǫ &gt; 0, there exists a sequence of codes (M, n) such that for any n ≥ n(ǫ), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">R s = 1 n log 2 M, P n e ≤ ǫ, 1 n H(W 1 |Y 2 ) ≥ R s -ǫ, 1 n H(W 1 |Y 1 , X 2 ) ≥ R s -ǫ.<label>(13)</label></formula><p>In this case, the signal received by the relay node does not leak any information about the transmitted message W 1 . This model describes a more conservative scenario where the source does not trust the relay but still wishes to exploit the benefit brought by cooperation. We assume that the relay node is not malicious and, hence, is willing to cooperate with the source <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">2</ref> . The following theorem characterizes the achievable perfect secrecy rate of the NF strategy in the deaf-helper setting.</p><p>Theorem 5: The perfect secrecy rate of the NF scheme with an additional security constraint on the relay node is R s = max</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">p(v 1 )p(v 2 )</formula><p>min{R s1 , R s2 }, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">R s1 = I(V 1 ; Y |V 2 ) + min{I(V 2 ; Y ), I(V 2 ; Y 2 |V 1 )} -min{I(V 2 ; Y ), I(V 2 ; Y 2 )} -I(V 1 ; Y 2 |V 2 ) + , R s2 = [I(V 1 ; Y |V 2 ) -I(V 1 ; Y 1 |X 2 )] + .</formula><p>Proof: Please refer to Appendix V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Reversely Degraded Relay-Eavesdropper Channel</head><p>In the classical relay channel without security constraints, there exist some scenarios where the relay node does not provide any gain, for example, the reversely degraded relay channel</p><p>shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Here, we focus on this scenario and show that the relay node can still offer a gain in the presence of the eavesdropper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 ( [4]):</head><p>The relay channel is called reversely degraded, if p(y, y</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">1 |x 1 , x 2 ) = p(y|x 1 , x 2 ) p(y 1 |y, x 2 ).</formula><p>The following result, borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, states the capacity of the classical reversely degraded relay channel.</p><p>Theorem 6 (Theorem 2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>): The capacity of the reversely degraded relay channel is</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">C 0 = max x 2 max p(x 1 ) I(X 1 ; Y |x 2 ).<label>(14)</label></formula><p>This result implies that the relay node should send a constant, and hence, does not contribute new information to the destination. In most channel models, the constant sent by the relay does not result in any capacity gain. The question now is whether the same conclusion holds in the presence of an eavesdropper. We first observe that the degradedness of the relay channel implies that DF and CF cooperation will not provide the destination with additional useful information.</p><p>The relay node, however, can still send codewords independent of the received signal to confuse the eavesdropper, as proposed in the NF scheme. Since we do not require decoding at the relay node in the proof of Theorem 3, the degradedness imposed here does not affect the performance.</p><p>Hence, we get the following achievable perfect secrecy rate for the reversely degraded relayeavesdropper channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corollary 1:</head><p>The achievable perfect secrecy rate of the reversely degraded relay eavesdropper channel is</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">R s = max p(v 1 )p(v 2 ) I(V 1 ; Y |V 2 ) + min{I(V 2 ; Y ), I(V 2 ; Y 2 |V 1 )} -min{I(V 2 ; Y ), I(V 2 ; Y 2 )} -I(V 1 ; Y 2 |V 2 ) + .<label>(15)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The AWGN Channel</head><p>Now we consider the Gaussian relay-eavesdropper channel, where the signal received at each node is</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">y j [n] = i =j h ij x i [n] + z j [n],</formula><p>here h ij is the channel coefficient between node i ∈ {s, r} and node j ∈ {r, w, d}, and z j is the i.i.d Gaussian noise with unit variance at node j.

This result is also shown to be valid for stochastically degraded channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In our case, if the relay does not transmit, the relay eavesdropper channel becomes a Gaussian eavesdropper channel, which can always be converted into a stochastically degraded channel as done in the Gaussian broadcast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Applying this result to our case, the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian eavesdropper channel without the relay node is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">1 2 log 2 (1 + |h sd | 2 P 1 ) -1 2 log 2 (1 + |h sw | 2 P 1 ) + .

On the other hand, as shown later, the relay can facilitate the source-destination pair to achieve a positive perfect secrecy rate under some conditions even when |h sw | 2 ≥ |h sd | 2 .

In the second model, we assume that each channel experiences an independent phase fading, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">h ij = d -γ ij e jθ ij</formula><p>, where θ ij is uniformly distributed over [0, 2π). We believe that the second model is more practically relevant than the real channel scenario. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the achievable perfect secrecy rate of the proposed schemes for the first channel model. In generating this figure, we use the network topology shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, where we put the source at (0, 0), the destination at (1, 0), the eavesdropper at (0, 1), and the relay node at (x, 0). We let P 1 = 1, P 2 = 8. Since d sd = d sw , the perfect secrecy capacity of the eavesdropper channel without the relay node is zero. But, as shown in the figure, we can achieve a positive secrecy rate by introducing a relay node. In computing the upper-bound, we set V 1 ∼ N (0, P 1 ), V 2 ∼ N (0, P 2 ) with a correlation coefficient ρ, and maximize over ρ ∈ [-1, 1].</p><p>Notice that the Gaussian input is not necessarily optimal for the upper-bound. We can see that, when the relay is near the source, the DF scheme touches the Gaussian upper-bound. Also, when x &gt; 1, it is clear that DF cooperation does not offer any gain, while NF and AF still offer positive rates. Notice that when x &gt; 1, both d sr ,d sd are larger than d sw . The interesting observation here is that though both the destination and relay are in disadvantage positions compared with the eavesdropper, they can cooperate with each other and gain some advantage over the eavesdropper. If the relay is at 0, our model is equivalent to the case where the source has two antennas. Notice that the upper-bound of the perfect secrecy capacity is zero under this scenario. Hence, increasing the number of transmitting antenna at the source does not increase the secrecy capacity under the real channel model. On the other hand, if there is a relay node at an appropriate position, we can exploit this relay node to establish a secure source-destination link.</p><p>In the second scenario, we assume that before transmission, the source knows the phases θ sr , θ sd , θ rd , but does not know θ sw , θ rw . The random phase will not affect the achievable perfect secrecy rate of NF since it does not depend on beam-forming between the source and relay. But, the rates of DF and AF are different here. In both cases, the source can adjust its phase according to the knowledge of the phase information about θ sr , θ sd , θ rd . In this way, the signals of the source and the relay will add up coherently at the destination, but not at the eavesdropper since θ sw , θ rw are independent of θ sd , θ rd , θ sr . The secrecy rate of DF and AF could then be obtained by averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> over the random phases. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the achievable perfect secrecy rates of the proposed strategies for the same setup as the first scenario. Due to the random phases, the achievable perfect secrecy capacity when the relay is at the same position as the source is not zero anymore. In this case, it will be beneficial to have multiple transmitting antennas at the source. Similar to the first scenario, when x &gt; 1, DF cooperation does not offer any benefit. But both NF and AF still enjoy non-zero secrecy rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, the relay-eavesdropper channel was studied. In particular, several cooperation strategies were proposed and the corresponding achievable performance bounds were obtained.</p><p>Furthermore, an outer-bound on the optimal rate-equivocation region for this channel was developed. Of particular interest is the proposed NF strategy which was used to illustrate the deafhelper phenomenon, and to demonstrate the utility of the relay node in the reversely degraded relay-eavesdropper channel. Overall, our results establish the critical role of user cooperation in facilitating secure wireless communications and shed light on the unique feature of the relayeavesdropper channel.</p><p>Among the many open problems posed by our work, how to close the gap between the achievable performance and the outer-bound is arguably the most important one. This problem is expected to be challenging since the capacity of the classical relay channel remains unknown.</p><p>The investigation of the role of feedback in the relay-eavesdropper channel is another interesting problem. In the relay channel without security constraints, noiseless/noisy feedback was shown to be beneficial. On the other hand, in the presence of an eavesdropper, the role and optimal mechanism of feedback is not yet known, since the eavesdropper could also benefit from the feedback signal. Finally, extending our work to a large scale network is expected to be of practical significance.</p></div>
