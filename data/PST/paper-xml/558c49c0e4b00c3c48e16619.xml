<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has emerged as a promising solution to the operation and bandwidth challenges faced by future mobile communication infrastructures, which are required to handle an exponentially increasing demand for data traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A C-RAN utilizes centralized signal processing in the baseband unit (BBU) pool instead of processing at distributed base stations (BSs), which can result in significant capital and operating expenditure savings. Centralized processing at the BBU pool also allows cooperation between multiple remote radio heads (RRHs), thus improving spectrum efficiency and link reliability. Furthermore, the use of cloud computing technologies as the infrastructure of the BBU pool greatly improves hardware utilization.</p><p>Decoupling the baseband signal processing from the RRHs is the most attractive feature of C-RAN, which means that RRHs only need to keep the basic transmission and reception functionalities, while computationally intensive tasks can be migrated to the BBU pool in a cloud data center. This centralized signal processing and scheduling feature in the BBU pool further makes a variety of prospective technologies feasible, including centralized encoding and decoding, centralized compression and decompression, and joint beamforming.</p><p>Although C-RAN makes it possible to transition conventional cellular networks (CCNs) from hardware defined infrastructures to a software defined environment, many design and operational challenges that have been resolved in CCNs need to be revisited in C-RAN. One particular example of importance is the resource allocation problem. Specifically, in CCNs, power control and beamforming strategies have been used to minimize the system power consumption such that users' predefined quality-of-service (QoS) requirements are fulfilled. Unfortunately, these strategies cannot plug directly into the C-RAN framework. In CCNs, the BSs' computation capacity is fixed. As a result, resource allocation methods in CCNs are oblivious to the computation capacities of the BSs although users' achievable QoS levels are actually dependent on them. Under the C-RAN architecture, the computational functionalities in conventional BSs are migrated to the cloud based virtual machines (VMs) in the BBU pool, whose computation capacity can be scaled according to users' QoS requirements and various parameters from different layers of the OSI stack, including the incoming traffic rate from the application layer and wireless channel state information from the physical layer. Therefore, developing a cross-layer resource allocation scheme is required in order to fully utilize the features of a C-RAN, and to optimize the overall system power consumption.</p><p>Most of the power in a C-RAN are consumed in the following subsytems:</p><p>• BBU pool. Having a cloud data center as the BBU pool not only allows centralized signal processing, but also elastic service scaling of the resources of the BBU pool. Specifically, the BBU pool can dynamically adjust each VM capacity to optimize power consumption for changing traffic and channel states. An important research challenge is to design low-complexity algorithms for dynamic service scaling in the BBU pool. • Fiber links. Each RRH is connected to the BBU pool via a high-bandwidth, low-latency fiber link. The power consumption in the fronthaul links has traditionally been ignored in the CCN literature since it is relatively much lower than the power consumption in the BSs of the CCN. However, in C-RAN, the power consumption in fronthaul links is comparable to the power consumption at the RRHs since the RRHs are architecturally much simpler compared to conventional BSs. By turning off some redundant fiber links, as well as the RRH connected to these fiber links, energy savings can be achieved. This motivates the link or RRH selection problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BBU pool RRHs Fiber links</head><p>• RRHs. In C-RAN, the functionality of RRHs can be as simple as just a signal transmission and reception point.</p><p>The RRHs can cooperate with each other to perform centralized joint beamforming to mitigate interference. Thus, the throughput of the wireless channels to the users can be significantly enhanced. An important research issue here is the design of the joint beamforming at the RRHs in order to achieve an optimal trade-off in channel throughput and energy efficiency. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing the allocated VM computation capacities in the BBU pool, the set of selected RRHs, and the beamforming strategies at the active RRHs in order to minimize the overall system power consumption for C-RAN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Related work</head><p>C-RAN aims to be a competitive and potential 5G framework, which has been attracting comprehensive research attention from both industry and academia since 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Many prototypes, test-beds and architecture designs have been done to show the feasibility and performance gain by adopting C-RAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The concept of RAN as a service (RANaaS) has also been developed based on the structure of C-RAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In the fronthaul of C-RAN, i.e., the RRHs and the wireless channel, Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) techniques are deployed to enhance the system throughput. In order to enhance energy efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, cell, BS or RRH selection for the fronthaul has been comprehensively studied over the past several years <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For example, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> jointly consider the base station selection problem and linear precoding. Fronthaul link or RRH selection for C-RAN have been studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> considers joint BS selection and distributed compression in C-RAN to improve energy efficiency, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> considers RRH selection jointly with fronthaul beamforming to minimize the system power consumption.</p><p>The joint RRH selection and beamforming problem is NPhard <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, therefore to solve it exactly is computationally intractable when the number of RRHs is large. We summarize some commonly used approaches here. In the first approach, the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), and then solved by Branch and Bound (BnB) or Branch and Cut (BnC) methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Both the BnB and BnC methods yield the optimal solution, but have high time complexity. Another approach is the "sorting-andremoving" method <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, in which the RRHs are ranked according to some priority criteria in each iteration, and the RRH with the lowest priority is removed. The process continues until the problem becomes infeasible. This method can produce a near-optimal solution, but still has high computational complexity. The "sparsity-inducing" method is inspired by compressive sensing. Reweighted l 1 -norm relaxation and sparsity-inducing norms are used to obtain a sparse subset of RRHs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This method is efficient in computational complexity but cannot guarantee optimality. Finally, constructing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a potential way to solve the RRH selection problem as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In this work, we propose a "Shaping-and-Pruning" method, which is a trade-off between the sorting-and-removing and sparsity-inducing methods, in order to obtain a near-optimal performance with lower computational complexity.</p><p>The BBU pool of C-RAN comprises many general purpose processors (GPP), which forms a cloud computing infrastructure using virtualization technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. A computationally aware strategy is proposed to reduce the computational outage in C-RAN recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, most of the previous works related to the C-RAN BBU pool just makes use of the centralized processing property offered by cloud computing to optimize the system. For example, a central encoder is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> to jointly encode the messages intended for the mobile stations, and a cloud decoder in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> utilizes the joint statistics of the received correlated signals to decompress the received signal. Theses works do not consider the issue of elastic service scaling and resource allocation the BBU pool, which is one of the focus of this paper. In addition, unlike most of the works in the literature, which investigate methods to provide QoS guarantees for specific layers in the OSI stack (e.g., ensuring bandwidth or latency requirements are met only in the wireless transmission part), we consider methods to ensure cross-layer QoS guarantees in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Main contributions</head><p>In this paper, we formulate the cross-layer resource allocation problem as a MINLP by minimizing the system power consumption, which consists of three parts: the power consumption in the BBU pool with respect to (w.r.t.) the VM computation capacity, the power consumption in the fiber fronthaul links w.r.t. the number of links (or, active RRHs) and the transmission power on the RRHs w.r.t. the transmit beamformer. We relax the MINLP into an extended sum-utility maximization (ESUM) problem, and propose two different approximate solution approaches. In the first approach, we approximate the ESUM problem as a quasi weighted sumrate maximization (QWSRM) problem, and propose a BnB algorithm to solve it. The QWSRM problem is an extension of the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem, which has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In the second approach, we utilize the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method to obtain a locally optimal solution to the ESUM problem. Based on the achievable rates found by either solving the QWSRM problem or using the WMMSE approach, we propose an efficient Shaping-and-Pruning algorithm to perform RRH selection. Our proposed algorithm achieves a trade-off between computational complexity and solution optimality. We provide simulation results that suggest that our proposed approach outperforms the recently proposed greedy selection algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and successive selection algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> in terms of overall system power consumption, since these methods only optimize the RRH selection and RRH beamforming strategies. This shows that cross-layer optimization can result in higher energy efficiencies for a C-RAN.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present the C-RAN system model in Section II, and introduce the QWSRM problem and its solution in Section III. In Section IV, we formulate the minimization of system power consumption as a MINLP, approximate this MINLP problem as a QWSRM problem, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve it. We present simulation results in Section V, and conclude the paper in Section VI.</p><p>Notations. We use boldface lower case letters to denote vectors. The notation x 2 is the Euclidean norm of x, while (•) T and (•) H represent transpose and conjugate transpose, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>In this section, we present our C-RAN system model and problem formulation. Suppose that there are N single-antenna user equipments (UEs) and L available RRHs, each with K antennas, in a C-RAN cluster. We denote the sets of all UEs and all RRHs as N = {1, • • • , N } and L = {1, • • • , L}, respectively. We denote the set of active RRHs (i.e., the set of RRHs that are servicing the UEs in N , and their associated fiber links) as A. We have A ⊆ L. The amount of voice and data traffic associated with each UE i ∈ N up to time t is given by ∆ i (t) (bits), and each UE i is served by one VM with computation capacity µ i in the BBU pool. After processing by the VM, the data is forwarded to the UE via |A| active RRHs (we assume data sharing among the RRHs), where |A| ≤ L is the cardinality of the set A. Let the achievable wireless transmission rate to UE i using the active RRHs be c i .</p><p>Queueing model, with the channel capacity as the queue's service rate, is widely used to characterize wireless communication systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Therefore, we introduce a double-layer queueing network to represent each UE's data processing and transmitting behavior in the C-RAN downlink (cf. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Our model can be easily extended to the C-RAN uplink as well. Specifically, in the BBU pool, the data of UE i is processed (e.g., encoded) by a VM, which is abstracted as a processing queue, with mean service rate µ i . Then, the processed data is transmitted to UE i via the RRHs, which are modeled using a transmitting queue with mean service rate c i . Note that the links between the BBU pool and the RRHs are high-bandwidth, low-latency optical fiber links with negligible transmission delay. However, the power consumption P f of each fiber link cannot be neglected, compared with the power consumption in the associated RRH.</p><p>For each UE i ∈ N , let a i represent the expected delay in the processing queue (i.e., the expected delay in the BBU pool) and b i be the expected delay in the transmitting queue (i.e., the expected delay during wireless transmission). Our goal is to design a cross-layer algorithm such that for each UE i, the system expected delay d i = a i + b i satisfies the cross-layer QoS constraint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d i ≤ τ i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where τ i is a predefined QoS requirement for UE i.</p><p>We assume that UE i's packet arrival process to the processing queue is a Poisson process with mean rate λ i &gt; 0, where ∆ i (t) = λ i t, and the service time of each data packet in the processing queue follows an exponential distribution with mean 1/µ i . Then, the arrival process to the transmitting queue is the same as the one to the processing queue <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. We assume that the service time of each data packet in the transmitting queue follows an exponential distribution with mean 1/c i . Therefore, the data processing and transmitting for each UE i in our C-RAN model can be treated as two M/M/1 queues <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> in tandem. We have for µ i , c i &gt; λ i ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d i = 1 µ i -λ i + 1 c i -λ i .</formula><p>In the wireless transmission, C-RAN leverages CoMP transmission to enhance the throughput <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. There are two types of CoMP techniques in the downlink: coordinated scheduling/coordinated beamforming (CS/CB) and joint transmission (JT). In this work, we consider JT as the CoMP technique in C-RAN, i.e., each UE's data can be shared among all the coordinated RRHs. Let x i denote the data symbol for the ith</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">UE with E[|x i | 2 ] = 1, and w ij ∈ C K denote the transmit beamformer for the UE i from RRH j.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem formulation</head><p>The BBU pool of C-RAN utilizes a cloud computing infrastructure with elastic service scaling. In particular, the BBU pool can dynamically adjust the VMs' computation capacities to handle dynamic user traffic and channel states. We model VM i's power consumption ϕ i (µ i ) as a function of its computation capacity µ i . We make the following assumptions regarding the VM's power consumption function ϕ i .</p><p>Assumption 1: For each VM i, i ∈ N , the power consumption function ϕ i (µ i ) has the following properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1) ϕ i (µ i ) ≥ 0 for all µ i ≥ 0, 2) ϕ i (µ i ) is a convex and increasing function of µ i .</formula><p>The power consumption of a VM i is often modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ϕ i (µ i ) = k i µ ai i ,</formula><p>where k i &gt; 0 and a i &gt; 1 are positive constants. This power consumption function satisfies Assumption 1, and has been widely adopted in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Our aim is to minimize the system power consumption in C-RAN, which consists of three components: the power consumption in the BBU pool, the power consumption in the fiber links, and the power consumption at the RRHs. Specifically, (i) the power consumption for each VM in the BBU pool with computation capacity µ i is ϕ i (µ i ), ∀i ∈ N ; (ii) the power consumption for each active fiber link is P f ; and (iii) the power consumption at RRH j ∈ A is (1/η) N i=1 w H ij w ij , where η ∈ (0, 1) is the inefficiency coefficient of the amplifier in each RRH.

However, by first relaxing (P0) into a ESUM problem, and then into a QWSRM problem, we obtain a BnB solution. In the following section, we first discuss the QWSRM problem and its BnB solution.</p></div>

However, the WMMSE approach cannot always find the global optimal solution. Subsequently, a BnB method is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which shows that this method can produce the global optimal solution. The proposed BnB method uses the fact that the objective function in WSRM problem is monotonically non-increasing in the achievable rates c i ≥ 0 , for all i ∈ N . In what follows, we first give a brief overview of the BnB algorithm from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and then show how to extend it to solve the QWSRM problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>The BnB approach is widely used in nonconvex optimization problems, e.g., the integer programming problems. For each iteration step of the BnB algorithm, one needs to generate a sequence of asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds for the objective function, with both bounds converging to the global optimal value eventually. The basic idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> of using the BnB algorithm to solve the WSRM problem is to first expand the unknown feasible region of the WSRM problem to a known initial N -dimensional rectangle, and then sequentially shrink the rectangle until it is small enough, where at each iteration, the variables c are fixed, and a feasibility problem w.r.t. to the variables {w ij : i ∈ N , j ∈ A} is solved. This avoids having to solve the nonconvex WSRM problem w.r.t. {c i , w ij } directly.</p><p>Inspired by the BnB algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, we develop a similar BnB procedure in Algorithm 1 for the QWSRM problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. We use Q init given in Theorem 1 as the initial N -dimensional rectangle. We shrink the N -dimensional rectangle by making use of the following upper bound</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">γ ub (Q) = f (c min ), c min ∈ F + ∞, otherwise<label>(15)</label></formula><p>and lower bound<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_25">γ lb (Q) = f (c max ), c min ∈ F + ∞, otherwise,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>for every</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">N -dimensional rectangle Q {c | c i,min ≤ c i ≤ c i,max , ∀i ∈ N } ⊆ Q init ,</formula><p>where c i,min and c i,max denotes the end points of the ith edge of Q,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">c min = [c 1,min , • • • , c N,min ] T and c max = [c 1,max , • • • , c N,max ] T .</formula><p>Note that c max need not be in the feasible region F .

The rationale of using the BnB algorithm to solve the QWSRM problem is the same as that for the WSRM problem, i.e., we sequentially shrink the given N -dimensional rectangle Q init , where the optimal solution falls in, until the the lower and upper bounds satisfy u kl k ≤ ǫ, where ǫ &gt; 0 is a predefined accuracy level. The following result shows that Algorithm 1 converges to the optimal solution of the QWSRM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The effect of shaping</head><p>In this subsection, we show the performance of the proposed SP algorithm for the RRH selection problem, compared with the following benchmark algorithms:</p><p>• Exhaustive Search (ES) Algorithm. This algorithm solves the RRH selection problem (28) using an exhaustive search over all possible RRH selections to obtain the optimal solution for problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. It has a high complexity of O((N LK) 3.5 2 L ), which makes the algorithm intractable when L becomes large. This is used as a benchmark to compare other algorithms against. • Bisection Search (BS) Algorithm. This algorithm, which was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, skips the shaping step in the SP algorithm, and uses βj in place of βj for all j ∈ L in the pruning step of the SP algorithm. We use this algorithm as a benchmark to show the effect of the shaping step in the SP algorithm. The complexity of the BS algorithm is O((N LK) 3.5 log L). • Full Cooperation (FC) Algorithm. This algorithm assumes all the RRHs are chosen to be active, i.e., A * = L. The complexity of the FC algorithm is O((N LK) 3.5 ). • Successive Selection (SS) Algorithm. This algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and lets all RRHs to be active in the initial iteration, with a RRH having the least power consumption removed at each subsequent iteration.   The iterations are performed until the problem (28) becomes infeasible. The complexity of the SS algorithm is O((N LK)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>.5 L).</p><p>• Greedy Selection (GS) Algorithm. This algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It considers all RRHs to be active in the initial iteration, and then removes the RRH that reduces the system power consumption by the largest amount at each iteration until the problem (28) becomes infeasible. Simulation results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> suggest that this algorithm produces a near-optimal solution, compared with the global solution obtained by solving a MINLP. The complexity of the GS algorithm is O((N LK) 3.5 L 2 ).</p><p>To compare the performance of all the RRH selection algorithms, we suppose the optimal achievable rate c * i for each UE i is identical in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5</ref>(a), we show the mean number of active RRHs versus each UE's optimal achievable rate c under different RRH selection algorithms when the number of UEs N = 6. We see that the SP algorithm outperforms the FC, SS and BS algorithms over all mean arrival rates. When c ≤ 17 Mb/s, the SP algorithm has comparable or even better sparsity performance than the GS algorithm. When c ≥ 17 Mb/s, compared to the SP algorithm, the GS algorithm produces a solution with about 5% less active RRHs, but at the expense of L 2 / log L = 17.5 times computational complexity overhead.</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">, i.e., c * 1 = • • • = c * N = c. In Figure</formula><p>Next, we let c = 20 Mb/s, and show the mean number of active RRHs versus the number of UEs N under different RRH selection algorithms in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5</ref>(b). We see from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5</ref>(b) that the SP algorithm has similar sparsity performance as the GS algorithm, and outperforms the FC, SS and BS algorithms. From both Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5(a</ref>) and 5(b), we can see that although we incur an overhead to perform the shaping step in the SP algorithm, its solution sparsity is improved by 5% -10%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The importance of cross-layer design</head><p>In this subsection, we present simulation results to verify the performance gain using a cross-layer design in which the both the BBU pool power consumption and the RRH power consumption are jointly optimized. Most of the previous work in C-RAN optimizes the power consumption for the wireless transmission layer and BBU pool independently, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We call this class of algorithms the decoupledlayer (DL) algorithms. We assume that, for the DL algorithms, the delay in the BBU processing queue a i and the delay in the RRH transmitting queue b i satisfy a i ≤ τ i /2 and b i ≤ τ i /2 respectively. We formulate optimization programs, similar to problem (P0), for finding optimal UE achievable rates, VM computation capacities, beamformer vectors, and active RRH set separately. The RRH selection problem can then be solved using either the SS or GS algorithms. We call these the DLSS and DLGS method respectively.</p><p>In this paper, we have provided a general framework that allows us to perform cross-layer (CL) optimization of the overall system power consumption. Our two-step approach (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>) allows us to first solve a QWSRM using Algorithm 1 and then a RRH selection problem. For the RRH selection problem, we can again adopt the ES, BS, and FC algorithms. We call these the CLES, CLBS, and CLFC methods respectively 3 . We let UEs' mean arrival rates to be identical, i.e., λ 1 = • • • = λ N = λ.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>, we show the relationship between the UEs' mean arrival rate and the system power consumption for N = 6 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>(a). We observe that, firstly, CL algorithms outperform the DL algorithms, especially in high traffic rate regime. Secondly, CLSP1 outperforms CLSP2. Finally, as the incoming traffic rate increases, the performance gap between CLFC and CLSP1 (CLSP2) becomes smaller since CLSP1 (CLSP2) needs more active RRHs to support the higher rate demand. The performance of system power consumption versus the number of UEs is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>(b) when λ = 20 Mb/s. We see again that CL algorithms are better than DL algorithms. CLSP1 and CLSP2 also outperforms CLBS, which again shows the importance of the shaping step in the SP algorithm.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have investigated the problem of minimizing the overall system power consumption (including the power consumption in the BBU pool, the fiber links and the RRHs) in a C-RAN, such that the cross-layer QoS and per-RRH power constraints are satisfied. We formulated a MINLP and then relax it to an ESUM problem, which gives the optimal achievable rate for each UE. Based on the optimal achievable rate, we proposed an efficient SP algorithm, with lower computational complexity than several state-of-the-art RRH selection methods, to recover a sparse solution for the RRH selection problem. Simulation results suggest that our proposed SP algorithm outperforms various other methods, and the proposed cross-layer algorithm is more energy efficient than existing decoupled-layer methods.</p><p>C-RAN provides a centralized BBU pool, instead of the distributed BSs, to improve resource utilization, and enable the use of centralized processing like joint beamforming. However, there are two main side effects. The first is the large channel state information (CSI) overhead, and the second is the high amount of data transfer in the fronthaul, whose capacity is limited in practice. As the number of RRHs and UEs in C-RANs becomes large, our proposed algorithms may be restricted by the large CSI overhead and limited fronthaul capacity, and may become unsuitable for real-time implementation. Therefore, in future work, it would be of interest to incorporate CSI overhead reduction techniques based on historical traffic arrival rates, and statistical properties of the channel states, in order to perform approximate realtime cross-layer optimization in limited fronthaul capacity systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
