<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Heterogeneous network traffic possesses diverse statistical properties which include complex temporal correlation and non-Gaussian distributions. A challenge to modeling heterogeneous traffic is to develop a traffic model which can accurately characterize these statistical properties, which is computationally efficient, and which is feasible for analysis. This work develops wavelet traffic models for tackling these issues. In specific, we model the wavelet coefficients rather than the original traffic. Our approach is motivated by a discovery that although heterogeneous network traffic has the complicated short-and long-range temporal dependence, the corresponding wavelet coefficients are all "short-range" dependent. Therefore, a simple wavelet model may be able to accurately characterize complex network traffic. We first investigate what short-range dependence is important among wavelet coefficients. We then develop the simplest wavelet model, i.e., the independent wavelet model for Gaussian traffic. We define and evaluate the (average) autocorrelation function and the buffer loss probability of the independent wavelet model for Fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) traffic. This assesses the performance of the independent wavelet model, and the use of which for analysis. We also develop (low-order) Markov wavelet models to capture additional dependence among wavelet coefficients. We show that an independent wavelet model is sufficiently accurate, and a Markov wavelet model only improves the performance marginally. We further extend the wavelet models to non-Gaussian traffic through developing a novel time-scale shaping algorithm. The algorithm is tested using real network traffic and shown to outperform FARIMA in both efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, the wavelet models are parsimonious, and have the computation complexity ( ) in developing a model from a training sequence of length , and ( ) in generating a synthetic traffic trace of length .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>works and diverse network applications. The goal of this work is to develop a traffic model that is both accurate in capturing the aforementioned statistical properties and computationally efficient for developing a model as well as generating synthetic traffic.</p><p>The complex temporal correlation of network traffic can be characterized by the short-range (SRD) and the long-range dependence (LRD). Examples of traffic exhibiting SRD include voice-over IP (VoIp) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and VBR video traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>; and examples of traffic possessing LRD include web request traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Ethernet data traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The autocorrelation function of SRD traffic decays exponentially, and that of LRD traffic decays hyperbolically. For real-time applications, it has been shown that only SRD is relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Numerous models corresponding to short-range-dependent processes can be used to model SRD reasonably well. These models include variants of Markov processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and DAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. For nonreal time applications such as video-on-demand, most of the data communications and some network management tasks, a traffic model needs to capture the temporal dependence at large time scales, i.e., the long-range dependence. The Markov-type models, when extended to capture LRD, often result in a complicated structure with many states/parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Models such as Fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> can capture the long-range dependence but not the short-range dependence. In fact, network traffic such as VBR video can exhibit a complex mixture of SRD and LRD. That is, the corresponding autocorrelation function behaves similarly to that of long-range dependent processes at large lags, and to that of short-range dependent processes at small lags <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Models developed to characterize both SRD and LRD include FARIMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, a model based on the Hosking procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the scene-based model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the Markov Modulated Process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, the fractal point process <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Among these methods, the scene-based model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and the Markov Modulated process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> provide a physically interpretable model to include both long-range and short-range dependence. However, due to the stochastic nature of network traffic, it is difficult to accurately define and segment network traffic into different states in the time domain. FARIMA models are not computationally efficient. They may require a large number of model parameters, and computational time to develop a model from a traffic trace of length and to generate synthetic traffic of length <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The model has been shown to have a moderate number of parameters. However, it is a point process. Its efficiency in generating a high volume of synthetic traffic needs further investigation.</p><p>Non-Gaussian distribution is another important statistical property of heterogeneous traffic. It has been shown that both video and data traffic have heavy-tailed non-Gaussian marginal probability density functions (PDFs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Moreover, the higher order statistics of traffic can have a significant impact on accurately predicting the buffer overflow probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Algorithms have been proposed to incorporate higher order statistics by matching the marginal distribution and the second-order statistics of network traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, their performance, measured by the queueing results, is still not as desirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This is because these algorithms only model the marginal distribution of the traffic at the finest time scale, whereas the marginal distributions across different time scales should be modeled for accurately predicting queueing behavior.</p><p>The goal of this work is to develop a traffic model which can capture complex temporal dependence in terms of both LRD and SRD, which can model non-Gaussian distributions to achieve accurate queueing performance, and which is computationally efficient. Why are these aspects difficult to be achieved simultaneously? The main reason is that the heterogeneous traffic is intrinsically complex in the time domain. This makes it difficult for the time-domain models to be both accurate and efficient. Models have been developed in the frequency domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Although the harmonics are not a generic representation of heterogeneous traffic, the idea of modeling in a transformation domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> motivates our work in this paper.</p><p>Which transformation domain may be suitable for modeling network traffic? Sherman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> demonstrated that the statistical properties of the aggregated traffic are self-similar across a wide range of time scales. In addition, network control and management are often performed at different time scales. All these motivate us to model heterogeneous traffic based on time scales. We show later that time scales can be naturally represented by wavelets. We also demonstrate that the wavelet representation matches the properties of the bursty network traffic, in that the wavelet coefficients are short-range dependent even though the corresponding heterogeneous traffic may be long-range dependent. Consequently, a simple yet accurate model can be derived in the wavelet domain.</p><p>Wavelet models have been developed for fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and scale-invariant processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in signal processing. Wornell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> have proven that the spectrum of the independent wavelet model of an FBM process is very close to that of processes. Therefore, the independent wavelet model has been proposed to rapidly generate FBM of FGN-like synthetic sample paths. However, the previous investigation on (asymptotic) correlation structure of wavelet coefficients has been focused mostly on a limited scope for FBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, FGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, or AR(1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The correlation structure has not been well studied for short-range dependent processes nor for a mixture of long-and short-range dependent processes. To apply wavelet models to networking related applications, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed to estimate Hurst parameters by wavelet models. The possibility of using wavelets for modeling network traffic was mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, wavelet approaches have not been applied to modeling heterogeneous traffic when this work is developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> have applied multiplicative wavelet models to model network traffic.</p><p>The main contributions of this work include: 1) the application of the wavelet approach for modeling heterogeneous traffic; 2) the development of a novel time-scale shaping algorithm to incorporate non-Gaussian distributions of network traffic; and 3) investigation of the performance of the wavelet models using networking-related performance measures.</p><p>Herein, we first investigate whether/why the wavelet modeling approach is indeed capable of capturing the complex temporal dependence in heterogeneous traffic. For this, we derive analytical results on the correlation of wavelet coefficients. These results show that a key advantage of using wavelets is their ability to reduce the complex temporal dependence so significantly that the wavelet coefficients only possess the short-range dependence. With these results, we first develop wavelet models for both SRD and LRD Gaussian traffic, and then develop a novel multitime-scale shaping algorithm for the non-Gaussian distributed traffic. After we assess our models through intensive experiments, we further assess our wavelet models analytically for modeling FGN traffic. In particular, we shows that the average buffer overflow probability of the independent wavelet model, when used to model FGN traffic, is asymptotically close to that of the original traffic. We show that the autocorrelation function of the independent wavelet model of FGN traffic has the same (hyperbolic) decay rate as the original traffic, with an approximation error of less than 15%. From the computational efficiency perspective, we show that wavelet models are parsimonious, and have the lowest computational complexity. In specific, the computational complexity is in developing a wavelet model from a training sequence of length , and in generating a synthetic sample path of length .</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background knowledge. Section III studies why wavelet models are good candidates for long-and short-range dependent traffic. Section IV investigates Gaussian wavelet models. Section V develops a time-scale shaping algorithm to extend the independent wavelet models to non-Gaussian traffic. Section VI presents experimental results which validate the performance of the wavelet models. Section VII provides analysis on the autocorrelation function and the buffer loss probability of the independent wavelet model of FGN traffic to further evaluate the performance of the wavelet models. Section VIII discusses our results. Section IX concludes the paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Long/Short-Range Dependence and Performance Measures</head><p>Intuitively, long-range dependence (LRD) can be considered as a phenomenon that current observations are significantly correlated to the observations that are far away in time. One formal definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> of a long-range dependent stationary process can be described as that the sum of its correlation function over all lags is infinite. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> This implies that the correlation function decays asymptotically as a hyperbolic function of , i.e., (s) is defined to be the parent node of node s. (s) is defined to be the left neighbor of node s.</p><p>for . is the so-called Hurst parameter, which is an important quantity for characterizing the LRD. Examples of such long-range dependent processes include the FGN process and the fractional autoregressive integrated moving average process (FARIMA). The nature of these random processes is "self-similar," i.e., the corresponding statistical properties are invariant at different time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In particular, FGN is a Gaussian process, and can be completely specified by three parameters: mean, variance, and the Hurst parameter. FARIMA is a fractional differentiation of an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA ) process, where and represent the orders of the ARMA process and is a differentiation degree. The Hurst parameter of FARIMA equals to . FARIMA has parameters, and is much more flexible than FGN in terms of simultaneously modeling of both long-range dependence and short-range dependence in network traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Examples of short-range dependent random processes include auto-regressive (AR) and ARMA processes with exponentially decaying correlation functions, i.e., . The criteria that we use to measure the performance of the wavelet models are the autocorrelation function and the buffer loss rate. The autocorrelation function is an important quantity characterizing the second-order statistics of a wide-sense-stationary process. If a model is able to capture both LRD and SRD components in network traffic, it should be able to match the autocorrelation function of network traffic in a long enough range. The buffer loss rate is chosen as one other criterion, since an important goal for traffic modeling is to assist designing the buffer size of a server, 2 and estimating the packet loss rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Wavelet Transformation</head><p>Wavelets are complete orthonormal bases which can be used to represent a signal as a function of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In , discrete wavelets can be represented as (1) 2 This can be modeled as a single queue with capacity C and a buffer size B.</p><p>where and are positive integers.

Without loss of generality, is assumed to be zero for the rest of this paper.</p><p>'s are wavelet coefficients and can be obtained through the wavelet transform  . In addition, we denote the parent and the neighboring wavelets of a wavelet through the tree diagram. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, and are the parent and the left neighbor of node , respectively. We use both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional indices of a wavelet coefficient in this paper.</p><p>A key advantage of using Haar wavelets is simplicity. The computational complexity of the (Haar) wavelet transform and inverse transform is , where is the length of the time series.</p><p>When is a random process, which is of interest to this work, the corresponding wavelet coefficients 's define a two-dimensional random processes in terms of and</p><p>(see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and references therein for details). Due to the one-to-one correspondence between and its wavelet coefficients, the statistical properties of the wavelet coefficients are completely determined by those of . Likewise, if the statistical properties of the wavelet coefficients are well specified, they can be used to characterize the original random process. This motivates our approach of traffic modeling by characterizing statistical properties of wavelet coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. WHY WAVELETS: CORRELATION OF WAVELET COEFFICIENTS</head><p>One of the main motivations for using wavelets is their ability to reduce the temporal correlation so that wavelet coefficients are less correlated. In this section, we first provide (asymptotic) analysis on correlation structures of wavelet coefficients for well-known LRD and SRD processes. We then provide empirical studies to show that the correlation structures are dominated by only a few key elements. This motivates traffic modeling in the wavelet domain, and the simple wavelet models we will choose in Section IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Analysis on Correlation Structure of Wavelet Coefficients 1) Correlation Structure of Wavelet Coefficients of LRD Processes:</head><p>The correlation structure of (long-range dependent) FGN process has been investigated extensively in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and can be applied to the problem we consider in this work.</p><p>Theorem 1: (Kaplan and Kuo <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>; Flandrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>): Let be a FGN process with Hurst parameter .

Here is the shortest distance between two wavelets, and greater than 1. The exponent, , is between 0 and 0.5 since for FGN processes. This shows that the correlation changes from the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>mean-revert</head><p>in the time domain to the mean-avert in the wavelet domain. Recall that the temporal autocorrelation of FGN decays at a rate for being the lag, and is thus nonsummable. The above theorem indicates that the wavelet transformation has changed the long-range dependence in the time domain so significantly that the summation of the correlation of wavelet coefficients converges to a constant. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> illustrates how drastic the reduction is by comparing the autocorrelation function of the original FARIMA (0, 0.4, 0) process to the corresponding autocorrelation function <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> of wavelet coefficients (of and ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Correlation Structure of Wavelet Coefficients of SRD Processes:</head><p>For short-range dependent processes, we derive the correlation of wavelet coefficients. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref>Theorem 2: Let be a zero mean wide-sense-stationary (discrete) Gaussian process with the autocorrelation , where with , is an integer and is the variance of .

In fact, the decay rate is even faster than the corresponding correlation in the time domain due to the "differencing operation" performed by the Haar wavelet transform. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> illustrates the decay rate by comparing the (temporal) correlation for an AR(1) process with that of its wavelet coefficient for . The above investigations suggest that a complex short-and/or long-range dependent process in the time domain may be sufficiently modeled by a short-range dependent process in the wavelet domain. That is, simple models which are insufficient for the temporal process may be accurate when used to model the wavelet coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Empirical Studies on Correlation Structure of LRD and SRD</head><p>What short-range dependence needs to be captured among wavelet coefficients? Unfortunately, an answer to this question cannot be provided by Theorems 1 and 2, since they only hold for large. We thus address this issue through experiments. Using sample paths of FARIMA (0, 0.4, 0) and AR(1), we obtain the corresponding correlation matrices of wavelet coefficients plotted in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, respectively. A pixel in an image represents the correlation between the th and the th wavelet coefficients, where and are the one-dimensional indices shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The gray level is proportional to the magnitude of the correlation. The higher the magnitude of the correlation, the whiter the pixel in the image. These figures show that in addition to the diagonal line, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> there are four pairs of lines having "visible" correlation. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> They correspond to the correlation between and , where represents the parent of the node , and denotes the parent of the node with being 1, 2, 3, 4 from the diagonal line. We then conclude that the most significant correlation is due to the parent-child relationship. Since the complicated temporal correlation concentrates on only a few key correlation patterns in the wavelet domain, we can use a parsimonious model in the wavelet domain to represent the original traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. GAUSSIAN WAVELET MODELS</head><p>We begin developing the wavelet models from the traffic with Gaussian distribution, for which we only need to characterize the autocovariance function through the wavelet models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. General Markov Models in Wavelet Domain</head><p>We capture the short-range dependence among wavelet coefficients using Markov models. Such Markov models can be implemented through a linear model on wavelet coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">8</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Here, and are weighting factors depending on the one-dimensional index , and is i.i.d Gaussian noise with zero mean and a unit variance.</p><p>The order of the Markov model, , can be chosen to make a tradeoff between model complexity and performance. Since our empirical study has demonstrated the regular patterns of the correlation structure for a wide range of SRD and LRD processes, we can choose accordingly to capture several strongest correlations and ignore the insignificant ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Independent Wavelet Model for Gaussian Traffic</head><p>The simplest model is the independent wavelet model when is chosen to be 1, and for all . This corresponds to the case that s are independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance . can be estimated from data at each independently. This model only characterizes the mean and the variance of individual wavelet coefficients, and completely neglects the interdependence among them. Therefore, the resulting correlation is and otherwise.</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>8</label></formula><p>How can the independent wavelet model represent LRD/SRD processes in the time domain? To provide answers to this question, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> plots the variances of wavelet coefficients from an independent wavelet model for several well-known processes: a long-range dependent FARIMA (0, 0.4, 0), a short range dependent process AR(1), and a mixture of long-range and short-range dependent process FARIMA (1, 0.4, 0).</p><p>The figure shows that variances of the three processes exhibit different behavior. In particular, the variance of LRD increases with exponentially for all . Intuitively, this is due to the fact that the statistical variation of a LRD process persists through all time scales. The variance of SRD first increases rapidly at small time scale , but saturates when is large. This is because that the statistical variation of SRD processes only persists at small time scales. 9 For a mixture of LRD and SRD, the variance shows the mixed behaviors from both SRD and LRD. These plots suggest that the variances of independent wavelet coefficients are capable of distinguishing LRD from SRD for Gaussian processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. (Low-Order) Markov Wavelet Models</head><p>The next simplest model is the first-order Markov model, which captures the parent-child relationship, the most significant correlation among wavelet coefficients as shown in the previous section. Specifically (9) 9 As an extreme case, the variance of an i.i.d. temporal process, which includes Poisson-type processes and i.i.d.

The resulting correlation pattern of this wavelet model consists of the diagonal line and the next brightest off-diagonal line in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Markov wavelet models with even higher orders can be used to capture more correlations among wavelet coefficients, and can be implemented in a similar manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Algorithm for Developing Wavelet Models and Generating Synthetic Traffic</head><p>Once the form of a wavelet model is chosen, two issues need to be considered • Generate coefficients from the wavelet correlation model using the estimated parameters for all and .</p><p>• Perform the inverse wavelet transform to the generated wavelet coefficients ( s). This results in the synthetic traffic in the time domain. Efficiency of traffic models can be measured through two quantities: 1) the computational time needed to develop a model using a training sequence and to generate synthetic traffic; and 2) the number of parameters of a model. In particular, the wavelet transform, the inverse transform, and the parameter estimation for the wavelet models are all linear <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Thus, the computational time is for developing a wavelet models, and for generating synthetic traffic of length . As a comparison, FARIMA requires for estimating parameters <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">11</ref> using a training sequence of length , and for generating a synthetic trace. In terms of the actual computing time, it usually takes at most a few minutes on a Sparc station to develop a wavelet model and to generate a trace of length , whereas a FARIMA model needs at least several hours to complete the same task.</p><p>As for the number of parameters of a wavelet model, an independent wavelet model has at most parameters for modeling a training sequence of length . An th order Markov wavelet model has about parameters (in this work,</p><p>).</p></div>

NON-GAUSSIAN INDEPENDENT WAVELET MODEL</head><p>As heterogeneous network traffic often possesses a non-Gaussian distribution, we extend the Gaussian wavelet models to non-Gaussian traffic.

Therefore, in order to perform well under a wide range of conditions, a traffic model should match marginal distributions of the cumulated process at a wide range of time scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Time Scales and Wavelets</head><p>The time scale has a natural relationship with wavelets. Specifically, as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the (Haar) wavelet coefficients can be related to the so-called scale coefficients by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where the scale coefficient is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> for and integer of . By comparing this equation with the definition of cumulative process [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>], we can relate the scale coefficient to the cumulative process as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> In other words, a scale coefficient is simply the weighted cumulative process over the interval with a length and a starting point . The scale coefficient can be further related to wavelet coefficients through the recursive relation [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>] as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where is a weighting factor, and is the scale coefficient at the coarsest time scale.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Time-Scale Shaping Algorithm</head><p>Using the relationships among wavelet coefficients, scale coefficients, and the cumulative process, we can now derive our shaping algorithm for non-Gaussian traffic. The key idea consists of the following: 1) generating the so-called background wavelet coefficients by Gaussian wavelet models (Section IV-D); 2) computing the empirical distributions of scale coefficients of a training sequence; and 3) shaping the background wavelet coefficients so as to match the empirical distributions of the scale coefficients.</p><p>The idea can be implemented through a top-down procedure, i.e., the background wavelet coefficients are shaped from the coarsest to the finest time scales. Specifically, let and be the unshaped and the shaped wavelet coefficients at the th time scale, respectively. Assume that the shaping has been done from the coarsest ( th) to the [ th] time scale. At step , we fix the following: s for all and , and [related to through <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>]. Our objective at step is to transform the (unshaped) wavelet coefficient to the shaped wavelet coefficient so as to match the empirical distribution of the scale coefficients s. To do so, we define an intermediate variable . We note that if an appropriate transform can be applied to , then would become the new scale coefficient, [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>], 12 whose desired distribution can be computed by the training sequence at scale . Hence, we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where represents the distribution of the scale coefficient at scale , 13 and can be estimated through the histogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> of training traffic using ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>).</p><p>12 By <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, ṽ needs to be obtained to march the marginal of a cumulative process. But from ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), v</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= (1= p 2)(v + v</formula><p>). Therefore, either v or v can be chosen arbitrarily for shaping in order to match a desired marginal with that of a cumulative process. We choose to shape v in this work. 13 We assume that v for a fixed j has the same distribution for different m. This is true for stationary traffic. Therefore, the distribution of v can be estimated through a histogram of v for a fixed j.</p><p>To understand what transformation is, we note that for an independent wavelet model, is independent of . This is because only depends on wavelet coefficients at time scales larger than . Therefore, we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where is a Gaussian random variable determined by the wavelet model. For Markov wavelet models with dependent wavelet coefficients, the cumulative distribution function is equal to the conditional cumulative distribution function of given ,</p><p>Such a conditional distribution is difficult to estimate empirically. Therefore, the transformation for the independent wavelet model [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>] can be used as an approximation.

PERFORMANCE OF WAVELET MODELS: NUMERICAL INVESTIGATIONS</head><p>In this section, we report numerical investigations on the performance of the wavelet models, where the performance for modeling Gaussian traffic is measured by the autocovariance function, and that for modeling non-Gaussian traffic is measured by the buffer loss probability. The results on modeling Gaussian traffic are verified using training sequences generated from known processes, and those for non-Gaussian traffic are validated using real network measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulation Setup</head><p>The experimental setup we use is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>. A trace is fed into a traffic model for estimating parameters of a wavelet model. The model obtained is then used to generate synthetic traffic</p><p>. The original and synthetic traffic traces are then used to obtain empirical autocovariance functions and the buffer losses probabilities, which are compared to measure the performance of the wavelet models. A FARIMA model is used similarly to further compare with the performance of the wavelet model. Both the sample autocorrelation functions and the buffer loss probabilities are obtained and compared with the true autocovariance functions and the buffer loss rates. The results for wavelet models are averaged over ten random sample paths.</p></div>

Performance on Gaussian Traffic</head><p>The performance of three types of wavelet models are investigated, which are independent wavelet models and the first-order and the third-order Markov wavelet models. A sample path of length 10 -10 is generated from either an AR or a FARIMA model. As various model parameters are used in our simulations, we report results in this paper based on two representative cases: a short-range dependent process, AR(1) with an AR parameter 0.9, and a mixture of both SRD and LRD processes, FARIMA(1, 0.4, 0), with an AR parameter 0.9 and the Hurst parameter 0.9.</p><p>Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref> show the sample autocorrelation functions for AR(1) and FARIMA(1, 0.4, 0); and Figs. 8 and 10 plot the buffer loss rates, respectively. To examine further the performance of each wavelet model, we plot the mean square error MSE between the original autocorrelation and the one from a wavelet model summing up to a lag , where   As observed from the figures, the independent wavelet model, which neglects all the dependence in the wavelet domain, performs reasonably well. Markov wavelet models which capture more correlations among wavelet coefficients improve the performance only marginally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance on Real Network Traffic</head><p>The performance of the independent wavelet model and the time-scale algorithm is investigated in this section using real network traffic. Specifically, two widely used traffic traces are used. One is JPEG-coded Star Wars at the frame level <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The trace is obtained by applying a JPEG-like encoder to each of 171 000 frames at intervals of 1/24 second per frame of the  two-hour movie Star Wars. The other is an Ethernet data trace used by Leland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">15</ref> The data set records the number of bits for every 10 ms during the half hour collection period. The length of this training sequence is 176 000.</p><p>An independent wavelet model is used and the time-scale shaping algorithm developed in Section V are applied. FARIMA <ref type="bibr">(25, d, 20)</ref> model is used for comparison, where FARIMA <ref type="bibr">(25, d, 20)</ref> has 25 AR parameters and 20 MA parameters. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">16</ref> The algorithms used for FARIMA to estimate its parameters and to generate synthetic traffic are from a commercial software package, Splus <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.

Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">14</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">15</ref> give the results on the buffer loss probabilities for both traces, respectively. As observed, the performance of the wavelet model resulting from the time-scale shaping algorithm is comparable to that of FARIMA <ref type="bibr">(25, d, 20)</ref> at small buffer sizes but is much improved at large buffer sizes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. PERFORMANCE OF INDEPENDENT WAVELET MODELS: ANALYSIS</head><p>One observation from our empirical studies is that independent wavelet models are rather accurate measured by both the autocovariance function and the buffer overflow probability, and the Markov models which include additional dependence only improve the performance marginally. This motivates us to further access the performance of independent wavelet models through analysis. We focus our analysis in this work on a limited case when independent wavelet models are used to model an FGN process. An FGN process is of the particular interest, since it is the only long-range dependent process with an explicit autocorrelation function. In addition, the independent wavelet model of an FGN process can be expressed explicitly <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This makes it possible for us to analyze the corresponding buffer overflow probability and the autocorrelation explicitly, and compare with those of the original FGN process given in the prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p></div>

The average buffer overflow probability of the independent wavelet model for an FGN process can then be derived and compared with the true value as shown by the following theorem. Theorem 3: When the buffer size goes to infinity, the buffer overflow probability of the independent model, , and that of the original FGN process, , satisfies (29) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> for <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> where ( ) is the Hurst parameter of the FGN process, and is a positive integer.</p><p>This theorem shows that when the buffer size is assumed to be a subset of all possible values, and is large, the independent wavelet model is asymptotically close to that of the original FGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. In other words, the independent wavelet model can faithfully capture a long-range dependent FGN traffic. Therefore, the result shows, in this special case, the capability and performance of the independent wavelet model, as well as the feasibility of using the model for queue analysis. Meanwhile, we would like to note that even for this special case, the proofs of the theorem involve elaborate analysis. The difficulty is due to the cyclostationarity of the independent wavelet model <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> which leads to the time-varying buffer overflow probability. This is, in fact, the consequence of using an independent wavelet model by ignoring all the dependence in the wavelet domain. As the result, techniques such as the large deviation cannot be used directly, and the lower and upper bounds have to be derived for the average buffer overflow probability. The main idea of the proof is given in Appendix B, and the details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Average Autocorrelation Function</head><p>The performance of independent wavelet models can be further evaluated through the autocorrelation function. To deal with cyclostationarity of the independent wavelet model, we need to define the average autocorrelation function. Specifically, let the average autocorrelation function of the resolution-limited independent wavelet model be <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> The limit defines the average autocorrelation function of , 19  where <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> Using the variance of the independent wavelet model for FGN process (see Part 1 of Theorem 1) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, we can derive the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 4: The average autocorrelation function of the independent wavelet model for an FGN process is bounded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> where is the Hurst parameter. and are defined by a function , where</p><p>and are <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">37</ref>) Then (38) 19 Assuming the limit exists. </p><p>where . The proof of Theorem 4 is in Appendix C. To understand the results given by the theorem, we recall that the autocorrelation function of an FGN process is <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> (40) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> where</p><p>. The performance of independent wavelet models measured by autocorrelation functions can then be evaluated by comparing <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> with <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. The theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> shows that the average autocorrelation function of independent wavelet model decays hyperbolically. This demonstrates that an independent wavelet model is capable of modeling long-range dependence in network traffic. In addition, the rate of decay for large lags is the same as that of the autocorrelation function of the original FGN process. By further comparing the constants with and shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">17</ref>, we can examine the difference between the autocorrelation function of the independent wavelet model and that of the original FGN process. Specifically, the relative difference between the constants ( and ) is plotted as a function of Hurst parameter in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">18</ref>, and shown to be no more than 15% between the average autocorrelation function of the independent wavelet model and that of the FGN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Performance and Efficiency of Wavelet Models</head><p>Why do independent wavelet models perform so well even when they neglect all the dependence in the wavelet domain? Intuitively, the (deterministic) self-similar structure of wavelets is a natural match to the statistical self-similarity of traffic. As wavelet basis functions have "absorbed" the long-range and short-range dependence by differencing the averages at all time scales, the wavelet coefficients are short-range dependent. This makes it possible to model wavelet coefficients as independent (or low-order Markov dependent) random variables without losing much information. The resulting wavelet model is therefore simple and parsimonious. In addition, since there exist fast algorithms for both wavelet transforms and inverse transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, our method is able to achieve the lowest computational complexity in developing the model and in generating synthetic traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. More on the Related Work</head><p>In signal processing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> have established a general framework for multiscale representations of a random process through the dyadic tree. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> have shown that wavelets can provide compact representations for an FBM process. Moreover, it has proven <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> that the spectrum of the independent wavelet model of an FBM process is very close to that of processes. Therefore, the independent wavelet model has been proposed to rapidly generate FBM or FGN-like synthetic sample paths. But the previous investigation on (asymptotic) correlation structure of wavelet coefficients has been focused mostly on a limited scope for FBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, FGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, or AR(1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The correlation structure has neither been well studied for short-range dependent processes 20 nor for a mixture of long-and short-range dependent processes. Since network traffic has both short-and long-range dependence, we have extended the previous work to a broader class of Gaussian processes in order to study correlation structures. Wavelets were also used to estimate Hurst parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The possibility of using wavelets for modeling network traffic was mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>This work is motivated by the fact that wavelet coefficients of network traffic with complex long-range and short-range depen- 20 Bounds but not the actual correlation function were derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>dence are no longer long-range dependent. Therefore, simple models can be developed in the wavelet domain. In this work, we have investigated thoroughly the independent wavelet model, the simplest wavelet model. In that, we have shown that they are capable of characterizing both long-and short-range dependent (temporal) processes through variances of wavelet coefficients at different time scales. We have derived autocorrelation functions and the queue loss rate using the independent wavelet model for the case of FGN traffic. Further, we have developed Markov wavelet models which capture the dependence among wavelet coefficients. We have compared the performance of the independent and Markov models, and show that independent wavelet models are sufficiently accurate and Markov wavelet models only improve the performance marginally. Finally, we have developed a time-scale shaping algorithm that extends the (Gaussian) wavelet models to non-Gaussian traffic. The algorithm shapes traffic at different time scales by exploiting relationships among (Haar) wavelet coefficients, scale coefficients, and the cumulative process. We also have demonstrated that the wavelet models are parsimonious, and have the lowest computational complexity achievable.</p><p>A possible future direction is to extend our initial (queue and autocorrelation function) analysis to a more general setting. Another issue of interest is to better deal with the nonstationary nature of the independent wavelet model, which we have discussed somewhat in this work. Other issues of interest include how to apply wavelet models as well as the concept of time scales to assist network design, control, and management.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B MAIN IDEA OF THE PROOF OF THEOREM 3</head><p>As the buffer loss probability of independent wavelet models is defined in the average sense to account for the nonstationarity, the proof of Theorem 3 involves comprehensive analysis to bound the average loss rate. Here, we provide the main ideas of the proof. More details can be obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Since proving Theorem 3 is equivalent to proving that ( <ref type="formula">45</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> where is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, we need to show <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> hold respectively.</p><p>Note that the buffer overflow probability [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>] can be generally lower bounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref> and upper bounded by the union bound as <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> For an FGN process ( ), Duffield <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> has shown that the upper and the lower bounds of the buffer overflow probability are asymptotically close to each other. That is</p><p>where is the so-called critical time scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, to prove <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>, it is sufficient to prove that <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref> for all integers and , and using ( <ref type="formula">48</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>. On the other hand, the lower bound [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>] can be obtained through <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">50</ref>), if we can show that <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref> where is the critical time scale of the FGN, holds under certain conditions on and .</p><p>Since , the cumulative process of the independent wavelet model, is a Gaussian random variable for fixed and , a key step for us to derive the theorem through proving ( <ref type="formula">53</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">54</ref>) is to derive the variance of , and relate it to that of . Because is a function of , our proof contains two main steps. The first step is to show that the conclusion holds for the special time slot, ( and is a large integer). This can be done through deriving the wavelet representation of and calculating the variance of . The second step is to relate the variance of , for any , to that of . The proofs for these two steps are done mostly through algebraic manipulations, and are lengthy due to the nonstationary nature of independent wavelet models. (Please refer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> for details.) Intuitively, because wavelets provide the multiscale representation of a signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, which in our case is traffic, the cumulated processes resulting from the independent wavelet model s are equal in probability to the cumulated process of an FGN process at special set of and . This results in the fact that is very close to for the rest of and . We prove that the above intuitions are true in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and therefore prove the theorem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX C PROOF OF THEOREM 4</head><p>To prove the theorem, we first need to derive an expression for the average autocorrelation function.</p><p>Inserting the wavelet representation of defined in ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) into <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, we can obtain through some algebraic manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref> where otherwise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref> represents the variance of wavelet coefficients of an FGN process and is given in Theorem 1 as <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref> Then the average autocorrelation function [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>] of an independent wavelet model for an FGN process is <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref> </p></div>
