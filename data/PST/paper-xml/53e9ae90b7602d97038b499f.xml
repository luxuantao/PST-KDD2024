<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>By nature, a power system is continually experiencing disturbances. These may be classified as event disturbances and load disturbances. Event disturbances include generator outages, short-circuits caused by lightning or other fault conditions, sudden large load changes, or a combination of such events. Event disturbances usually lead to a change in the configuration of the power system. Load disturbances, on the other hand, are the small random fluctuations in load demands. The system configuration usually remains unchanged after load disturbances. Recent trends toward full utilization of existing generation and transmission systems have increased the effects of these disturbances on power system security.</p><p>Power systems are planned and operated to withstand the occurrence of certain disturbances. The North American Electric Reliability Council defines security as the prevention of cascading outages when the bulk power supply is subjected to severe disturbances. The specific criteria which must be met are set by the individual reliability councils. Each council establishes the types of disturbances which the system must withstand without cascading outages. The following conditions, although conservative in nature, can ensure cascading outages will not occur: 1) when any of a specified set of disturbances occurs, the system will survive the ensuing transient and move into a steady-state condition, 2) no bus voltage magnitudes during transients are outside their permissible ranges, 3) in this new steady-state condition, no control devices, equipment or transmission lines are overloaded and no bus voltage magnitudes are outside their permissible ranges (say 5% of nominal). The first condition is related to the transient stability problem while the second one is related to the voltage-dip problem. The conditions are referred to as dynamic security. The third condition is referred to as static security.</p><p>Power system security analysis deals with the power system dynamic response to disturbances. In dynamic security analysis, the transition from the present operating condition to a new operating condition and the fact that 0018-9219/95$04.00 0 1995 IEEE during the transient cascading outages will not be triggered are of concern. In static security analysis, the transition to a new operating condition is assumed, and the analysis is focused on the satisfaction of both operating and engineering constraints <ref type="bibr">(overloading, voltage, etc.)</ref> The present-day power system operating environment has contributed to the increasing importance of the problems associated with dynamic security assessment of power systems. To a large extent, this is due to the fact that most of the major power system breakdowns are caused by problems relating to system dynamic responses <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> which mainly come from disturbances in power systems.</p><p>Maintaining power system dynamic security is a manyfaceted problem in which thermal limits, transient stability, and voltage-dip issues must be addressed. In addition, adequate energy and capacity reserves must be available, and the frequency response of machine governors combined with the load characteristics must be such that frequency excursions are arrested within safe limits. This task is more complicated and difficult to accomplish due to the recent federally mandated open access to the transmission grids which is motivating providers of transmission services to strive to achieve higher loadings of transmission networks and facilities than ever before thought possible.</p><p>Transient stability analysis is concerned with a power system's ability to reach an acceptable steady-state (operating condition) following an event disturbance. The power system under this circumstance can be considered as going through changes in configuration in three stages: from prefault, to fault-on, and then to postfault systems. The prefault system is usually in a stable steady state. The fault occurs (e.g., a short circuit), and the system is then in the fault-on condition before it is cleared by the protective system operation. Stability analysis is the study of whether the postfault trajectory will converge (tend) to an acceptable steady-state as time passes.</p><p>Transient stability problems, which are the concern of this paper, have become a major operating constraint in specific regions of North America that rely on long distance transfers of bulk power, such as in most parts of the Western Interconnection and Hydro Quebec, and on interfaces between large supplies of hydro power in Canada and load areas to the south, such as in the Ontario/New York area and the ManitobaMinnesota area. Transient stability problems have also been of concern to peninsular-type areas that are not as tightly connected to the rest of the network, such as the southern half of Florida. And there have been many individual generating facilities and localized areas with transient stability limitations under certain event disturbances. With increased numbers and volume of bulk power transfer, the trend now is for many more parts of the interconnected systems to become constrained by transient stability considerations. Transient stability will increasingly be a constraint to be evaluated in long distance transfers that result from transmission open access.</p><p>A major activity in utility system planning and operations is to test system transient stability relative to disturbances. Transient stability analysis programs are being used by power system planning and operating engineers to predict the response of the system to various disturbances. In these simulations, the behavior of a present or proposed power system is evaluated to determine its stability or its operating limits, or perhaps, to determine the need for additional facilities. Important conclusions and decisions are made based on the results of stability studies. It is therefore important to ensure that the results of stabil as timely and accurate as possible.</p><p>Until recently, transient stability analysis has been performed in power companies exclusively by means of numerical integrations to calculate generator behaviors relative to a given disturbance. By examining the behavior of the generators, one determines whether stability has been maintained or lost. This time-domain approach has several advantages: 1) it is directly applicable to any level of detail of power system models, 2) all the information of state variables during transient as well as steady-state is available, 3) simulation results can be directly interpreted by system operators. The chief disadvantages of this practice are: 1) it requires intensive time-consuming numerical integration, therefore it has not been suitable for on-line applications, 2) it does not provide information regarding the degree of stability (when the system is stable) and the degree of instability (when the system is unstable), 3) it does not provide information as to how to derive preventive control when the system is deemed unstable.</p><p>It is often desirable in practice to perform many power system stability studies to examine the effects of different fault locations and types, various operating conditions, different network topologies, and control device characteristics. For a typical large power system, thousands of nonlinear differential and algebraic equations must be solved, which takes tens of minutes of CPU time on a modern computer. This intensive computation requirement imposes severe constraints on the number of cases which can be studied. Moreover, the current power system operating environment motivates moving transient stability assessment from the off-line planning area into the online operating environment. There are significant benefits expected from this movement. First, one may be able to operate with margins reduced by a factor of 10 or more if the security assessment is based on actual system configuration and operating conditions, instead of assumed worst case conditions, as is done in off-line studies. As a simple example, a power transfer corridor whose actual stability boundary on a given hour can be computed to be 2500 MW could be forced to operate at a limit of 2000 MW based on the conservative assumptions inherent to off-line analysis. An on-line stability assessment using the actual system topology and real-time data could compute a limit of 2450 MW with enough certainty to allow the operator to load the system to that point. The savings realized in increased MW transaction capability can be $10 000 per hour. Another benefit of on-line analysis is that the amount of analysis can be reduced to those cases relevant to actual operating conditions. thereby freeing engineering resources for other critical activities. Thus there is always point (u.e.p.), which is essential in determining the critical energy value, is presented along with its theoretical foundation. In addition to an overview, new material is offered. Numerical solution algorithms capable of supporting online applications of direct methods are provided. These algorithms provide practical solutions to problems that have in the past made direct methods infeasible for on-line applications.</p><p>A major limitation of direct methods in the past has been the simplicity of the models used in various direct method implementations in software programs. Much of this limitation has been overcome and is presented in this paper. Another limitation has been that direct methods apply to first swing instability only. However, one of the most viable direct methods, the controlling u.e.p. method, is now shown in this paper to provide useful information for identifying multiswing unstable cases. In practical applications, the controlling u.e.p. method in conjunction with the BCU method, has shown promise as a tool for fast approximate contingency screening (thereby improving performance) and efficiently computing operating limits. This paper describes emerging applications of direct methods for on-line applications. Two examples include online transient stability assessments at the control center of Northern States Power Company and on-line transfer limit calculations at Ontario Hydro.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES dynamical systems theory. To unify our notation, let</head><p>We next review some relevant concepts from nonlinear "( = f ( X ( t ) )</p><p>(1) be the power system model under study, where the state vector X ( t ) belongs to the Euclidean space R", and the function f: R" -+ R" satisfies the sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of solutions. The solution curve of (1) starting from X at t = 0 is called a (system) trajectory, denoted by @(x, .): R + R". Note that The concepts of equilibrium point (e.p.), stable and unstable manifolds are important in dynamical system theory. Each of these concepts is defined next. A detailed discussion of these concepts and their implications may be found in <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[421,</ref><ref type="bibr">[601,</ref><ref type="bibr">[SO]</ref>, [811.</p><p>A state vector X is called an equilibrium point of system (1) if f ( X ) = 0. We denote E to be the set of equilibrium points of the system. A state vector X is @(X,O) = x. called a regular point if it is not an equilibrium point. We say that an equilibrium point of ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is hyperbolic if the Jacobian of f(.) at X , denoted J f ( X ) , has no eigenvalues with a zero real part. For a hyperbolic equilibrium point, it is a (asymptotically) stable equilibrium point if all the eigenvalues of its corresponding Jacobian have negative real parts; otherwise it is an unstable equilibrium point. If the Jacobian of the equilibrium point X has exactly one eigenvalue with positive real part, we call it a typeone equilibrium point. Likewise, X is called a type-k equilibrium point if its corresponding Jacobian has exactly k eigenvalues with positive real part. Throughout this section, it will be assumed that all the equilibrium points of syst:m (1) are hyperbolic.</p><p>Let X be a hyperbolic equilibrium point. Its stable and unstable manifolds, W s ( X ) and W'(X), are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W s ( X ) := {X E R": @ ( X , t ) + X a~ t -+ 00) wU(X) := { X E R": a ( ~, t ) + X as t t -m&gt;.</formula><p>Both stable and unstable manifolds are invariant sets.'</p><p>For an asymptotically stable equilibrium point, it can be shown that there exists a number 6 &gt; 0 such that 1 1 x 0 -XI1 &lt; S implies ~( X O , t ) + X as t + 00. If 6 is arbitrarily large, then X is called a global stable equilibrium point. There are many physical systems containing stable equilibrium points but not global stable equilibrium points. A useful concept for these kinds of systems is that of stability region (also called region ofattraction). The stability region of a stable equilibrium point X , is defined as A(X,) := { X E R": lim @ ( X , t ) = X,}. t+m From a topological point of view, the stability region A(X,) is an open, invariant, and connected set. The boundary of stability region A(X,) is called the stability boundary (or separatrix) of X , and will be denoted by BA(X,). The stability boundary is topologically an (n -1)-dimensional closed and invariant set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Formulation</head><p>The power system stability problem due to an event disturbance can be expressed in the following mathematical manner (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): In the prefault regime the system is at a known stable equilibrium point, say X,. At some time t f , the system undergoes a fault, termed the fault-on system, which results in a structural change in the system. Suppose the fault duration is confined to the time interval <ref type="bibr">[tf , t,~]</ref>.</p><p>During this interval, the system is governed by the fault-on dynamics described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X ( t ) = f F ( X ( t ) ) , tf I t&lt;t,z (2)</formula><p>where X ( t ) is the vector of state variables of the system at time t. Sometimes, the fault-on system may involve more than one action from system relays and circuit breakers. In these cases, the fault-on system is described by several sets of equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">"( = f i ( X ( t ) ) , tf L t &lt; t F , 1 x(t) = f ; ( X ( t ) ) , tF,1 I t &lt; t F , 2 x ( t ) = f : ( X ( t ) ) , t F , k 5 t &lt; tel.</formula><p>The number of the sets of equations corresponds to the number of actions due to the relays and circuit breakers. Each set of equations depicts the system dynamics due to one action from relays and circuit breakers. Suppose that the fault is cleared at time t,l and the system, termed the postfault system, is henceforth governed by postfault dynamics described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">X ( t ) = f ( X ( t ) ) tcz L t &lt; 0.</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">)<label>3</label></formula><p>Next, assume that the postfault system (3) has an asymptotically stable equilibrium point X , which satisfies operational constraints. The fundamental problem of transient stability is the following: starting from the postfault initial state X(t,,), will the postfault system settle down to the steady state condition X,? In other words, power system stability analysis is to determine whether the initial point of postfault trajectory is located inside the stability region (domain of attraction) of an acceptable stable equilibrium point (acceptable steady state).</p><p>The problem of direct stability analysis can be translated into the following: given a set of nonlinear equations with an initial condition, determine whether or not the ensuing trajectories will settle down to a desired steady-state without resorting to explicit numerical integrations. It is assumed in the area of direct methods that the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p>1) The prefault stable equilibrium point, Xtreand the postfault equilibrium point, X, , are sufficiently close to each other (so a nonlinear algebraic solver, such as the Newton method, with Xfre as the initial guess will find X,) and  Comparisons between time-domain approach and direct</p><p>2) the prefault stable equilibrium point, X:'", lies inside the stability region of the postfault stable equilibrium point X,.</p><p>Mathematical as well as physical arguments to support the above two assumptions can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the most popular method of analyzing transient stability is to calculate the postfault behaviors via numerical integrations. On the other hand, direct methods first assume that the postfault system has a stable equilibrium point X , which satisfies (power system) operational constraints (an acceptable steady state). Direct methods next determine, based on energy functions, whether the initial point of the postfault trajectory lies inside the stability region of the acceptable stable equilibrium point. If it does, direct methods then declare that the resulting postfault trajectory will converge to X , without any information regarding the transients of the postfault trajectory. Comparisons between time-domain approach and direct methods for power system transient stability problems is summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">2</ref>. The basis of direct methods for the stability assessment of a postfault system is knowledge of the stability region: if the initial condition of the postfault system lies inside the stability region of a desired postfault stable equilibrium point, then one can ensure without performing any numerical integrations that the ensuing postfault trajectory will converge to the desired stable equilibrium point. Therefore, knowledge of the stability region plays an important role in direct methods. In the next section, a heuristic introduction of direct methods will be presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">A HEURISTIC INTRODUCTION OF DIRECT METHODS</head><p>Heuristic arguments of the applicability of the direct methods can be derived from the classical equal area criby the following equations: terion. Consider one-machine-infinite-bus system described S = W Mw = -Dw -P o sin S -+ P,.

The stability boundary aA <ref type="bibr">(6,, 0)</ref> is composed of the stable manifold of the u.e.p.

We consider the following function, termed energy function</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E(&amp;, W ) = ~M w ~ -P, S -Po COS S.</formula><p>The energy function can be divided into kinetic energy K ( w ) and potential energy functions U ( w ) ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E(S, w ) = K ( w ) + U ( S )</formula><p>where K ( w ) = $Mw2 and U ( 6 ) = -P,S -P o cos 6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>U ( . ) .</head><p>The stability for this simple system can be directly assessed on the basis of the energy function U(S): if a given postfault trajectory (S, U ) , after reaching a local maximum value of U ( . ) , S starts to decrease, then the stability of this postfault trajectory is assured. The following two methods can be employed to assess the system's stability: 1) Closest u.e.p. method: This method uses the constant energy surface { ( S , U ) : V(6,w) = U(&amp;)) passing through the closest u.e.p. (61,O) to approximate the stability boundary BA(S,, 0). If a given state, say (Scl, wee), whose energy function value v(6,1, we[) is less than U ( &amp; ) , then the state <ref type="bibr">(S,l,w,l)</ref> is classified to be lying inside the stability region of (6,, 0) (see Fig. 5). Thus one can assert without numerical integration that the resulting trajectory will converge to (6s, 0). This method, termed the closest u.e.p. method, although simple, can give considerable conservative stability assessments; especially for those fault-on trajectories crossing the stability boundary BA(S,, 0) through W"(Sz, 0) (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a)). For example, the postfault trajectory starting from the state P, which (b) Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. (a) The closest U e p. method gives considerable conservative stabihty assessments for those fault-on trajectories crossing the stability boundary dA <ref type="bibr">(6,, 0)</ref> through W " <ref type="bibr">( 6 2 , O )</ref> ) (b) The postfault trajectory starting from the state P , which lies inside the stability region A <ref type="bibr">(6,, O )</ref> , is classified to be unstable by the closest u.e p method while in fact the resulting trajectory will converge to (6, 0) and hence it is stable lies inside the stability region A( S,, 0), is classified to be unstable by the closest u.e.p. method while in fact the resulting trajectory will converge to (6,, 0) and hence it is stable (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6(b)</ref>). We will elaborate on this problem of conservativeness later on. Controlling U. e.p. method: This method aims to reduce the conservativeness of the closest u.e.p. method by taking the dependence of the faulton trajectory into account. For those fault-on trajectories ( S ( t ) , ~( t ) ) whose 6 ( t ) component moves towards 61, the controlling u.e.p. method uses the constant energy surface passing through the u.e.p.  on trajectories ( S ( t ) , w ( t ) ) whose S ( t ) component moves towards 62, the constant energy surface passing through the u.e.p. ( S Z , ~) , ((6,~): E(6,w) = U ( &amp; ) } is chosen as the local approximation for the relevant stability boundary (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). Therefore, for each fault-on trajectory, there exists a unique corresponding unstable equilibrium point whose stable manifold constitutes the relevant stability boundary. The constant energy surface passing through the controlling u.e.p. can be used to accurately approximate the relevant part of the stability boundary toward which the fault-on trajectory is heading. If the energy function value of a given state is less than that of controlling u.e.p., then the state is classified to be lying inside the stability region of (S,, 0) by the controlling u.e.p. method.</p><p>Thus one can assert without numerical integration that the resulting trajectory will converge to (Sa, 0). This method, although more complex than the closest u.e.p. method, gives much more accurate and less conservative stability assessments than the closest u.e.p. method. For instance, the postfault trajectory starting from the state <ref type="bibr">(3,W)</ref> which lies inside the stability region A(S,, 0) is correctly classified to be stable by the controlling u.e.p. method while it is classified to be unstable by the closest u.e.p. method (see Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Again, this shows the conservativeness of the closest u.e.p. method which does not take the dependence of the fault-on trajectory in account.</p><p>The above exposition on the one-machine-infinite-bus system has outlined the key bases for both the closest u.e.p. method and the controlling u.e.p. method and highlighted their differences in stability assessment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ENERGY FUNCTION THEORY</head><p>The basis of direct methods for the stability assessment of a postfault system is knowledge of the stability region: if the initial condition of the postfault system lies inside the stability region of a desired postfault stable equilibrium point, then one can ensure without performing any numerical integrations that the ensuing postfault trajectory will converge to the desired point. Therefore, knowledge of stability region plays an important role in direct methods.</p><p>This section reviews some analytical results associated with energy function theory which enable one to characterize limit sets, stability boundaries and stability regions. A more comprehensive development of energy function theory can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>. This section also shows how to use energy functions to estimate stability regions.</p><p>We say a function V : R" H R is an energy function for a system (1) if the following three conditions are satisfied: 1) the derivative of the energy function V(X) along any system trajectory X ( t ) is nonpositive, i.e., V ( X ( t ) ) 5 0. 2) If X ( t ) is a nontrivial trajectory (i.e., X ( t ) is not an equilibrium point (e.p.)), then along the nontrivial trajectory X ( t ) the set {t E R: V ( X ( t ) ) = 0)has measure zero in R.</p><p>3) If a trajectory X ( t ) has a bounded value of V ( X ( t ) )</p><p>for 1 E R+, then the trajectory X ( t ) is also bounded.</p></div>

Properties 1) and 2) imply that the energy is strictly decreasing along any system trajectory. Property 3) states that along any system trajectory the energy function is a proper map2 but its energy need not be a proper map for the entire state space (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>).

Furthermore, each component of S ( k ) is an invariant set.</formula><p>In spite of the possibility that a constant energy surface may contain several disjoint connected components, there is an interesting relationship between the constant energy surface and the stability boundary. This relationship is that at most one connected component of the constant energy surface ~S ( T ) has a nonempty intersection with the stability region A ( X , ) as shown in the following theorem. Theorem 4-4: [ 151 (Constant energy surface and stability region)</p><p>Let X , be a s.e.p. of the system (1) and A ( X , ) be its stability region. Then, the set S(T) contains only one connected component which has a nonempty intersection with the stability region A ( X , ) if and only if r &gt; V ( X , ) .</p><p>Motivated by Theorem 4-4, we shall use the notation Sx,(r) to denote the connected set of S(T) (whose level value is r ) containing the stable equilibrium point X,. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>, the relation between the constant energy surfaces at different level values and the stability region A ( X , ) is shown. It is observed from this figure that the connected set S X , with a level value r smaller than the critical value is very conservative in the approximation of the stability boundary BA(X,). As the set Sx, is expanded by increasing the level value T , the approximation gets better until this constant energy surface hits the stability boundary a A ( X , ) at some point. This point can be shown to be an u.e.p <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>. We call this point the closest u.e.p. of the s.e.p. X , with respect to the energy function V ( . ) . Furthermore, as we increase the level value r, the connected set S X , would contain points which lie outside the stability region A(X,). It is therefore inappropriate to approximate the stability boundary d A ( X , ) by the connected set Sx, with a level value higher than that of the lowest point on the stability boundary BA(Xs). From these figures, it becomes obvious that, among the several disjoint connected sets of the constant energy surface, the connected set S x , is the best candidate to approximate the stability boundary BA(X,). We remark that given a point in the state space (say, the initial point of the postfault system), it is generally difficult to determine which connected component of a level set contains the point. This is due to the fact that a level set usually contains several different components and they are not easy to differentiate based on an energy function value. Fortunately, the knowledge of a prefault stable equilibrium point, a fault-on trajectory and a postfault stable equilibrium point helps to identify the connected component of a level set that contains the initial point of postfault system.</p><p>The analytical results discussed in this section above will be extended in the next section to develop a theoretical foundation for the most viable direct method: the controlling u.e.p. method.</p><p>V. THE CONTROLLING U.E.P. METHOD From a nonlinear system viewpoint, transient stability analysis is essentially the problem of determining whether or not the fault-on trajectory at clearing time is lying inside the stability region of a desired stable equilibrium point of its postfault system. Hence, the main point in transient stability analysis is not to estimate the whole stability boundary of the postfault system. Instead, only the relevant part of the stability boundary toward which the faulton trajectory is heading is of concern. When the closest increase the level value ,,? *%I. u.e.p. method is applied to power system transient stability analysis, this method has been found to yield conservative results. In fact, in the context of transient stability analysis, the closest u.e.p. method provides an approximated stability boundary for the postfault system, and is independent of the fault-on trajectory. Thus the closest u.e.p. method can give very conservative results for transient stability analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I increase the level v d u e</head><p>A desired method for determining the critical energy value would be the one which can provide the most accurate approximation of the part of the stability boundary toward which the fault-on trajectory is heading, even though it might provide a very poor estimate of the other part of stability boundary. To this end, the controlling u.e.p. method uses the constant energy surface passing through the controlling u.e.p. to approximate the part of stability boundary of the postfault system toward which the faulton trajectory is heading. If, when the fault is cleared, the trajectory lies inside the energy surface passing through the controlling u.e.p., then the postfault system will be stable (i.e., the postfault trajectory will settle down to a stable operating point); otherwise, the postfault system may The intersection between the stability boundary az4(Xs)</p><p>be unstable.

The stability boundary, BA(X"), is contained in the set which is the union of the stable manifolds of these six typeone e.p.'s and six type-two e.p.'s, as shown in Corollary 4-3. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> shows numerically the intersection between the stability boundary d A ( X " ) and the angle space, (61 , 62).</p><p>For illustration purposes, we assume the fault-on trajectory, X,(t) due to a faulL3The fault-on trajectory, X,(t), leaves the stability boundary, a A ( X " ) , via the stable manifold of the type-one e.p.

The time duration between p and X , along the fault-on trajectory X,(t) is the so-called critical clearing time. If the fault is cleared before the fault-on trajectory reaches X,, then the initial condition of the postfault trajectory lies inside the stability region A ( X , ) ; hence, the corresponding postfault trajectory will converge to X , . Otherwise, the corresponding postfault trajectory will, as stated in Theorem 5-1, either converge to another stable equilibrium point4 or d i ~e r g e . ~</p><p>In the operation or operational planning environment, calculating the critical clearing time relative to a fault is not practical because the reclosure times of protective relays in the system are already set.

The postfault trajectory starting from X,I will settle down to X , because X,l lies inside the stability region A(X,). The intersection between the stability boundary a A ( X , )</p><p>fault-on trajectory, X,(t), from X y to X,Z lies inside the stability region A ( X , ) is numerically very difficult, if not impossible. The main reason for this difficulty is due to the lack of an explicit expression for stable manifolds. However, the task is relatively easy if an energy function instead of the stable manifold Ws(X,,) is given. To elaborate on this point, let us go back to the previous numerical example and examine Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>, which shows the relationship between the stable manifold W s (X,,) and the constant energy surface passing through X,,. In order for the fault-on trajectory X f ( t ) to pass through the constant energy surface aS(V(X,,)), the point X,l must have an energy value greater than the energy value at the controlling u.e.p. X,,; i.e., V ( X , l ) &gt; V(X,,). Hence, the task of determining whether the segment of the fault-on trajectory X,(t) from Xfre to X,l lies inside the stability region A ( X , ) boils down to the task of comparing two scalars: V(Xc-) and V(X,,). If V ( X , , ) 5 V(X,,), then the controlling u.e.p. method asserts that X,. lies inside the stability region. Indeed, the segment of the fault-on trajectory X,(t) from Xzre to Xcl lies inside the stability region A ( X , ) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>). In this case, the postfault we have V(X,,) &lt; V(X,) &lt; V(X,l) and the postfault trajectory starting from X,i will not settle down to X , .</p><p>trajectory starting from X C l will converge to the stable equilibrium point X , (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">15</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, if V(X,z) &gt; V ( X c , ) , the controlling u.e.p. method asserts that X,l lies outside the stability region; however, the segment Xf" to X,l may not lie totally inside the stability region A(X,). Two cases are possible. In the first case, X,z lies outside the stability region A ( X , ) , in which we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">V(Xc,) &lt; V ( X , ) &lt; V(X,z)</formula><p>and the postfault trajectory starting from Xcl will not converge to X , (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">16</ref>). In the second case, Xcz still lies inside the stability region A ( X , ) , in which we have V(X,,) &lt; V(X,.) &lt; V ( X , ) and the postfault trajectory starting from X,. will still converge to X, (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">17</ref>). The second case points out the slight conservative nature of the controlling u.e.p. method in estimating the relevant stability region and the stability property of the postfault trajectory. The above reasoning forms the basis of the energy function based controlling u.e.p. method which will be theoretically justified later in this section. we have V(X,,) &lt; V(X,l) &lt; V(X,) and the postfault trajectory starting lrom X c ~ will still settle down to X,.</p><p>The above analysis points out that the controlling n.e.p. method will:</p><p>Case 1: predict a stable postfault trajectory, either first-swing or multiswing, to be stable, in which case V ( X , l ) &lt; V(X,,) (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>); or Case 2: predict an unstable postfault trajectory, either first-swing or multiswing, to be unstable, in which case V(X,-) &gt; V(X,,) (cf.

This nice property of the controlling u.e.p. method distinguishes the method itself from other methods. Depending on the characteristics of the fault-on trajectory and the property of the energy function, the controlling u.e.p. method may classify stable trajectories to be stable (see Case 1) or may classify stable trajectories to be unstable (see <ref type="bibr">Case 3)</ref>. The conservative nature shown in Case 3 is not surprising because the energy function, on which the controlling u.e.p. method is based, maps the state space (which is n-dimensional) into a scalar (which is 1D). Since this map is not one-to-one,6 the conservative nature of the controlling u.e.p. method is expected.</p></div>

X,,, then using other u.e.p.'s instead of using X,, as the controlling u.e.p., can give an incorrect stability assessment in both directions: either too conservative or optimistic (i.e., classifying an unstable trajectory as stable).</p><p>In summary, the task of finding the precise controlling u.e.p. of a fault-on trajectory is essential for direct transient stability analysis. Using the energy value of a wrong controlling u.e.p. as a critical value is likely to give inaccurate stability assessment. Unfortunately, the task of finding the exact controlling u.e.p. of a given fault for general power system models is very difficult because:</p><p>The controlling u.e.p. is a particular u.e.p. embedded in a large-degree state-space. The controlling u.e.p. is the first u.e.p. whose stable manifold is hit by the fault-on trajectory (at the exit point).</p><p>The exit point is very difficult to detect. A method which can find the controlling u.e.p. relative to any given fault has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref>. This method is based on the time-domain simulation approach; hence it is slow in nature. The role of this time-domain method is only to serve as a bench-mark to check the correctness of the controlling u.e.p. obtained by direct methods. It may prove fruitful to develop a tailored solution algorithm for finding controlling u.e.p.'s. by exploiting special properties as well as some physical and mathematical insights of the underlying power system model. In later sections, we will detail such a systematic method for finding controlling u.e.p.'s for both network-reduction and network-preserving power system models.</p></div>

DIRECT METHODS FOR NETWORK-REDUCTION POWER SYSTEM MODELS</head><p>Traditionally, direct methods have been based on the network-reduction model where all the load representations are expressed in constant impedance and the entire network representation is reduced to the generator internal buses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Network-Reduction Models</head><p>I ) The Classical Model: We review the network reduction with the classical generator model for transient stability analysis. Consider a power system consisting of n generators. Let the loads be modeled as constant impedances. The dynamics of the zth generator can be represented, using the angles of the infinite bus as a reference, by the following equations [6]: 6, =w, M,W, = -Dzwz + P, , -P,,, i = 1, ... ,n <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(8)</ref> where</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Pet = n+l n+l K&amp;B,, sin(&amp; -6,) + 1 KV,G,, cos(6, -<label>6</label></formula><p>,)</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">3 i t 3 f z</formula><p>V, is the constant voltage behind direct axis transient reactance.

B,, and G,, terms represent the transfer susceptance and conductance of the ( i , j ) element in the reduced admittance matrix of the system, respectively. Pmt is the mechanic power.</p><p>2 ) The One-Axis Generator Model with Exciters: This model includes one circuit for the field winding of the rotor, i.e., this model considers the effects of field flux decay. As a result, the voltage behind the direct transient reactance is no longer a constant. Sasaki first included such models for direct stability analysis <ref type="bibr">[69]</ref>. The dynamics of each generator are then described by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">n + c j=1 ,i#j</formula><p>V, (B,, cos S,, + G,, sin S,, ) .</p><p>(9)</p><p>3) The One-Axis Generator Plus First Order AVR Model: When the exciter control action is included in the generator model, at least one additional differential equation is needed to account for it:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">T v z E f d z = -E f d z -k &amp; z f 1,.</formula><p>We assume the terminal voltage Vt, of each generator has a linear relationship with its quadrature component Vtqz, i.e., V,, = kzVtqz, where k, is a positive constant.

Here we follow the IEEE recommended notation [58], which is somewhat different from the original paper <ref type="bibr">[51]</ref> in which the industry notation is used.</p><p>4) The Two-Axis Generator Model with Exciters: For generators with the salient-pole case, due to the armature reaction flux alignment effect, the internal voltage dynamics is decomposed into two perpendicular parts with different time constants: direct-axis voltage EL, and quadratureaxis voltage E&amp;. Using the angle of the infinite bus as a reference, the dynamics of the ith generator modeled by the two-axis machine model with a simplified first-order exciter model can be represented by the following equations [37],</p><p>[581, C64l.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Exact and Numerical Energy Functions</head><p>We next discuss a procedure to construct energy functions for the above four network-reduction power system models.</p><p>If the transfer conductance of the reduced network is zero (i.e., G,, = 0), then the above four models, except for the two-axis generator model with exciters, can be written in the following compact form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">d Tli: = --U(X, y) d X y = z M i = -Dx -</formula><p>where T , M , and D are positive diagonal matrices. Consider the function we show that W ( z , y , z ) is an energy function for system (12). Differentiating W ( z , y, z) along the system trajectory gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">i d W T d W T d W T * ( X ( t ) , y ( t ) , z ( t ) ) = x k + -y + - dY d z dUT dU dz d X -- T-l- -z T D z 5 0. - -</formula><p>This inequality shows that condition (1) of the energy function is satisfied. Suppose that there is an interval t E [ t l , t z ] such that l @ ( z ( t ) , g ( t ) , z ( t ) ) = 0. From ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), we have z ( t ) = 0 and k ( t ) = 0 for t E [ t l , t 2 ] , which implies that y(t) is a constant for t E <ref type="bibr">[tl,tz]</ref>. It then follows from (12) that the system state is at an equilibrium point, hence condition (2) of the energy function also holds.</p><p>The task of verifying condition (3) of the energy function (i.e., energy function is a dynamic proper map) is the most involved. It often requires exploring the special structure of the underlying model. This condition has been verified for the classical generator model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>. For the other network-reduction models, we will first prove that along every trajectory with bounded energy W ( X , y, z), ~( t ) is also bounded. We will then show that y(t) and z ( t ) are also bounded. For purpose of illustration, we will only prove the case for the one-axis generator model. In this model, the internal voltage dynamics can be put into the following compact form <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>: Since along any nontrivial trajectory with a bounded energy, the set r ? {t E R+: detz(S(t)) = 0} has measure zero and V ( t ) is bounded, it follows that V ( t ) = A(&amp;(t))-'(TV -Efd) is also bounded. Since V ( t ) is bounded, it follows from Theorem 3.3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref> that <ref type="bibr">6 ( t )</ref> and w ( t ) are also bounded.</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">where - T,, =Ti,,, T,, = 0 , i # j , A(S(t)) = M N -I , Mtz = % d z -X i L , MZJ = 0, i # j ,</formula><p>For the above various network-reduction models, the corresponding variables z, y, z and the potential energy functions U(z,y) can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>. Note that these energy functions can be decomposed into a sum of two separable functions: kinetic energy, which is related to the variable z only, and potential energy function, which is related to the variables IC and y. This observation will prove useful in our sequel analysis.</p><p>To derive an energy function for network-reduction models with nonzero transfer conductance of the reduced Y-bus matrix is a challenging task. Considerable efforts have been made to find energy functions for these models [13], [14],</p><p>[40], <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref>. Unfortunately, these efforts, either based on the classical Lure-Postnikov-type Lyapunov function approach or the first integral approach, have been in vain. Narasimhamurthi has shown that attempts to accommodate line losses by a smooth transformation of the energy functions for power systems without losses do not lead to a local Lyapunov function <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref>. It has been shown that there does not exist a general form of 'exact' energy function for power systems with transfer conductances [ 141. However, global energy functions still exist for certain networkreduction power system models under certain moderate conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>.</p><p>A compact representation of the above four networkreduction models with transfer conductance is</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">- d dX T k =---(z,Y) +gi(z,y) y =z</formula><p>where gl(z,y) and gz(z,y) account for the effects of the transfer conductances in the reduced network. The existing energy functions for power systems with transfer conductances are not exact in the sense that they do not satisfy the three conditions of energy functions and they are not well defined functions. We term these functions numerical energy functions. We next propose a numerical energy function for the generic network-reduction model (13).</p><p>For the compact form of the network-reduction power system model ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), the numerical energy function W(z,y,z) consists of two parts: an analytical energy function Wana(z,y,z) = i z T M z + U(s,y) and a path-dependent potential energy Upath(z, y), i.e., For classical generator models, the path-dependent energy function can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">n-1 n i=l j=i+l</formula><p>If a linear trajectory is assumed in the angle space, the above integration can be simplified as Such an approximation is called the ray approximation. For a two-axis generator model with exciters, the numerical potential energy function can be written as the following equations <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> have the following disadvantages: 1) the u.e.p.'s obtained by using these methods are not the exact controlling u.e.p. defined in the previous section, i.e. the first u.e.p. whose stable manifold is hit by the fault-on trajectory at the exit point. These methods have been found to give both overestimates and very conservative stability assessments in many cases, 2) they have no theoretical foundations, and 3) these methods do not have good convergence properties.</p><p>Incidentally, several previous efforts in determining the critical energy value without computing the controlling u.e.p. can be found in [34], [44], [501, <ref type="bibr">[MI,</ref><ref type="bibr">[871.</ref> Recently, a systematic method, called boundary of stability region based Gontrolling unstable equilibrium point method (BCU method), to find the controlling u.e.p. was developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>-[17], <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref>. The method was also given other names such as the exit point method <ref type="bibr">[371, 1621, [63]</ref> and the hybrid method <ref type="bibr">[58]</ref>. The BCU method has been evaluated in a large-scale power system and it compared favorably with other methods in terms of its reliability and the required computational efforts [62], <ref type="bibr">[63]</ref>. The BCU method has been applied to the fast derivation of power transfer limits <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref> and to real power rescheduling to increase dynamic security <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>, and demonstrated its capability for on-line transient stability assessments.</p><p>The fundamental ideas behind the BCU method can be explained in the following way. Given a power system stability model (which admits an energy function), the BCU method first explores special properties of the underlying model with the aim to define an artificial, dimensionreduction system such that the following conditions are met:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Static Properities:</head><p>The locations of equilibrium points of the dimensionreduction system correspond to the locations of equilibrium points of the original system.

From a practical viewpoint, it would be useful to know whether or not the one-parameter transversality condition is always satisfied for practical power systems <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref>.</p><p>We next remark on the impact of using network-reduction power system models on the accuracy of transient stability analysis. First, load characteristics are known to have a significant effect on system dynamics. Inaccurate load modeling could lead to a power system operating in modes that result in actual system collapse or separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref>. The so-called ZIP model (where the load is represented as a combination of constant impedance, constant current and constant MVA) are commonly used in current stability analysis programs. These static load models are adequate for some types of dynamic analysis but not for others (in which case, accurate complex static load models or dynamic load models are required). However, only the constant impedance load model (or equivalent model) is allowed in the network-reduction power system models. Hence, in the context of system modeling, the network-reduction power system models preclude consideration of load behaviors (i.e., voltage and frequency variations) at load buses. Second, in the context of physical explanation of results, re-duction of the transmission network leads to loss of network topology and, hence, precludes study of transient energy shifts among different components of the entire power network. Network-preserving models (structure-preserving models) have been proposed in the last decade to overcome some of the shortcomings of the classical model and to improve the modeling of generators, exciters, automatic voltage regulators and load representations. We next discuss the direct methods for network-preserving power system models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. DIRECT METHODS FOR NETWORK-PRESERVING MODELS</head><p>There are two advantages of using the networkpreserving power system models for direct stability analysis.

However, despite the strong analogy between DAE's and ODE'S, major differences do exist. For instance, once the trajectory intersects the following singular surface S , (2, y): (x, y) E L , A(x, y) = det a DAE can not be reduced to an ODE. From a dynamical viewpoint, complicated dynamic behaviors will occur in the vicinity of S. For instance, most of the trajectories near singular surfaces will not exist beyond singular surfaces; only when the initial conditions of the DAE satisfy certain conditions, the trajectories can be extended further <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>. Due to their intricate complicated dynamics near singular surfaces, DAE systems are difficult to analyze and only some phenomena are completely understood. We next discuss some analytical results for DAE systems that are useful for stability analysis of network-preserving power system models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. DAE Systems</head><p>If the Jacobian ( d / d y ) g ( z , g ) is nonsingular, i.e, the system is on the regular part of the DAE ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>), then by the Implicit Function Theorem [2, p. 401, the system equations ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) are locally equivalent to the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">2 = f ( 2 , Y)</formula><p>The existence and uniqueness of solutions of DAE in a neighborhood N of the initial conditions can be guaranteed provided functions f and g are smooth and the Jacobian (d/dy)g(x,y) has a full rank on N <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>.

However, it is usually very difficult to generalize these local results into global results because once the trajectory intersects the singular surface S, the implicit function theorem does not apply and some elements of the vector field become unbounded.</p><p>The singular surface S decomposes the algebraic manifold L into several disjoint components r2.. If all the points on some rZ so that the Jacobian matrix (d/dz)g(z,y) has eigenvalues with negative real parts, then rz is called a stable component; otherwise, it is called an unstable component. Since the vector field is unbounded on the singular surface, it can be expected that trajectories move very fast near the singular surface. Once the trajectory reaches the singular surface, an un-smooth jump behavior will occur and force the trajectory to reach another adjacent piece of the algebraic manifold. A comprehensive analysis of the dynamic behaviors near the singular surface can be found in [77]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[79]</ref>.</p><p>We next discuss the concept of the stability region for DAE systems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Singular Perturbation Systems</head><p>The singular perturbation approach is widely investigated in applied mathematics and control system societies <ref type="bibr">(451, [55]</ref>. The application of such concepts in networkpreserving power system models was initiated by <ref type="bibr">Sastry et al. (701,</ref><ref type="bibr">[71]</ref>, and considered later by Arapostathis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">171,</ref><ref type="bibr">Bergen et al.</ref> [lo], <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, De Marco et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref>, [29] and Chiang et al. <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. This approach treats algebraic equations as a limit of the fast dynamics: EY = g(z, y). In other words, as E approaches zero, the fast dynamics will approach the algebraic manifold. Therefore, for the DAE system (19), we can define an associated singularly perturbed system</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">2 = f(x, Y) EY = dJ:, Y) (21)</formula><p>where E is a sufficiently small positive number. If f and g are both smooth functions and bounded for all (x,y) E Rn+m, then the vector field is globally well defined. The very different rates shown in the system can be separated in two distinct time scales: slow variable x and fast variable y. The effects of the sign in the algebraic equations for power system applications are worth recognizing: the algebraic manifold remains invariant whether there is a positive sign or a negative sign in front of g(x, y). However, this sign will affect significantly the dynamical behaviors of corresponding singularly perturbed system. It is therefore imperative to choose a proper sign in algebraic equations to represent an appropriately corresponding singularly perturbed system.</p><p>Although the DAE system and the corresponding singularly perturbed system have some different dynamic models, they still share several similar dynamical properties. The following results demonstrate the invariant topological structure among equilibrium points between a DAE system and the associated singularly perturbed system.</p></div>

Instead, the fault-on trajectory will hit the stability boundary of its corresponding singularly perturbed postfault system. Hence the exit point of a fault-on trajectory must lie on the stable manifold of the controlling u.e.p. of the singularly perturbed postfault system. 3) Solution trajectory: Trajectories of the singularly perturbed system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(21)</ref> will not be confined to the algebraic manifold L and they are not exactly the same as trajectories of the original DAE system. However, the Tikhonov' s theorem over the infinite time interval can be applied to provide a theoretical justification to ensure that the difference of solution trajectories between the original DAE system ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) and the singularly perturbed system ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) is uniformly bounded by the order of O ( E ) <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Exact and Numerical Energy Functions</head><p>All existing network-preserving models can be written as a set of general differential-algebraic equations of the following compact form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(22)</ref> dY where U E T k and w E RI are instantaneously variables while J: E Rn, y E T", and z E R" are state variables.

The compact representation of the network-preserving model Therefore, the condition (1) of the energy function is satisfied. Suppose that there is an interval t E <ref type="bibr">[tl, tz]</ref> such that @(u(t), w(t), x(t), y(t), z ( t ) ) = 0. It follows from ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>) that z ( t ) = 0 and <ref type="bibr">tl,tz]</ref>. This indicates that y ( t ) is a constant for t E [ t l , tz]. It then follows that the system state is at an equilibrium point. Thus condition (2) of the energy function also holds. We can employ similar arguments used for the network-reduction model to show that condition (3) is also true; here we omit the detailed proof. Note that the additional terms in @(U, w, x, y, z ) , as compared with those in the network-reduction model, are related to the energy dissipation at load buses. Moreover, as t approaches zero, these terms become dominant in W(u, w, x, y, z ) . This observation also shows the important role of load models for stability analysis. When the network transfer conductance is not negligible, a general expression of exact energy functions does not exist. In this case, path-dependent numerical energy functions may prove adequate. This is similar to the case for networkreduction models. However, the transfer conductances of the network-preserving models are usually much smaller in relative value than that of the network-reduction models. This physical property makes numerical energy functions for network-preserving models 'close' to exact energy functions. This illustrates another advantage of using networkpreserving models instead of using network-reduction models.</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">U ( t ) = w(t) = i ( t ) = 0 for t E [</formula></div>

In order to make this picture more precise, the relationship between the postfault trajectory of the associated singularly perturbed model and that of the postfault network-preserving model needs to be established. With the aid of the singularly perturbed system, it can be shown that the postfault trajectory of the DAE system is approximately equal to the trajectory generated by the singularly perturbed system under mild conditions. This suggests that one can detect the controlling u.e.p. of the singularly perturbed system and use the constant energy surface passing the controlling u.e.p. of the singularly perturbed system as the relative stability boundary for the fault-on trajectory of network-preserving models. Once the fault-on trajectory is inside the energy surface, the trajectory generated by the DAE system will converge to the stable equilibrium point of the postfault DAE system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I ) Numerical Studies on Two Systems:</head><p>The numerical network-reduction BCU method has been tested on several power systems. The numerical simulation results presented in this section are a 50-generator, 145-bus power system which is a IEEE test system [65] and a 202generator, 1293-bus power system. The type of faults are three-phase faults with fault locations at both generator and load buses. Both severe and mild faults are considered.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> displays the estimated critical clearing times of several faulted systems by using six different methods on the IEEE test system. In this study, the test system is modeled by the network-reduction power system model with classical generators. The six different methods are: the time-domain (numerical integration) method (ETMSP), the BCU method, the MOD method, the exit point method, the hybrid method and the mixed DEEAC method. The MOD method attempts to find the controlling u.e.p. based on the mode of disturbances. The hybrid method is a hybrid of a direct method and a time-domain method. The mixed DEEAC method is based on a dynamic equivalent equal area criterion. A description of each of these methods can be found in <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[501, [67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[74]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[83]</ref>.

The CCT estimated by the BCU method due to this type and location of fault with the way of 'clearing' the fault is 102 ms while the exact CCT obtained by the time-domain simulation method is 108 ms. The CCT estimated by the MOD method, the exit point method, the hybrid method and the mixed DEEAC method is 112. <ref type="bibr">5, 112.5, 107.5, and 108 ms, respectively.</ref>   Relative Error (%) 0 -5.10 0.95 0 - <ref type="bibr">16.8 -2.90 -6.10 -6.10 -15.10 -2.70 -13.10 -0.30 -3.30 -2.61 -13.90 -3.90</ref> of each method compared against the time-domain method.</p><p>The sign ** in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> means that the corresponding method does not converge to a u.e.p. in that case.

These results are in compliance with the analytical results of the controlling u.e.p. method presented in Section V confirming that the critical energy value based on the controlling u.e.p. should give slightly conservative stability assessments if exact energy functions are used. The simulation results also reveal that the CCT's estimated by the other methods can be either overestimates or underestimates. Overestimating CCT is undesirable because it could lead to classifying an unstable case to be stable. Note that numerical energy functions were used in these simulations.</p><p>The numerical network-reduction BCU method is also applied to estimate the CCT of several faulted systems, modeled by the network-reduction, two-axis generator with a first-order exciter models. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref> lists some simulation results on the IEEE test system with 6 generators equipped with exciters. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> lists some simulation results on the 202-generator, 1293-bus power system with the classical generator model. Two methods were used in these simulations: the time-domain method and the BCU method. The results from the time-domain method are used as a benchmark. Again, the BCU method consistently gives slightly conservative results in estimating CCT. These results are in compliance with the analytical results of the controlling u.e.p. method, despite the fact that numerical energy functions were used in these simulations.</p></div>

Network-Preserving Power System Models</head><p>A numerical implementation of the conceptual BCU method for network-preserving power system models discussed in Section VII-F is presented below. system and the 202-generator, 1293-bus system discuss in the previous subsection.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">6</ref> displays the estimated CCT of the IEEE 50generator, 145-bus test system with different locations of three-phase faults using the time-domain method and the network-preserving BCU method. The load model used in this numerical study is a combination of 20% constant power, 20% constant current, and 60% constant impedance. The network-preserving BCU method is also applied to a nonlinear static load model, which is a combination of 20% constant power, 20% constant current, and 60% constant impedance. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> contains the simulation results of the 202-generator, 1293-bus. The simulation results are the estimated CCT's of the system with different locations of three-phase faults using the time-domain method and the BCU method with 1) constant impedance loads, and 2) a nonlinear static load which is a combination of 20% constant power, 20% constant current, and 60% constant impedance. Again, the computational performance of the network-preserving BCU method is that it consistently gives slightly conservative results in estimating CCT which is in compliance with the controlling u.e.p. method, despite the fact that numerical energy functions were used in these simulations. Moreover, the computational performance of the network-preserving BCU method seems to be very consistent when applied to different static load models. Quite often, power system operators need to cope with the following situation: for a given power system with a given contingency, called the base case, if some of the parameters in the system change (due to a disturbance, perhaps), called the new case, one must know how these changes affect the system stability as quickly as possible. Also, there is a great need of a fast, yet accurate method to determine the transient stability-constrained loading limits, power transfer limits and, furthermore, to decide how to make changes in the parameters, such as generation rescheduling, and load shedding in order to improve system transient behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numerous previous methods [31], [59],</head><p>[73], <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[82]</ref> have attempted to use the sensitivity of energy functions to changes in system parameters to determine the stability limits of systems. It is assumed in these methods that the mode of the controlling u.e.p. does not change. In general, this assumption may not be true for every case. A counterexample of the assumption on a 50-generator, 145-bus system was provided in [16].</p><p>The sensitivity-based BCU method also allows one to quickly determine the extent to which one may change real power generations in the system before jeopardizing its transient stability, or how much change is necessary in order to gain stability. The chief advantage of the sensitivity-based BCU method is that it does not make the assumption that the new case will have roughly the same controlling u.e.p. as the base case. The main idea behind the sensitivity-based BCU method is that the values of the state variables at the fault clearing time, Xcl, (i.e., the initial state of the postfault system) and at the exit point, X,, (of the artificial, dimension-reduction system) can be quickly estimated when changes are made to the parameters of the base case to which the BCU method has already been </p></div>

This application consists of two major components: a contingency screen program made up of a sequence of filters based on the BCU method and an on-line transient simulation program based on EPRI' s Extended Transient and Midterm Stability Program (ETMSP). A framework for on-line dynamic contingency screening, selection, and ranking is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">23</ref>.</p><p>In the prototype, a sequence of three contingency filters is applied to a list of contingencies. These three contingency filters are based on the three steps of the BCU method. The first filter, based on step one of the BCU method, is the fastest one. It uses the exit point on the stability boundary of the dimension-reduction system as an approximation for computing the energy margin. The second filter uses the minimum semigradient point, which is the second step of the BCU method. The third and most exact filter uses the controlling u.e.p. to compute the critical energy, which is the third step of the BCU method. Contingencies which are definitely stable are dropped from further analysis at each filter step. The computations for each contingency are cumulative through the three filters, avoiding the need to  A framework for on-line dynamic contingency screenrepeat computations. Cases identified as requiring further analysis are sent to the ETMSP for detailed time-domain assessments. Each filter is intended to be conservative and has been tested to be so (i.e., no unstable cases are misclassified as stable). The speed up achieved by using the BCU filters, developed by the Empros and Iowa State University, is more than six times faster than what would have been required to run a time-domain simulation on each contingency.</p><p>The prototype has been integrated into the control center at NSP and is intended to allow increased MW transfers from the north. The program has undergone an evaluation by NSP engineers and operators and is expected to provide significant dollar savings when completed as a production program.</p><p>Direct methods have also been demonstrated under EPRI sponsorship at the control center of Ontario <ref type="bibr">Hydro [46]</ref>. This program is an on-line transfer limit calculation based on the BCU method. The program uses a time-domain simulation program supplied by Ontario Hydro to compute the exit point at which the projected fault-on trajectory crosses the stability boundary of the artificial, dimensionreduction system. From there, a minimum gradient point search and a calculation of the controlling u.e.p. are completed. The results of the program include energy margins and sensitivities to power system parameters. This program has been integrated into the energy management system at Ontario Hydro and demonstrated to the industry at a workshop in December 1993. The program was validated using off-line analysis with a simulation program.</p><p>Previous EPRI-sponsored project results have shown that direct stability analysis is feasible for large power systems and it has several important applications. The EPRI software-DIRECT is a production-grade computer package for direct stability analysis of large-scale power systems. The latest version of DIRECT 4.0 uses the networkpreserving BCU method to compute the critical energy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. PERSPECTIVE</head><p>Direct methods provide advantages which make them a good complement to the traditional time-domain simulation approach. The current direction of development is to include direct methods within the simulation programs themselves. For example, the energy margin and its sensitivity to certain power system parameters are an effective complement which can significantly reduce the number of simulations required to compute power transfer limits. In the future one should expect direct methods will become components of commercial grade transient stability simulation programs. Yet, direct methods will need some improvements to be used as a reliable complement to the traditional time-domain simulation approach.</p><p>Direct methods have been based on the energy function theory for nonlinear autonomous systems. As such, there are several limitations on the applications of current direct methods; some of them are inherent to direct methods. These limitations may be classified as: the modeling limitation, the scenario limitation, the function limitation, and the accuracy limitation. Roughly speaking, the modeling limitation stems from the requirement of having an energy function for a given power system model, but not every power system model has an energy function associated with it <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>. The scenario limitation comes from the requirement of the initial condition of the postfault system, which must be obtained using the time-domain approach and which may not be available beforehand. This is an inherent limitation in direct methods. The function limitation shows that in theory several of the current direct methods are only applicable to power system models described by pure differential equations and work only for first-swing transient stability analysis.</p><p>A major limitation of direct methods in the past has been the simplicity of the models used in various direct method implementations in software programs. Recent work in this area has overcome much of this limitation. As to the function limitation stipulating that direct methods are only applicable to first swing instability, the direct method based on the controlling u.e.p. method has now been shown in this paper to provide useful information for identifying multiswing unstable cases. Regarding the accuracy and reliability of direct methods, this limitation can be significantly improved by the work (BCU method) presented in this paper for network-preserving power system models. In practical applications, the controlling u.e.p. method, in conjunction with the BCU method, has shown promise as a tool for fast approximate contingency screening (thereby improving performance) and efficiently computing operating limits.</p><p>The scenario limitation of direct methods still needs to be solved.</p><p>Given a power system stability model, the existence of an energy function and the ability to compute the controlling u.e.p. are essential for direct stability analysis of the underlying model. A systematic procedure of constructing energy functions for both network-reduction and network-preserving power system models is proposed in this paper. The BCU method extensively described in this paper is a systematic method of computing the controlling u.e.p. for large-scale power systems. It explores the special structure of the underlying model so as to define an artificial, dimension-reduction system which can capture all of the equilibrium points on the stability boundary of the underlying system. The BCU method then finds the controlling u.e.p. of the original system via the controlling u.e.p. of the dimension-reduction system which is much easier to find than that of the original system. Given a power system stability model with certain properties, there exists a corresponding version of the BCU method. The paper has demonstrated, through an exposition of the BCU method, that analytical results can sometimes lead to the development of reliable yet fast solution algorithms for solving problems. This further enhances the authors' belief that solving practical problems efficiently can be accomplished through a thorough understanding of the underlying theory, in conjunction with exploring the features of the practical problem under study.</p><p>This paper has also presented a general framework for the BCU method and developed a theoretical foundation for the BCU method for both the network-reduction and the network-preserving power system stability models. In addition to demonstrating its practical applications to online transient stability analysis, sufficient conditions for the BCU method to find the correct controlling u.e.p. relative to a given fault have also been derived. From a practical viewpoint, it would be usefulto know whether or not these sufficient conditions are always satisfied for practical largescale power systems. There are certainly other avenues we may explore in order to improve the reliablity, accuracy, and computational speed of the BCU method. For instance, the issue of how to find an optimal artificial dimensionreduction system such that, in addition to satisfying the static and dynamic properties presented in Section VI-C, it also has a desired level of smoothness on its stability boundary or it offers much milder sufficient condition for the BCU method to work (e.g., it removes part of the requirement of the one-parameter transversality condition).</p><p>A stability problem causing great concerns in power industry is the voltage-dip problem. This problem can be stated as follows: following a disturbance (event disturbance or load disturbance), whether or not the underlying power system will settle down to an acceptable steady-state (in the context of frequency and voltage) and during the transient, the system voltage will not dip to un-acceptable values (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>). The problem is particularly significant in the current operating condition of the North America's interconnected power network whose systems are now ~ P z f a u l t trajectory (Voltage Dip) T Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>. Following a disturbance (event disturbance or load disturbance), whether or not the underlying power system will settle down to an acceptable steady-state and during the transient, the system voltage will not dip to un-acceptable values operated very close to their security limits. Mathematically, the voltage dip problem can be stated a set of nonlinear equations with an determine whether or not the ensuing trajectories will settle down to a desired steady-state without resort to explicit numerical integrations of a whole set of nonlinear equations; furthermore, one wants to know whether during the transient, part of the state variables (related to voltage magnitudes at load buses) drop below a certain value, say 0.9 p.u. Alternatively, from a nonlinear system viewpoint, the problem can be stated in the following way: given a set of nonlinear equations with an initial condition, determine 1) whether or not the initial condition lies inside the stability region (region of attraction) of a desired stable equilibrium point and, 2) whether or not the projected system trajectory on the subspace spanned by the voltage magnitudes at load buses does not fall below a certain value. Obviously, the voltage-dip problem is very unique and challenging. It is imperative to extend the functionality of direct methods for solving the voltage-dip problems.</p><p>Further improvements in direct methods' limited modeling capability are desirable, especially to include an appropriate dynamic load modeling in the model. It is well known that inaccurate load modeling can lead to a power system operating in modes that result in actual system collapse or separation. Accurate load models capturing load behaviors during dynamics are therefore necessary for more precise calculations of power system controls and stability limits. Most of the load models used in direct methods are limited to the so-called static load models, where loads are represented as constant impedance, constant current, constant MVA, or some combinations of these three. These static load models may not adequately capture load behaviors during transient. Hence, it may prove rewarding to show that direct methods can be extended to structure-preserving stability models with sufficiently detailed load models (more accurate static load models or even adequate dynamic load models) and generator models with adequate nonlinear representations.</p><p>In recent years, practical experience has shown that a power system may become unstable ten to thirty seconds after a disturbance, even if it is stable in transient states. The power system is short-term stable and midterm unstable. One mechanism that may contribute to this phenomenon is that the initial state of the postfault system lies inside the stability region of the short-term power system model but lies outside the stability region of the midterm power system model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>. This points out the necessity of extending direct methods for midterm power system models. In this regard, it may prove useful to develop general functions (more general than the energy function) such that any nonlinear system having such a function has the following dynamic properties: 1) the w-limit set of any of its bounded trajectories consists only of equilibrium points and limit cycles, and 2) the function is nonincreasing along its trajectories. Such a development will allow one to apply direct methods to detailed power system models whose stability boundaries contain equilibrium points and limit cycles. An example of such a model can be found in <ref type="bibr">[75]</ref>.</p><p>Due to the upcoming practice of power wheeling and open access to transmission systems, the utilities are more often concerned with determining the limiting power transfer across a boundary or the limits on the real power generation sent out of a power station. This concern coupled with the need to share full utilization of transmission among utilities for economic transfer have made the problem associated with transient-stability constrained transfer limits a pressing issue. The determination of power transfer limits becomes much more important than ever. Direct methods should be capable of providing such information more timely and readily than the conventional time-domain simulation approach. Extension of direct methods in this direction will be welcome.</p><p>The major breakthroughs presented in this paper include a solid mathematical foundation for direct methods, development of a systematical procedure for constructing energy functions for both network-reduction and networkpreserving power system models, development of BCU methods for computing the controlling u.e.p. for networkpreserving models and practical demonstrations of on-line stability assessments based on the controlling u.e.p. method in conjunction with the BCU method. The remaining hurdles include the resolution of detailed modeling involving high-level nonlinearity limitations in loads and generators and the removal of the scenario limitation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.

(for the network-reduction model) can be traced back to the mid-1970's. In [61], Prabhakara and El-Abiad argued that the controlling u.e.p. is the u.e.p. which is closest to the fault-on trajectory. Athay et al. in [SI suggested that the controlling u.e.p. is the u.e.p. 'in the direction' of the fault-on trajectory. Ribbens-Pavella et al. [68] relate the controlling u.e.p. to the machine (or groups of machines) which first goes out of synchronism if the fault is sustained. Fouad et al. (351, associated the controlling u.e.p. with the 'mode of instability' of machines. These concepts have been used to develop several methods for computing the controlling u.e.p. The details of these methods can be found, for example in [37], [57], [58], [67].

In Step 2, the integration of the postfault dimension-reduction system can be replaced by the integration of the boundary-layer system of the postfault dimension-reduction system to accelerate the computational procedure. The remarks made on the numerical implementation of the conceptual networkreduction BCU method also apply to the above numerical network-preserving BCU method.</p><p>numerical network-preserving BCU method has also been tested on several power systems, modeled by a networkpreserving, classical generator with static nonlinear load representations. The static nonlinear load model is a combination of constant power, constant impedance and constant current. The simulation results presented in this subsection are on the IEEE 50-generator, 145-bus test is (U:,, w : , , e x YZ,, 0 ) .</p></div>
