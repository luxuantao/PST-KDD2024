<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Fractional calculus as an extension of usual calculus dates from the late seventeenth century and it is regarded as a generalization of derivation and integration of arbitrary order ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Compared with integer-order systems, fractional-order ones have apparent advantages in describing the memory and hereditary properties of different kinds of materials and processes. Moreover, fractional-order systems are more likely to be used to describe most of the real-world behaviors than integer-order ones because they can provide more practical value and accurate results. Therefore, many researchers have paid close attention to studying the dynamical behaviors of fractional-order systems and have drawn some wonderful results in the literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>).</p><p>In the past several decades, bidirectional associative memory neural networks (BAMNNs) have been successfully applied in the filed of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition because they generalize the single-layer auto-associative Hebbian circuit to a two-layer pattern matched hetero-associative correlation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>). The two-layer pattern matched heteroassociative circuit can help BAMNNs store and recall pattern pairs which are regarded as the bidirectionally stable states ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>). Accordingly, the reverberating interfered message between the two-layer circuit would be unavoidably involved in the information which is derived by decoding in BAM. That way, some hereditary properties present in this kind process of intelligent information. Given that fact, it is very important to take into account merging infinite memory into BAMNNs as the authors suggested in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>). On one hand, BAMNNs can be realized in a circuit where the self-feedback connection weights and the common connection weights are established by memristors. The memristor which was found by Chua ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>) is well-known as the fourth fundamental nonlinear circuit element. The other three basic nonlinear circuit elements are capacitor, inductor and resistor. Almost forty years later, a group of scientists from Hewlett-Packard library identified the memristor and employed it to build the prototype with the nanometer size ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>). Since then, the memristor has been substituted for resistor to emulate neural synapses in analog circuits because it owns memory and performances more like biological synapses than the resistor. There are many papers which verify that the memristor possesses the characteristic of pinched hysteresis. Owe to this characteristic, some researchers establish a new class of NNs named memristive or memristor-based neural networks (MNNs) by replacing resistors with memristors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>). Very recently, based on nonsmooth analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>), some authors studied memristive or memristorbased BAM neural networks (MBAMNNs) and investigated the various dynamical behaviors of BAMMNNs in order to realize their better applications in associative memories, neural learning and pattern recognition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>). On the other hand, as we shared at the beginning, fractional-order systems possess infinite memory and hereditary properties. In addition, time delays inevitably exist in dynamical systems and they may initiate undesirable dynamical behaviors such as divergence, oscillation, even or instability. Therefore, many researches about several dynamical behaviors of NNs with time delays become more and more significant and popular. From the above three perspectives, it is necessary to develop some economical and practical systems for fractional-order memristive bidirectional associative memory neural networks (FMBAMNNs) with time delays.</p><p>Moreover, synchronization has been an active topic in the area of nonlinear science since Pecora and Carroll introduced chaos synchronization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>). Very recently, many researchers showed more interest in the study of synchronization of fractional-order neural networks(FNNs). Up to now, there are many kinds of synchronization of FNNs such as global Mittag-Leffler synchronization, projective synchronization and so on ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>). The global Mittag-Leffler stability and synchronization was discussed for FMNNs by introducing a generalized Gronwall-like inequality of Caputo fractional derivative in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>), authors dealt with the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization for a class of FNNs considering discontinuous activations by employing a singular Gronwall inequality and applying Filippov solution theorem. Some new sufficient criteria were derived for achieving the projective synchronization of FMNNs by using a new hybrid controller in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). The above mentioned kinds of synchronization show that the trajectories of the slave system can catch the trajectories of the master system in infinite-time. In practice, it is extremely important that the synchronization should be reached in finite-time. Recently, many researchers have paid their close attention to the investigation of finite-time synchronization of NNs and many better results have been exhibited in the literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>). Especially, the finite-time synchronization was studied for NNs considering arbitrary time delays in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>). In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>), on the basis of two different time-delayed feedback controllers, authors derived some good criteria for the finite-time synchronization for NNs. Very recently, authors in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>) investigated the finitetime for MNNs by empolying analysis method, finite-time stability theorem and applying a proper feedback controller. The problem of finite-time synchronization was settled for FMNNs with time delays by applying Laplace transform, Mittag-Leffler function, the generalized Gronwall's inequality and linear feedback control method in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>).</p><p>Motivated by the above discussion, this paper is concerned with the finite-time synchronization for FMBAMNNs with time delays. The main contributions of this paper are the following aspects: (1) As the authors in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>) proposed the idea of circuit design, an economical class of FMBAMNNs is constructed by just using one pair of memristors to store multiple states of the input message while the snapes of FMNNs were designed with multiple memristors in earlier publications ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>).</p><p>(2) For the fractional-order α satisfying 0 &lt; α &lt; 1, based on Lyapunov theory, some easily checked criteria are obtained to achieve the finite-time synchronization of FMBAMNNs by mainly emoloying a new inequality about the Caputo derivative of absolute value function and a generalized Gronwall-like inequality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> Given that fractional-order α satisfying 1 &lt; α &lt; 2, based on theory of vector norm, matrix norm and comparison theorem, a relaxed judgment condition is derived to realize the finite-time synchronization of FMBAMNNs by mainly applying the generalized Gronwall's inequality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> The obtained criteria are simple in form rather than linear matrix inequalities, they are more easily checked and contribute to reducing the computational burden.</p></div>

In this paper, the corresponding conditions will be investigated for the finite-time synchronization of FMBAMNNs with α satisfying 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 as well as 1 &lt; α &lt; 2 based on different methods, respectively. So our studied NNs are more general and practical.</p><p>According to the above discussion, the values of c i (x i (t)) and c j (y j (t)) change as the states x i (t) and y j (t) vary. It is obvious that c i (x i (t)) and c j (y j (t)) are piecewise continuous even or discontinuous functions at most two points of discontinuity such as ±S i and ±T j , respectively.

For fractional-order α satisfying 1 &lt; α &lt; 2, this paper provides a judgment condition for the problem of the finite-time Mittag-Leffler synchronization of FBAMNNs with time delays by employing some properties of the vector norm and matrix norm and applying comparison theorem in the corresponding norm. The derived condition in Theorem 2 is also easily verified and fast to be calculated. Remark 13. In this paper, for given different fractional-order α, different theoretical methods are applied in dealing with the corresponding problems of the finite-time Mittag-Leffler synchronization of FBAMNNs with time delays. The above applied methods can be popularized to settle other dynamical behaviors of fractional-order systems.</p></div>

For given different fractional-order α, different theoretical methods are employed   to settle the corresponding problems of the finite-time Mittag-Leffler synchronization of FBAMNNs with time delays. The above applied methods can be popularized to settle other dynamical behaviors of fractional-order systems.
