<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Unsupervised protein language models trained across millions of diverse sequences learn structure and function of proteins. Protein language models studied to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evolutionarily related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families. The performance of the model surpasses current state-ofthe-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior state-of-the-art protein language models.</p></div>

Sequence variation within a protein family conveys information about the structure of the protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Yanofsky et al., 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Altschuh et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Göbel et al., 1994)</ref>. Since evolution is not free to choose the identity of amino acids independently at sites that are in contact in the folded three-dimensional structure, patterns are imprinted onto the sequences selected by evolution. Constraints on the structure of a protein can be inferred from patterns in related sequences. The predominant unsupervised approach is to fit a Markov Random Field in the form of a Potts Model to a family of aligned sequences to extract a coevolutionary 1 UC Berkeley 2 Work performed during internship at FAIR. 3 Facebook AI Research 4 New York University.

This approach fits large neural networks with shared parameters across millions of diverse sequences, rather than fitting a model separately to each family of sequences. At inference time, a single forward pass of an end-to-end model replaces the multistage pipeline, involving sequence search, alignment, and model fitting steps, standard in bioinformatics. Recently, promising results have shown that protein language models learn secondary structure, long-range contacts, and function via the unsupervised objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rives et al., 2020)</ref>, making them an alternative to the classical pipeline. While small and recurrent models fall well short of state-of-the-art <ref type="bibr">(Rao et al., 2019)</ref>, the internal representations of very large transformer models are competitive with Potts models for unsupervised structure learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rives et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rao et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Potts models have an important advantage over protein lan-guage models during inference. The input to the Potts model is a set of sequences. Inference is performed by fitting a model that directly extracts the covariation signal from the input. Current protein language models take a single sequence as input for inference. Information about evolutionary variation must be stored in the parameters of the model during training. As a result, protein language models require many parameters to represent the data distribution well.</p><p>In this work, we unify the two paradigms within a protein language model that takes sets of aligned sequences as input, but shares parameters across many diverse sequence families. Like prior protein language models operating on individual sequences, the approach benefits from learning from common patterns across protein families, allowing information to be generalized and transferred between them. By taking sets of sequences as input, the model gains the ability to extract information during inference, which improves the parameter efficiency.</p><p>We introduce the MSA Transformer, a model operating on sets of aligned sequences. The input to the model is a multiple sequence alignment. The architecture interleaves attention across the rows and columns of the alignment as in axial attention <ref type="bibr">(Ho et al., 2019)</ref>. We propose a variant of axial attention which shares a single attention map across the rows. The model is trained using the masked language modeling objective. Self supervision is performed by training the model to reconstruct a corrupted MSA.</p><p>We train an MSA Transformer model with 100M parameters on a large dataset (4.3 TB) of 26 million MSAs, with an average of 1192 sequences per MSA. The resulting model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, outperforming Potts models and protein language models with 650M parameters. The model improves over state-of-the-art unsupervised contact prediction methods across all multiple sequence alignment depths, with an especially significant advantage for MSAs with lower depth. Information about the contact pattern emerges directly in the tied row attention maps. Evaluated in a supervised contact prediction pipeline, features captured by the MSA Transformer outperform trRosetta <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref> on the CASP13 and CAMEO test sets. We find that high precision contact predictions can be extracted from small sets of diverse sequences, with good results from as few as 8-16 sequences. We investigate how the model performs inference by independently destroying the covariation or sequence patterns in the input, finding that the model uses both signals to make predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Unsupervised Contact Prediction The standard approach to unsupervised protein structure prediction is to identify pairwise statistical dependencies between the columns of an MSA, which are modeled as a Potts model Markov Random Field (MRF). Since exact inference is computationally intractable, a variety of methods have been proposed to efficiently fit the MRF, including mean-field inference <ref type="bibr">(Morcos et al., 2011)</ref>, sparse-inverse covariance estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jones et al., 2012)</ref>, and the current state-of-the-art pseudolikelihood maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Balakrishnan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ekeberg et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Seemayer et al., 2014)</ref>. In this work we use Potts models fit with psuedolikelihood maximization as a baseline, and refer to features generated from Potts models as "co-evolutionary features." Making a connection with the attention mechanism we study here, <ref type="bibr">Bhattacharya et al. (2020)</ref> show that a single layer of self-attention can perform essentially the same computation as a Potts model.</p><p>Deep Models of MSAs Several groups have proposed to replace the shallow MRF with a deep neural network. Riesselman et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) train deep variational autoencoders on MSAs to predict function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Riesselman et al. (2019)</ref> train autoregressive models on MSAs, but discard the alignment, showing that function can be learned from unaligned sequences. In contrast to our approach which is trained on many MSAs, these existing models are trained on a single set of related sequences and do not provide a direct method of extracting protein contacts.</p><p>Supervised Structure Prediction Supervised structure prediction using deep neural networks has driven groundbreaking progress on the protein structure prediction problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Senior et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jumper et al., 2020)</ref>. Initial models used coevolutionary features <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Senior et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Adhikari &amp; Elofsson, 2020)</ref>. Recently MSAs have been proposed as input to supervised structure prediction methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mirabello &amp; Wallner (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Kandathil et al. (2020)</ref> study models which take MSAs as input directly, respectively using 2D convolutions or GRUs to process the input. More recently, AlphaFold2 <ref type="bibr">(Jumper et al., 2020)</ref> uses attention to process MSAs in an end-to-end model supervised with structures.</p><p>The central difference in our work is to model a collection of MSAs using unsupervised learning. This results in a model that contains features potentially useful for a range of downstream tasks. We use the emergence of structure in the internal representations of the model to measure the ability of the model to capture biology from sequences. This is a fundamentally distinct problem setting from supervised structure prediction. The MSA Transformer is trained in a purely unsupervised manner and learns contacts without being trained on protein structures.</p><p>Large protein sequence databases contain billions of sequences and are undergoing exponential growth. Unsupervised methods can directly use these datasets for learning, while supervised methods are limited to supervision from the hundreds of thousands of crystallized structures. Unsupervised methods can learn from regions of sequence space not covered by structural knowledge.</p><p>Protein Language Models Protein language modeling has emerged as a promising approach for unsupervised learning of protein sequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bepler &amp; Berger (2019)</ref> combined unsupervised sequence pre-training with structural supervision to produce sequence embeddings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alley et al. (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Heinzinger et al. (2019)</ref> showed that LSTM language models capture some biological properties. Simultaneously, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rives et al. (2020)</ref> proposed to model protein sequences with self-attention, showing that transformer protein language models capture accurate information of structure and function in their representations. <ref type="bibr">Rao et al. (2019)</ref> evaluated a variety of protein language models across a panel of benchmarks concluding that small LSTMs and transformers fall well short of features from the bioinformatics pipeline.</p><p>A combination of model scale and architecture improvements has been instrumental to recent successes in protein language modeling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Elnaggar et al. (2020)</ref> study a variety of transformer variants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rives et al. (2020)</ref> show that large transformer models produce state-of-the-art features across a variety of tasks. Notably, the internal representations of transformer protein language models are found to directly represent contacts. <ref type="bibr">Vig et al. (2020)</ref> find that specific attention heads of pre-trained transformers correlate directly with protein contacts. <ref type="bibr">Rao et al. (2021)</ref> combine multiple attention heads to predict contacts more accurately than Potts models, despite using just a single sequence for inference.</p><p>Alternatives to the masked language modeling objective have also been explored, such as conditional generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Madani et al., 2020)</ref> and contrastive loss functions <ref type="bibr">(Lu et al., 2020)</ref>. Most relevant to our work, <ref type="bibr">Sturmfels et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sercu et al. (2020)</ref> study alternative learning objectives using sets of sequences for supervision. <ref type="bibr">Sturmfels et al. (2020)</ref> extended the unsupervised language modeling to predict the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sercu et al. (2020)</ref> used amortized optimization to simultaneously predict profiles and pairwise couplings. However, prior work on protein language models has not considered sets of sequences as inputs to the language model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>Transformers are powerful sequence models capable of passing information from any position to any other position <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. However, they are not trivially applied to a set of aligned sequences. Naively concatenating M sequences of length L in an MSA would allow attention across all sequences, but the (M L) 2 self-attention maps would be prohibitively memory-intensive. The main con-tribution of this paper is to extend transformer pre-training to operate on an MSA, while respecting its structure as an M × L character matrix.</p><p>We describe the input MSA as a matrix x ∈ R M ×L , where rows correspond to sequences in the MSA, columns are positions in the aligned sequence, and entries x mi take integer values<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> encoding the amino acid identity of sequence m at position i. After embedding the input, each layer has a R M ×L×d state as input and output. For the core of the transformer, we adapt the axial attention approach from <ref type="bibr">Ho et al. (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Child et al. (2019)</ref>. This approach alternates attention over rows and columns of the 2D state (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This sparsity pattern in the attention over the MSA brings the attention cost to O(LM 2 ) for the column attention, and O(M L 2 ) for the row attention.</p><p>Feedforward Layers We deviate from <ref type="bibr">Ho et al. (2019)</ref> in the interleaving of the feedforward layers. Rather than applying a feedforward layer after each row or column attention, we apply row and column attention followed by a single feedforward layer (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This choice follows more closely the transformer decoder architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tied Row Attention</head><p>The standard implementation of axial attention allows for independent attention maps for each row and column of the input. However, in an MSA each sequence should have a similar structure; indeed, directcoupling analysis exploits this fact to learn contact information. To leverage this shared structure we hypothesize it would be beneficial to tie the row attention maps between the sequences in the MSA. As an additional benefit, tied attention reduces the memory footprint of the row attentions from O(M L 2 ) to O(L 2 ).</p><p>Let M be the number of rows, d be the hidden dimension and Q m , K m be the matrix of queries and keys for the m-th row of input. We define tied row attention (before softmax is applied) to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M m=1 Q m K T m λ(M, d)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The denominator λ(M, d) would be the normalization constant √ d in standard scaled-dot product attention. In tied row attention, we explore two normalization functions to prevent attention weights linearly scaling with the number of input sequences:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">λ(M, d) = M √ d (mean normaliza- tion) and λ(M, d) = √ M d (square-root normalization).</formula><p>Our final model uses square-root normalization. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-training Objective</head><p>We adapt the masked language modeling objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> to the MSA setting. The loss for an MSA x, and masked MSA x is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L MLM (x; θ) = (m,i)∈mask log p(x mi | x; θ)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The probabilities are the output of the MSA transformer, softmax normalized over the amino acid vocabulary independently per position i in each sequence m. We consider masking tokens uniformly at random over the MSA or masking entire columns of the MSA, and achieve the best performance by masking tokens uniformly at random over the MSA (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>). Note that the masked token can be predicted not only from context amino acids at different positions but also from related sequences at the same position.</p><p>Pre-training Dataset Models are trained on a dataset of 26 million MSAs. An MSA is generated for each UniRef50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Suzek et al., 2007)</ref> sequence by searching UniClust30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mirdita et al., 2017)</ref> with HHblits <ref type="bibr">(Steinegger et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The average depth of the MSAs is 1192. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> for MSA depth distribution. MSA Subsampling During Inference At inference time, memory is a much smaller concern. Nevertheless we do not provide the full MSA to the model as it would be computationally expensive and the model's performance can decrease when the input is much larger than that used during training. Instead, we explore four strategies for subsampling the sequences provided to the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models and Training</head><p>• Random: This strategy parallels the one used at training time, and selects random sequences from the MSA (ensuring that the reference sequence is always included).</p><p>• Diversity Maximizing: This is a greedy strategy which starts from the reference and adds the sequence with highest average hamming distance to current set of sequences.</p><p>• Diversity Minimizing: This strategy is equivalent to the Diversity Maximizing strategy, but adds the sequence with lowest average hamming distance. It is used to explore the effects of diversity on model performance.</p><p>• HHFilter: This strategy applies hhfilter <ref type="bibr">(Steinegger et al., 2019)</ref> with the -diff M parameter, which returns M or more sequences that maximize diversity (the result is usually close to M ). If more than M sequences are returned we apply the Diversity Maximizing strategy on top of the output. </p></div>

These baselines implement the intuition that a simple model could use the column frequencies to make a prediction at the masked positions, or copy the identity of the missing character from the most similar sequence in the input. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> reports masked language modeling performance. The MSA Transformer model (denoising accuracy of 56.6) significantly outperforms the PSSM (accuracy 38.9) and nearest-neighbor (accuracy 39.1) baselines.</p></div>

For the single-sequence protein language models we use the sequence belonging to the structure as input. We also compare against Potts models using the APC-corrected <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dunn et al., 2008)</ref> Frobenius norm of the coupling matrix computed on the MSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kamisetty et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> compares unsupervised contact prediction performance of the models.

The CASP13-FM test set consists of 31 free modeling domains (from 25 targets); the CAMEO hard targets are a set of 131 domains (out of which we evaluate on the 129 that fit within the 1024 character maximum context length of the model). On the CASP13-FM test set, unsupevised contact prediction with the MSA Transformer (42.7 top-L long-range precision) is competitive with the trRosetta base model (42.4 top-L long-range precision), a fully supervised structure prediction model.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Model Analysis</head><p>We examine how the model uses its input MSA in experiments to understand the role of sequence diversity, attention patterns, and covariation in the MSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Effect of MSA diversity</head><p>The diversity of the input sequences strongly influences inference of structure. We explore three inference time strategies to control the diversity of the input sequence sets: (i) diversity maximizing, (ii) diversity minimizing, and (iii) random selection (see Section 3). Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows average performance across the test set for each selection strategy as the number of sequences used for input increases. Two approaches to maximize diversity, greedy hamming distance maximization and hhfilter, perform equivalently. Both strategies surpass ESM-1b performance with just 16 input sequences. In comparison, the diversity minimizing strategy, hamming distance minimization, performs poorly, requiring 256 sequences to surpass ESM-1b. Random selection performs well, although it falls behind the diversity maximizing strategies. The qualitative effects of MSA diversity are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, where the addition of just one high-diversity sequence outperforms the addition of 31 low-diversity sequences.</p><p>In principle, the model's attention could allow it to identify and focus on the most informative parts of the input MSA. We find row attention heads that preferentially attend to highly variable columns. We also identify specific column attention heads that attend to more informative sequences. In this experiment random subsampling is used to select inputs for the model. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> compares the distribution of attention weights with two measures of MSA diversity: (i) per-column entropy of the MSA; and (ii) computed sequence weights (Appendix A.13). Per column entropy gives a measure of how variable a position is in the MSA. Computed sequence weights measure how informative a sequence is in the context of the other sequences in the MSA. Sequences with few similar sequences receive high weights. The maximum average Pearson correlation between a row attention head and column entropy is 0.59. The maximum average Pearson correlation between a column attention head and sequence weights is 0.58. These correlations between attention weights and measures of MSA diversity suggest the model is specifically looking for informative sequences when processing the input. 5ahw, chain: A) of model performance after independently shuffling each column of an MSA to destroy covariance information, and after independently permuting the order of positions to destroy sequence patterns. The MSA Transformer maintains reasonable performance under both conditions. A Potts model fails on the covariance-shuffled MSA, while a single-sequence language model (ESM-1b) fails on the position-shuffled sequence. Right: Model performance before and after shuffling, binned by depth of the original (non-subsampled) MSA. 1024 sequence selected with hhfilter are used as input to MSA Transformer and Potts models. MSAs with fewer than 1024 sequences are not considered in this analysis. Average Top-L long-range precision drops from 52.9 (no ablation) to 15.9 (shuffled covariance) and 27.9 (shuffled positions) respectively. A Null (random guessing) baseline is also considered. Potts model performance drops to the Null baseline under the first condition and ESM-1b performance drops to the Null baseline under the second condition. The MSA Transformer produces reasonable predictions under both scenarios, implying it uses both modes of inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Attention Corresponds to Protein Contacts</head><p>In Section 4.1, we use the heads in the model's tied row attention directly to predict contacts in the protein's threedimensional folded structure. Following <ref type="bibr">Rao et al. (2021)</ref> we fit a sparse logistic regression to the model's row attention maps to identify heads that correspond with contacts. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the weight values in the learned sparse logistic regression fit using 20 structures. A sparse subset (55 / 144) of heads are predictive of protein contacts. The most predictive heads are concentrated in the final layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Inference: Covariance vs. Sequence Patterns</head><p>Potts models and single-sequence language models predict protein contacts in fundamentally different ways. Potts models are trained on a single MSA; they extract information directly from the covariance between mutations in columns of the MSA. Single-sequence language models do not have access to the MSA, and instead make predictions based on patterns seen during training. The MSA Transformer may use both covariance-based and pattern-based inference. To disentangle the two modes, we independently ablate the covariance and sequence patterns in the model's input via random shuffling. To ensure that there is enough information in the input for covariance-based extraction to succeed, we subsample each MSA to 1024 sequences using hhfilter, and apply the model to unshuffled and shuffled inputs. To avoid the confound of some MSAs having fewer sequences, we only consider MSAs with at least 1024 sequences.</p><p>To remove covariance information, we randomly permute the values in each column of the MSA. This preserves percolumn amino acid frequencies (PSSM information) while destroying pairwise correlations between columns. Under this condition, Potts model performance drops to the random guess baseline. Since ESM-1b takes a single sequence as input, the permutation trivially produces the same sequence, and the result is unaffected. Unlike the Potts model, the MSA Transformer retains some ability to predict contacts, which increases sharply as a function of MSA Depth. This indicates that the model can make predictions from patterns in the sequence profile in the absence of covariance.</p><p>To remove sequence patterns seen during training, we randomly permute the order of positions (columns) in the MSA. This preserves all covariance information between pairs of columns, but results in an input that is highly dissimilar to a real protein. Under this condition, Potts model performance is unaffected since its parameterization is invariant to sequence order. ESM-1b performance drops to the random guess baseline. The MSA Transformer does depend on sequence order, and predicts spurious contacts along the diagonal of the reordered sequence. When predicted contacts with sequence separation &lt; 6 are removed, the remaining predictions align with the correct contacts. Model performance does not increase significantly with MSA depth. This shows the model can predict directly from covariance when presented with sequence patterns unobserved in training.</p><p>Together these ablations independently destroy the information used by Potts models and single-sequence language models, respectively. Under both conditions, the MSA Transformer maintains some capability to predict contacts, demonstrating that it uses both modes of inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Prior work in unsupervised protein language modeling has focused on inference from individual sequences. We study an approach to perform inference from a set of aligned sequences in an MSA. We use axial attention to efficiently parameterize attention over the rows and columns of the MSA. This approach enables the model to extract information from dependencies in the input set and generalize patterns across MSAs. We find the internal representations of the model enable state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than current protein language models. While supervised methods have produced breakthrough results for protein structure prediction <ref type="bibr">(Jumper et al., 2020)</ref>, unsupervised learning provides a way to extract the information contained in massive datasets of sequences produced by low cost gene sequencing. Unsupervised methods can learn from billions of sequences, enabling generalization to regions of sequence space not covered by structural knowledge.</p><p>Models fit to MSAs are widely used in computational biology including in applications such as fitness landscape prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Riesselman et al., 2018)</ref>, pathogenicity prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sundaram et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frazer et al., 2020)</ref>, remote homology detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hou et al., 2018)</ref>, and protein design <ref type="bibr">(Russ et al., 2020)</ref>. The improvements we observe for structure learning suggest the unsupervised language modeling approach here could also apply to these problems.</p><p>Prior work in protein language models has established a link between the scale of models and performance across a variety of prediction tasks related to structure and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rives et al., 2020)</ref>. Further scaling the approach studied here in the number of parameters and input sequences is a potential direction for investigating the limits of unsupervised learning for protein sequences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1. Unsupervised Contact Prediction</head><p>For unsupervised contact prediction, we adopt the methodology from <ref type="bibr">Rao et al. (2021)</ref>, which shows that sparse logistic regression trained on the attention maps of a single-sequence transformer is sufficient to predict protein contacts using a small number (between 1 − 20) of training structures. To predict the probability of contact between amino acids at position i and j, the attention maps from each layer and head are independently symmetrized and corrected with APC <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dunn et al., 2008)</ref>. The input features are then the values ālhij for each layer l and head h. The models have 12 layers and 12 heads for a total of 144 attention heads. An L1-regularization coefficient of 0.15 is applied. The regression is trained on all contacts with sequence separation ≥ 6. 20 structures are used for training. Trained regression weights are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>.</p></div>

The UniRef50 clusters are partitioned randomly in 90% train and 10% test sets. For each sequence, we construct an MSA using HHblits, version 3.1.0. <ref type="bibr">(Steinegger et al., 2019)</ref> against the UniClust30 2017−10 database <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mirdita et al., 2017)</ref>.

Ablation Studies</head><p>Ablation studies are conducted over a set of seven hyperparameters listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>. Since the cost of an exhaustive search over all combinations of hyperparameters is prohibitive, we instead train an exhaustive search over four of the hyperparameters (embedding size, block order, tied attention, and masking pattern) for 10k updates. The best run is then selected as the base hyperparameter setting for the Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. Validation perplexity and denoising accuracy on UniRef50 validation MSAs. PSSM probabilities and nearest-neighbor matching are used as baselines. To compute perplexity under the PSSM, we construct PSSMs using the input MSA, taking the cross-entropy between the PSSM and a one-hot encoding of the masked amino acid. When calculating PSSM probabilities, we search over pseudocounts in the range [10 −10 , 10), and select 10 −2 , which minimizes perplexity. For denoising accuracy, the argmax for each column is used. For nearest-neighbor matching, masked tokens are predicted using the values from the sequence with minimum hamming distance to the masked sequence. This does not provide a probability distribution, so perplexity cannot be calculated. MSAs with depth 1 are ignored, since the baselines fail in this condition. Perplexity ranges from 1 for a perfect model to 21 for a uniform model selecting over the common amino acids and gap token.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.10. MSA Positional Embedding</head><p>An MSA is an unordered set of sequences. However, due to the tools used to construct MSAs, there may be some pattern to the ordering of sequences in the MSA. We therefore examine the use of a learned MSA positional embedding in addition to the existing learned sequence positional embedding. The positional embedding for a sequence is then a learned function of its position in the input MSA (not in the full MSA). Subsampled sequences in the input MSA are sorted according to their relative ordering in the full MSA. We find that the inclusion of an MSA positional embedding does modestly increase model performance, and therefore include it in our final model.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5. Embedding Size (D)</head><p>Since the MSA Transformer is provided with more information than single sequence protein language models, it is possible that many fewer parameters are needed to learn the data distribution. To test this hypothesis we train a model with half the embedding size (384 instead of 768) resulting in 30M total parameters. The resulting model achieves a Top-L long-range precision of 52.8 after 100k updates, 3.5 points lower than the baseline model. This suggests that model size is still an important factor in contact precision, although also shows that a model with fewer than 30M parameters can still outperform 650M and 3B parameter single-sequence models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.6. Masking Pattern</head><p>We consider two strategies for applying BERT masking to the MSA: uniform and column. Uniform masking applies masking uniformly at random across the MSA. Column masking always masks full columns of the MSA. This makes the training objective substantially more difficult since the model cannot look within a column of an MSA for information about masked tokens. We find that column masking is significantly worse (by almost 20 points) than uniform masking. One possible explanation is that column masking removes all direct signal for training column attention. It is possible that a combination of uniform and column attention could improve performance further; we leave this for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.7. Block Ordering</head><p>Row attention followed by column attention slightly outperforms column attention followed by row attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.8. Tied Attention</head><p>We consider three strategies for row attention: untied, mean normalization, and square root normalization (see Section 3). We find that tied attention substantially outperforms untied attention and that square root normalization outperforms mean normalization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.9. Masking Percentage</head><p>As the MSA Transformer has more context than single sequence models, its training objective is substantially easier than that of single sequence models. Therefore, we explore whether increasing the masking percentage (and thereby increasing task difficulty) would improve the model. How-  The fraction of attention on an amino acid k is defined as the average over the dataset of a lh i 1{xi == k}, where xi is a particular token in the input MSA and a lh is the attention in a particular layer and head. KL Divergence is large for early layers but decreases in later layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.11. Subsample Strategy</head><p>At training time we explore two subsampling strategies. The first strategy is adapted from Yang et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>): we sample the number of output sequences from a log-uniform distribution, with a maximum of N/L sequences to avoid exceeding the maximum tokens we are able to fit in GPU memory. Then, we sample that number of sequences uniformly from the MSA, ensuring that the reference sequence is always chosen. In the second strategy, we always sample the full N/L sequences from the MSA. In our hyperparameter search, most models use the first strategy, while our final model uses the second. We find no statistically significant difference in performance between the two strategies. However, it is possible that the log-uniform strategy would help prevent overfitting and ultimately perform better after more training.</p><p>The CCMpred implementation of Potts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Balakrishnan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ekeberg et al., 2013)</ref>, UniRep <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alley et al., 2019)</ref>, Se-qVec <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Heinzinger et al., 2019)</ref>, TAPE transformer <ref type="bibr">(Rao et al., 2019)</ref>, ESM-1b <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rives et al., 2020)</ref>, ProtBERT-BFD, and ProTrans-T5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Elnaggar et al., 2020)</ref> are used as supervised contact prediction comparisons. In Table <ref type="table">8</ref> we show the complete results for long-range precision over the CASP-13 FM targets and CAMEO-hard domains referenced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref>. All baseline models are trained for 200 epochs with a batch size of 4.</p><p>A.12. Attention to Amino Acids <ref type="bibr">Vig et al. (2020)</ref> examine the distribution of amino acids attended to by single-sequence models. The attention in single-sequence models is roughly equivalent to the rowattention in our model, but there is no column-attention analogue. We therefore examine the distribution of amino acids attended to by the column attention heads. In Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> we show the KL-divergence between the distribution of attention across amino acids and the background distribution of amino acids. The divergence is large for earlier layers in the model but decreases in later layers, suggesting the model stops focusing on the amino acid identities in favor of focusing on other properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.13. Sequence Weights</head><p>Sequence reweighting is a common technique used for fitting Potts models which helps to compensate for data bias in MSAs <ref type="bibr">(Morcos et al., 2011)</ref>. Informally, sequence reweighting downweights groups of highly similar sequences to prevent them from having as large of an effect on the model. The sequence weight w i is defined as,</p><p>where x i , x j are the i-th and j-th sequences in the MSA, d hamming is the hamming distance between two sequences normalized by sequence length, and w i is the sequence weight of the i-th sequence.</p></div>			</div>
