<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Two related problems are treated in continuous time. First, the state agreement problem is studied for coupled nonlinear differential equations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction.</head><p>This paper studies a dynamical system that is the interconnection of subsystems. Examples are abundant in biology, physics, engineering, ecology, and social science: e.g., a biochemical reaction network <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, coupled Kuramoto oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>, arrays of chaotic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>, a swarm of organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>, and a group of autonomous agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>. We model such systems by coupled nonlinear differential equations in state form. Pioneering work on such coupled dynamical systems from a structural point of view is that of Siljak, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>.</p><p>State agreement means that the states of the subsystems are all equal. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> studies a group of individuals who must act together as a team; each individual has its own subjective probability distribution for the unknown value of some parameter. How the group might reach a consensus and form a common subjective probability distribution for the parameter is a state agreement problem. In other contexts, state agreement arises as synchronization in theoretical physics, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref>, and consensus in computer science, particularly in distributed computing, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Central to the state agreement problem is the graph describing the interaction structure in the interconnected system-that is, who is coupled to whom. And a central question is, What properties of the interaction graph lead to state agreement? Most existing work has dealt with static graphs with a particular topology, such as rings <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>, cyclic digraphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, and fully connected graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, or with static graphs having an unspecified topology but a certain connectedness. Example frameworks are coupled cell systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, coupled oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>, multiagent systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>, and formations of unicycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Of course, a static graph simplifies the state agreement problem and allows one to focus on the difficulties caused by the nonlinear dynamics of the nodes.</p><p>The more interesting situation is when the interaction graph is time varying. From the point of view of control theory, the most suitable mathematical model for these setups is a switched interconnected system. However, attempts to understand how the switching affects the collective system behavior had been hampered by the lack of suitable analysis tools. Recently, however, great strides have been made <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> by characterizing the convergence of infinite products of certain types of nonnegative matrices in a linear discrete-time setup with an undirected interaction graph. For the switched linear continuous-time system model and a directed graph, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> uses the graph Laplacian and the properties of some special matrices to prove asymptotic state agreement under certain graphical conditions. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> uses the common Lyapunov function technique for the switched linear continuous-time system and shows that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing the average-consensus problem. Two other works on state agreement for linear continuous-time systems are <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, which deals with random networks, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, which addresses the deterministic time-varying case.</p><p>However, many real systems are nonlinear in addition to having time-varying interaction among subsystems. Examples are systems of coupled oscillators. For nonlinear interconnected systems with time-varying interaction, new tools are required. A novel approach is taken by Moreau in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>: The framework is nonlinear and discrete-time, and the stability analysis is based upon a blend of graph-theoretic and system-theoretic tools, with the notion of convexity being key. The idea is, roughly speaking, that if every agent always moves toward the relative interior of the convex hull of the set of neighbor agents at each step, state agreement will be achieved. The result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> was recently generalized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> as follows: The setup is still a discretetime system, but each agent moves towards the relative interior of a set which is a function, not necessarily the convex hull, of the present and past states of neighbor agents. In this way communication delays can be accommodated.</p><p>One concrete instance of the state agreement problem is the rendezvous problem for autonomous mobile robots. Suppose the robots' fields of view have a fixed radius. Then the robots may come into and go out of sensor range of each other, and the interaction graph is therefore state dependent instead of time dependent. For this problem, some distributed algorithms were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>, with the objective of getting the robots to congregate at a common location (achieving rendezvous). These algorithms were extended to various synchronous and asynchronous stop-andgo strategies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>.</p><p>This paper makes two main contributions. The first is the continuous-time counterpart to the result of Moreau <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. We borrow heavily from Moreau's geometric concepts and proof structure; we suggest, however, that the continuous-time case presents some considerable challenges, as one will see from the details of our proof. Thus our contribution to this problem is primarily technical in nature. As an example application, we apply our result to make new conclusions about synchronization of coupled Kuramoto oscillators. The second contribution of this paper is a solution of the continuous-time rendezvous problem for kinematic point-mass robots; we use the circumcenter control law of Ando et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and give the first proof of convergence in continuous time.</p></div>

The convex hull of S ⊂ R m is denoted co(S). The convex hull of a finite set of points x 1 , . . . , x n ∈ R m is a polytope, denoted co{x 1 , . . . , x n }.</p><p>Let S ⊂ R m be convex. If S contains the origin, the smallest subspace containing S is the carrier subspace, denoted lin(S). The relative interior of S, denoted ri(S), is the interior of S when it is regarded as a subset of lin(S) and the relative topology is used, and likewise for the relative boundary, denoted rb(S). If S does not contain the origin, it must be translated by an arbitrary vector: Let v be any point in S and let lin(S) denote the smallest subspace containing Sv. Then ri(S) is the interior of S when it is regarded as a subset of the affine subspace v + lin(S), and similarly for rb(S).</p><p>A nonempty set K ⊂ R m is a cone if λy ∈ K when y ∈ K and λ &gt; 0.

Thus the set T (y, S) is nontrivial only on ∂S, the boundary of S. In particular, if S contains only one point, y, then T (y, S) = {0}. In geometric terms the tangent cone for y ∈ ∂S is a cone centered at the origin which contains all vectors whose directions point from y "inside" (or they are "tangent to") the set S.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>The state agreement problem: Main results. Our setup is a general interconnection of nonlinear subsystems, where the vector fields can switch within a finite family. We associate to each vector field a directed graph based in a natural way on the interaction structure of the subsystems; this is called an interaction digraph in the present paper. Assuming that the vector fields satisfy a certain subtangentiality condition, we show that asymptotic state agreement is achieved if and only if the dynamic interaction digraph has the property of being sufficiently connected over time, in a certain technical sense. Most of the proofs are deferred to section 5.</p><p>To formalize the notion of a switched interconnected system, first consider a family of systems ẋ1 = f 1 p (x 1 , . . . , x n ) . . . ẋn = f n p (x 1 , . . . , x n ), where x i ∈ R m is the state of subsystem i and where the index p belongs to a finite set P. Notice that the subsystems share a common state space, R m . Introducing the aggregate state x ∈ R mn , we have the concise form ẋ = f p (x), p ∈ P, <ref type="bibr">(3.1)</ref> where for each p ∈ P, f p : R mn → R mn .</p><p>We now associate to each vector field f p an interaction digraph G p capturing the interaction structure of the n subsystems (agents).</p><p>Definition 3.1 (interaction digraph). The interaction digraph G p = (V, E p ) consists of</p><p>• a finite set V of n nodes, each node i modeling agent i;</p><p>• an arc set E p representing the links between agents. An arc from node j to node i indicates that agent j is a neighbor of agent i in the sense that f i p depends on x j ; i.e., there exist x 1 j , x 2 j ∈ R m such that Let C i p (x) = co{x i , x j : j ∈ N i (p)} denote the polytope in R m formed by the states of agent i and its neighbors. Also, it is convenient to introduce a subset S ⊂ R m of the common state space that plays the role of a region of focus. In our state agreement problem, initial states of the agents will be in S and agreement will occur in S. Let I 0 denote the index set {1, . . . , n} and assume that, for each i ∈ I 0 and each p ∈ P, the vector fields f i p : R mn → R m satisfy the following two assumptions: A1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f i p (x 1 , . . . , x 1 j , . . . , x n ) = f i p (x 1 , . . . , x 2 j , . . . , x n ). The set of neighbors of agent i is denoted N i (p).</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">f i p is locally Lipschitz on S n . A2. For all x ∈ S n , f i p (x) ∈ ri T (x i , C i p (x)</formula><p>) . Assumption A2 is sometimes referred to as a strict subtangentiality condition. Figure 3.1 illustrates two example situations of A2. In the left-hand example, agent 1 has only one neighbor, agent 2; the convex hull C 1 p (x) is the line segment joining x 1 and x 2 ; the tangent cone</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T (x 1 , C 1 p (x)) is the closed ray {λ(x 2 -x 1 ) : λ ≥ 0} (in the figure it is shown translated to x 1 ); the relative interior ri T (x 1 , C 1 p (x)</formula><p>) is the open ray {λ(x 2x 1 ) : λ &gt; 0}; and A2 means that f 1 p is nonzero and points in the direction of x 2x 1 . In the right-hand example, agent 1 has two neighbors, agents 2 and 3; the convex hull C 1 p (x) is the triangle with vertices x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ; the tangent cone</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">T (x 1 , C 1 p (x)) is {λ 1 (x 2 -x 1 ) + λ 2 (x 3 -x 1 ) : λ 1 , λ 2 ≥ 0} (again, it is shown translated to x 1 ); the relative interior ri T (x 1 , C 1 p (x)) is {λ 1 (x 2 -x 1 ) + λ 2 (x 3 -x 1 ) : λ 1 , λ 2 &gt; 0};</formula><p>and A2 means that f 1 p points into this open cone. In general, A2 requires that</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">f i p (x) have the form j∈Ni(p) α j (x)(x j -x i ),</formula><p>where α j (x) are nonnegative scalar functions, and that f i p (x), now viewed as a vector applied at the vertex x i , not be tangent to the relative boundary of the convex set</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">C i p (x).</formula><p>When the index p in (3.1) is replaced by a piecewise constant function σ : [0, ∞) → P, we obtain a switched interconnected system</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ẋ(t) = f σ(t) (x(t)) .

The case of infinitely fast switching (chattering), which would call for a concept of generalized solution, is not considered here. As a matter of fact, it can be shown that even piecewise constant switching signals σ(t) do not have sufficient regularity for asymptotic agreement of the switched interconnected system (3.2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Let S dwell denote the class of piecewise constant switching signals such that any consecutive discontinuities are separated by no less than some fixed positive constant τ D , the dwell time.

Let Ω denote the set of aggregate states such that the subsystem states are all equal and in S, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">(∀i) ( x i (t 0 ) ≤ c) ∧ (x i (t 0 ) ∈ S) =⇒ (∃ζ ∈ S)(∀t ≥ t 0 + T )(∀i) x i (t) -ζ ≤ ε; (iii)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">Ω = {x ∈ R nm : x 1 = • • • = x n ∈ S}.</formula><p>Then state agreement is equivalent to uniform stability with respect to Ω.</p><p>Finally, we give the following new definition of positive invariance specially for interconnected systems.</p><p>Definition 3.5. A set A ⊂ R m is said to be positively invariant for the switched interconnected system (3.2) if</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(∀t 0 ≥ 0)(∀i) x i (t 0 ) ∈ A =⇒ (∀t ≥ t 0 )(∀i) x i (t) ∈ A.</formula><p>Our first result establishes the positive invariance property of any compact convex set in S without needing any property of the interaction digraph. This result can perhaps be understood intuitively as follows. For m = 2, all agents move in the plane. Let A be a compact convex set in S and assume all agents start in A. Let C(t) denote the convex hull of the agents' locations at time t. Because A is convex, clearly C(0) ⊂ A. Now invoke assumption A2. An agent that is initially in the interior of C(0) can head off in any direction at t = 0, but an agent that is initially on the boundary of C( <ref type="formula">0</ref>) is constrained to head into its interior. In this way,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">C(t) is nonincreasing (if t 2 &gt; t 1 , then C(t 2 ) ⊂ C(t 1 )</formula><p>), and A is therefore positively invariant for the switched interconnected system (3.2).</p><p>Theorem 3.6. Let A ⊂ S be a compact convex set. Then A is positively invariant for the switched interconnected system (3.2).</p><p>The second result establishes state agreement of the system, again without needing any property of the interaction digraph. Theorem 3.7. Suppose S is closed and convex. The switched interconnected system (3.2) has the property of state agreement on S.</p><p>Proof. Let ζ ∈ S and ε &gt; 0 be arbitrary, and let A2 . For all x ∈ S n and all t ∈ R, f i p (t, x) ∈ ri T (x i , C i p (x)) .

This corresponds to the situation where G σ(x(0)) is not QSC. Thus it is natural to assume that G σ(x(0)) is QSC. Moreover, we wish the control laws u i to be devised such that G σ(x(t)) does not lose this property in the future, even though the controller may cause changes in G σ(x(t)) .

Proof. If G σ(x 0 ) is fully connected, then G σ(x(t)) is fixed for all time t ≥ 0 since no link will be dropped, by Proposition 4.1, and no link can be added. Then the conclusion follows from Corollary 3.9.</p><p>If instead G σ(x 0 ) is not fully connected, then G σ(x(t)) is dynamic and switches for a finite number of times. To prove this, suppose by contradiction that for all t ≥ 0, G σ(x(t)) = G σ(x 0 ) . Then by Corollary 3.9, all the robots converge to a common location. So G σ(x(t)) will become fully connected at some time t, which contradicts the assumption that G σ(x(t)) = G σ(x 0 ) is not fully connected. Hence, there is a t 1 ≥ 0 such that G σ(x(t1)) has more links than G σ(x 0 ) because no link will be dropped by Proposition 4.1. Repeating this argument a finite number of times eventually leads to the existence of t i such that G σ(x(ti)) is fully connected, and thus, it is fixed after t i . Then the conclusion follows from Corollary 3.9 by treating (t i , x(t i )) as the initial condition.</p><p>The control law given next is based on the algorithm first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Proposition 4.3. A possible choice of u i satisfying condition (4.2) as well as assumptions A1 and A2 is u i = e(0, y ij : j ∈ N i (x)), the Euclidean center of the set Z = {0, y ij , j ∈ N i (x)}.</p><p>Proof. The Euclidean center of the set Z is the unique point w that minimizes the function g(w) := max z∈Z wz . Interpreted geometrically, e(•) is the center of the smallest m-sphere that contains the set of points {0, y ij , j ∈ N i (x)}. Furthermore, it can be easily shown that it lies in the polytope C i p = co{0, y ij , j ∈ N i (x)} but not at its vertices if the polytope is not a singleton. Thus, e (0, y ij : j ∈ N i (x)) = arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">w∈ C i p max z∈Z w -z .</formula><p>Then, by the maximum theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, the function e(•) is continuous (but not locally Lipschitz by some other arguments), and hence u i satisfies assumption A1 .</p><p>Next, e(•) ∈ C i p implies e(•) ∈ T (0, C i p ). Also, notice that C i p (x) = co{x i , x j : j ∈ N i (x)} is the translation of C i p to the point x i . Hence, e(•) ∈ T (x i , C i p (x)). In addition, if C i p (x) is not a singleton and x i is its vertex, this means that C i p is not a singleton and 0 is its vertex. Then by the fact that e(•) lies in C i p but not at its vertices, it follows that u i = e(•) = 0. Thus u i satisfies assumption A2 .</p><p>Finally, u i satisfies (4.2). This can be seen from geometry. We show the case m = 2 for illustration. If u i = 0, then it trivially satisfies (4.2). If u i = 0, then the picture is as in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.1. The solid circle C 1 is the smallest circle enclosing the points 0 and y ij , j ∈ N i (x). The dotted circle C 2 is centered at the origin and goes through the intersection points between C 1 and its diameter, which is perpendicular to u i . We know that if there are some y ij in the closed shaded area, then one of them achieves the maximal distance from the origin among all y ij , j ∈ N i (x). On the other hand, there is at least one j ∈ N i (x) such that y ij is in the closed semicircle of C 1 , since otherwise it is not the smallest circle. Hence, y ij lies in the closed shaded area if j ∈ I i (x). Moreover, the angle between u i and such y ij is less than π/2. This implies that max j∈Ii(x) (x ix j ) T u i ≤ 0.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions.</head><p>In this paper we first studied the state agreement problem for a class of switched interconnected large-scale systems with a family of admissible vector fields. The interconnection structure is time varying and independent of the state.</p><p>The key assumption about the vector fields, A2, generalizes Moreau's assumption in discrete time. Necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the interaction graph, are obtained to assure that the system achieves asymptotic state agreement. These results can be understood as connective stability, as in the framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Achieving asymptotic state agreement of a large-scale interconnected system is robust with respect to either the coupling structure or parameter values. In addition, our results and analysis may be of independent interest in the field of switched systems.</p><p>Second, we studied the rendezvous problem in continuous time. The interconnection structure is defined in terms of the distances between agents and hence is state independent. We proved that the circumcenter control law is a solution to the problem.</p><p>The notion of state agreement in this paper is that the states of the subsystems are all equal and constant. This notion can potentially be generalized in the following two directions. First, state agreement could mean equality of all the trajectories of the subsystems. In other words, the trajectories of a collection of subsystems will follow, after some transient, the same path in time. This would be of interest in formation control of multiagent systems. Second, state agreement could mean equality of all the states after suitable state transformations. An example is a biochemical reaction network studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In many state-agreement problems, the interaction graphs are bidirectional. For such cases, it is reasonable to conjecture that interconnected systems enjoy several special properties. For instance, results similar to those in Theorem 3.8 may be obtained with weaker assumptions on the smoothness of the vector fields.</p><p>Finally, we conjecture in the spirit of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that our result could be generalized by replacing C i p (x) in assumption A2 by a set-valued map satisfying suitable properties.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 . 1 .</head><label>31</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.1.
