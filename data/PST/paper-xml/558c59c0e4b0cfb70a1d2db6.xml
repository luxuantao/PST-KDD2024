<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Weather Adaptive Traffic Prediction Using Neurowavelet Models</head><p>Stephen Dunne and Bidisha Ghosh</p><p>Abstract-Climate change is a prevalent issue facing the world today. Unexpected increase in rainfall intensity and events is one of the major signatures of climate change. Rainfall influences traffic conditions and, in turn, traffic volume in urban arterials. For improved traffic management under adverse weather conditions, it is important to develop a traffic prediction algorithm considering the effect of rainfall. This inclusion is not intuitive as the effect is not immediate, and the influence of rainfall on traffic volume is often unrecognizable in a direct correlation analysis between the two time-series data sets; it can only be observed at certain frequency levels. Accordingly, it is useful to employ a multiresolution prediction framework to develop a weather adaptive traffic forecasting algorithm. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is a well-known multiresolution data analysis methodology. However, DWT imparts time variance in the transformed signal and makes it unsuitable for further time-series analysis. Therefore, the stationary form of DWT known as stationary wavelet transform (SWT) has been used in this paper to develop a neurowavelet prediction algorithm to forecast hourly traffic flow considering the effect of rainfall. The proposed prediction algorithm has been evaluated at two urban arterial locations in Dublin, Ireland. This paper shows that the rainfall data successfully augments the traffic flow data as an exogenous variable in periods of inclement weather, resulting in accurate predictions of future traffic flow at the two chosen locations. The forecasts from the neurowavelet model outperform the forecasts from the standard artificial neural network (ANN) model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I NTELLIGENT transportation systems (ITSs) are a broad spectrum of advanced technologies designed to improve sustainability in existing transportation networks by improving efficiency of traffic operationalization and management. An important aspect of the ITS is the Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS), and for the ATMS to function efficiently, information about the actual and the near-term future traffic state is critical. This necessitates the ability to make and continuously update predictions of traffic flows into the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Traffic flow prediction has become an active field of research over the last 15 years.</p><p>There exist numerous parametric and nonparametric approaches for predicting traffic flow in short-term future. The predominant nonparametric approach, which is studied in the existing literature on traffic flow forecasting, is the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. Conventional ANN structures, such as the feedforward (FF) back-propagation (BP) neural network (FFBPNN) algorithm, have been utilized widely by researchers to predict traffic flow in short-term future <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Apart from the conventional ANN, usage of nonconventional ANN structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, such as time-delayed ANNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and genetically optimized neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, are well-known in this field. Hybrid ANN structures (ANN structures used in conjunction with other signal processing algorithms) are also well known for their applicability in traffic flow predictions. Spectral basis ANNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, ANNs combined with a fuzzy modeling approach involving Kalman filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, ANNs combined with principal component analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, ANNs as part of an aggregated approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and pattern-based ANNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> are a few examples of such studies. The different structures and applications of ANNs in traffic forecasting have established the versatility of these models compared with other existing methodologies. Due to their ability to predict precisely, to adapt, and to be flexible for use in both univariate and multivariate paradigms, the ANN algorithms have been chosen for modeling traffic flow in this paper. A comprehensive review of the different approaches and applications of ANNs in traffic prediction is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The wavelet transform (WT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is a popular signal processing technique that has been used in conjunction with ANNs for various purposes in transportation research. One of the first instances of the use of WT combined with ANNs in the transportation field is the work on utilization of a discrete WT (DWT) for data filtering to improve the performance of a neurofuzzy ANN incident detection algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Other examples include developing a wavelet energy algorithm featuring radial basis function neural network for fast incident detection on rural and urban roads <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and using the WT with RNNs for online modeling and control of traffic flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In transportation literature, the WT has been mainly employed as a denoising procedure as the coefficients generated using DWT are nonstationary in nature; hence, the regular time-series prediction algorithms cannot be used successfully with a DWT coefficient data series. To eliminate the problem of nonstationarity in timeseries data sets decomposed using the DWT, a novel redundant WT (also referred to in the literature as nondecimated WT, stationary WT (SWT), or an a-trous algorithm) has been introduced by researchers in different fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In summary, the trend in recent years has been to use the SWT, which is a stationary version of the DWT, to develop robust and efficient time-series prediction algorithms. This relatively new trend is well developed, as seen in references <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and the variety of fields in which it has been successfully implemented displays the generalizability of the models. In the field of traffic flow forecasting, SWT has been used for denoising traffic volume time-series data from highways, prior to prediction with selforganizing ANNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, the multiresolution structure of SWT, involving independent modeling of the higher and lower resolution components, has yet to be exploited in an urban arterial traffic prediction framework.</p><p>In this paper, the multiresolution structure of the SWT is used to its fullest potential in developing a weather adaptive neurowavelet traffic forecasting algorithm that takes into account the effect of weather at different resolution levels. The effect of rain on travel demand and traffic accidents has been confirmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This paper illustrated that rain had a very real effect on travel demand, with the demand decreasing with increasing rain, and it was also determined that there are more accidents during rainy conditions. Findings in a technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> identify that adverse weather reduces the capacities and operating speeds on roadways, resulting in congestion and productivity loss. With regard to weather conditions affecting lane speed, an investigation determined that the variation of lane speed is different in fine and adverse weather conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The effect of weather on traffic congestion has also been investigated, and it was found that rain had a clear extended effect on morning peak congestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. It has also been determined that including the effects of weather in autoregressive integrated moving average forecasting models can result in improvements in forecast accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. These conclusions suggest that rain has a definite impact on traffic flow. In this regard, it was thought of as imperative to develop a traffic flow forecasting model that takes into account the weather conditions of the forecasted time interval. It is urgent to develop this model because the presence of climate change decrees that many locations around the world will experience longer and more intense periods of inclement weather. Therefore, with the likelihood of more regular precipitation in many areas, it is necessary to be able to factor in the effect of various levels of precipitation on traffic flow conditions. In this paper, the effect of rainfall on traffic volume has been investigated at different resolution levels and incorporated in the prediction model accordingly.</p><p>The work in this paper is organized as follows. Following the introduction in Section I, Section II describes the multiresolution weather adaptive traffic prediction methodology, including the theory behind the SWT and ANN algorithms. Section III discusses the traffic flow and precipitation data used in modeling. The results of the prediction algorithms are presented in Section IV, with a discussion on the prediction accuracy of the studied models. This paper is concluded in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODOLOGY</head><p>A brief description of the theory behind SWT and ANN algorithms used in this paper and a detailed description of the proposed neurowavelet prediction framework are shown here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Theoretical Background</head><p>The SWT has been used to decompose hourly traffic flow and rainfall time-series data sets. ANN-based prediction algorithms were used to predict the traffic flow time series in near future. Section II-A1 covers the SWT theory, whereas the ANN structure is discussed in Section II-A2.</p><p>1) SWT: The DWT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is a WT with a discrete-time mother wavelet, a nonzero integer dilation (scale) parameter, and a discrete translational parameter. Generally in the DWT, the dilation parameter is a power of two, indicating dyadic scales. The DWT of a time-series signal x(t) can be approximately described as the discretized form of the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W (a, b) = x(t), ψ a, b (t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ψ a, b (t) is a discrete wavelet, dilation parameter a = 2 j , and the translation parameter b = 2 j k. The discrete wavelet ψ j, k (t) can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ψ j, k (t) = 2 -j/2 ψ(2 -j t -k). (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>Here, j denotes the scale, and k denotes the position. In DWT the time series or the signal is essentially simultaneously filtered through high-pass and low-pass filters in this process. The low-pass filter produces the approximation coefficients, and the high-pass filter produces the detail components. Any low-pass filter that satisfies certain conditions can be considered as a scaling function, and scaling function φ(t) can be convolved with signal x(t) to produce the approximation coefficients</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">c j (k) = x(t), φ j, k (t) = ∞ -∞ x(t)2 -j/2 φ(2 -j t -k)dt. (3)</formula><p>Similarly, the detail coefficients generated by filtering through the high-pass filter can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d j (k) = x(t), ψ j, k (t) = ∞ -∞ x(t)2 -j/2 ψ(2 -j t -k)dt. (4)</formula><p>The original time-series signal can be represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x(t) = ∞ k=-∞ c j 0 (k)φ j 0 ,k (t) + j 0 j=-∞ ∞ k=-∞ d j (k)ψ j, k (t). (5)</formula><p>In the multiresolution analysis, the approximation component at level j, i.e., c j , can be further decomposed into the approximation and detail components at the next level, i.e., j + 1. Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> shows the formulas required for extending the coefficient calculation at further decomposition levels for the approximation and detail cases, respectively, as follows: At each level of decomposition, convolution of the approximation coefficients at the previous level with the time reversed filters, i.e., h 0 (-n) and h 1 (-n), followed by downsampling, produces the approximation and detail coefficients at the next level respectively [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>]. Approximation and detail coefficients (c j and d j ) of a signal x(t) are not the same length as the original signal. For a finite even-length h 0 (n), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">c j+1 (k) = ∞ n=-∞ h 0 (n -2k) c j (n) d j+1 (k) = ∞ n=-∞ h 1 (n -2k) c j (n) (6) φ(t) = √ 2 n∈Z h 0 (n)φ(2t -n) ψ(t) = √ 2 n∈Z h 1 (n)φ(2t -n).<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">h 1 (n) = (-1) n h 0 (N -n) (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where N is any odd number. The high-pass and low-pass filters are in reverse order and in alternate signs. These filters can be called quadrature mirror filters. In a DWT, x(t) is convolved with filters and then decimated. This decimation removes the time-invariant structure. At every step of the decimation process, either the odd indexed elements or even indexed elements are chosen, and the rest is discarded. However, synthesizing the approximation and details components, or the inverse DWT [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>], removes the time variance introduced through downsampling.</p><p>The presence of downsampling in DWT means that the time-invariant structure of the time series x(t) is altered through the transform. However, for all practical time-seriesmodeling-related purposes, it is important to achieve or retain the stationarity property of the signal. Therefore, methods were devised to incorporate the property of shift invariance in the WT.</p><p>To retain the time invariance structure of the data set, the DWT can be performed without decimations through the algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and this transform is termed as the SWT (or ε-decimated WT, or shift-invariant WT). The SWT structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where time-invariant coefficients are produced in a similar fashion as the DWT without any decimation operation.</p><p>The SWT is obtained by convolving signal x(t) with the appropriate filters as in the DWT but without downsampling. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">9</ref>) represents the process of generating upsampled approximation and detail coefficients through SWT as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">cj+1 (k) = ∞ l=-∞ h 0 (l) cj (k + 2 j l) dj+1 (k) = ∞ l=-∞ h 1 (l) cj (k + 2 j l). (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>The approximation and the details coefficient obtained through SWT can be synthesized through the inverse SWT (ISWT) to reconstruct the original signal.</p><p>The crucial result of this is that the coefficients of the approximation and detail at each level are the same length as the original signal. For further details on the SWT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> can be consulted for a thorough description of the mathematical theory.</p><p>2) ANN Algorithm: The ANN is a statistical data mining tool that involves a network structure inspired by the biological neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. A brief description of this ANN structure is provided here. The ANN generally consists of a set of inputs or input vectors N , which are then multiplied by a set of weights, to generate a net input. A bias is added to the net input, and the result is put through an activation function to produce an output from the network. The ANN algorithm used in this paper follows a FFBPNN structure with a unique input vector formulation. The FFBPNN structure was chosen as it shows comparable accuracy with other more complex neural network structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Therefore, to improve the ease and speed of development, the FFBPNN was used in this paper without compromising on accuracy, as compared with more complex neural network structures. FFBPNNs consist of both forward and backward phases. First, the FF phase involves the network receiving the input data and passing it to the hidden layer of the network. The input vector of the FFBPNN structure in this paper was generated using an autocorrelation-based variable reduction technique. The process involves plotting autocorrelation coefficients against time lag for a stationary traffic flow time series (to ensure stationarity, the mean is first subtracted from each observation of the traffic flow time series to be analyzed). These autocorrelation coefficients measure the correlation between observations at different lags and provide useful descriptive information about the properties of the timeseries data. The lag points with high autocorrelation values were chosen as the most influential data points to be used to predict traffic flow in the future. It is expected that these are the points that have the most influence on the near-term future prediction of traffic flow data. Output values are calculated by summing up the weighted inputs of the input layer and passing these summations through the activation function, i.e., a logsigmoid function in this case. After the forward pass of the inputs, the BP phase of the network compares the calculated network outputs a pq with the desired or target values t pq and is an iterative optimization of the error function that represents the performance of the network. This function of error E is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">E = 0.5 MN p=1 N q=1 (t pq -a pq ) 2 . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>The partial derivative of this error function gives a direction of steepest descent, and from this, the corrections to the weights of the network are determined for each iteration. In summary, a difference between the network output and the target output results in the gradient descent algorithm adjusting the connection weights (w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w MN ) of the network, in an attempt to bring future network outputs more in line with the desired outputs, i.e., teaching the network. The Levenberg-Marqaurdt (LM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> is used with the FFBPNN in this paper to optimize the error function. Another recent instance of the LM algorithm in the field of traffic flow forecasting involved the use of the LM algorithm after an exponential smoothing preprocess <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. This algorithm is an iterative optimization technique that locates the minimum of a multivariate nonlinear function. Rewriting the standard FFBPNN error function as a function of the weights of the network results in</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f (W) = E T E 2 = E T (W)E T (W) 2 = 1 2 MN p=1 N q=1 (t pq -a pq ) 2<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where W = [w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w p ] T and E = [e 11 , . . . , e MN N ] Weight updating is then achieved as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">W(k + 1) = W(k) -J T k J k -1 J T k E k (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where the Jacobian matrix J contains the first derivatives of the network errors with respect to weights and biases, and E is a vector of network errors. (J T J) is positive definite, but if it is not, then some perturbations made into it control the probability of it being nonpositive. Thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">W(k + 1) = W(k) -J T k J k + λI -1 J T k E k . (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Quantity λ is a learning parameter, which decreases as the iterative process approaches a minimum value.</p><p>In summary, the ANN model in this paper uses autocorrelated input vectors as input to the FFBPNN structure with LM algorithm applied for training. Therefore, the forecasts in this paper are computed using an input data set composed of previous observations that are highly correlated with the recent data. This framework hugely improves the computation time of the network as the size of the input vector and, hence, the number of neurons in the network setup, is reduced considerably <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Hereafter, this FFBPNN structure involving an autocorrelated input vector has been labeled as the autocorrelation neural network (ACNN).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Neurowavelet Prediction Framework</head><p>A schematic of the prediction framework is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The proposed framework uses the SWT to decompose traffic flow and precipitation time-series data into approximation and detail components. These components are then predicted individually using separate ACNN models, with the forecasted components then recombined using an ISWT. This recombined and reconstructed time series is the predicted traffic flow. A novel element of this paper is the method whereby precipitation data are used to compliment historical traffic flow data as an additional input to the ACNN forecasting models to develop a weather adaptive traffic prediction algorithm. Accordingly, the proposed framework comprises of two parts. One part is a dry model where traffic flow is predicted using a stationary neurowavelet algorithm. The other part is a wet model that predicts traffic flow by utilizing both traffic flow and rainfall information. The wet model is activated if rainfall is expected in the forthcoming hour, based on local weather forecasts. The following describes the dry and wet forecasting models.</p><p>1) Dry Model: The dry forecasting model predicts traffic flow in near future using current and recent past observations of the same. The first step of the procedure is to decompose traffic flow data using SWT, to an optimized level, i.e., j. The approximation and detail components at all levels of decomposition are then forecasted with individual ACNN models, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. These separately forecasted components are then reconstructed using the ISWT. The recombination of the separate approximation and detail elements in this way produces a final forecasted time series, i.e., of the same order as the original hourly traffic flow time-series input to the model.</p><p>2) Wet Model: The wet forecasting model follows the same basic idea as in the dry model. However, it is unique in incorporating the rainfall data to augment the historical traffic flow data as an extraneous variable for predicting future traffic flow in wet conditions. The current and time-lagged correlations between traffic flow and precipitation time-series can be assumed as an indicator of how much traffic flow is affected by rainfall. This relationship can exist at different frequency levels and by exploiting the multiresolution framework of the SWT; the correlation between the two aforementioned time series has been calculated for the original time-series data sets and at different levels of approximation and detail components. The component series showing the maximum correlation between traffic and rainfall data have been used as input to the ACNN structure. In most cases, it has been observed that the approximation coefficients obtained by decomposing the traffic flow and rainfall time series show the maximum correlation. Therefore, in the wet model described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the approximation coefficients for both rainfall and traffic flow data are presented as input to the ACNN structure at each level of decomposition for illustrative purposes. The ACNN algorithms in the wet model are multivariate models, including both rainfall and traffic flow as input, and producing future traffic flow levels as output. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EVALUATION OF THE NEUROWAVELET MODEL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data</head><p>The prediction methodology described earlier is evaluated using real-time traffic flow data from urban arterials along with hourly precipitation data in Dublin, Ireland. In the following, the description of the modeled traffic flow data and rainfall data, and the model fitting procedure are described.</p><p>The data modeled using the proposed prediction methodology is obtained from the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) database in the Traffic Control Centre of Dublin City Council. The SCATS database constitutes of traffic-condition-related information from all the major urban arterials in Dublin city center and the surrounding suburbs. SCATS data sets contain traffic volumes aggregated over every 15 min in every lane of a given junction. For this paper, hourly traffic data from January 2009 were collected from two SCATS sites, i.e., TCS 106 and TCS 125, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Both these sites lie to the west of Dublin City Centre. TCS 106 is a five-phase junction consisting of a T-junction where the Kylemore Road meets the Lucan Road. TCS 125 is a four-phase crossroads where the Nephin Road intersects the Navan Road. It is expected that both sites will be influenced by commuter traffic, with TCS 106 and TCS 125 being situated close to the two major commuter routes N4 and N3, respectively, in and out of the city. It is important to note that the traffic flow observations recorded on a weekday are substantially different to those traffic observations recorded on the weekend. Therefore, for ensuring consistency in within-day traffic dynamics, only weekday traffic condition observations are modeled in this paper. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows typical traffic flow levels for a weekday at each of the two junctions modeled. Typically, the values are highest around 08:00 h as commuters travel to work during the morning peak period and again at 17:00 h during the evening peak period, whereas the roads are quietest from midnight until approximately 06:00 h in the next morning. It is also evident in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> that TCS 106 encounters heavier traffic than TCS 125. In addition, the bimodal nature of the traffic flow at TCS 106 indicates that the junction is more affected by commuter traffic. The traffic flow time series for TCS 125 does not display such prominent peaks and troughs during expected commuter travel hours. The graph shows that the variation of traffic volume at TCS 125 is more stable, with a fairly consistent flow of traffic from 07:00 to 19:00 h.</p><p>The rainfall data used in this model were collected from the Phoenix Park weather station, as provided by Met Eireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The weather station is located in close proximity of the two chosen traffic junctions, which ensures that local rainfall events that may affect the traffic flow at the two chosen sites will be reflected in the rainfall records of the chosen weather station (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Hourly rainfall records were available from the Phoenix Park weather station; hence, traffic flow data at hourly resolution were used for modeling in this paper. The rainfall levels (measured in millimeters per hour) during the weekdays between January 1 and 14 of 2009 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. Generally, January and February are the wettest months of the year in Dublin; however, at this instance, there were few rain events during the majority of this time period, as shown in the figure. Recent research has shown short-term rainfall forecasting algorithms to be quite accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, which reinforces the effectiveness and portability of the proposed SWT-ACNN model as the proposed model can include the rainfall forecasts from any such existing prediction algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Traffic Modeling Using SWT-ACNN Structure</head><p>Traffic flow time-series data are modeled using an SWT-ACNN structure for future predictions. The framework consists of two parts, as discussed in the methodology: the dry and wet models.</p><p>Dry Model: The proposed neurowavelet traffic prediction framework employed the dry model to predict traffic flow provided that there were no rainfall events existing or expected in the next hour. In this model, at the first step, the SWT involving the db3 wavelet basis function <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> was used to decompose the traffic flow time series into separate approximation and detail coefficients (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). This decomposition was performed multiple times to achieve an optimum level of approximation for representing the within-day traffic dynamics. At each level, the approximation coefficients were decomposed using the SWT to generate approximation and detail coefficients for the next level; the transformation was undecimated, and the generated data sets were of the same length as the original traffic flow data. For illustrative purposes, the wavelet decomposition of the traffic flow data from TCS 106 is only shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Each different component series generated through the SWT was modeled by an individual ACNN, and the output from all ACNN structures were reconstructed using the ISWT. In all, 240 observations of hourly traffic flow were used in this model. Eight days were used to train the ACNN (points 1-192), whereas the points from the ninth day (points 193-216) were used to predict hourly traffic flow levels on the tenth day (points 217-240). The size of the input vectors for the ACNN prediction algorithms was dependent upon the results of the autocorrelation procedure on both hourly traffic flow data sets. Study of the autocorrelation coefficients for TCS 106 showed that five points from a 24-h period were deemed to have an autocorrelation coefficient of sufficient size to be influential in future predictions. Therefore, in the prediction of traffic flow at TCS 106, the training and test data sets made use of these five influential points when creating the input vectors for the ACNN. Thus, five influential historic hourly traffic flow data points were used to predict a single future hourly traffic flow value, rather than using the entire 24 points of the day at each iteration of the prediction algorithm. This procedure was repeated in steps to predict a full 24-h period. The same methodology was followed for the TCS 125 traffic flow data set, although only three points were deemed influential in this case. In the case of rainfall events, the framework switched to a wet model. The standard ANN model used for comparison in this paper used the entire 24 points from a day for prediction. This way, the SWT-ACNN model is also valuable as a model that reduces computational time, e.g., in the case of TCS 125, the standard ANN prediction data set was eight times larger than that used in the SWT-ACNN model; thus, the SWT-ACNN model computed a prediction in a shorter time.</p><p>Wet Model: As discussed in the methodology, traffic flow is affected by weather <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>; hence, rainfall data were included in the wet-model framework. Rainfall data time series was decomposed using the SWT in the same way as the traffic flow data. Current and time-lagged correlation coefficients were calculated to determine whether rainfall events and traffic flow  were all looked at individually to ascertain which components had the highest correlation. Labels A, B, and C in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> refer to conditions under which the correlation coefficients were calculated. In condition A, the entire rainfall and traffic flow data sets were used for calculating the correlation coefficients. This condition resulted in the lowest levels of correlation as expected because, for a large proportion of the time, the rainfall data are 0 mm/h, and this skews the relationship between traffic flow and rainfall. Condition B focused on the correlation present only in instances where there is some level of rainfall in a given hour. As shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, this resulted in an improved level of correlation. The results for Condition B in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, along with the visual inspection of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, vindicate the decision to calculate correlation coefficients at times when rain is present only to negate the effect of a large proportion of zero values in the rainfall data set. Condition C looked at hours where rain was present along with a single following hour of such time periods. This was to allow for the delayed effect that inclement weather can cause to traffic flow levels and behavior, i.e., traffic jams formed under rainy conditions may still be present for a percentage of the following dry hour.</p><p>Conditions B and C both produced similar levels of correlation between rainfall and traffic flow at junction TCS 106. An interesting result was that there is a much greater correlation present in the approximation coefficients than in the detail coefficients. Based on this behavior, the decision was made to use only the approximation components of the decomposed hourly rainfall data as part of the inputs in the wet-model framework. It was also decided that when rainfall was expected in the forthcoming hour, the wet model would be activated for both the forthcoming hour and the hour after that to allow for the time-lagged effect of rainfall on within-day traffic flow dynamics. In addition, in the wet model, the input vector sizes for the individual ACNN were twice the size as the respective dry-model input vectors, i.e., where three hourly traffic flow data points were used to predict one future data point at TCS 125 in the dry model and six points (three hourly traffic flow and three hourly rainfall events) were used for the same in the wet-model case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PREDICTIONS AND COMPARISONS</head><p>The SWT-ACNN model has been used to predict the traffic volume on Wednesday, January 14, 2009, for junctions TCS106 and TCS 125. The predicted traffic volumes and the actual traffic volumes are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>(a) and (b). To illustrate the efficiency of the SWT-ACNN structure, a standard ANN algorithm, comparable with the fundamental FFBPNN structure used in the ACNN model, has been used to predict traffic volume on the same day over a 24-h period. The shaded boxes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>(a) and (b) show periods of rainfall (from 14:00 to 19:00 h) where the wet-model framework took over from the dry-model framework as rainfall tends to change traffic evolution in a way that is distinct from fine weather conditions. It is important to note here that the rainfall in this period was actually intermittent, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. Rainfall events occurred at 14:00, 16:00, and 18:00 h, but the hours in between were also subject to the wet-model prediction algorithm to address the time-lagged effect of precipitation on traffic flow, i.e., the wet model activates for hours t and t + 1 when rain is expected at hour t. It is immediately visible from the graph that the wavelet model outperforms the nonwavelet model significantly.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from the predictions carried out at TCS 106 and TCS 125, whereas Table III looks at the MAPE values specific to both dry and wet conditions. The values in Table II emphasize the importance of using a multiresolution framework in incorporating the effect of rainfall in traffic prediction, with the SWT-ACNN more accurate at both TCS 106 and TCS 125, based on the MAPE and RMSE values. As an illustrative example of the effectiveness of the wet model in predicting traffic flow, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref> shows the MAPE for the neurowavelet prediction model during dry and wet times at junctions TCS 106 and TCS 125. The table is based on the predictions shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>(a) and (b), where a rainfall event occurs from 14:00 to 19:00 h. Hence, for this time period, the wet model is enabled as the chosen prediction methodology. The findings in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref> emphasize how effective it can be to include rainfall as an input to the neurowavelet model.  V. CONCLUSION Rainfall effects travel dynamics in urban transport networks in a complex manner and causes congestion and, often, an increased frequency of accidents on the roads. A neurowavelet prediction algorithm has been proposed in this paper to forecast hourly traffic flow, taking into account the effect of precipitation. The neurowavelet structure utilizes a multiresolution wavelet analysis framework to address the fact that rain can affect traffic flow dynamics at different resolution levels. To retain the time invariance of the original time-series data sets, an undecimated form of WT (SWT) has been used in this purpose. This model, taking rain into account, is a novel application of the SWT in the field of traffic prediction.</p><p>The algorithm toggles between a dry model and a wet model, depending on whether rainfall is expected in the forthcoming hour. The algorithm was evaluated using real-time hourly traffic volume and precipitation observations. The prediction accuracy of the wet model is superior to the dry model and the standard ANN model during rainfall periods. This emphasizes that rainfall affects traffic volume and the inclusion of rainfall as a model input improves the prediction accuracy during rainfall events. The algorithm also outperformed the conventional ANN algorithms in dry situations (where traffic flow data alone were used as model input). This confirms that the proposed algorithm is flexible and can be applied to situations where and when rainfall data are not available. Furthermore, the successful application of SWT-ACNN at two dissimilar traffic sites in Dublin shows the generalizability and portability of the model. For future research in this area, it will be important to investigate the performance of this algorithm using higher resolution traffic and rainfall time-series data sets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
