<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Emerging evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in diverse fundamental and important biological processes associated with human diseases. Inferring potential disease related miRNAs and employing them as the biomarkers or drug targets could contribute to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of complex human diseases. In view of that traditional biological experiments cost much time and resources, computational models would serve as complementary means to uncover potential miRNA-disease associations. In this study, we proposed a new computational model named Neighborhood Constraint Matrix Completion for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (NCMCMDA) to predict potential miRNA-disease associations. The main task of NCMCMDA was to recover the missing miRNA-disease associations based on the known miRNA-disease associations and integrated disease (miRNA) similarity. In this model, we innovatively integrated neighborhood constraint with matrix completion, which provided a novel idea of utilizing similarity information to assist the prediction. After the recovery task was transformed into an optimization problem, we solved it with a fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. As a result, the AUCs of NCMCMDA in global and local leave-one-out cross validation were 0.9086 and 0.8453, respectively. In 5-fold cross validation, NCMCMDA achieved an average AUC of 0.8942 and standard deviation of 0.0015, which demonstrated NCMCMDA's superior performance than many previous computational methods. Furthermore, NCMCMDA was applied to three different types of case studies to further evaluate its prediction reliability and accuracy. As a result, 84% (colon neoplasms), 98% (esophageal neoplasms) and 98% (breast neoplasms) of the top 50 predicted miRNAs were verified by recent literature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), known as one type of small singlestranded noncoding RNAs (∼22 nt), could regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Many researches have manifested that miRNAs are engaged in multiply stages of biological process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and the overexpression or dysregulation of miRNAs is bound up with various cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and other kinds of complex diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. For example, previous study has demonstrated that miR-10b was highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> identified that miR-23b could serve as an oncogene through targeting a novel mitochondrial tumor Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bib/bbz159/5685754 by Queen Mary University of London user on 14 January 2020 suppressor proline oxidase (POX), and decreasing expression of miR-23b may effectively inhibit kidney tumor growth. In addition, recent research found that miR-19a/19b expression was induced in patients with heart failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. These two miRNAs could reduce myocardial infarction (MI)-induced cardiac damage and protect cardiac function, making them potential therapeutic targets to treat heart failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Therefore, identification of underlying disease-related miRNAs is of great significance to the discovery of disease biomarker and the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of complex human diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In light of that the traditional experiments are time-and laborconsuming, computational models would serve as an effective supplementary tool to identify miRNA-disease associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Over the past few years, many computational models, such as scoring function-based models, have been developed for the prediction of potential miRNA-disease association <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For example, Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> presented one of the premier prediction models, in which they developed a scoring system based on hypergeometric distribution to rank all candidate miRNAs according to the scores. The deficiency of this model lay in that it only considered the neighbor information of each miRNA. Mørk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> developed a reliable computational model of miRNA-Protein-Disease (miRPD) to uncover unknown miRNA-disease association, which innovatively linked miRNAs to diseases via involved proteins. For a set of proteins connected to a miRNA and a disease, they multiplied the miRNA-protein association score with protein-disease association score and took the maximum as the final score of the miRNA-disease pair. Because a high proportion of the miRNA-target interactions are false-positive or false-negative, miRPD failed to exhibit satisfactory performance. Pasquier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> tried to infer miRNA-disease association with a vector space model called MiRAI, in which they incorporated multiple information including miRNA-disease associations, miRNA-neighbor associations, miRNA-target associations, miRNA-word associations and miRNA-family associations to generate a matrix. After implementing Single Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimension of this matrix, they calculated the distance between a miRNA in miRNA space and a disease in disease space as the prediction score of miRNA-disease pair. Xuan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a model of Human Disease-related MiRNA Prediction (HDMP) based on weighted k most similar neighbors. HDMP optimized the approach of estimating miRNA functional similarity through incorporating the information content of disease terms and phenotype similarity between diseases. Furthermore, HDMP assigned higher weights to miRNAs in the same miRNA cluster or family since they were more inclined to be associated with similar diseases. However, HDMP did not achieve decent performance since it only considered local network similarity. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed a novel computational model of Within and Between Score for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (WBSMDA) by incorporating miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, miRNA-disease associations and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for diseases and miRNAs. Given a disease d and a miRNA m, from the disease space, diseases that are most similar to d among the m-related and m-unrelated disease group were picked out, respectively, and their similarity values with d were regarded as Within-Score and Between-Score. From the miRNA space, the two scores were calculated in the same way. Then the four scores from miRNA and disease space were combined to make the association prediction.</p><p>Researchers have also developed network models for the miRNA-disease association prediction. For example, Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed a method to identify miRNA-disease association based on the functional links between miRNA targets and disease genes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. They adopted global network distance measure and implemented random walk with restart algorithm in the PPI network to calculate the probability score of miRNA-disease pairs. In a later model named Random Walk with Restart for MiRNA-Disease Association (RWRMDA), Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> introduced the global network similarity measures. They conducted random walk on the miRNA-miRNA functional similarity network to prioritize candidate miRNAs for targeted diseases. Nevertheless, this method failed to work for new diseases with no known related miRNAs. Another random walk-based method named MIRNAs associated with Diseases Prediction (MIDP) was put forward by Xuan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In this model, they considered the functional similarity between two miRNAs as their edge weight to construct the miRNA network (Mnet). After partitioning the nodes within Mnet into labeled nodes and unlabeled ones, two transition matrices were established, respectively. Finally, they calculated the relevance scores of miRNA-disease pairs by their random walkbased prediction model and prioritized all unlabeled nodes in accordance with their scores. Besides, Xuan et al. upgraded the method through the introduction of extended random walk on miRNA-disease bilayer network, enabling the method to apply to new diseases without known miRNAs. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> also made reliable predictions in Heterogeneous Graph Inference for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (HGIMDA). This model used the same inputs as WBSMDA. An iteration equation was defined by summarizing all the paths between miRNA and disease with the length equal to three. When the iteration got stable, HGIMDA would generate a score matrix of the association probability of miRNA-disease pairs. As an improvement, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction (MDHGI). Differing from HGIMDA, in this model, authors implemented matrix decomposition algorithm to remove the noises in the original adjacency matrix before the graph construction and heterogeneous graph inference. Recently, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> presented a model of Triple Layer Heterogeneous Network-based inference for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (TLHNMDA) based on triple layer heterogeneous network formed by multiple data, including the same input data of WBSMDA, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-miRNA interactions and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for lncRNA. Also, they put forward two iterative equations to propagate information across the formed heterogeneous network and obtained probability scores of potential miRNA-disease associations and miRNA-lncRNA interactions simultaneously after the two equations converged. Some machine learning-based prediction models have also been developed and exhibited satisfactory performance. For example, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proposed Regularized Least Squares for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (RLSMDA), in which two optimal classifiers in miRNA space and disease space were combined to obtain the final association probability. It is mentionable that RLSMDA does not require negative associations and it is also applicable to new diseases and new miRNAs. In another method of Ranking-based KNN for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (RKNNMDA), Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, used K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to sort out k-nearest neighbors of the targeted miRNA. After the Hamming loss calculation, these k-nearest-neighbors were re-ranked by support vector machine, and a weight score was generated by weighted voting. The same procedure was conducted for disease, and these two weight scores of miRNA and disease were summed as the final score for miRNA-disease pair. Later, Chen Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bib/bbz159/5685754 by Queen Mary University of London user on 14 January 2020 et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> proposed restricted Boltzmann machine for multiple types of miRNA-disease association prediction (RBMMMDA), in which the restricted Boltzmann machine was made up of layers of visible units (diseases) and hidden units (miRNAs). Then, Chen et al. trained the restricted Boltzmann machine models by Contrastive Divergence algorithms and accomplished the prediction of unknown miRNA-disease pairs. Differing from other models, RBMMMDA was the first computational method that could predict novel miRNA-disease associations as well as their corresponding association types. Matrix completion algorithm was also applied to the association prediction of disease-related miRNAs. The main idea was to update the miRNA-disease adjacency matrix to recover its missing entries, based on the assumption that the elements in the final iteration results should be as close as possible to that in the original adjacency matrix. For instance, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proposed a method of Matrix Completion for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (MCMDA), in which no negative samples were required. They transformed the matrix recovery task into an optimization problem and solved it with the Lagrange multiplier method.</p><p>After the matrix completion procedure ended, the values in the ultimate iteration result were regarded as the association scores of the corresponding miRNA-disease pairs. However, MCMDA suffered from not being applicable to new diseases and new miRNAs, because it only depended on known miRNA-disease associations. As an improvement, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> put forward Inductive Matrix Completion for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (IMCMDA), which could apply to new diseases without known miRNAs. They initially set two matrices, indicating the low dimensional representation of miRNA and disease, and updated them with gradient descent algorithm. When stopping criteria was met, the two updated matrices were directly incorporated with the feature (similarity) matrix of miRNA and disease through matrix multiplication. The results were considered as the final relevance score of miRNA-disease pairs. In addition, researchers have put forward combinatorial optimization-based methods for identifying disease-related miRNAs. For example, Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> designed a model named Maximizing Network Information Flow (MaxFlow) to calculate the association score of candidate miRNA-disease pair. Given a query disease and candidate miRNAs, they computed the maximum information flow between two nodes by push-relabel algorithm. The amount of flow leaving the candidate miRNA was obtained by summarizing all maximum information flow between the miRNA and other nodes, which was considered as the association score between query disease and miRNA.</p><p>The discovery of potential miRNA-disease association is undoubtedly of great benefit to the researches on understanding disease pathogenesis and developing cures for human diseases. Because traditional biological experiments are generally timeand labor-consuming, there is an urgent need for efficient and reliable computational prediction methods. The past few decades have witnessed great progress in developing computational models to predict potential miRNA-disease association. Matrix completion algorithm has proved to be an effective tool and was widely used in bioinformatics research <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Based on that, researchers have designed prediction methods like MCMDA and IMCMDA, as we stated above. However, MCMDA only utilized the miRNA-disease association information, making it not being applicable to new diseases with no known miRNA-disease association. Though the similarity information of disease and miRNA was incorporated to assist the association prediction, IMCMDA's prediction accuracy was not as competitive as MCMDA's. How to better incorporate the similarity information with matrix completion algorithm to make reliable prediction performance remains unexplored. In this study, we put forward a novel computational model named Neighborhood Constraint Matrix Completion for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (NCMCMDA). In this model, we combined the miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for disease (miRNA) to obtain the integrated similarity for disease (miRNA). Notably, in this method, we utilized the similarity information in a different way from IMCMDA. We added the similarity-based neighborhood constraint into the matrix completion model to help recover the missing miRNAdisease associations. The whole completion procedure was transformed into an optimization problem, which was solved by a fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. In this study, we conducted leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and 5-fold cross validation to assess NCMCMDA's prediction performance. As a result, NCMCMDA achieved area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.9086 in global LOOCV, 0.8453 in local LOOCV and 0.8942+/-0.0015 in 5-fold cross validation. In the three types of case studies concerning colon neoplasms, esophageal neoplasms and breast neoplasms, 42, 49 and 49 out of top 50 predicted miRNAs were, respectively, verified by experimental literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result Performance evaluation</head><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of NCMCMDA, we carried out three types of cross validations, namely global LOOCV, local LOOCV and 5-fold cross validation. In the LOOCV, each time we took one sample in turn among the 5430 recorded miRNAdisease associations as test sample and utilized the remaining known associations to train our model. In global LOOCV, the test sample was ranked with all unconfirmed miRNA-disease pairs. Yet, in local LOOCV, we only prioritized miRNAs that had no confirmed associations with the disease concerned in the test sample. In 5-fold cross validation, the known miRNA-disease associations were randomly and evenly split into five parts, each of which was then picked out in turn as the test sample, and the other four parts were considered as training samples. Just the same way as global LOOCV, all unknown miRNAdisease pairs were considered as candidate samples. In order to alleviate the possible influence of sample division on prediction performance, we randomly split the known miRNA-disease associations for 100 times and obtained the mean and standard deviation of AUCs. Throughout the three cross validations, we implemented NCMCMDA to obtain the score list of all miRNAdisease pairs and ranked the score of each test sample with the scores of candidate samples. If the test sample ranked ahead of the given threshold, we assumed that this model successfully predicted this association. It should be noted that we recalculated the miRNA (disease) Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity in each LOOCV and 5-fold cross validation procedure, because the adjacency matrix was changed when one or part of the known miRNA-disease associations was removed.</p><p>Based on the results of LOOCV, we drew the ROC curve at different thresholds with the true positive rate (TPR, sensitivity) as the X-axis, and the false positive rate (FPR, 1-specificity) as the Y-axis. Sensitivity means the proportion of the test samples ranking ahead of the threshold, while specificity refers to the percentage of the negative miRNA-disease pairs that ranked behind the threshold. Here we computed AUC as the evaluative criterion, and greater AUC means the model shows more accurate prediction performance. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we compared NCMCMDA with aforementioned methods. It turned out that NCMCMDA obtained an AUC of 0.9086 in global LOOCV and 0.8453 in local LOOCV, both ranking first when compared with other models, namely RLSMDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, HDMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, WBSMDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, MCMDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, MaxFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, TLHNMDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, IMCMDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and MDHGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which exhibited AUCs of 0.8426, 0.8366, 0.8030, 0.8749, 0.8624, 0.8795, 0.8380 and 0.8945, respectively, in global LOOCV, and obtained AUCs of 0.6953, 0.7702, 0.8031, 0.7718, 0.7774, 0.7756, 0.8034 and 0.8240 in local LOOCV. Notably, we did not take MIDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> into account in global LOOCV comparison, because random walk was a local approach, and this random walk-based method could not predict all diseases simultaneously. Moreover, MiRAI <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> was also excluded from global LOOCV comparison, because its prediction scores had a highly positive correlation with the number of known related miRNAs of a disease. The more miRNAs a disease was associated with, the higher score MiRAI would award, and vice versa. Therefore, it was unreasonable to compare the prediction scores for different diseases. The AUCs of MIDP and MiRAI in local LOOCV were 0.8196 and 0.6299. The poor performance of MiRAI was due to the sparsity of our datasets which included 383 diseases and 495 miRNAs with 5430 confirmed associations, and most diseases are only correlated with a few miRNAs, while the dataset contained only 83 diseases with more than 20 known associated miRNAs per disease, in the original literature. As for 5-fold cross validation, NCMCMDA achieved an average AUC of 0.8942 and deviation of 0015, which surpassed all aforementioned methods (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Besides, in order to test if the inaccurate network information may influence the results, we conducted sensitivity analysis by randomly removing 20% and 30% of the nodes in the network. We implemented three types of cross validations on the removed networks, and repeated the procedure for 10 times to alleviate the effect of random removal. The AUC results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Based on the AUC results after 10 times of randomly removing 20% and 30% nodes in the network, we can conclude that our model showed stable performance, and the prediction accuracy only decrease a bit as the amount of data decreased. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case studies</head><p>With the intention of further assessing whether NCMCMDA could exhibit accurate and robust performance, we carried out three different types of case studies concerning colon neoplasms, esophageal neoplasms and breast neoplasms. In the first category of case studies, the known miRNA-disease associations obtained from HMDD v2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> were used as the training dataset for NCMCMDA, and candidate miRNAs for investigated diseases were prioritized in accordance with the prediction scores given by our model. After that, we picked out the top 50 predicted miRNAs and verified them with another two authoritative databases, dbDEMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and miR2Disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Colon neoplasm, also known as colorectal cancer, is a disease in which cancer cells form in the colon tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. It is predicted that there will be 101,420 new colon neoplasm cases accounting for 8.3% of all new cancer cases in the US, and 51,020 Americans will die from colon neoplasms in 2019 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Colon neoplasms begin as a single mutational event in a cell and it takes several years before the malignancy becomes detectable <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Therefore, novel and sensitive biomarkers which could be used for effective and timely detection of colon neoplasms are in great demand. Researchers have verified that many miRNAs have an association with colon neoplasms. For example, the research of Xiao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> found that the inhibition of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bib/bbz159/5685754 by Queen Mary University of London user on 14 January 2020 miR-4260 could reduce colon neoplasm cell growth through targeting tumor suppressor gene. Therefore, they pointed out that the inhibition of miR-4260 might be a potential way of treating colon neoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Another example is that Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> found that the knockdown of miR-20a could increase the sensitivity of colon neoplasm cells to cisplatin through increasing the expression of ASK1 (a target of miR-20a), suggesting miR-20a's therapeutic value in treating colon neoplasms. In this study, we implemented NCMCMDA to uncover potential related miRNAs for colon neoplasms, and it turned out that 10 out of top 10, 19 out of top 20 and 42 out of top 50 predicted miRNAs were verified in database, dbDEMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and miR2Disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that miR-143 (first in our prediction list) was downregulated in colon neoplasms and could increase sensitivity of colon neoplasms cells to 5-fluorouracil <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The research revealed that miR-143 could serve as anti-proliferative, chemosensitizer and putative pro-apoptotic in colon neoplasms <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. In the second type of case study, we aimed to assess that whether NCMCMDA can be applied to diseases with no known associated miRNAs. Given an investigated disease, we removed its known associations in HMDD v2.0, and considered it as a new disease. Thereby, NCMCMDA made predictions for the investigated disease only based on the information of other diseases' known related miRNAs and the similarity information of all diseases and miRNAs. Esophageal neoplasm, Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bib/bbz159/5685754 by Queen Mary University of London user on 14 January 2020 Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Validation results of the top 50 predicted esophageal neoplasm-related miRNAs. It turned out that 49 out of the top 50 predicted miRNAs were confirmed based on dbDEMC, HMDD v2.0 and miR2Disease. The remaining one was confirmed by literature given in the form of PMID. The first column records top 1-25 related miRNAs. The third column records the top 26-50 related miRNAs. The evidence columns mean the predictions were confirmed by databases or literature miRNA a commonly-diagnosed cancer, is estimated to cause 16,080 deaths (2.6% of all cancer deaths) in the US in 2019 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are the two most common types of esophageal neoplasms, usually caused by factors like smoking, alcohol use, achalasia, chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The research of Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> confirmed that miR-196a could regulate RAS-related protein (RAP1A) expression, which was overexpressed in the majority of esophageal neoplasm tissues. They further identified that RAP1A might serve as potential diagnostic and prognosis markers for esophageal neoplasms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Moreover, the study of Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> demonstrated that miR-644a could suppress esophageal neoplasm cell's self-renewal and malignancy, making miR-644a a potential prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target for esophageal neoplasms. Here we took esophageal neoplasm as an example to predict esophageal neoplasmrelated miRNAs and obtained the ranked list of its candidate miRNAs with reference to their prediction score. The results showed that 10 out of top 10, 20 out of top 20 and 49 out of top 50 EN-related miRNAs were verified in dbDEMC, miR2Disease and HMDD v2.0 (see Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Taking miR-21 (first in our prediction list) as an example, previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> found that serum concentration of miRNA-21 in esophageal neoplasm patients is significantly higher than that in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.001), and miR-21 levels were significantly reduced in esophageal neoplasm patients who responded to chemotherapy (P = 0.003), whereas no significant change was observed in the nonresponders. Therefore, miR-21 was considered to be a novel biomarker for esophageal neoplasm diagnosis, and it could also serve as a response marker during chemotherapy for esophageal neoplasm patients.</p><p>In the third type of case study, we intended to evaluate whether NCMCMDA could exhibit stable performance on different databases by employing the known miRNA-disease associations from HMDD v1.0 as the training samples for our model. Breast neoplasm, also known as breast cancer, is one of the most common health problems across the world, which causes hundreds of thousands death every year <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Here, breast neoplasm was chosen as the investigated disease. The research of Han et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> demonstrated that miR-124 played a crucial part in suppressing the invasive and metastatic potential of breast neoplasms, suggesting miR-124's potential application possibility in treating breast neoplasms. After the implementation of NCMCMDA, 49 of the top 50 predictions were manually confirmed based on dbDEMC, miR2Disease and HMDD v2.0 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). Taking miR-16 (first in the prediction list) as an example, researchers found that miR-16 could mediate BMI1 downregulation, the elevated levels of which would increase breast neoplasm cell's sensitivity to doxorubicin, causing apoptotic cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>According to what has been presented above, we can conclude that NCMCMDA exhibited an accurate and stable performance in the three types of case studies. As researches on miRNA-disease association continue, we hope that our method can help identify new disease-related miRNAs and contribute to the pathogenesis understanding and treatment of human disease in the near future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this article, we presented a novel matrix completion-based model named NCMCMDA to infer potential miRNA-disease Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bib/bbz159/5685754 by Queen Mary University of London user on 14 January 2020 associations. In this model, we combined low rank matrix completion algorithm with neighborhood constraint to recover the score of unknown miRNA-disease pairs based on known miRNA-disease associations, miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for diseases (miRNAs). We transformed the recovery task into an optimization problem, and then solved it with a fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. The results of three types of cross validations have proved NCMCMDA's superior performance than many previous computational methods. Case studies concerning colon neoplasms, esophageal neoplasms and breast neoplasms also demonstrated that our model could exhibit a reliable and accurate prediction performance. It is reasonable to conclude that NCMCMCDA would be of help to the miRNA-disease association prediction. The excellent performance of NCMCMDA could be ascribed to the following factors. Firstly, unlike traditional matrix completion algorithm, NCMCMDA additionally integrated the neighborhood constraint, which provided a novel idea of utilizing similarity information to help improve prediction accuracy. Based on integrated disease (miRNA) similarity matrix, each disease's (miRNA's) top k nearest neighbors were ranked out to generate a new disease (miRNA) similarity matrix. We performed matrix multiplication on new disease similarity matrix with the score matrix, and on the score matrix with the new miRNA similarity matrix. The two products were linearly combined to obtain a new score matrix. We added the square error between the score matrix and the newly calculated score matrix as a constraint term into the optimization problem. Secondly, after the whole recovery task was changed into a convex optimization problem, we adopted a fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm to solve it, which ensured the efficiency of our method. Thirdly, our method could be applied to new diseases without known miRNAs and simultaneously identify potential related miRNAs for all diseases.</p><p>Yet, limitations also exist in NCMCMDA. Firstly, the insufficiency of currently known miRNA-disease associations may influence the performance of NCMCMDA and there still has a long way to expand data. Secondly, how to effectively select the parameters to balance the impacts of disease similarity information, miRNA similarity information and low rank constraint still needs further study. Finally, researchers found that miRNA's targets have an association with cancer hallmarks or immune systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Moreover, some literature pointed out that drug or radiation could modulate miRNA expressions in cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. Researches on the two fields are of great significance to developing treatments for patients. Because the similarity measures we presented here are not comprehensive enough to capture the relations between diseases and between miRNAs, it stills needs further research to develop more comprehensive similarity measurements through considering geographical variation and more biological information such as miRNA expression and gene-cancer hallmark association. In the future, we will also work to apply our model to other fields, such as the research on the effects of drug or radiation on miRNA expressions in cancers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>In this paper, we incorporated multiple data for our prediction model NCMCMDA. Firstly, human miRNA-disease associations, symbolized as A, were directly downloaded from HMDD Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bib/bbz159/5685754 by Queen Mary University of London user on 14 January 2020 v2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, which contained 383 diseases, 495 mRNAs and 5430 experimentally confirmed miRNA-disease associations. To be specific, if disease d(i) is associated with miRNA m(j), A(i, j) is 1, otherwise 0. Variables nd and nm were used to denote the number of diseases and miRNAs, respectively. Secondly, we also incorporated the miRNA functional similarity scores, which were calculated based on the model proposed by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Here, we directly downloaded them from http://www. cuilab.cn/files/images/cuilab/misim.zip and denoted them as FS. What's more, in this article, we used the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to describe the relationships among diseases. To obtain more comprehensive and accurate disease similarity, we adopt two different models to calculate disease semantic similarity. Specifically, based on the assumption that the larger parts the DAGs of two diseases share in common, the larger semantic similarity value they would get, we used the model proposed by Xuan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to compute the first type of disease semantic similarity, and denoted it as SS1. Differing from that, we adopted another similarity measurement according to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, in view of that different disease terms in the same layer of DAG may appear in the different numbers of disease DAGs. The second type of disease semantic similarity was represented by SS2. In addition, based on the assumption that miRNAs with similar functions are more likely to be correlated with similar diseases, we constructed Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity as another similarity measurement between two miR-NAs (diseases) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. Finally, because the disease semantic similarity was computed based on DAGs, we can't get DAG for all diseases. Therefore, we combined Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for diseases with disease semantic similarity according to the literature released by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and obtained the integrated disease similarity matrix SD. Similarly, we can obtain the miRNA similarity matrix SM. These two similarity matrices were used as the inputs for our prediction model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NCMCMDA</head><p>In this study, we innovatively integrated matrix completion algorithm with neighborhood constraint to infer potential miRNAdisease associations motivated by a previous study from Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Let X be a score matrix, and its elements refer to the association scores of corresponding miRNA-disease pairs. We could obtain X through solving an optimization problem shown as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min X τ X * + X 2 F s.t X = A (1)</formula><p>where is the element-wise product operator. is the indicator matrix of A. If there is a confirmed association between the disease d(i) and miRNA m(j), (i, j) is 1, otherwise 0. X F is the Frobenius norm of matrix X, X * = i σ i (σ i is the singular value of X). τ is a tradeoff parameter used in soft-thresholding operation.</p><p>Based on the above matrix completion algorithm, we can recover the missing entries in association matrix A by solving the optimization problem. However, because only known miRNAdisease associations are taken into consideration in the objective function, the above model fails to work for new diseases with no known related miRNAs. To solve this problem and improve the accuracy, we propose a novel model of NCMCMDA in this study. The main procedure of NCMCMDA is made up of three steps (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Firstly, after the data preparation, we obtain A, SD, SM, respectively. Secondly, we introduce the neighborhood constraint. The k nearest neighbors of disease (miRNA) are ranked out to calculate a new disease (miRNA) similarity matrix. Then, we perform simple matrix multiplication on the new disease similarity matrix with X, and on X with the new miRNA similarity matrix. The two products are linearly combined to obtain X'. Thirdly, we add the square error between X' and X as a constraint into the objective function. Then, we adopt a fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding method to solve the optimization problem. The details of NCMCMDA are shown as follows.</p><p>According to previous assumption that functionally similar miRNAs are more likely to have associations with diseases which share similar phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, we further assume that the association likelihood between disease d(i) and miRNA m(j) should be close to the association score which is calculated based on d(i)'s neighbors and m(j)'s neighbors. Based on this assumption, we introduce neighborhood constraint in this study. Here, given a miRNA m(j), we pick out the m(j)'s k most similar miRNAs as its neighbor set based on the integrated miRNA similarity, and use N(m(j)) to represent this neighbor set. Then we define a new miRNA similarity matrix ∼ SM, whose element is obtained as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∼ SM j, l = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ SM(j,l) m(p)∈N(m(j)) SM(j,p) if m l ∈ N m(j) 0 o t h e r w i s e<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Likewise, disease d(i)'s k nearest neighbors are ranked out as d(i)'s neighbor set, which is symbolized as N(d(i)). The new disease similarity matrix ∼ SD is computed in the same way. These two similarity matrices only contain disease's (miRNA's) neighbor information. As shown in Equation (3), we calculate X' based on disease's (miRNA's) neighbors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X' = ω ∼ SDX + (1 -ω) X ∼ SM T (3)</formula><p>where ω is the tradeoff parameter that balances the weight of miRNA space and disease space. According to the aforementioned assumption, the newly calculated X' ought to meet the condition that X(i, j) ≈ X'(i, j).</p><p>Here, we define a square loss function l(X, X') as shown in Equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), and we want it to be small. l X, X' = X -X'</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">2 F = ω I nd - ∼ SD X + (1 -ω) I nm - ∼ SM T 2 F (4)</formula><p>where I nm and I nd are identity matrix with size nm and nd, respectively.
