<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Vision</head><p>The focus of our research is to design and build rapidly deployable, scalable, adaptive, cost-effective, and robust swarms of autonomous distributed robots. Our objective is to provide a scientific, yet practical, approach to the design and analysis of swarm systems.</p><p>The team robots could vary widely in type, as well as size, e.g., from nanobots to micro-air vehicles (MAVs) and micro-satellites. A robot's sensors perceive the world, including other robots, and a robot's effectors make changes to that robot and/or the world, including other robots. It is assumed that robots can only sense and affect nearby robots; thus, a key challenge has been to design "local" control rules. Not only do we want the desired global behavior to emerge from the local interaction between robots (self-organization), but we also require fault-tolerance, that is, the global behavior degrades very gradually if individual robots are damaged. Self-repair is also desirable, in the event of damage. Self-organization, fault-tolerance, and self-repair are precisely those principles exhibited by natural physical systems. Thus, many answers to the problems of distributed control can be found in the natural laws of physics.</p><p>This paper provides an overview of our framework for distributed control, called "physicomimetics" or "artificial physics" (AP). We use the term "artificial" (or virtual) because although we are motivated by natural physical forces, we are not restricted to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Although the forces are virtual, robots act as if they were real. Thus the robot's sensors must see enough to allow it to compute the force to which it is reacting. The robot's effectors must allow it to respond to this perceived force.</p><p>There are two potential advantages to this approach. First, in the real physical world, collections of small entities yield surprisingly complex behavior from very simple interactions between the entities. Thus there is a precedent for believing that complex control is achievable through simple local interactions. This is required for very small robots, since their sensors and effectors will necessarily be primitive. Second, since the approach is largely independent of the size and number of robots, the results scale well to larger robots and larger sets of robots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Physicomimetics Framework</head><p>The basic AP framework is elegantly simple. Virtual physics forces drive a multirobot system to a desired configuration or state. The desired configuration (state) is one that minimizes overall system potential energy. In essence the system acts as a molecular dynamics (F = ma) simulation.</p><p>At an abstract level, AP treats robots as physical particles. This enables the framework to be embodied in robots ranging in size from nanobots to satellites. Particles exist in two or three dimensions and are point-masses. Each particle i has position x and velocity v. We use a discrete-time approximation to the continuous behavior of the system, with time-step ∆t. At each time step, the position of each particle undergoes a perturbation ∆x. The perturbation depends on the current velocity, i.e., ∆x = v∆t. The velocity of each particle at each time step also changes by ∆v. The change in velocity is controlled by the force on the particle, i.e., ∆v = F ∆t/m, where m is the mass of that particle and F is the force on that particle. A frictional force is included, for self-stabilization. This is modeled as a viscous friction term, i.e., the product of a viscosity coefficient and the robot's velocity (independently modeled in the same fashion by Howard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). We have also included a parameter F max , which restricts the maximum force felt by a particle. This provides a necessary restriction on the acceleration a robot can achieve. Also, a parameter V max restricts the velocity of the particles, which is very important for modeling real robots.</p><p>Given a set of initial conditions and some desired global behavior, it is necessary to define what sensors, effectors, and local force laws are required for the desired behavior to emerge. This is explored, in the next section, for a variety of simulated static and dynamic multi-robot configurations. Our implementation with robots is discussed in Section 3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Physicomimetic Results</head><p>Our research has focused on robotic behaviors that are similar to those shown by solids, liquids, and gases. Solid crystalline formations are useful for distributed sensing tasks, to create a virtual antenna or synthetic aperture radar. For such tasks it is important to maintain connectivity and a lattice geometry. Liquids are for obstacle avoidance tasks, since fluids easily maneuver around obstacles while retaining connectivity. Solid and liquid behaviors are formed using a similar force law, that has attractive and repulsive components. The transition between solids and liquids can be performed via a change in only one parameter, which balances the attractive and repulsive components <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, gases are handy for coverage tasks, such as surveillance and sweeping maneuvers. For these tasks it is imperative that coverage can be maintained, even in the face of individual robot failures. Gas-like behaviors are created using purely repulsive forces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Simulation Results</head><p>Solids: Our initial application required that a swarm of MAVs self-organize into a hexagonal lattice, creating a distributed sensing grid with spacing R between MAVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Potential applications include sensing grids for the mapping or tracing of chemical/biological plumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or the creation of virtual antennas to improve the resolution of radar images <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. To map this into a force law, each robot repels other robots that are closer than R, while attracting robots that are further than R in distance. Thus each robot has a circular "potential well" around itself at radius R -and neighboring robots will be separated by distance R. The intersection of these potential wells is a form of constructive interference that creates "nodes" of low potential energy where the robots are likely to reside. A simple compass construction illustrates that this intersection of circles of radius R will form a hexagonal lattice where the robot separation is R. Note that potential energy (PE) is never actually computed by the robots. Robots compute local force vectors. PE is only computed for visualization or mathematical analysis.</p><p>With this in mind, we defined a force law F = Gm i m j /r p , where F ≤ F max is the magnitude of the force between two particles i and j, and r is the distance between the two particles. The variable p is a user-defined power, which ranges from -5.0 to 5.0. Unless stated otherwise, we assume p = 2.0 and F max = 1 in this paper. Also, m i = 1.0 for all particles (although the framework does not require this). The "gravitational constant" G is set at initialization. The force is repulsive if r &lt; R and attractive if r &gt; R. Each particle has one sensor that can detect the distance and bearing to nearby particles. The one effector enables movement with velocity v ≤ V max . To ensure that the force laws are local, we allow particles to sense only their nearest neighbors. Hence, particles have a visual range of only 1.5R.</p><p>A simple generalization of this force law will also create square lattices. If robots are arbitrarily labeled with one of two colors, then square lattices are formed if robots that have unlike colors have a separation of R, while robots that have like colors have separation √ 2R. Furthermore, transformations between square and hexagonal lattices (and vice versa) are easily accomplished. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates formations with 50 robots. The initial deployment configuration (left) is assumed to be a tight cluster of robots. The robots move outwards into a square formation (middle). Then they transform to a hexagonal formation (right). Selfrepair in the face of agent failure is also straightforward <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The total PE of the initial deployment configuration is an excellent indicator of the quality of the final formation. High PE predicts high quality formations. This energy is dependent on the value of G, and it can be proven that the optimal value of G for hexagonal lattices is <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G opt = F max R p [2 -1.5 1-p ] p/(1-p) (1)</formula><p>The value of G opt does not depend on the number of particles, which is a nice result. However, for square lattices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">G opt 2 = F max R p √ 2(N -1)[2 -1.3 1-p ] + N [2 -1.7 1-p ] √ 2(N -1) + N p/(1-p)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Note that in this case G opt depends on the number of particles N . It occurs because there are two classes (colors) of robots. However, the dependency on N is not large and goes to zero as N increases. Our current research is focused on the movement of formations through obstacle fields towards some goal. Larger obstacles are created from multiple, point-sized obstacles; this enables flexible creation of obstacles of arbitrary size and shape. As a generalization to our standard paradigm, goals are attractive, whereas obstacles are repulsive (similar to potential field approaches, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates how a square formation moves through an obstacle field via a sequence of rotations and counter-rotations of the whole collective. This behavior emerges from the interaction of forces and is not a programmed response. If this cannot be accomplished, the formation may not be able to make further progress towards the goal.</p><p>Liquids: As stated above, the difference in behavior between solid formations and liquid formations depends on the balance between the attractive and repulsive components of the forces. In fact, the parameter G once again plays a crucial role. Below a certain value of G ≡ G t , liquid behavior occurs. Above that value, solid behavior occurs. The switch between the two behaviors acts very much like a phase transition. Using a standard balance of forces argument we can show that the phase transition for hexagonal lattices occurs at <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G t = F max R p 2 √ 3<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The phase transition law for square lattices is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">G t 2 = F max R p 2 √ 2 + 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Neither law depends on the number of robots N , and the difference in the denominators reflects the difference in hexagonal and square geometries. There are several uses for these equations. Not only can we predict the value of G t at which the phase transition will occur, but we can also use G t to help design our system. For example, a value of G ≈ 0.9G t yields the best liquid formation, while a value of G ≈ 1.8G t ≈ G opt yields the best solid formations.</p><p>As mentioned before, liquids are especially interesting for their ability to flow through obstacle fields, while retaining their connectivity. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> illustrates how a "square" liquid formation moves through the same obstacle field as before. In comparison with the solid formation shown above, far more deformation occurs as the liquid moves through the obstacles. However, the movement is quicker, because the liquid does not have to maintain the rigid geometry of the solid. Despite this, connectivity is maintained. One can easily imagine a situation where a formation lowers G to move around obstacles, and then raises G to "re-solidify" the formations after the obstacles have been avoided.</p><p>Gases: The primary motivation for gas behavior is regional coverage, e.g., for surveillance and sweeping. For stealth it is important for individual robots to have an element of randomness, while the emergent behavior of the collective is still predictable. Furthermore, any approach must be robust in the face of robot failures or the addition of new robots. The AP algorithm for surveillance is simple and elegant -agents repel each other, and are also repelled by perimeter and obstacle boundaries, providing uniform coverage of the region. If robots are added/destroyed, they still search the enclosed area, but with more/less virtual "pressure" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. An interesting phase transition for this system depends on the value of G. When G is high, particles fill the corridor uniformly, providing excellent on-the-spot coverage. When G is low, particles move toward the corners of the corridor, providing excellent line-of-sight coverage. Depending on whether the physical robots are better at motion or sensing, the G parameter can be tuned appropriately.</p><p>Currently we are investigating the more difficult task of "sweeping" a region, while avoiding obstacles. This task consists of starting a swarm of robots at one end of a corridor-like region, and allowing them to travel to the opposite end, providing maximum coverage of the region in minimal time. A goal force causes the robots to traverse the corridor length. As they move, robots must not only avoid obstacles, but they must also sweep in behind the obstacles to minimize holes in the coverage. One obvious tradeoff is the speed at which the robots move down the corridor. If they move quickly, they traverse the corridor in minimal time, but may move too quickly to sweep in behind obstacles. On the other hand, excellent sweeping ability behind obstacles can significantly slow the swarm. What is required is a Pareto optimal solution that balances sweeping ability with traversal speed v traversal .</p><p>To address this task we modified our standard AP algorithm to employ a more realistic gas model that has Brownian motion and expansion properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. The collective swarm behavior appears as Brownian motion on a small scale, and as a directed bulk movement of the swarm when viewed from a macroscopic perspective. The expansion properties provide across-corridor coverage and the ability to sweep in behind obstacles. An analogy would be the release of a gas from the ceiling of the room that has an atomic weight slightly higher than the normal atmosphere. This gas drifts downward, moving around obstacles, and expanding back to cover the areas under the obstacles. As mentioned above, speed of movement down the length of the corridor is governed by v traversal . However, the expansion properties (across the corridor width) are governed by a temperature parameter T , which determines the expected kinetic theory speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v kt = 1 4 8πkT m (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where k is Boltzmann's constant. Note that v kt is an emergent property of the system -each robot can continually change its velocity, based on "virtual" robot/robot, robot/obstacle, and robot/corridor collisions. The net effect is to provide a stochastic component to each robot, while maintaining predictable collective behavior. The resultant velocity of each robot depends on both v traversal and v kt . In other words, although the speed of the swarm is predictable, the individual robot velocities are not. This is especially valuable for stealthy surveillance. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> illustrates the compromise between traversal speed and the quality of the sweep, providing effective coverage in reasonable time, with the exception of small gaps behind the obstacles. Numerous experiments with different corridors confirm this effectiveness in simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results with Robots</head><p>The current focus of this project is the physical embodiment of AP on a team of robots.</p><p>For our experiments, we built seven robots. The "head" of each robot is a sensor platform used to detect other robots in the vicinity. For distance information we use Sharp GP2D12 IR sensors. The head is mounted horizontally on a servo motor. With 180 • of servo motion, and two Sharp sensors mounted on opposite sides, the head provides a simple "vision" system with a 360 • view. After a 360 • scan, object detection is performed. A first derivative filter detects object boundaries, even under conditions of partial occlusion. Width filters are used to ignore narrow and wide objects. This algorithm detects nearby robots, producing a "robot" list that gives the bearing/distance of neighboring robots.</p><p>Once sensing and object detection are complete, the AP algorithm computes the virtual force felt by that robot. In response, the robot turns and moves to some position. This "cycle" of sensing, computation and motion continues until we shut down the robots or they run out of power. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the AP code. It takes a robot neighbor list as input, and outputs the vector of motion in terms of a turn and distance to move.</p><p>To evaluate performance we ran two experiments. The objective of the first experiment was to form a hexagon. The desired distance R between robots was 23 inches. Using the theory, we chose a G of 270 (p = 2 and F max = 1). The beginning configuration was random. The results were very consistent, producing a good quality hexagon ten times in a row and taking approximately seven cycles on average. A cycle takes about 25 seconds to perform, almost all of which is devoted to the scan of the environment. The AP algorithm itself is extremely fast. A new localization technology that we are developing will be much faster and will replace the current scan technique. For all runs the robots were separated by 20.5 to 26 inches in the final formation, which is only slightly more error than the sensor error.</p><p>The objective of the second experiment was to form a hexagon and then move in formation to a goal. For this experiment, we placed four photo-diode light sensors on each robot, one per side. These produced an additional force vector, moving the robots towards a light source (a window). The magnitude of the goal force must be less than √ 3G/R p for cohesion of the formation to be maintained <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The results, shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, were consistent over ten runs, achieving an accuracy comparable to the formation experiment above. The robots moved about one foot in 13 cycles of the AP algorithm.</p><p>In conclusion, the ability to set system parameters from theory greatly enhances our ability to generate correct robotic swarm behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion and Outlook</head><p>This paper has summarized our framework for distributed control of swarms of robots in sensor networks, based on laws of artificial physics (AP). The motivation for this approach is that natural laws of physics satisfy the requirements Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Seven robots self-organize into a hexagonal formation, which then successfully moves towards a light source (a window, not the reflection of the window). Pictures taken at the initial conditions, at two minutes, fifteen minutes, and thirty minutes.</p><p>of distributed control, namely, self-organization, fault-tolerance, and self-repair. The results have been quite encouraging. We illustrated how AP can self-organize hexagonal and square lattices. Results showing fault-tolerance and self-repair are in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We have also summarized simulation results with dynamic multi-agent behaviors such as obstacle avoidance, surveillance, and sweeping. This paper also outlines several physics-based analyses of AP, focusing on potential energy, force balance equations, and kinetic theory. These analyses provide a predictive technique for setting parameters in the robotic systems. Finally, we have shown AP on a team of seven mobile robots.</p><p>We consider AP to be one level of a more complex control architecture. The lowest level controls the movement of the robots. AP is at the next higher level, providing "way points" for the robots, as well as providing simple repair mechanisms. Our goal is to put as much behavior as possible into this level, in order to provide the ability to generate laws governing important parameters. However, levels above AP are needed to solve more complex tasks requiring planning, learning, and global information <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Future Work</head><p>Currently, we are improving our mechanism for robot localization. This work is an extension of Navarro-Serment et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, using a combination of RF with acoustic pulses to perform trilateration. This will distinguish robots from ob-stacles in a straightforward fashion, and will be much faster than our current "scan" technique.</p><p>We also plan to address the topic of optimality, if needed. It is well understood that potential field (PF) approaches can yield sub-optimal solutions. Since AP is similar to PF, similar problems arise with AP. Our experience thus far indicates that this is not a crucial concern, especially for the tasks that we have examined. However, if optimality is required we can apply new results from control theory to design force laws that guarantee optimality <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>. Although oscillations of the formations do not occur, excess movement of the robots can occur due the fact that the force law F = Gm i m j /r p is not zero at the desired separation distance R. Current work using an alternative force law based on the Lennard-Jones potential, where the magnitude of the force is negligible at the desired separation, greatly minimizes this motion.</p><p>From a theoretical standpoint, we plan to formally analyze other important aspects of AP systems. This analysis will be more dynamic (e.g., kinetic theory) than the analysis presented here. We also intend to expand the repertoire of formations, both static and dynamic. For example, initial progress has been made on developing static and dynamic linear formations. Many other formations are possible within the AP framework. Using evolutionary algorithms to create desired force laws is one intriguing possibility that we are currently investigating. We summarize one preliminary experiment here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Evolving Force Laws for Surveillance</head><p>This task consists of an environment with areas of forest and non-forest. The goal is for a swarm of MAVs to locate tanks on the ground. Tanks are hidden from the MAVs if they are in the forest. Each MAV has a target sensor with a small field of view for locating the tanks (with probability of detection P d ), and a foliage sensor with a larger field of view for detecting forest below it. The environment is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> with three MAVs. The smallest circle represents the target sensor. The next largest circle represents the foliage field of view. Each MAV acts as if it were contained in a "bubble" that has a certain radius (depicted as the outer circle). If the bubbles of two MAVs are separated from each other, the MAVs are attracted to one another. If the bubbles overlap, they are repelled. The optimum MAV separation occurs when the bubbles touch.</p><p>A genetic algorithm is used to find the optimum bubble radius, as well as the G, p, and F max parameters of the force law. We generated one environment with 100 tanks, 25% forest coverage, 20 MAVs, and P d = 1. The GA fitness function was the percentage of tanks seen within 3000 time steps. In this "training" phase the GA was used to evolve a force law, that when used by all MAVs, created perfect coverage (all tanks were seen).</p><p>Testing consisted of generating other environments and performing ablation studies. First, nine other environments were created with the same parameter settings. The MAVs had no difficulty finding all tanks. Next, the percentage of foliage was systematically changed from 0% to 90% in increments of 10%. In all cases the MAVs found all tanks. Finally, two ablation studies were performed. The triangle represents a tank that has not yet been seen but is visible, the + represents a tank that has been seen and is visible, the × represents a hidden tank that has not been seen, and the | represents a tank that is currently hidden but has been previously seen.</p><p>First, the number of MAVs was reduced from 20, to 15, to 10, and then to 5. The results were quite robust; performance only suffered when the number of agents was reduced to 5. Second, we also lowered the probability of detection P d from 1.0, to 0.75, to 0.5, and then to 0.25. Again, the results were quite robust, showing negligible performance drops (see Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</p><p>In summary, the results are extremely promising. Using only one training environment, the GA evolved a force law that showed surprising generality over changes in the environment, the number of MAVs, and the quality of the target detection sensor. with foraging, task allocation, and division of labor problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. In Beni et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>, a swarm distribution is determined via a system of linear equations describing difference equations with periodic boundary conditions. Behavior-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref> are also very popular. They derive vector information in a fashion similar to AP. Furthermore, particular behaviors such as "aggregation" and "dispersion" are similar to the attractive and repulsive forces in AP. Both behavior-based and rule-based (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>) systems have proved quite successful in demonstrating a variety of behaviors in a heuristic manner. Behavior-based and rule-based techniques do not make use of potential fields or forces. Instead, they deal directly with velocity vectors and heuristics for changing those vectors (although the term "potential field" is often used in the behavior-based literature, it generally refers to a field that differs from the strict Newtonian physics definition). Control-theoretic approaches have also been applied effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. Our approach does not make the assumption of having leaders and followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>One of the earliest physics-based techniques is the potential fields (PF) approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>). Most of the PF literature deals with a small number of robots (typically just one) that navigate through a field of obstacles to get to a target location. The environment, rather than the agents, exert forces. Obstacles exert repulsive forces, while goals exert attractive forces. Recently, Howard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Vail and Veloso <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> extended PF to include inter-agent repulsive forcesfor the purpose of achieving coverage. Although this work was developed independently of AP, it affirms the feasibility of a physics force-based approach. The social potential fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> framework by Reif and Wang is highly related to AP, in that they rely on a force-law simulation similar to our own. We plan to merge their approach with ours.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
