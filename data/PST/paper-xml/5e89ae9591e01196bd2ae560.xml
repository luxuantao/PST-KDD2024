<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Evaluating the performance of meteorological service not only relies on physical measurements but also requires public feedback. As a significant part of the evaluation, assessing the sentiment of these feedbacks gives an insightful view which can help to establish reliable decision support in policy making and emergency responding. However, climate and weather are always accompanying phenomena in the evolutionary process of human beings, making the climate and weather-related words themselves contain a large number of extend meanings in people's daily expression. These polysemy phenomena have led to a decline in the performance of traditional general sentiment calculations in the vertical field of meteorology. As far as we know, there is no Chinese sentiment calculation tool in the meteorological field, due to the different expressions between different languages. Facing with the above problems and issues, this paper proposes and establishes a sentiment analysis based on lexicon-based framework of Chinese text in the meteorological field. The framework fuses two major sentiment assessment method consists of two approaches, namely machine learning-based and knowledge based one. First, word embedding similarity and word cooccurrence methods are utilized to construct the domain sentiment dictionary which includes 8,796 negative words and 4,751 positive words. Then, by using the extend sentiment dictionary to select theme words from original text as feature, machine learning models are introduced to assess the sentiment tendency. Experiment showed that the performance of the proposed framework was improved up to 85.79% in terms of overall accuracy compared with traditional methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In social media platforms, people are not only regarded as recipients of information, but also as perceptions and producers of information. The number of online discussion and comment sharply increasing, making more and more people known as "netizens" to exchange their personal information, experience and knowledge on social network sites (SNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As a typical topic, people can freely discuss the weather and post relevant comments on SNS such as Twitter, Facebook and Sina Weibo. One of the key features of the comments posted include their perception, feeling, emotion and feedback towards weather and climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Thus, we can collect and analyze these subjective responses of the speakers and finally demonstrates the social significance through techniques such as data mining and knowledge engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This method named sentiment analysis can provide real-time feedback on weather conditions and guides government about policy development, decision making, emergency response and public relations 5] <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It is * Corresponding author also suitable to interpret people's opinions and emotions in professional fields such as metrology.</p><p>However, currently, performing meteorological Chinese sentiment analysis with general sentiment analytic tools are faced with the following major problems: (1) A large number of vocabulary and expressions in the meteorological field have broad implications. Taking meteorological phenomena as the means of human mood and development of things is widely present in various periods of Chinese expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> On the other hand, the coverage of existing universal Chinese sentiment dictionary is limited in specific fields. For example, the dictionary such as NTUSD and HOWNET will assign incorrect emotional scores to some area-specific words, and result in incorrect scores and sentiment classification of texts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> The choice of classifiers and the extra action of features are crucial in sentiment analysis of specific fields. Chinese text comments have the characteristics of diversified expression and inconsistent sentence length which causes the missing semantic information of text features and sparse feature vectors are normal in feature extraction. Therefore, facing with the above problems and issues, we propose a Chinese lexical based sentiment analysis framework in the vertical domain of meteorology. The framework is used to analyze users' own sentiment tendency on Weibo by determining the emotional polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of their posted tweets on the topic of weather. In this framework, we combine the word embedding similarity (WES) and the word co-occurrence (WCO) methods to construct a sentiment dictionary in the meteorological field. Then a machine learning model with the best sentiment analysis performance is utilized on sentiment keywords extracted from original tweets by using the extended domain sentiment dictionary. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The second section summarizes the technical development of the current text sentiment classification, especially in meteorologicalrelated text sentiment classification method. The third section introduces the structure and steps of the sentiment analysis framework proposed in this paper. The 4th section introduces the results and analysis of experiment. The 5th section is the conclusion and prospect. II. RELATED WORK Sentiment analysis (SA) is the process of detecting the context polarity of tweets, reviews, or other perspective texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. At the same time, it is worth noting that more and more researchers have conducted a lot of research on Chinese sentiment analysis recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.The sentiment analysis systems can be probably categorized into lexicon-based and corpus-based approaches. The lexicon-based approaches according to sentiment dictionary and the corpus-based approaches generally rely on machine learning-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Lexicon-based approaches</head><p>Sentiment dictionary is the basis of lexicon based sentiment analysis. Nowadays, the typical English sentiment lexicons include WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, SentiWordNet (http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it), General Inquirer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, etc. In the application of Chinese, the classic dictionaries include HowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and NTUSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> . Muhammad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a lexicon-enhanced method to improve the sentiment analysis of user generated reviews based on rulebased classification scheme. The proposed method of sentiment analysis has an improvement after considering emoticons, negation and domain specific terms to overcome the limitations of previous methods. Taboada et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> used a dictionary associated with its sentiment classes and scores to develop a semantic direction calculator (SO-CAL) which included negation and reinforcement. In addition, they pointed out that the process of dictionary construction and annotation. Their methods could be enlarged by combining emotion and area-specific words for more emotional classification. Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed an innovative approach to emotional computing of news events. Based on the word sentiment association network, a word emotion calculation algorithm is proposed to obtain the initial word emotion and re-express it through the standard sentiment dictionary. The construction of a specific sentiment dictionary is the key to text sentiment analysis. By continuously improving on the basis of existing dictionaries, the semantic information and text characteristics of words are fully explored, thereby improving the ability of text sentiment analysis. Jijkoun et al.</p><p>[21] used the TREC blog tracking test to generate a centralized automatically and accurate subject-specific subjective dictionary from a universal polarity dictionary Weichselbraun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> presented a semi-automatic method for creating emotional lexicons. Emotional extremum is assigned to words through crowdsourcing related techniques, and thresholds are set to select emotional vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Corpus-based approaches</head><p>Corpus-based approaches use machine learning methods to analyze texts of emotions. There are also many studies that use machine learning to analyze texts of emotions. Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> designed a system for recognizing video emotions by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for video emotion recognition, which can intelligently analyze and automatically identify video emotions. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> proposed a neural network model based on multiple attention to create a better representation of emotional expressions and clauses. The model encoded clauses through two-way longterm and short-term memory, and then used multi-attentionbased neural network to capture the interaction between emotional clauses and each candidate clause. Samara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> Tom proposes a layered machine learning method based on facial expressions for emotional state recognition on affective state recognition using active stimuli. The method uses a feature representation based on Euclidean distance and is combined with the user's own custom coding. Tang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> proposed a machine learning-based approach that combines pattern matching for sentiment analysis. This method calculates the value of emotional tendency by designing keyword extraction strategies and some emotional expression patterns. Ajili et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> used the random decision forest method to identify and analyze expression gestures. The method extracts body features based on the Laban Movement Analysis factors that describe the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human motion. Yi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> proposed a multimodal learning framework that depicts the visual modalities that trigger emotions by extracting features from motion key point trajectories and convolutional neural network methods. Song <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> utilized the nearest neighbor (NN) graph method to measure the similarity among different text materials, and introduce a feature clustering strategy to divide the emotion features into two classes to learn the general feature subspace of the original dataset and the target dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Analysis of sentiment in the meteorology</head><p>Internet users are paying more and more attention to meteorology, and they have presented unprecedented challenges to the meteorological department's sensational guidance capabilities. At present, researchers have on the emotional analysis of meteorology. Han et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> analyzed the spatial, temporal and textual related to Shouguang Flood in Sina Weibo in 2018, causing casualties and economic losses, which caused widespread concern of the Chinese public. A topic extraction and analysis model was established to hierarchically classify six flood-related topics and nine public emotional feedbacks in the tweets text. Gelernter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> used named entity recognition and machine learning methods to identify streets and addresses, buildings and urban spaces through post-earthquake tweets, Bakillah et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> experimented with the case study of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines using a clustering algorithm based on semantic similarity. Crooks et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of tweets on twitter on the east coast of the United States. Their experiments have shown that people act as sensors to improve our situational awareness and improve our understanding and response to such events. Blanford et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> found that the tweets on Twitter reflect the different reactions of people in different stages of a tornado.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. METHOD</head><p>In this section, we introduce our proposed Chinese lexical based sentiment analysis framework in meteorology to analyze the emotional polarity of meteorological reviews in Weibo. Generally, our framework includes text preprocessing, extension of meteorology sentiment lexicons, and machine learning based sentiment assessment.</p><p>The main purpose of this work is to improve the accuracy and precision of sentiment analysis by combining the knowledge-based and the machine learning-based approaches and relief the problem of data sparsity with noise. The proposed method consists of the following three main steps: 1) We perform 10,000 weather-related texts crawled on Weibo for pre-processing of word segmentation and stop words removal for noise reduction; 2) Based on the existing emotional dictionary in the Chinese language, the preprocessed text is used to expand the emotional dictionary in the meteorological field with combining WCO and WES methods; 3) The expanded emotional dictionary are used as feature extractor, and machine learning methods are used to </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Text preprocessing</head><p>In this paper, 10,000 Chinese tweets with the topic of meteorology on Sina Weibo were collected and manually labeled to form a corpus for the following research. Then we divide each tweets into words collection by using the commonly used Chinese word segmentation tool namely Jieba. The next step is to use the stop word set to remove stop words and punctuations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Extending meteorological sentiment lexicons</head><p>Emotional dictionary is an important toolkit for sentiment processing algorithms. Three major approaches are commonly used to construct emotional dictionary, namely manual approaches, corpus-based approaches and dictionary-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. Manual approaches utilize human power to establish the lexicon. Dictionary-based approaches took the idea that a lexicon is expanded by expanding a seed dictionary with utilizing resources. A set of seed words is expanded by a relatively large corpus from a particular domain in Corpus based approaches. Obviously, manual methods are usually not doable because each domain needs its own dictionary, and this manpower effort is apparently expensive. Unlike corpusbased approaches, dictionary-based approaches are more straightforward and can express subjective feelings, emotions, or opinions. This paper combines the dictionary-based approaches and corpus-based approaches, and constructs an emotional dictionary in the meteorology. This paper adopts the existing Chinese language dictionary which include Taiwan University Opinion Dictionary (NTUSD) and How Net Dictionary (HOWNET) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> as the basic dictionary of emotion analysis, and then uses the pre-processed Weibo on this basis. Then based on this, the pre-processed tweets corpus is used to expand the sentiment dictionary in the meteorology field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) PMI-based vocabulary polarity judgment</head><p>This section uses the pointwise mutual information (PMI) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> to expand the special emotional vocabulary in the meteorology. The basic idea of this approach is to account the probability that two words may appear simultaneously in the corpus. The probability larger is, the more closely correlation and the higher degree of relevance is. The frequency of occurrence of all words in the statistical text corpus in the text, based on the existing sentiment dictionary (NTUSD dictionary and HOWNET dictionary). The way to calculate the PMI values of the seed words of the remaining words and the sentiment dictionary is shown as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">pmi(x, y) = log ( , ) ( ) ( )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where ( , ) represents the probability that the word (x) in the text corpus and the seed word y in the sentiment dictionary appear simultaneously.</p><p>( ) denotes the probability of occurrence of the word x in the text corpus, and ( ) represents the probability of occurrence of the seed word y in the sentiment dictionary. pmi(x, y) represents the extent to which x, y co-occur. When the value is larger, the coexistence frequency of the two words is higher. However, We can only use PMI to decide the co-occurrence of two words, not the polarity of a word. For example, the word "weather" not only has a high frequency of co-occurrence with positive words in the sentiment dictionary, but also has a high frequency of co-occurrence with negative words in the emotional dictionary. It is impossible to judge the polarity of the word "weather". Therefore, we use the method proposed by Turney <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> to tell the emotional polarity (SO) of the word, and subtract the PMI of a word from the positive sentiment word from the PMI of the negative sentiment word to get a difference. The emotional tendency of the word is judged based on the difference, and calculated by the Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">SO(w) = ∑ ( , ) − ∑ ( , )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Where is the word to determine polarity. and denote positive and negative seed words respectively, while and denote their total number of words, respectively. Therefore, the probability of adding the word to the positive sentiment dictionary is also larger. If the value of SO is larger than the threshold, this word would be considered to be closer to the positive word than negative one. Finally, by setting the threshold, the filter word is expanded into the basic sentiment dictionary to generate the domain dictionary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Vocabulary polarity judgment based on word embedding similarity</head><p>We utilized a distributed representation to get vector representation of theme words. The word vector dimension in this representation relatively low compared with one-hot encoding, and the similarity between words is expressed by calculating the distance between each two word vectors. In this paper, we use the method of Rumelhart et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> used word2vec to perform word vector training on pre-processed text corpus, and to calculate the non-original sentiment dictionary in the seed word and text in the original sentiment Identify applicable funding agency here. If none, delete this text box. dictionary in space. The distance between the words into observe their similarity, thus judging the emotional polarity of the word (the word in the non-original sentiment dictionary in the text).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( , ) = ∑ ( × ) ∑ × ∑<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Shown in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>), ( , ) represents the similarity between the seed word in the sentiment dictionary and the word in the non-original sentiment dictionary in the text.</p><p>represents a vector of seed words in the sentiment dictionary.</p><p>represents the vector of words in the nonoriginal sentiment dictionary in the text. The larger the sim value, the closer the emotional polarity of the word in the nonoriginal sentiment dictionary in the text is to the emotional polarity of the seed word in the sentiment dictionary.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">SO(w) = ∑ ( , ) − ∑ ( , )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) also uses the method proposed by Turney <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> to determine the emotional polarity (SO) of the word. Similarly, finally the threshold is added to filter the word expansion into the basic sentiment dictionary to generate the domain dictionary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Weighted selection based on the two extension methods</head><p>The above two methods can be used to expand the corresponding sentiment dictionary separately. However, due to the limitation of corpus size, the PMI-based vocabulary polarity judgment method is affected by the low frequency words, and the value of the correlation calculation results are generally small, which is not conducive to the comparison and differentiation of correlation size. Similarly, the vocabulary polarity judgment based on word embedding similarity method is prone to cause the semantic relationship between words and the lack of text structure information. When dealing with massive information, there are also problems of high dimensionality and sparsity. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis, this paper combines the two methods with the idea of weighting. The best emotional words are screened from the corresponding emotional dictionaries by two methods.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= ×<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>, ' ' represents the final weight of the word in the non-original sentiment dictionary in the text. represents a threshold based on the PMI method. represents a threshold based on the word embedding similarity method.</p><p>represents the word based on the vocabulary polarity value of the word embedding similarity method. represents the vocabulary polarity value of the word which based on PMI. The larger the absolute value of (negative polarity is negative), the greater the degree to which the word becomes an emotional word in the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Calculation of emotional polarity values</head><p>When the word set of the sentiment dictionary is determined, if the value of the emotional polarity of the words in the active dictionary is directly set to 1 (or vice versa, the value of the emotional polarity of the words in the negative dictionary is directly set to -1). This practice is obviously not accurate. For example: "Unhappy" and "angry" are obviously emotional words of two people with different levels of emotion. "Although the weather is a bit bad, I feel very happy. " There is a negative emotional word "a bit bad" and a positive emotional word "very happy", obviously the emotional tendency of this sentence is positive and not neutral. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis, the method proposed by Ku et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is used in this paper. The emotional polarity of each morpheme is calculated according to the frequency of occurrence in the positive and negative dictionaries which is calculated in Equations ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= ∑ ⁄ ∑ ∑ ⁄ ⁄ (6) = ∑ ⁄ ∑ ∑ ⁄ ⁄<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where</p><p>indicates the frequency at which a morpheme '(one word in each sentiment word) appears in each positive sentiment word (' ' indicates that a morpheme ' ' appears in each negative phrase of the frequency), 'm' and 'n' respectively represent the number of Chinese characters in each emotional word. Therefore, the emotional polarity value of each word is in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">8</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">= ( − )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>and respectively indicate that the weight of is positive or negative characters. The difference between and is -in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>), which is decided in the emotional tendency of character . If it is positive, this character will appear more times in positive Chinese words and vice versa. A value near to zero means that it may not an sentiment character or a neutral emotional character.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">= × ∑<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">9</ref>) defines the sentiment degree of Chinese word , which gets the average value of the sentiment scores of the characters c , c , , c .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Machine learning based sentiment assessment</head><p>The main purpose of this stage is to extract the basis of the most classification of features from text data, and use the machine learning model to achieve the role of classification. In this paper, three features are selected for experiment: all words of the text, the keywords of each sentence and the emotional words in the expanded sentiment dictionary. The keywords for each sentence are respectively via text rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> and TF-IDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. In the next step, the commonly used classification models are selected based on the features to classify the texts (mainly divided into 3 categories, positive, negative and neutral): k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> [42], logistic regression (LR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, support vector machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data sets and evaluation indicators</head><p>We crawled 1,468,274 weather-related tweets from Weibo and randomly sampled 10,000 records and manually label emotional polarity (positive, negative or neutral) by observing the emotional sentiment of the text. We finally got 4,950 neutral posts, 2,463 negative posts, and 2,587 positive posts. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT BASED ON SENTIMENT DICTIONARIES</head><p>The proportion of the three emotional tendency texts is also in line with the actual proportion of all crawled posts.</p><p>In this experiment, we used the following evaluation indicators to evaluate the experimental results: precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>which are listed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Precision = (10) Recall =<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">F1 = × × ( )<label>(12)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">Accuracy =<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Where is the number of tweets comments that correctly classify positive sentiment.</p><p>is the number of Weibo comments with positive emotional sentiment that is misclassified.</p><p>is the number of tweets comments for the correct classification of negative emotional tendencies. ' ' is the number of tweets comments with negative emotional sentiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experiment 1) Performance of extended sentiment dictionary</head><p>Firstly, based on the two sentiment dictionaries of NTUSD and HOWNET, the corresponding sentiment dictionaries are expanded by the word embedding similarity method (WES), co-occurrence method (WCO) and combination method(WCO-WES) in the third section. Then we assign the sentiment words in the sentiment dictionary through the method which proposed in the previous section to determine the emotional tendency of the text. If the sentiment value of a text is larger than zero, the emotional tendency of the text is considered to be positive. Similarly, if the emotional value of a text is less than 0, then the emotional tendency of the text is considered negative. If the emotional value of a text is equal to 0, then the emotional tendency of the text is considered neutral.</p><p>In this experiment, the emotional words of NTUSD and HOWNET were used to evaluate the emotional sentiment in the sentiment dictionary using the proposed method. The experimental results are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.The experimental results show that the WCO method is better than the original dictionary-based method (the accuracy of NTUSD has increased by 2.84%, and the accuracy of HOWNET has increased by 1.03%). The WES approach is better than the WCO approach (the accuracy of NTUSD has increased by 1.85% and the accuracy of HOWNET has increased by 3.04%). The WCO-WES method has the best performance, and the indicators are generally improved compared with the benchmark dictionary, and the accuracy reaches 79.97% and 77.14%, respectively. In the WCO-WES method, although there are a few indicators below the WCO or WES method, the overall indicator value has been greatly improved, and the value is relatively stable. There will be no phenomenon that the individual indicators are very high or very low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Performance of machine learning-based approach</head><p>In this experiment, we first use 1,000,000 meteorologicalrelated comments as corpus for unsupervised learning and generate corresponding models. The 10,000 tagged Weibo comments were then divided into three categories by the classifier using the trained model, positive, negative and neutral. In this experiment, based on the above experimental results (this section uses the best performing WCO-WES (NTUSD) dictionary), we selected LR, kNN, SVM and GBDT as classifiers, using the extended sentiment dictionary, all words in the text, extracting 10 subject words using Text Rank, and extracting 10 subject words and four types of data using TF-IDF as extracted features.. The experimental results are presented in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.  Experimental data shows that the results of the machine learning method are generally much better than the dictionaryonly method. By comparing the experimental data, we can see that each group has the best results based on the extended sentiment dictionary, which are: 80.89, 81.41, 82.68, 85.79 . In this experiment, we got the best classifier (GBDT), which performed well in all indicators, with an accuracy rate of 85.79%, which is 14.63% higher than the accuracy based on the NTUSD dictionary. It suggests that this sentiment classification framework can improve the accuracy of text sentiment classification in the area of meteorology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we present a Chinese lexical based sentiment analysis framework in meteorology. In the step of constructing the framework, we use the word co-occurrence method as well as the word embedding similarity method based on the basic dictionary, and then combine the two methods. Finally, 8796 negative words and 4751 positive words are selected and constructed. Emotional dictionary in the field of meteorology. Next, the constructed sentiment dictionary is used as the word feature, and the emotional polarity of the text is discriminated by four machine learning methods (KNN, LR, SVM, GBDT). Compared with the original method, this method has improved the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Here, we provide a framework and dictionary of sentiment analysis based on fine-grained meteorological fields for relevant departments and scholars to conduct related research. At the same time, we continue to use more and more types of data to conduct experiments. Continuously improve the sentiment analysis framework and update the emotional words in the sentiment dictionary in the meteorology.</p><p>In future work, we can consider replacing other methods in the framework to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis in the meteorological field, such as based on other sentiment lexicons or multiple emotional dictionary mixed screening methods. Secondly, we can also study coarsegrained sentiment classification with the help of deep learning related models. Finally, text sentiment analysis is used to analyze the user's emotions, grasp the user's emotions and other characteristics of information, we can also provide personalized intelligent knowledge services for the user.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
