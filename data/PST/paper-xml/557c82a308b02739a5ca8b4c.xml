<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Community bulletin boards serve an important function for public information sharing in modern society. Posted fliers advertise services, events, and other announcements. However, fliers posted offline suffer from problems such as limited spatial-temporal coverage and inefficient search support. In recent years, with the development of sensor-enhanced mobile devices, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has been used in a variety of application areas. This paper presents FlierMeet, a crowdpowered sensing system for cross-space public information reposting, tagging and sharing. The tags learned are useful for flier sharing and preferred information retrieval and suggestion. Specifically, we utilize various contexts (e.g., spatio-temporal info, flier publishing/reposting behaviors, etc.) and textual features to group similar reposts and classify them into categories. We further identify a novel set of crowd-object interaction hints to predict the semantic tags of reposts. To evaluate our system, 38 participants were recruited and 2,035 reposts were captured during an eight-week period. Experiments on this dataset showed that our approach to flier grouping is effective and the proposed features are useful for flier category/semantic tagging.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>environments, and so on. Therefore, it is particularly useful for small businesses and average users. Numerous empirical studies on the use of bulletin boards have proved its significance on community information sharing, socializing, viewpoint advertising, and marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In short, the usage of bulletin boards have been part of the fabric of the social space <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and it presents an informal, nonintrusive, and inexpensive medium for mass communication.</p><p>Though the bulletin board has proved useful and significant in our daily lives, it suffers from several drawbacks. First, it has limited spatial-temporal coverage. For example, fliers on bulletin boards might quickly be covered by new fliers and are mainly visible to passer-bys <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Second, fliers on a board are often cluttered and lack order, making it a laboring task for people to identify the information needed. Therefore, there would be benefits to augment paper-based boards with digital techniques to facilitate information sharing and retrieval. There have been several techniques devoted to address this. For example, digital displays lead to a transformation from paper fliers to digital contents, but its deployment and publishing cost is high, thus creating barriers to average content providers. Though barcodes or RFID tags connect paper fliers with the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the link is often directed to proprietary websites and thus making it difficult to have an open and universal platform for public information sharing. Due to their complementary features and merits, in the near future, we envision an co-existence of varied public information exchange mediums (paper fliers, digital contents, barcode-tagged fliers, etc.) and an effective and practical way is, however, to build an overlay above them for public information gathering and sharing. The consensus is that we should bridge the gap between these physical-space objects and their cyber-space counterparts to facilitate public information sharing, i.e., enabling cross-space content transferring and sharing.</p><p>With the recent surge of sensor-rich (e.g., accelerometer,</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>There are three closely related research areas to our work: mobile crowd sensing, community bulletin boards, and heterogeneous crowdsourced data mining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Mobile crowd sensing</head><p>Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) is a new sensing paradigm that empowers ordinary people to contribute data gathered or generated from their mobile devices. It further aggregates heterogeneous crowdsourced data in the cloud to extract hidden intelligence (e.g., from ambient audio/visual signal to location semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). From the AI perspective, MCS is founded on a distributed problem-solving model where crowds are engaged in complex problem solving procedures through open calls <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. There have been numerous MCS-powered applications, such as environment monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, traffic planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, social context sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, public safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, social event replay <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, etc. In this paper we focus on a novel application area of MCS, which aims to leverage crowd power to repost, analyze, and share distributed public info in urban areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Augmented bulletin boards and fliers</head><p>With the development of information and communication techniques, several approaches have been proposed to address the shortage of board-based fliers. The first proposal calls for replacing physical bulletin boards with digital displays, which have been used in many places (e.g., high-traffic streets, building entrances, workplaces) for information publishing. For example, Houde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> projected a digital newsletter created by members of a research group into a common gathering space. Alt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> developed a networked digital display system called Digifieds and deployed it in 12 public places in Oulu, Finland. They presented their insights regarding to the design and interaction techniques of digital displays after a six-month study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Public displays were also found useful for promoting social ties and enhancing work performance in small groups or organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. However, digital displays are often used for a business purpose or interaction in organizations. It lessens the openness in terms of average flier-posting activities, and their deployment/maintenance cost is considerably high.</p><p>Another widely studied method is the use of barcodes or RFID tags on fliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. By reading the associated tag, people can get access to a website and obtain more information about the flier. Though this method bridges the gap between the physical space and the virtual space, the information sharing problem still remains. The cross-space link is often directed to proprietary websites (owned by different stakeholders or content providers), making it difficult to have an open and universal platform for public information sharing. Unlike the above studies, FlierMeet presents a novel way to enhance public information dissemination and sharing. It is a cross-space reposting platform that leverages crowdsourcing and human mobility to move paper flier information into the cyber-physical computing system. Alt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> made an empirical study for varied paper-based notice areas, and attempted to propose a single large network of public displays to connect isolated display solutions. However, it is designed at a conceptual level and the vision for enforcing the same policies (the same design and structure) across all displays is hard to be implemented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Crowdsourced data mining</head><p>The extraction of high-level context or semantic information from raw user-contributed data is crucial to MCS. Cranshaw et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and Krumm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> introduced a set of location-based features to analyze the social context of geographic regions (e.g., home, office, etc.), which were extracted from crowd visiting patterns to the regions. CrowdSense@Place <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> exploited opportunistically captured image and audio clips from smartphones and proposed a set of features to assign category tags (e.g., store, restaurant) to places. MoVi <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> was an application in which smartphones collaboratively sense their environment and recognize socially "interesting" events. While existing studies mainly focus on mining contexts pertaining to places and events, we aim to identify the contexts of the reposted fliers (e.g., flier category and semantics) by leveraging both visual/textual features and crowd-flier interaction patterns. That's to say, crowd-object interaction patterns are explored to distil object contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE FLIERMEET SYSTEM OVERVIEW</head><p>FlierMeet is the first system that supports cross-space public information reposting, tagging, and sharing. Before getting into the technical details, we first define the data model and then present the system architecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The System Model</head><p>A cross-space reposting system consists of physical elements (e.g., fliers, human, boards), cyber elements (e.g., reposted counterparts), as well as their interactions. The proposed data model is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Person</head><p>Person denotes a user who reposts (called a reposter in this work) or views public information through FlierMeet. Each reposter has a set of personal or social features, such as age, gender, affiliation, education background, interests, social ties, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Board</head><p>A board refers to a place (e.g., a traditional bulletin board, a digital display) where fliers can be posted. Usually, the flier content varies depending on its location <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. For example, fliers found on a street board are generally varied in categories, while fliers seen around a department building in a university are often related to the academic. We call it the social preference of a board. In other words, while some boards attract a wide range of flier categories, some others are category-specific.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Flier</head><p>A flier can have many copies and can be posted on one or more boards. We define the reposts of the same flier as a flier group, which has several features: the group size (i.e., the number of reposts), the number of source boards (i.e., how many boards do the group members come from), and the group of users who repost this flier. Each repost has its repost time and each flier group has its category and semantic tags. For flier group f g , we use |f g | to denote the size of f g , B(f g ) as the number of source boards, and U(f g ) as the group of reposters for f g .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Tags</head><p>Considering mass demands of public information viewing, we characterize fliers at different levels using two types of tags: category tags and semantic tags. In the pilot study, we considered the following category tags: (1) ads (e.g., special deals, items on sale), (2) academic events (e.g., lectures, talks, workshops), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">3</ref>) notices (e.g., notices about a coming event), and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">4</ref>) recruitments (e.g., job hunting, part-time jobs). In addition to category tags, in information systems we often characterize items by their semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, e.g., a popular Twitter post or a surprise item to a user. According to the characteristics of FlierMeet, we define the following semantic tags. a) Popular. A 'popular' flier refers to a flier whose content will be enjoyed by a variety of people (of different age, occupation, and so on). In distribution, a popular flier is often posted in several different places. b) Hot. A 'hot' flier is defined as a specialized type of popular fliers: (1) it has a wide audience; (2) its popularity usually reaches a peak value within a short time period. The sudden explosion of hot fliers distinguishes themselves from average popular fliers. c) Professional. Compared to 'popular' fliers, a professional flier shows its influence to a specific community of users (i.e., not widely accepted by the public) who share some commonalities (e.g., major, interests, needs, behavior similarities). This is very common in our daily life. For example, a seminar flier is often interesting to people with the academic background, while a concert event often attracts music lovers. In this paper, we define this kind of flier as 'professional'. d) Social. People from existing groups usually show high similarity, which motivates us to characterize a flier at the social structure level. For instance, we can recommend a 'social' flier to an existing online group if a proportion of members from this group repost the information (e.g., suggesting a sale information to the detected group in Facebook). Groups can be extracted using community detection techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Different from the 'professional' tag, which largely depends on the content of a flier and is suggested to a dynamic group of users (e.g., job hunters, music lovers, people with similar GPS trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>), the 'social' tag to a flier is determined by the link density of its reposters and is recommended to the members of existing groups. e) Surprise. Most recommendation methods focus on the precision in the proximity to user preferences, which may, however, narrow down users' horizons. Recently, surprise recommendation, which aims to broaden users' horizons, has become a new research topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. There can be different definitions of a 'surprising item.' We characterize it from the following aspects. (1) 'Surprise' is a user-specific concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and for distinct users, the surprising items can be different. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We believe that the type of fliers that a person commonly sees is not surprising or novel to the user. So fliers that do not often appear in a user's daily life (e.g., fliers from the place you do not often visit) have more potential to be a surprise to the user.</p><p>Most social tagging systems adopt a multi-tag approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, which means that multiple tags can be given to a single object. In this paper, considering that some semantic tags may overlap, we use the multi-tag approach as well. For instance, a person from an existing online social network group may also belong to a dynamic group formed based on behavior similarity, and thus a flier can have both 'social' and 'professional' tags.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The System Architecture</head><p>The system architecture of FlierMeet is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. We briefly describe its major components in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Cross-space reposting</head><p>Cross-space reposting builds the connection between mobile clients and the backend server. Using the application running at the mobile clients, users can capture interesting fliers from bulletin boards and transmit them to the backend server. Since prior knowledge about boards is often not available, this component also supports the detection and location of bulletin boards based on crowd reposting behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Flier grouping</head><p>This module clusters fliers with duplicate reposts from different reposters into flier groups. A context-sensitive approach is proposed to improve group performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Data selection</head><p>FlierMeet chooses the best view of a flier in a flier group, which can be used for flier grouping and result display. The challenge is to design heuristics that can achieve reliable elimination and leave good candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Intelligent tagging</head><p>Category tags are categorized based on content analysis, and semantic tags are predicted using the features extracted from crowd-flier interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) User interface</head><p>It displays the extracted information to users in a multi-view manner, e.g., browsing by categories or semantic tags.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. REPOSTING, GROUPING, AND SELECTION</head><p>Crowd-powered cross-space reposting is a novel method of public information collection. In this section we first describe the reposting infrastructure and then present the flier grouping and selection methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Bulletin Board Detection</head><p>It is hard to gain prior knowledge of the deployment of bulletin boards in a city. We propose a crowdsourced clustering method for board detection that relies on a dynamic discovery process, as described below.</p><p>In FlierMeet, each repost is associated with a GPS point, which is captured during reposting at the mobile client side. Assuming that at a certain time t, there are n reposts in the system and the associated GPS points are P = {p Considering the precision of GPS readings and the normal distribution of boards in the real world, we set DisThres to 20m in this paper. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> gives an example, where p1~p6 are the GPS points of six reposts. At the beginning, as there are only four points (p1-p4) and the distance between p1 and p2 is less than DisThres, we use the middle point of p1 and p2 as the location of Board1. Similarly, Board 2 is detected by p3 and p4. Afterwards, two new reposts (p5, p6) arrives. Since the distance between p5 and Board 1 is less than DisThres, p5 is clustered into Board1 and the coordinates of Board1 are updated. p6 cannot be clustered and a new board (Board3) is detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data Capture Pilot and Dataset</head><p>We recruited 38 student volunteers to repost fliers on our university campus. The volunteers had four major origins: students from a course and a club, graduate students from our lab, and the ones recruited from public notices. They varied in their demographics such as age, major, interest, etc. To avoid invalid reposts, they were asked only to capture fliers that were interesting or important to them. As incentives, each participant was paid a 50~100 RMB shopping card according to their  During the eight-week period, we collected 2,035 reposts, based on which we identified 24 boards on the university campus. The reposts could be grouped into 921 flier groups. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) distribution of the number of source boards (left) and the size of each flier group (right). It seems that many flier groups are derived from the reposts from one or two boards, but some fliers are sourced from up to six boards. The size of each flier group varies, and the largest one has 14 copies from different contributors.</p><p>By obtaining social relationships between participants, we detected communities from them using the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Currently, the social relationships were acquired using a questionnaire. When deploying our system in a practical scenario in the future, they can be obtained from online social network portals (e.g., Facebook). Among the 38 participants, five communities (with distinct color) were detected, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Over the five communities, G1 was composed of students from a common course of the department of computer science. G2 consisted of undergraduates from a robotics techclub. Postgraduates, including masters and PhDs, in our lab made up of G3. G4 and G5 were volunteers recruited from open calls. These detected communities can be used for 'social' flier recommendation.</p><p>In the FlierMeet system, each repost is defined as a 6-tuple &lt;image, place, time, light_l, acc_var, shoot_angle&gt;. Usually, place is measured by GPS on the smartphone client. The three elements (light_l, acc_var, shoot_angle) are captured based on a smartphone's built-in sensors (light sensor, accelerometer, and magnetometer), which help understand the quality of reposts (to be depicted later in Section 4.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Similarity-based Flier Grouping</head><p>The aim of flier grouping is to cluster similar reposts from different users. It can be framed as a near-duplicate (similar regions exist in two reposts) image detection problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Grouping is challenging subject to two issues: (1) the reposts are transmitted to the server individually along the timeline, and thus dynamic clustering or matching should be conducted based on the new coming repost and existing records (in traditional clustering, the dataset is already there and thus it is not executed in a dynamic manner); (2) the high computational cost on duplicate repost matching (if the new repost and an existing repost in the server is duplicate), especially when the number of reposts is large. To achieve dynamic, resourceconserved flier grouping, we should limit the number of duplicate matches when a new repost comes (i.e., matching with a subset of existing reposts under certain constraints). The spatio-temporal-association (STA) based grouping algorithm is thus proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Spatial constraint</head><p>Spatial constraint is based on the fact that flier information is often related to local contexts (e.g., a school campus, a street block) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. We partition the city into 150m*150m region cells. When logging into the system, a user selects an interesting region, and only the reposts related to that region are displayed. It can significantly reduce the number of reposts to match with, considering that only the reposts within the same region of a new repost are matched for grouping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Temporal constraint</head><p>It is not needed to match a new repost with outdated reposts, but it is usually hard to recognize which of the existing reposts are outdated. Though some fliers state the validation time (e.g., the date of a workshop), most others do not. Nevertheless, it is known that information without attention for a period of time might be outdated or uninteresting. Therefore, in the current study, we introduce an aging factor called AgingThres (e.g., six hours or two days). The last update time of a flier group is defined as UpdateTime. A match process is triggered only when Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) meets.</p><p>-CurrentTime UpdateTime AgingThres </p><p>(1)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Match by association</head><p>We leverage the implicit association between fliers and boards to optimize the match order and the grouping performance. It is motivated by the fact that flier publishing behaviors often follow certain patterns. For example, due to the social preferences of boards, a certain type of flier is often posted in a similar set of boards within a social community. This implicitly reveals the logical connections among boards. We characterize the board-flier association at two levels:  Inner-board association. A match will first happen with the flier groups that have members from the current board.  co-reposting relationship among boards as that the same fliers have been reposted from these boards. Specially, we use CRC(b i ,b j ) to represent the co-reposting coefficient between boards b i and b j , which can be used to rank the boards for match-order optimization. We formulate it in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). The two associations determine the match order at the board-level. If there is more than one flier group from the same board, they will be ordered by their UpdateTime in matching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Near-duplicate repost matching</head><p>SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) is a popular method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images, widely used for near-duplicate image retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. A SIFT process finds candidate matching features based on the Euclidean distance of their feature vectors. We used the open source library VLFeat <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> to extract SIFT features. As the reposts in each flier group are duplicate, it is not necessary to match all of them when a new repost arrives. Instead, we select one with high-quality for matching. The selection method will be introduced in detail in the next subsection.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> and Algorithm 1 show the STA grouping process. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, when a new repost N arrives, STA will select the appropriate flier groups to match with. This is a filtering and ordering process based on spatio-temporal constraints and board associations, and f 1 to f 3 are selected accordingly. The selected flier groups are matched in order: f 1 has fliers coming from the same board (b 1 ) as N, so the match happens first with f 1 ; f 2 and f 3 come from the same associated board (b 2 ), but because the UpdateTime of f 2 is more recent, f 2 is placed ahead f 3 in matching. Finally, f 2 is matched with N.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Quality-based Repost Selection</head><p>Selection is important because reposts are in the format of images, which are often too blurry or dark to be useful. In FlierMeet, repost selection is important to two system modules:</p><p>(1) In the grouping module, we need to match a new repost with the selected one from an existing flier group; (2) In the user interface module, we should select an image of high visual quality to display upon user queries. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, the green node 2 is chosen from f 2 as the one to match with the new repost N. Since N has better quality than the green node 2, after matching, it is selected as the new represented one of this flier group.</p><p>Traditional image processing methods for image quality measurement are computationally intensive and ineffective in many cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Therefore, we design heuristics based on the "flier capture" context learned from the associated sensory readings to converge on the "best repost" selection. Three contexts are considered:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Light intensity</head><p>Proper ambient light usually results in clear images. Accordingly, the light value obtained from the light sensor in smartphones is preprocessed into three levels: {bright, normal, dark}. We give regular light reposts a high score, and rate darker ones a low score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Motion blur</head><p>To choose a stable image, the repost with less accelerometer variance (learned from the accelerometer sensor in smartphones) is assigned a higher score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) The shooting angle</head><p>Pictures shot in the frontal direction normally have better quality than yawed ones. People usually try to find the frontal shooting angle (or the best shooting angle) when taking pictures of fliers on a board, though sometimes there are exceptions. To get the best shooting direction of a certain board, we need to analyze the heading angle (i.e., the raw angle of smartphones <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the range is [-π, π]) of the reposts captured at that place. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>, the heading angles of most reposts from a board are close to the best shooting angle, and some are out of the central zone.</p><p>To determine the best-shooting direction for the fliers on a certain board, a crowdsourced approach is proposed. In the approach, we measure the central tendency of the collected  heading angles to the board, and use the central value as the best shooting angle. Specifically, the heading angle of a smartphone in reposting can be measured by a standard algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> using the values of built-in magnetometer and accelerometer sensors. There are several approaches to measure central tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and the mean value metric is used for best-angle calculation (the confidence interval is set to 95%). A smaller difference between a certain repost i's heading angle Ag(i) and the best shooting angle to the associated board BAg(Board(i)) can lead to a higher rank.</p><p>The overall scoring metric is given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">3</ref>), where the three factors are all considered.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) ( ( )) 1 () 2 () ( ) ( ) ( ) Ag i BAg Board i x y z LigL Score i Var i Var i Var i    <label>(3)</label></formula><p>In the current study, the three levels of LigL is numerated to {1.5, 1.0, 0.5}; Var x,y,z (i) refers to the acceleration variance in the x(y, z)-axis during the sampling period (around 0.2s) of repost i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CROWDSOURCED FLIER TAGGING</head><p>Assigning tags to fliers is important for selective viewing and intelligent recommendation. We have two types of tags and employ different approaches for automatic tagging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Category Tagging</head><p>Flier category tagging is implemented in two steps. First, we need to extract the text from flier images. In this study, we use a commercial-grade optical character recognition (OCR) tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> to recognize text. Since there will be fuzzy words and non-word characters in the extracted text, pre-processing is conducted using regular expressions and dictionary search. Then, we employ MALLET <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> (a toolkit for document classification and natural language processing) for category tagging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Feature Extraction for Semantic Tagging</head><p>The goal of semantic tagging is to identify a set of features that can label the right semantic tags to the reposted fliers. These semantic tags have close relationships with human behaviors. Thus, we look deeper into the characteristics of crowd-flier interactions and extract the following features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Flier group features</head><p>There are two features about a flier group. The flier group size refers to the number of reposts of the same flier, while the source board number refers to the number of source boards of a flier group. The latter feature is important because fliers with a high popularity or a wide acceptance are often posted on numerous boards.</p><p>2) The social structure We use link density <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> to characterize the density of social connections among the reposters of a flier group, which is the fraction that pairs of reposters in the flier group that connect. It is useful to measure the social property of a flier group. We formulate it as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">( ( )) ()</head><p>( 1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">g g gg NumOfConns U f LinkD f ff   <label>(4)</label></formula><p>Where: NumOfConns counts the number of existing connections among the reposters of flier group f g .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Diversity</head><p>The popularity or professional degree of a flier often shows its relationship with the features of its source boards and reposters. We propose the following features:  Board-flier entropy. There can be numerous boards in a city region. To enlarge flier influence, the flier publisher often carefully chooses the board(s) to be covered. As presented earlier, boards at different places often show a distinct domain focus and content diversity. We propose board-flier entropy to measure the diversity of fliers on a board, motivated by the use of entropy in the study of biodiversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. It is formulated by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>  </p><p> Human-flier entropy. People are more willing to repost fliers that they are interested in. However, the range of people's interests differs greatly. Some individuals are only interested in a particular type of flier (e.g., movie ads), while some people's interests are manifold. In order to measure the diversity of a person's interests, we introduce human-flier entropy. It can quantify the diversity of reposted fliers of a person. The calculation method is similar to board-flier entropy (by viewing a person as a board). As we can see in similarity-based flier grouping, a flier is often distributed among multiple boards and reposted by different people. At this time, the entropy of a single board or reposter is insufficient to characterize the diversity degree of a flier. We thus introduce a new feature: mean_entropy, which is the mean value of entropies of all the reposters or boards associated with a flier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Temporal feature</head><p>A 'hot' topic is usually 'popular' but its popularity reaches a peak within a short time period, similar to trending topics in Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Repost actions usually happen from 6:00 to 22:00, and we divide it into M time intervals. Let the number of reposts to flier k at the time interval T i of date d be N(k,T i ,d) and the average number of reposts at the same time interval during the past few days (e.g., one week) be AvgN(T i ). As formulated in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), we use HI to measure flier k's hot index during T i . It is a dynamic feature and we use the maximum HI in the reposting history of a flier as its current hot index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> </head><p>, , ( , , ) / ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">i i i HI k T d N k T d AvgN T  (7)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Visit distance &amp; preference distance</head><p>In order to recommend fliers that can make a person feel "surprised", we need to find a method to measure the distance between a flier and a person's appetite. A flier that is distinct from a person's appetite is definitely more surprising than a flier this person has commonly seen. The fact that people's daily lives are often organized and limited in regions inspires us to propose visit distance and preference distance. The visit distance is used to measure the distance between the location of a flier and a person's daily visiting area. A flier posted at a place one seldom pays a visit to has more potential to be a surprise. Preference distance is used to tell the distance between the type of flier and a person's flier preference. Usually, fliers of a brand new type are more surprising to a user than common ones. The visit distance and preference distance between person p and a flier group f g are calculated by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>). _ ( , ) 1 max{ ( , ), ( )} </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">g i i g v dis p f ratio p b b B f    (8) _ ( , ) 1 ( ,<label>(</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Semantic Tagging with Hybrid Classifiers</head><p>Having described a variety of features extracted from crowd-flier interactions, we next present how to achieve semantic tagging. Taking the properties of tags into consideration, we conduct semantic tagging from two different directions. First, tags like popular, hot, and professional are closely related to the content of a flier. In other words, we can label a flier with these tags according to the content of a flier. For example, a flier about a widely acknowledged event (e.g., a concert notice) is generally viewed as a 'popular' flier, and a flier about an academic report can be labeled as 'professional.' For these kinds of tags, we can employ supervised learning techniques. Second, some tags, such as social and surprise, are largely determined by human features (e.g., user interactions, social ties, and personality), which are not suitable for supervised learning. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid approach for semantic tagging. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>, for content-dependent tags, we use a multi-label classifier; for human-associated tags, heuristic rules are employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Multi-label classifier</head><p>Since there can be overlaps among different semantic tags, we propose a multi-label classifier for semantic tagging. Recently, the issue of learning from multi-label data has attracted significant attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In FlierMeet, we use Mulan <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, a java library for learning from multi-label data. It is built on top of the Weka library <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and currently offers a variety of multi-label classification, ranking and feature selection algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Heuristic rules</head><p>We use heuristic rules in human-associated semantic tagging. Specifically, we use the social structure of a group to determine whether a given flier should be labeled as 'social'. For example, when a flier has been reposted by a group of people, we check the density of social connections among them. If the density of the reposter group exceeds a pre-defined threshold T ss , the flier is tagged 'social'. The fliers whose visit and preference distances to a person are all above the predefined thresholds (T vd and T pd ) are labeled as 'surprise' to that person.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Pilot Implementation</head><p>FlierMeet is developed on Android and the main interfaces are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. There are four major functions listed in Fig. <ref type="figure">10 (a)</ref>. 'Flier capture' enables reposting by users. If the 'Flier timeline' button is pressed, a list of recently published fliers (e.g., the last six hours) will be displayed in a time order. 'Flier map' allows users to view the fliers on the map. Users can choose among different category or semantic tags and browse by 'tag' on the map (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10 (b)</ref>). If the user clicks a repost on the map, detailed information about that repost, including its reposters and user comments, will be listed (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10 (c)</ref>). The 'Meet up' function can suggest potential social links according to their repost behavior similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experiments</head><p>The success of a cross-space flier reposting and tagging system like FlierMeet is impacted by three main factors: (1) the effectiveness of the repost grouping algorithm, (2) the performance of the repost selection method, and (3) the usefulness of the proposed features in flier tagging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Repost grouping</head><p>The performance improvement by adding spatial and temporal constraints is obvious, and thus we focused on the effectiveness of inter-and inner-associations. A naï ve approach that did not consider board association was used for a comparative study, and we call it ST. In ST, the flier groups selected (under spatio-temporal constraints) for matching with the new repost are only ordered by their UpdateTime. Boardassociation-based ordering, however, is not considered in ST. 300 reposts were randomly chosen from the dataset depicted in Section 4.2 to form the test set, all of which had a corresponding flier group in the server. For each repost in the test set, the matching process completed when the algorithm found a match between the repost and its flier group. We counted the number of matches needed for each repost in the test set. The CDF results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>. It is clear that STA (presented in Section 4.3) can decrease the number of matches (i.e., the computational cost can be lowered) for grouping than ST by considering inner-and inner-associations in match ordering.</p><p>We also computed the accuracy of the grouping method. All 2,035 reposts were selected as the test dataset, and 943 flier groups were obtained using the STA method. We used the standard Precision and Recall metric to analyze the result. As shown in TABLE I, there were 45 reposts (i.e., FN=45) that should have been clustered in a group but were not; 12 reposts were wrongly clustered (i.e., FP=12). The overall performance is high (F-measure is above 98%). By analyzing the results, we found that there were several reasons that can cause errors:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>The repost was blurry or the main body was too small, which led to incorrect clustering (FP) or self-clustering (FN).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>We used two days as the AgingThres's (temporal constraint) value, but there were fliers that had reposts over two days, which resulted in redundant clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Quality-based repost selection</head><p>Repost selection is important to FlierMeet for both flier grouping and user browsing (see Section 4.4). To validate the performance of our approach on repost quality measurement, we made a comparison with human selection. There were 413 flier groups whose size was at least 2 in the dataset and they were used in the testing. Three volunteers were recruited to collaboratively choose the best repost for each flier group. There were two factors to measure each selection's quality: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> whether the text in the selected repost was easy to distinguish (i.e., clear), (2) whether there were clearer or better images (in terms of human selection results). Based on these factors, four grades were given to measure the performance of the repost selection method: Best, Good, Fair, and Poor. For example, when the selected repost to a flier group was 'clear' and has 'no better' one in the group, the data selection result for this flier group was valued "Best". As shown in TABLE II, more than 90% ("Best" or "Good") of the selected reposts are clear, and there are around 55% with the same result ("Best") as human selection, which implies that our context-based approach for data selection is effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Category tagging</head><p>We used the Naï ve Bayes algorithm provided by MALLET to do document classification. An effective classification algorithm relies on a rich training dataset. Compared to offline collected public information, more similar information can be easily obtained online (i.e., from websites and social media). We trained our classifier using 800 crawled webpages, including recruitment sites, e-commerce services, academic activity discussion forums, and government websites. The webpages were related to the four flier categories depicted in Section 3.1 (200 for each). We further selected 360 reposts (90 for each flier category) as the test set. The experimental results shown in Table <ref type="table">III</ref> indicate that our method for category tagging is effective, particularly true for academic fliers. However, for ads, as they often vary both in format and content, the tagging results are not that significant.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Multi-label classification results</head><p>The aim was to test the performance of the proposed crowd-flier interaction features for semantic tagging. We trained a multi-label classifier and tested its performance on tagging. There were a total of 921 flier groups collected. As our research is based on the study of crowd-flier interactions, the groups with only a single member cannot provide enough information. We thus selected 350 flier groups whose size was at least two, where 260 were used as the training set, and the remaining 90 as the test set. Three students were employed to annotate the data. Each of them could assign the three semantic tags (popular, hot, professional) to each flier group according to their understanding to its content and impact in the campus. If there were conflicts, they could have a discussion to reach an agreement.</p><p>Three multi-label classification algorithms in Mulan <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> were used, including RAkEL, HMC, and HOMER. Three measurement metrics were used: precision, recall, and F-measure. One thing to note is that in multi-label classification, since an object can be associated with multiple labels, the computing method to the three metrics was somewhat different from their use in single-label data. Details about this can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The classification results are shown in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>. It is clear that RAkEL achieved the best performance in all the measures. However, the classification result is still not high. One reason is that the dataset is still small. As the features are extracted from crowd-flier interaction, more participants and reposts can better characterize the proposed features. We thus intend to have the system deployed and gather more data in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Tagging with heuristic rules</head><p>As introduced before, we use heuristic rules to label fliers with tags of 'social' and 'surprise'. As described in the system model section, if the density of social connections of a flier group's reposters exceeds a pre-defined threshold T ss , this flier is tagged as 'social'. T ss was set to 0.3 in the current study. Based on the community detection results mentioned in Section 4.2, we can locate the community that contains the most people from the reposter group and recommend this flier to the other members (who did not repost this flier) of this community.</p><p>Similarly, by analyzing the reposting history of a user, we can also compute and recommend 'surprising' fliers to her. In the experiments, the two distance thresholds T vd , T pd were all set to 0.9.</p><p>A user study was conducted to compare users' rating to the recommended social/surprising fliers by our method and two baseline methods. For a user p, all these methods recommended her k fliers that were not reposted by p. Specifically, FlierMeet chose the top-k computed 'social' or 'surprise' fliers to p, ordered by their group size (i.e., the number of reposts). The two baselines used were named popular and random. The prior one defined popular fliers as the ones with large group size, and directly recommended Top-k popular fliers to p. The latter one, however, randomly selected and recommended k flier to p. We combined all the recommendations by the three methods to a unique set. One thing to note is that there could be overlaps among the fliers from each method, and we left only one copy to each flier in the combined set. In this study, k was set to 8.</p><p>29 data contributors (who volunteered the data collection process presented in Section 4.2) participated this study. The 29 participants were asked to rank their interest degree to the recommended fliers individually using a scale of 1 to 5. The average scoring result for each method is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, where we obtain the following findings:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>The average scoring of 'social' fliers is normally higher than other recommendations. It indicates that people in the same community do share some common interests and mutual concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>For some participants (e.g., 2, 12, and 26), the average score of the recommended surprising fliers was much higher than other methods. For other participants (e.g., 7, 10, and 22), the average rating was comparatively low. This makes sense when considering the features of surprise recommendation. Unlike suggesting similar items by collaborative filtering techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, surprise recommendation can be considered as a kind of lottery. When recommending a surprising flier to a user, it is possible that she feels this flier is unique/novel and gives it a high score, but it is also possible that she has no interest in this kind of fliers and gives a low ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6) User study</head><p>We also made a user study to test the usability of our system. To obtain manifold views and comments about our system, both data contributors (a total of 10) and new users <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> were invited to participate this study. They were asked to evaluate FlierMeet on its attractiveness (overall impression), prospect  (the perspective and acceptability), and simplicity (is it easy to use) on the scale of 1 to 5. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>, the average scores to the three system properties were 3.8, 3.6, and 3.9, respectively. Overall, the results indicate that most people were excited about FlierMeet and felt that it was easy to use. Only slight differences can be found to the evaluation results from data contributors and new users, where the data contributors felt the simplicity of the system could be improved.</p><p>We also asked for their comments about the improvement of the system and presented the representative ones below.  As a cross-space application, it is important to link online reposts with offline activity participation, such as allowing people to express their willingness to attend the activity and allowing people to crowdsource the important and interesting moments of running activities associated with the repost. By having crowdsourced activity information, a comprehensive characterization of the activity can be obtained and shared.  It is useful to develop a 'view by activity place' function, because many people are interested about the activity place, while not the flier posting place. This can be achieved by analyzing the text extracted using named-entity recognition techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. DISCUSSIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Limitations and Future Work 1) Flier capture</head><p>In this study, we used GPS to locate boards and reposts. This limits our research to mainly outdoor environments. Indoor flier reposting is left for future work, where WiFi positioning techniques can be explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) User privacy</head><p>Privacy is a major concern of crowd sensing systems, since user locations, references, and even activity patterns can be revealed. This issue is alleviated in FlierMeet since data is captured in a participatory manner and users can control their data in sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Incentives</head><p>To make FlierMeet a success, we should have numerous participants that are willing to contribute data. Since it costs computational and communication resources for data capture and publicizing, how to motivate users to participate is challenging. Interest and reputation can be motivators, but further mechanisms are needed. There are three stakeholders in the system: flier publishers, reposters, and the service provider. Many flier publishers (e.g., store owners, companies) want to disseminate their information to a wide range of people, and they are willing to pay payment to well-performed reposters. A pioneering study on opportunistic coupon dissemination has been discussed by Garyfalos et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Various incentive mechanisms for MCS systems are also investigated recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. Founded on these existing works, we intend to build an incentive model that can address the specific features of FlierMeet in the future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Out of date</head><p>The temporal scope of fliers vary, with some of them are only relevant for a short period while others offer content that has ongoing relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Because of the presence of out-of-date materials, it is sometimes hard to tell what is still relevant and useful. There are two potential methods to be explored in the future. (i) One is to analyze the trending of a flier group by analyzing the temporal feature of its reposts. This method mainly relies on human intelligence, considering that people may not repost outdated materials. (ii) The other method is based on text mining, by extracting the validation time information from the flier when available. However, the performance largely depends on the OCR text extraction results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Perspectives beyond FlierMeet 1) A generic methodology for knowledge discovery</head><p>FlierMeet predicts semantic tags based on the features extracted from crowd-flier interaction. It can be expanded to a generic knowledge discovery methodology that takes advantage of crowd-object interaction patterns. As human participation is a characteristic of MCS, interaction among people and objects is a unique data source for crowd intelligence extraction. It can also be found in several recent studies. For instance, features extracted from human-place interaction were used for place categorization in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The generic methodology can be used for numerous data collection campaigns in MCS, working for a wide range of urban events and user experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) The fusion of human and machine intelligence</head><p>The success of FlierMeet relies on the aggregation of the complementary features of machine and human intelligence. Machine intelligence is good at large-scale data processing. The hybrid classifiers for intelligent tagging is a typical example. Human intelligence is also explored in our work from at least three aspects: (i) the identification of bulletin boards and the calculation of the best shooting angle to a board; (ii) the deployment of fliers by their publishers in the real world (revealing popularity or professional degree of fliers); (iii) the repost behaviors based on human selection, where important (e.g., hot, popular or community-oriented fliers) and nonoutdated ones are usually captured. As presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the fusion of human and machine intelligence is a promising research area of MCS. Based on the practice of our system, we will keep exploring their deep fusion models and approaches to improve our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Potential Applications</head><p>Besides the public information sharing service developed, FlierMeet can nurture numerous novel applications, some of which are listed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Community memory</head><p>The usage of FlierMeet provides a community repository or memory of postings that may be browsed when their public shows are expired. For instance, we can send a reminiscence message to local residents about the popular events in the past year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Peer-enhanced marketing</head><p>For commercial-related fliers, we can build an economic model that motivates reposting activities and facilitates ad dissemination. User preferences can be learned from their reposting behaviors, enabling target advertising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Cross-space lifelong activity management</head><p>Activities in our daily life often follow a generic lifecycle that contains several stages: activity initiation, activity running, and activity completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. The current system focuses on the activity initiation process, which addresses the challenges on activity information advertising. Following the suggestions obtained during the user study, we can also leverage MCS to record the running activity information and share crowdsourced activity summaries after activity completion. Therefore, a doubled offline-online interaction (activity flier reposting, running activity recording and sharing) application will be developed, which allows lifelong crowdsourced activity management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>FlierMeet is a mobile crowdsourcing platform for cross-space public information reposting, intelligent tagging, and pervasive sharing. Due to duplicate reposts crowdsourced from distributed users, we have proposed a STA-based algorithm for flier grouping, and a context-sensitive quality measurement approach for flier selection. Moreover, to facilitate flier sharing, we extract a set of novel features from crowd-flier interaction and propose a hybrid learning model to predict the category and semantic tags of fliers. Experiments indicate that our approaches can effectively group duplicate fliers and the features extracted for repost tagging are useful. A further user study indicates that people are interest about our system and are willing to use it in their daily life. Several suggestions to improve our system are also obtained from the study. As for future research, we intend to enhance the incentive mechanism, gather more repost data, and promote advanced cross-space links (e.g., linking offline activity participation with online flier reposts) in FlierMeet.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
