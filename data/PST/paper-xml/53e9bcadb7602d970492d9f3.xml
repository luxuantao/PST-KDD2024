<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This note deals with consensus strategy design for double-integrator dynamics. Specifically, we consider the case where the control inputs are required to be a priori bounded and the velocity (second state) is not available for feedback.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Consensus algorithms have received great interest in the control community, leading to several results that have been applied to a variety of problems related to the cooperative control of multi-vehicle systems such as flocking, rendezvous and formation control (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and references therein). A team of agents is said to achieve consensus if all members of the team reach an agreement on a common final value using local information exchange. Consensus algorithms for single-integrator kinematics have been widely studied in the literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to name a few, and several interesting results have been obtained using properties from graph theory. These results have been extended to doubleintegrator dynamics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> where it was shown that consensus algorithms for double-integrator dynamics are more challenging than first order kinematics. Several variants of the proposed algorithms have been applied to flocking <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, rigid body attitude synchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and formation control <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>While most consensus algorithms for double-integrator dynamics rely on the availability of the full state for feedback, only a ✩ This paper was not presented at any IFAC meeting. few works have been done when velocity information is not available. In fact, this problem is faced when vehicles are not equipped with velocity sensors, to save cost, space and weight, or velocity is not precisely measured. Another important problem that often arises in practical applications, is to design algorithms that account for actuator saturations. The problem becomes quite serious when the number of vehicles in the team is large and the information flow is high, i.e., each vehicle has a large number of neighbors. This leads to a high control effort for each vehicle that causes actuator saturations. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, formation control strategies for multirobot formation maneuvers are discussed. The authors present two control schemes that respectively account for actuator saturation and consider the lack of relative velocity measurements. In this work, the communication flow between vehicles is restricted to a bidirectional ring. The author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> extends the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to a more general undirected communication topology, and presents some consensus algorithms for double-integrator dynamics without relative velocity measurements. However, in both works, the velocity-free consensus algorithms do not take into consideration actuator saturations.</p><p>The main contribution of this note is to propose consensus algorithms for double-integrator dynamics without velocity measurements and in the presence of input saturation constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first dealing with these two issues simultaneously. We discuss two conceptually different design methodologies that achieve consensus, with and without reference velocity, under a fixed and bidirectional communication topology. The first approach discussed in this note extends the velocity-free consensus algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to account for actuator saturations. This approach is based on the introduction of an auxiliary system for each agent, acting as a reduced order observer. The input of this auxiliary system is determined using the relative positions of the vehicles and its output is used in the control law to generate the necessary damping in the absence of velocity signals. As a result, consensus is achieved with an a priori bounded control law using only position relative errors. Consequently, the communication requirements between the team members is considerably reduced as compared to the full information case.</p><p>As will be clear throughout the paper, the first approach suffers from some limitations. First, the upper bound of the control law depends on the number of neighbors of each member of the team. This is generally not desirable especially when each vehicle has a large number of neighbors, since a trade-off between maintaining the control upper bound and good performance can hardly be achieved. Second, as most auxiliary systems-based methods, this approach suffers from the lack of sufficient damping, and the system response generally presents transient oscillations before reaching consensus. To solve these problems, we propose a second consensus algorithm based on a high order auxiliary system. The proposed scheme guarantees that the control input of each vehicle can be a priori bounded regardless of the number of its neighbors. Furthermore, additional damping is added such that transient oscillations can be reduced and/or eliminated. In this approach, the control objective is achieved by forcing the vehicles' relative positions to track the relative errors of the auxiliary variables. Thereafter, the auxiliary variables are forced to converge to zero asymptotically, guiding the relative positions between all vehicles in the team to zero.</p></div>

To design consensus algorithms, vehicles must communicate some of their states with each other. In this work, we assume that the information flow between members of the team is fixed and undirected. Then, it is natural to describe the information flow between vehicles using weighted graphs. A weighted undirected graph, G, consists of the triplet (N , E , K), with N being the set of nodes or vertices, describing the set of vehicles in the team, E ⊆ N × N the set of unordered pairs of nodes, called edges, and K = [k ij ] ∈ R n×n is a weighted adjacency matrix. An edge (i, j) indicates that vehicles i and j are neighbors and can obtain information from one another. The weighted adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph is defined such that k ij = k ji &gt; 0 for (i, j) ∈ E , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">k ij = 0 if (i, j) ̸ ∈ E .</formula><p>If there is a path between any two distinct nodes of a weighted undirected graph G, then G is said to be connected.</p><p>For more details on graph properties, the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The objective of our work is to design control algorithms for a group of vehicles such that consensus is reached on their final states and all vehicles track a desired velocity, i.e., r i (t) → r j (t) and v i (t) → v d (t) for all i, j ∈ N , with v d (t) being a reference velocity. Also, we aim to extend our results to solve the consensus problem without reference velocity, where it is required that r i (t) → r j (t) and v i (t) → v j (t) for all i, j ∈ N . In this work, we assume that the absolute and relative velocities are not measurable, and all vehicles are subject to input saturation constraints such that ‖u i ‖ ∞ ≤ u max for i ∈ N .</p></div>

Hence, point (ii) follows from the assumption that the undirected communication graph is connected.</p><p>Using the above boundedness results, we can see from (4) that ψi is bounded, for i ∈ I. Since φi is bounded, for i ∈ N , we conclude that V1 is bounded, and invoking Barbălat Lemma we can conclude that lim t→∞ φ i (t) = 0 for i ∈ N and lim t→∞ (r i (t) -ψ i (t)) = 0 for i ∈ I. In addition, since φi , v i , for i ∈ N and ψi , for i ∈ I, are bounded, we know that φi is bounded, and since we have already shown that lim t→∞ φ i (t) = 0, we know by Barbălat Lemma that lim t→∞ φi (t) = 0, for i ∈ N . Therefore, we conclude from (3) that</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">lim t→∞ n - j=1 k ij tanh  λ r (r i -r j )  = 0, for i ∈ N .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Multiplying the above set of equations by r i and taking the sum over i, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> will be equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">lim t→∞ n - i=1 n - j=1 k ij r T i tanh  λ r (r i -r j )  = 1 2 lim t→∞ n - i=1 n - j=1 k ij (r i -r j ) T tanh  λ r (r i -r j )  = 0, (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where we have used the fact that the information flow between vehicles is undirected, i.e, k ij = k ji . As a result, we can conclude that lim t→∞ (r i (t) -r j (t)) = 0 for all (i, j) ∈ E . Since the undirected communication graph is assumed connected, this result is valid for all i, j ∈ N . Furthermore, we can see from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) that vi is bounded for i ∈ N , and hence we can conclude by Barbălat Lemma that lim t→∞ (v i (t) -v j (t)) = 0 for all i, j ∈ N . Exploiting the above results, we can see that ψi = vd + k <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) is bounded for i ∈ N . Therefore, we know that (r i -ψi ) is bounded for i ∈ I. Then, from Barbălat Lemma, and since lim t→∞ (r i (t) -ψ i (t)) = 0 for i ∈ I, we conclude that lim t→∞ (v i (t) -ψi (t)) = 0 for i ∈ I. Consequently, we know from (4) that lim t→∞ (v i (t) -v d (t)) = 0 for i ∈ I. Finally, since the set I ̸ = ∅, i.e., contains at least one element, and lim t→∞ (v i (t) -v j (t)) = 0, for all i, j ∈ N , we can conclude that lim t→∞ (v i (t) -v d (t)) = 0 for all i ∈ N , and this ends the proof.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ψ i (v i - ψi ) is bounded for i ∈ I and u i in (</formula><p>It is worth noting that the auxiliary system, with output φ i , is used in the above control scheme to drive the relative positions and the relative velocities to zero without velocity measurements. The second auxiliary system, with output ψ i , is used to drive the velocity of at least one vehicle in the team to the desired velocity. As a result, all vehicles reach consensus on their final states and track the desired final velocity. Note that the second auxiliary system is implemented for only some vehicles in the team, as defined by the set I. Therefore, the variable ψ i is not defined for i ̸ ∈ I, which does not change our results since k v i = 0 in this case.</p><p>Also, note that the desired velocity needs to be available to only some vehicles in the team.

First, note that the control input (13) is bounded as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">‖u i ‖ ∞ ≤ 2 ∑ n j=1 k ij + k φ i ,</formula><p>which, under the constraint on the control gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, yields (i). Using the following Lyapunov function candidate</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">V 2 = 1 2 n - i=1 (v i -φ i ) T (v i -φ i ) + 1 2 n - i=1 n - j=1 k ij λ r 1 T m × log  cosh  λ r (r i -r j )  + 1 2 n - i=1 φ T i φ i ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>and following similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1, with the help of Barbălat Lemma, the rest of the corollary can be proven.</p><p>Remark 1. Note that the control scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> guarantees that all vehicles achieve consensus with constant final velocity since v i is globally bounded and lim t→∞ u i (t) = 0 for i ∈ N .</p><p>Remark 2. Notice from the above consensus algorithms that only a single auxiliary system, with output φ i , is implemented for each vehicle in the team to achieve the result of Corollary 1. Whereas, to guarantee the results of Theorem 1, we need to implement an additional auxiliary system, with output ψ i , for at least one vehicle in the team. In both cases, only the position vector r i is transmitted between vehicles in the team.</p><p>It is important to mention that the control scheme in Theorem 1 can be modified to guarantee the same results using only a single auxiliary system for each vehicle. This can be seen from the control law</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">u i = vd (t) -k v i tanh  λ ψ (r i -ψ i )  - n - j=1 k ij tanh  λ r (r i -r j )  , for i ∈ N ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where ψ i is given in (4), with I = N , and the control gains are defined as in Theorem 1. In fact, following similar steps as in the proof of Theorem 1, we can easily show that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">16</ref>) achieves consensus with reference velocity. However, the auxiliary system with output φ i is necessary to achieve consensus without reference velocity, using only the relative positions of the vehicles in the team.</p><p>Remark 3. The proposed control schemes in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>), with v d = 0, and (13) extend respectively the results in Corollary 4.2 and Theorem 4.1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to account for actuator saturations. The main difference between the two works is the adopted design method, namely the choice of the Lyapunov function. In fact, the Lyapunov function used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> does not facilitate the design of an a priori bounded control law for our system. Furthermore, and as was shown in the result of Theorem 1, the proposed control scheme can handle time-varying trajectories, which is not obvious using the design method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 4. Although the presented control schemes in this section achieve our control objectives, they suffer from two limitations that are shared with the design of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. First, we can see from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">13</ref>) that the upper bounds of the proposed control schemes depend on the number of neighbors of each vehicle. This constitutes a constraint in tuning the above controllers. In fact, it is generally hard to obtain a trade-off between guaranteeing the controller upper bounds with achieving an acceptable/good transient performance. This problem becomes more important when the number of neighbors of each vehicle is large and u max is small. Second, since the outputs of the auxiliary systems are used in the control law instead of the missing velocity vectors, the proposed control schemes in this section suffer from the oscillatory transient response of the states (lack of sufficient damping). The above mentioned limitations will be obviated in a new consensus design that will be the subject of the next section.</p></div>

Since the information flow between vehicles is assumed connected, we know that (ξ i -ξ j ) is bounded, for (i, j) ∈ N . To completely prove point (ii), we still need to show that the vectors θ i and θi are bounded, for i ∈ N . Using the above results, we know from (23) that φi is bounded, for i ∈ N , and from (24) that ψi is bounded, for i ∈ I. As a result, V3 is bounded and we conclude from Barbălat Lemma that lim t→∞ φ i (t) = 0, for i ∈ N , and lim t→∞ (ξ i (t) -ψ i (t)) = 0, for i ∈ I. Using similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1, we can conclude that lim t→∞ φi (t) = 0, for i ∈ N , lim t→∞ (z i (t)ψi (t)) = 0, for i ∈ I. Therefore, we conclude from (23) that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">lim t→∞ ∑ n j=1 k ij (ξ i (t) -ξ j (t))  = 0, for i ∈ N .</formula><p>Following similar steps as in the proof of Theorem 1, we can conclude that lim t→∞ (ξ i (t) -ξ j (t)) = 0 and lim t→∞ (z i (t) -v d (t)) = 0, for all i, j ∈ N , since the communication graph is connected and I ̸ = ∅.</p><p>As a result, we have lim t→∞ (r</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">i (t) -r j (t)) = lim t→∞ (θ i (t) -θ j (t)) and lim t→∞ (v i (t) -v d (t)) = lim t→∞ θi (t), for all i, j ∈ N .</formula><p>Exploiting the above results, the dynamics of the variable θ i can be written as in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">22</ref>), with</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">η i = (-φi + k v i (ξ i -ψ i ) + ∑ n j=1 k ij (ξ i - ξ j ))</formula><p>, which is globally bounded and converges asymptotically to zero. Then from the results of Lemma 1, we can conclude that θ i and θi are globally bounded and lim t→∞ θ i (t) = lim t→∞ θi (t) = 0, for i ∈ N . Finally, we conclude that lim t→∞ (r i (t) -r j (t)) = lim t→∞ (v i (t) -v d (t)) = 0 for all i, j ∈ N . This ends the proof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 5.</head><p>It is important to mention that the idea behind the introduction of the new variables θ i in the above control scheme is to modify the trajectories of the states during the transient. In fact, instead of attempting to drive the relative positions and velocity tracking errors directly to zero, we first force (r i -r j ) and (v i -v d ) to converge respectively to (θ i -θ j ) and θi without velocity measurements. This is accomplished using the output of the first order auxiliary systems (23) and (24). Once this is achieved, the variables θ i and θi are guaranteed to converge to zero asymptotically, for all i ∈ N , guiding the relative positions and velocity tracking errors towards zero.</p><p>When it is desirable that the vehicles achieve consensus in their final states without reference velocity, i.e., r i (t) → r j (t) and v i (t) → v j (t) asymptotically, for all i, j ∈ N , we propose the consensus algorithm stated in the following corollary.</p><p>Corollary 2.

The result (i) is obvious from the control law (28) with (19) and condition (29). To prove points (ii) and (iii), we consider the following Lyapunov function candidate</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">V 4 = 1 2 n - i=1 (z i -φ i ) T (z i -φ i ) + 1 4 n - i=1 n - j=1 k ij (ξ i -ξ j ) T (ξ i -ξ j ) + 1 2 n - i=1 φ T i φ i .<label>(30)</label></formula><p>Following similar steps as in the proof of Theorem 2, the time derivative of V 4 evaluated along the system dynamics (1), with (28), is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">V4 = - n - i=1 k φ i φ T i φ i ,<label>(31)</label></formula><p>and we can conclude that z i , φ i and (ξ i -ξ j ), for all i, j ∈ N , are bounded. Using similar arguments as in the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2, we conclude that lim t→∞ φ i (t) = 0, lim t→∞ φi (t) = 0, for i ∈ N , lim t→∞ (ξ i (t) -ξ j (t)) = 0, and lim t→∞ (z i (t) -z j (t)) = 0, for all i, j ∈ N . Then, using the results of Lemma 1, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">η i =  -φi + ∑ n j=1 k ij (ξ i -ξ j )</formula><p> , we conclude that θ i and θi are bounded and lim t→∞ (r i (t) -r j (t)) = lim t→∞ (v i (t) -v j (t)) = 0, for all i, j ∈ N . Remark 6. To implement the above control schemes, it is required that vehicles transmit their variables ξ i . Hence, the proposed consensus algorithm does not increase the communication requirements as compared to (2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 7.</head><p>The main advantage from the introduction of the auxiliary system with output θ i in this section is to enable the design of a bounded control input for each vehicle, which does not depend explicitly on the vehicles' relative positions (as can be seen from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_43">28</ref>) with ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">19</ref>)). Consequently, the upper bound of the control input of each vehicle can be determined a priori independently from the number of its neighbors in the group. This facilitates considerably the tuning of the controller gains to achieve good transient performance regardless of the communication topology between vehicles. In the case of the control scheme (28) for example, the gains k φ i and k ij can be freely selected such that the</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">term η i =  -φi + ∑ n j=1 k ij (ξ i -ξ j )</formula><p> converges to zero as fast as possible. Thereafter, the choice of the gains k θ 1i and k θ 2i will determine the way r i converges to the final position for each vehicle. It is worth noting that when η i → 0 and θ i has not yet converged to zero but becomes sufficiently small, we have vi → θi ≈ -k θ 1i θ i -k θ 2i θi . This leads us to expect that at this moment of the transient response, sufficient damping is imposed on θ i by an appropriate choice of k θ 2i . As a result, and since (r i -r j ) has converged to (θ i -θ j ), sufficient damping is implicitly applied to the system. Remark 8. The design methodology presented in this section can be applied to extend the consensus algorithms proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, in the full information case, to achieve a priori boundedness of the control input with upper bounds independent of the number of neighbors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Simulation results</head><p>In this section, we provide simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two control schemes proposed in this work.</p><p>We consider a group of 10 vehicles modeled as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, with m = 1, and with initial conditions: R(0) = (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5) T and V (0) = (0.1, 0.02, -0.08, 0.05, 0.07, -0.1, -0.05, 0.06, 0.04, 0.08) T , where R(t) and V (t) are the vectors containing respectively the positions and velocities of the vehicles, r i (t) and v i (t) for i ∈ {1, . . . , 10}. We consider the communication topology between vehicles as described by the undirected and connected graph G shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>To consider the results of Theorems 1 and 2, we assume that the desired velocity is given by v d (t) = 0.5 sin(2t/π ), and all vehicles are constrained such that u max = 2.8. We first consider the control law ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) with, λ φ = λ ψ = k</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">ψ i = 1, λ r = 10, k φ i = 0.</formula><p>5, for i ∈ {1, . . . , 10}, k ij = 0.15, for (i, j) ∈ E and k v i = 0.2 for i ∈ I = {1, 7}, i.e., the auxiliary system ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) is implemented for only vehicles 1 and 7. Note that this choice of gains with the upper bound of vd (t) satisfy condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The results are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We can see that all vehicles reach consensus on their final positions with the final desired velocity after 35 s.</p><p>Then, we consider control law ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_32">23</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">24</ref>), with  <ref type="figure">3</ref>, where we can see that faster consensus with final desired velocity is achieved using this consensus algorithm. From these figures, we notice the oscillations present in the system response and the control input of each vehicle. This is mainly due to the ''insufficient'' damping introduced to the system by the auxiliary variables used to substitute the missing velocity information. However, we can see that in the second approach, Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, oscillations in the system response and in the control input of each vehicle decay rapidly after few seconds, whereas in the first approach, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, oscillations are present for a longer time. It   is interesting to investigate the response of the system when the second approach is implemented. From the control input in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we can see the high control activity for each vehicle in the first period of time, (0, 1) s, where the maximum input, as determined in (20), is almost reached. This indicates that the variables θ i , θi and η</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">k θ 1i = 0.7, k θ 2i = 1.1, k φ i = 10, k ψ i = 1, for i ∈ {1, . . . , 10}, k ij = 100, for (i, j) ∈ E ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_53">i =  -φi + k v i (ξ i -ψ i ) + ∑ n j=1 k ij (ξ i -ξ j )</formula><p></p><p>have not yet reached small values. Note that this is due to the high values of the gains k φ i , k ij and k v i , which are selected independently from the system constraints and aim to drive the term η i to zero as fast as possible. After the instant 1 s, we see from the same figure that the value of the control input for each vehicle starts decreasing. This indicates that the variables θ i and θi are decreasing, and the term η i is approaching zero. At this point, the dynamics of (r i -r j ) are approaching the dynamics of (θ i -θ j ), for (i, j) ∈ E , and with the above choice of k θ 1i and k θ 2i , we are adding damping to the response of θ i , and consequently damping is introduced to the response of r i , for i ∈ {1, . . . , 10}. As a result, the transient oscillations in the system response are considerably reduced after few seconds. Next, we consider the results of Corollary 1. We assume that no reference velocity is assigned to the team and all vehicles are constrained such that u max = 6. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates the obtained results when control law (13) is implemented with λ φ = 3, λ r = 50, k φ i = 1, for i ∈ {1, . . . , 10}, and k ij = 0.5, for (i, j) ∈ E . Note that this choice of the control gains satisfies condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, and it achieves the fastest consensus that we have obtained with <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p><p>We can see that consensus is achieved after 12 s with the presence of some oscillations in the vehicles' positions and velocities. To investigate the effects of the control upper bound on the system response, we consider the same control law, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, with u max = 2, λ φ = 3, λ r = 100, k φ i = 0.4, for i ∈ {1, . . . , 10}, and k ij = 0.16, for (i, j) ∈ E . The obtained results are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, where we can see that consensus is achieved after more than 25 s. It is important to mention that with the same information flow between vehicles, and smaller values of u max , tuning the controller gains to achieve good results becomes more difficult.</p><p>Finally, we consider the results of Corollary 2 with u max = 6.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, we show the obtained results when the control scheme in (28) is implemented with k φ i = 10, k θ 1i = 1.5 and k θ 2i = 3, for i ∈ {1, . . . , 10}, and k ij = 100, for (i, j) ∈ E . Note that this choice of gains satisfy condition (29). Due to the controller gains tuning flexibility introduced by this method, and as discussed above, we can see that the transient oscillations are reduced and faster consensus is achieved as compared to the results in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. In the case where u max = 2, we consider the same control law, (28) with k θ 1i = 0.65 and k θ 2i = 1.35, for i ∈ {1, . . . , 10}, with the same previous gains, and the obtained results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. We can notice that similar performance is achieved, as compared to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, even with lower upper bounds of the control efforts for each vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We considered the consensus problem for double-integrator dynamics without velocity measurements and with input constraints, under fixed and undirected information flow. First, based on the auxiliary systems approach, we proposed a velocity-free consensus scheme which extends the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to account for actuator saturations. Although consensus is attained, the proposed scheme presents some limitations in the sense that the upper bound of the control input for each vehicle depends on the number of its neighbors. To overcome this problem, we proposed a second velocity-free consensus algorithm with a priori bounded control inputs, where the upper bounds are not affected by the number of neighbors of each vehicle. The main idea in this approach is the introduction of an additional second order auxiliary system in terms of θ i for each vehicle. As a result, additional damping is generated through the dynamics of the new variables leading </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
