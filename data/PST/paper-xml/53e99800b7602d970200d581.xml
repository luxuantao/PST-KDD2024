<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Various enumerations of labeled trees and forests, including Cayley's formula n n&amp;2 for the number of trees labeled by [n], and Cayley's multinomial expansion over trees, are derived from the following coalescent construction of a sequence of random forests (R n , R n&amp;1 , ..., R 1 ) such that R k has uniform distribution over the set of all forests of k rooted trees labeled by [n]. Let R n be the trivial forest with n root vertices and no edges. For n k 2, given that R n , ..., R k have been defined so that R k is a rooted forest of k trees, define R k&amp;1 by addition to R k of a single edge picked uniformly at random from the set of n(k&amp;1) edges which when added to R k yield a rooted forest of k&amp;1 trees. This coalescent construction is related to a model for a physical process of clustering or coagulation, the additive coalescent in which a system of masses is subject to binary coalescent collisions, with each pair of masses of magnitudes x and y running a risk at rate x+ y of a coalescent collision resulting in a mass of magnitude x+ y. The transition semigroup of the additive coalescent is shown to involve probability distributions associated with a multinomial expansion over rooted forests.</p></div>

Cayley's <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> formula *T n =n n&amp;2 is a well known consequence of the bijection between T n and [n] n&amp;2 set up by Pru fer's <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> coding of trees.

One purpose of this paper is to show how various enumerations of labeled trees and forests, including Cayley's formula, follow easily from a very different construction of random forests by a coalescent process. A second purpose is to relate this construction to various models of coalescent processes which have found applications in statistical physics and polymer chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, computer science <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, genetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, combinatorics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, and astronomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. A third purpose is to lay combinatorial foundations for the study undertaken in companion papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> of asymptotic properties of the additive coalescent process, in which a system of masses is subject to binary coalescent collisions, with each pair of masses of magnitudes x and y running a risk at rate x+ y of a coalescent collision resulting in a mass of magnitude x+ y. These asymptotics, which allow the definition of the additive coalescent process to be extended to an infinite number of masses, are related to the lengths of excursion intervals of a Brownian motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and Aldous's concept of a continuum random tree associated with a Brownian excursion <ref type="bibr">[4 6</ref>].</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 derives some basic enumerations for labeled trees and forests by a combinatorial version of the coalescent construction. Section 3 interprets these enumerations probabilistically by construction of a uniformly distributed random tree as the last term of a coalescent sequence of random forests. Section 4 relates this construction to various known results concerning random partitions derived from coalescent processes and models for random forests. Section 4.4 indicates some applications to random graphs. Section 5 shows how Cayley's multinomial expansion over trees can be deduced from the basic coalescent construction, and offers some variations and probabilistic interpretations of this multinomial expansion. Section 6 shows how an additive coalescent process with arbitrary initial condition can be derived from a coalescent construction of random forests, and deduces a formula for the transition semigroup of the additive coalescent which is related to a multinomial expansion over rooted forests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BASIC ENUMERATIONS</head><p>Except when specified otherwise, a tree t is assumed to be unrooted, and labeled by some finite set S. Then call t a tree over S. Write *S for the number of elements of S. Call a two element subset [a, b] of S, which may be denoted instead a W b, an edge or a bond. A tree t over S is identified by its set of *S&amp;1 edges. A forest over [n] is a graph with vertex set <ref type="bibr">[n]</ref> whose connected components form a collection of trees labeled by the sets of some partition of <ref type="bibr">[n]</ref>. Note that each forest over <ref type="bibr">[n]</ref> with k tree components has n&amp;k edges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Rooted forests</head><p>A rooted forest over [n] is a forest labeled by <ref type="bibr">[n]</ref> together with a choice of a root vertex for each tree in the forest. Let R k, n be the set of all rooted forests of k trees over <ref type="bibr">[n]</ref>. A rooted forest is identified by its digraph, that is its set of directed edges, sometimes denoted a Ä b instead of (a, b), with edges directed away from the roots. Say one rooted forest r contains another rooted forest s if the digraph of r contains the digraph of s. Call a sequence of rooted forests (r i ) refining if r i contains r j for i&lt; j. The following lemma is the simpler equivalent for rooted forests of an enumeration of unrooted forests due to Moon <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, which appears later as Lemma 3.</p><p>Lemma 1. For each forest r k of k rooted trees over [n], the number of rooted trees over [n] that contain r k is n k&amp;1 .</p><p>Proof. For r k # R k, n let N(r k ) denote the number of rooted trees over [n] that contain r k , and let N*(r k ) denote the number of refining sequences (r 1 , r 2 , ..., r k ) with r j # R jn for 1 j k. Any tree r 1 which contains r k has (n&amp;1)&amp;(n&amp;k)=k&amp;1 bonds more than r k . So to choose a refining sequence (r 1 , r 2 , ..., r k ) starting from any particular r 1 that contains r k , there are k&amp;1 bonds of r 1 that could be deleted to choose r 2 , then k&amp;2 bonds of r 2 that could be deleted to choose r 3 , and so on. Therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N*(r k )=N(r k )(k&amp;1)!<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Now consider choosing such a refining sequence (r 1 , r 2 , ..., r k ) in reverse order. Given the choice of (r k , r k&amp;1 , ..., r j ) for some k j 2 the number of possible choices of r j&amp;1 is the number of ways to choose the directed edge a Ä b that is in r j&amp;1 but not r j . But a can be any vertex in [n], and then b any one of the j&amp;1 roots of the j&amp;1 trees in r j that do not contain a.</p><p>(If b is not one of those roots then the resulting digraph is not a rooted forest.) So the number of possible choices of r j&amp;1 given (r k , ..., r j ) is always n( j&amp;1). This yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N*(r k )=n k&amp;1 (k&amp;1)!<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Now ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and (2) imply N(r k )=n k&amp;1 . K</p><p>For k=n Lemma 1 shows that the number of rooted trees over [n] is *R 1n =n n&amp;1 , which is equivalent to Cayley's formula *T n =n n&amp;2 . Formula (2) for k=n gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">*[refining (r 1 , r 2 , ..., r n ): r j # R jn for 1 j n]=n n&amp;1 (n&amp;1)!<label>(3)</label></formula><p>For r k # R k, n let N**(r k ) denote the number of these refining sequences of rooted forests with the k th term specified equal to r k . This is the number of ways to choose (r 1 , ..., r k&amp;1 ) times the number of ways to choose (r k+1 , ..., r n ), that is from (2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N**(r k )=N*(r k )(n&amp;k)!=n k&amp;1 (k&amp;1)! (n&amp;k)!<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Because this number does not depend on the choice of</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">r k # R k, n , dividing<label>(3)</label></formula><p>by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) yields the number of rooted forests of k trees over [n]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">*R k, n = n n&amp;1 (n&amp;1)! n k&amp;1 (k&amp;1)!(n&amp;k)! = \ n k+ kn n&amp;k&amp;1 = \ n&amp;1 k&amp;1+ n n&amp;k<label>(5)</label></formula><p>This enumeration appears as (8a) in Riordan <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> with a proof using generating functions and the Lagrange inversion formula. Let R 0 k, n denote the subset of R k, n consisting of all rooted forests over [n] whose set of roots is <ref type="bibr">[k]</ref>. An r k # R k, n is specified by first picking its set of k roots, then picking a forest with those roots. So <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> amounts to the following result stated by Cayley <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and proved by Re nyi <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">*R 0 k, n =kn n&amp;k&amp;1<label>(6)</label></formula><p>For alternative proofs and equivalents of this formula see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 17]</ref>. The same method yields easily the following result, which includes both Lemma 1 and formula (5) as special cases:</p><p>Proposition 2. For each 1 k j n, and each forest r j of j rooted trees over [n], the number of forests of k rooted trees over [n] that contain r j is ( j&amp;1 k&amp;1 ) n j&amp;k .</p></div>

The analog of Lemma 1 for unrooted forests is more complicated:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Lemma 3 (Moon [35]). If f k # F k, n consists of k trees of sizes n 1 , ..., n k , where i n i =n, then the number N( f k ) of trees t # T n which contain f k is N( f k )= \ k i=1 n i + n k&amp;2 (7)</formula><p>Proof.

K See <ref type="bibr">Stanley ([62]</ref>, Exercise 2.11) for a generalization of Lemma 3 which can be obtained by the same method, and an application to enumeration of spanning trees of a general graph. Section 5 shows how Moon's derivation of Lemma 3 can be reversed to deduce Cayley's multinomial expansion over trees.</p></div>

The equivalence of (i), (ii), and (iii) is evident from the enumeration (3), and the uniform distribution of R k follows from (4). K</p><p>The next theorem is just a reformulation of Theorem 4 in terms of unrooted forests instead of rooted forests. While the correspondence between (i) and (i)' and between (iii) and (iii)' in the two formulations is obvious, in the unrooted formulation the distributions of the intermediate random forests displayed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> are not uniform, and the coalescent description (ii)' is consequently more complicated. The rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> in (ii)' for picking which pair of trees to join in the coalescent process obtained by time-reversal of (i)' appears without proof in Yao [64, <ref type="bibr">Lemma 2]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 5. The following three descriptions (i)', (ii)' and (iii)', for the distribution of sequence (F 1 , F 2 , ..., F n ) of random forests over [n], are equivalent, and imply that for each 1 k n and each forest f k # F k, n comprising k trees with sizes n 1 , ..., n k in some arbitrary order,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P(F k = f k )= &gt; k i=1 n i n n&amp;k \ n&amp;1 k&amp;1+<label>(9)</label></formula><p>(i)' F 1 is a uniform random tree over [n], and given F 1 , for each 1 k n the forest F k is derived by deletion from F 1 of k&amp;1 edges e j , 1 j k&amp;1, where (e j , 1 j n&amp;1) is a uniform random permutation of the set of n&amp;1 edges of F 1 ;</p><p>(ii)' F n is the trivial forest, with n vertices and no edges, and for n k 2, given F n , ..., F k where F k is a forest over [n] with k tree components, say [T 1 , ..., T k ] where T i is a set of size n i and k i=1 n i =n, the forest F k&amp;1 # F k&amp;1, n is derived from F k by addition of a single edge a W b according to the following rule: first pick (i, j) with probability n i +n j n(k&amp;1) for 1 i&lt;j k,</p><p>then pick a and b independently and uniformly at random from T i and T j respectively.</p><p>(iii)' the sequence (F 1 , F 2 , ..., F n ) has uniform distribution over the set of all (n&amp;1)! n n&amp;2 refining sequences of forests ( f 1 , f 2 , ..., f n ) such that f k # F k, n for every 1 k n&amp;1.</p><p>Proof. The equivalence of descriptions (i)' and (iii)' is obvious from Cayley's formula *T n =n n&amp;2 . From either of these descriptions, the forest F k is determined by a choice of a tree t # T n and a subset of k&amp;1 bonds of t, and there are n n&amp;2 ( n&amp;1 k&amp;1 ) equally likely choices. The number of such choices which make F k = f k is the number of trees t # T n which contain f k , as displayed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.

This can be verified as follows using the conditional distribution of R k&amp;1 given R k described in condition (ii) of Theorem 4. Consider the conditional probability that F k&amp;1 = f k&amp;1 given F k = f k where f k&amp;1 is obtained by adding a single edge a W b to f k , where a # T i and b # T j for some 1 i&lt; j k.

Let }(x, y) be a positive symmetric function of pairs of positive integers (x, y), called a collision rate kernel.

Here }(x, y) may be interpreted as a collision rate between trees of size x and size y in a continuous time Markov chain with state space F n .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RANDOM PARTITIONS</head><p>In applications of coalescent processes, the distribution of sizes of various clumps is of primary importance. The state of a coalescent process of n particles is often regarded as a partition of n, that is a unordered collection of positive integer clump sizes with sum n. A partition of n may be denoted 1 m 1 2 m 2 } } } n m n to indicate that there are m i clumps of size i for each 1 i n, where n= i im i and the number of clumps is i m i . If clumps are regarded as sets of labeled particles, the state of a coalescent process may be represented as a partition of the set [n]. In the random forest models of the previous section, each clump of particles also has an internal tree structure. Such models arise naturally in polymer chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, but the internal tree stucture may be ignored in other settings. Let There are natural projections from F n onto P [n] onto P n , say f Ä 6 Ä ?, where 6 is the partition of [n] generated by the tree components of f, and ? is the partition of n generated by the sizes of components of 6. By use of these projections and the standard criterion for a function of a Markov chain to be Markov, the discrete time }-coalescent process defined in the previous section as a Markov chain with statespace F n induces corresponding Markov chains with state space P [n] and P n .

Sheth <ref type="bibr">[58, (5)</ref>] found the distribution for a partition of n described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> by analysis of a stochastic model for gravitational clumping which he reformulated in quite different terms as follows. Consider a Poisson Galton Watson branching process (PGW(*) process) starting with a single male individual, in which each individual has a Poisson(*) number of offspring for some 0&lt;* 1, so the process is either critical or sub-critical. Suppose that each individual born in the process is male with probability p and female with probability q, independently of the sex of all other individuals. Let N total be the total number of progeny in the branching process, say N total =N male +N female . In the random family tree of size N total induced by the branching process, there are N total &amp;1 parent-child bonds. Now cut the tree into subtrees by cutting each bond between a parent and a male child. There are then N male subtrees, each consisting of a single male individual and his female line of descent. Sheth <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> showed that given N total =n the distribution of the partition of n defined by the sizes of the N male distinct subtrees is given by formula which reduces to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. The connection between Sheth's model and Moon's model is provided by the following observation of Aldous <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> (c.f. Gordon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Kolchin <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kesten Pittel [24]</ref>). Given that a PGW(*) branching process starting with one individual has total progeny equal to n, let T be the random tree over [n] obtained from the PGW(*) family tree by a random labeling of individuals in the family tree by <ref type="bibr">[n]</ref>.</p><p>Then T has uniform distribution on R 1, n . See <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> for a proof and discussion of related results. Combined with Theorem 4 this observation implies that in the two-sex PGW(*) process in which each child is male with probability p, starting with a single male and given that N total =n and N male =k, the rooted random forest over [n] defined by subtrees of descent with male roots, for a random labeling of all individuals by [n], has uniform distribution on R k, n . Also, Sheth's result may be reformulated as follows: given that N total =n and N male =k, the sequence (N 1 *, ..., N k *) of sizes of the k subtrees, presented in a random order, has the joint distribution defined by formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p><p>Random mappings.

Let C be the set of vertices in cycles of D, let K=*C, and let R be the rooted forest with roots in C obtained by first cutting the edges of D between points in C, then reversing all edge directions.

Suppose that C is a subset of [N] with *C=n, and that the restriction of G(N, p) to C is a tree. This could be understood by conditioning in various ways. For example, C could be a fixed subset of size n, and G(N, p) could be conditioned to make its restriction to C a tree, or to make C a tree component of G(N, p). Or C could be the random component of G(N, p) containing a particular vertex, say vertex 1, and this component could be conditioned to be a tree component of size n. Let G C (N, q) denote the restriction of G(N, q) to C, regarded as graph on [n] by relabeling of C via the increasing map from [n] to C. Then it follows easily from the basic independence assumptions in the model G(N, p) that given the existence of the tree component C in G(N, p) the process (G C (N, up), 0 u 1) is a copy of the process (F + (n, u), 0 u 1) defined above. That is to say, given that a tree component C of size n exists in G(N, p), the development of the sequence of forests that coalesced to form C over the interval (0, p) is governed by an additive coalescent process. A similar statement holds of course for G(N, m) for arbitrary m n&amp;1. 4uczak [29, Section 5] exploited the more obvious time-reversed version of the above statement, in terms of random deletion of edges, to analyze the ``race of components'' in the evolution of a random graph.</p><p>The idea of picking out a clump of a given size n in a coalescent process by suitiable selection or conditioning, and analyzing how this clump of size n was formed, is the idea of a merger history process developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>.

The aim of this section is to obtain a corresponding formula for the distribution at time t of the same coalescent process started at an arbitrary initial partition.

The coalescent scheme in part (ii) of Theorem 11 provides one simple construction of a random tree R 1 with the distribution on R 1, n induced by an arbitrary probability distribution p on [n]. Many other constructions of such a tree R 1 are possible. For example, the Pru fer coding of rooted trees applied to a sequence of n&amp;1 independent random variables with distribution p. Or, assuming p a &gt;0 for all a, the following scheme constructs R 1 with the distribution on R 1, n induced by p from a sequence of independent random variables W 0 , W 1 , ... with distribution p, by application of a general result for irreducible Markov chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> [33, Section 6.1]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">R 1 :=[(W m&amp;1 , W m ): W m Â [W 0 , ..., W m&amp;1 ], m 1]<label>(40)</label></formula><p>According to Theorem 11, no matter how a random tree R 1 is constructed with the distribution on R . Call an R n -valued process R :=(R(t), t 0) a p-coalescent forest if R is a Markov chain such that for each 2 k n and each forest r k # R k, n , the rate of transitions from r k to r is zero unless r # R k&amp;1, n is derived from r k by addition of a single edge x Ä y for some y which is the root of one of the k&amp;1 tree components of r k that does not contain x, and for each such (x, y) the rate of addition of the edge x Ä y to r k is p x .</p><p>Note that for any probability distribution p on [n] the set of rooted trees R 1, n is a set of absorbing states for the p-coalescent forest, and that for any initial distribution of R(0), in a p-coalescent forest the limit R 1 :=R( &amp;) exists in R 1, n almost surely. Call this random tree R 1 the terminal random tree of the p-coalescent forest R. It follows from the above definition and standard properties of Poisson processes that a p-coalescent forest with arbitrary initial state R(0) can be constructed as follows. For each (x, y) # [n]_[n] let N x, y be a Poisson process of rate p x , and assume these N x, y are independent. If there is a point of N x, y at time t, say that an edge (x, y) appears at time t.

If G(t) is a rooted forest, let R(t)=G(t), else let R(t)=R(t&amp;).</p><p>Suppose now that the initial state R(0) is the trivial forest with n root vertices and no edges. Let { 0 :=0, { n := . By standard theory of finite state Markov chains, the sequence of times { 1 &lt;{ 2 &lt; } } } &lt;{ n&amp;1 at which the p-coalescent forest changes state is such that the { i &amp;{ i&amp;1 are independent exponential variables with rates n&amp;i. Moreover, this sequence is independent of the embedded jumping chain R n , ..., R 1 where R k is the state of R(t) during the interval [{ n&amp;k , { n&amp;k+1 ) when R(t) # R k, n , and the sequence (R k , 1 k n) has the distribution described in part (ii) of Theorem 11. For 1 m n&amp;1 let (I m , J m ) be the m th edge added during the construction of the p-coalescent forest (R(t), t 0). Then ((I m , J m ), 1 m n&amp;1) has the same distribution as ((X n&amp;m , Y n&amp;m ), 1 m n&amp;1) for ((X j , Y j ), 1 j n&amp;1) as in part (ii) of Theorem 11.

According to Theorem 11, conditionally given R 1 the sequence ((I m , J m ), 1 m n&amp;1) is a random permutation of the set of n&amp;1 edges of R 1 . For each (i, j) which is an edge of R 1 , let [epxij] be the random time at which (i, j) is added in the construction of (R(t), t 0); that is = (i, j ) ={ m if (i, j)=(I m , J m ).

Conditionally given R 1 the joint distribution of the = (i, j ) , (i, j) # R 1 and the { 1 , ..., { n&amp;1 is thus identical to the joint distribution of a collection of n&amp;1 independent exponential variables with rate 1 and their increasing rearrangement. Thus Theorem 11 implies:</p><p>Corollary 14.

The following lemma is an immediate consequence of the well known criterion in terms of transition rates for a function of a Markov chain to be a Markov chain <ref type="bibr">[56,</ref> Section IIId]: Lemma 15. If (R(t), t 0) is a p-coalescent forest, then (6(t), t 0) is a P [n] -valued additive p-coalescent, as per the next definition. Definition 16. Call a P [n] -valued process (6(t), t 0) a P [n] -valued additive p-coalescent or (P [n] , +, p) coalescent if (6(t), t 0) is a Markov chain with the following transition rates: for a partition ?=[S 1 , ..., S k ] # P [n] with k 1, the only possible transitions out of state ? are te ? ij for some 1 i&lt; j k, where ? ij is obtained from ? by merging S i and S j and leaving the other components of ? unchanged, and the rate of transitions from ? to ? ij is p S i + p S j , where p S = a # S p a .</p><p>Intuitively, think of p as a distribution of mass over S. The (P [n] , +, p)coalescent develops by merging each pair of components at a rate equal to the sum of the masses of the two components. For p the uniform distribution on P [n] , the (P [n] , +, p)-coalescent is identical to the P [n] -valued additive coalescent process considered in Theorem 8. The above development now yields the following description of the semigroup of the (P [n] , +, p)coalescent for an arbitrary probability measure p on [n]:</p><p>Theorem 17 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Let (6(t), t 0) be a (P S i <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> where p S = s # S p s and |S| is the number of elements of S. If instead the initial partition is 6(0)=? # P [n] , the same formula applies to each partition [S 1 , ..., S k ] of [n] such that each S i is a union of some number n i of components of ?, with |S i | replaced by n i .</p><p>Proof. For 6(0) the partition of [n] into singletons, by application of Lemma 15 the probability of the event that 6(t)=[S 1 , ..., S k ] is obtained by summing the expression (43) over all forests r whose tree components are S 1 , ..., S k . Write the product over S in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> as the product over 1 i k of products over S i . The sum of products is then a product of sums, where the i th sum is a sum over all trees labelled by S i . Each of these sums can be evaluated by the multinomial expansion over rooted trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, and the result is <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. If instead 6(0)=?=[A 1 , ..., A q ] say, then the only partitions [S 1 , ..., S k ] which are possible states of 6(t) are coarsenings of the initial partition. Every such coarsening is identified in an obvious way by a partition of the set <ref type="bibr">[q]</ref>. With this identification the (P [n] , +, p) coalescent with initial partition [A 1 , ..., A q ] # P [n] is identified with the (P [q] , +, p$) coalescent with initial state the partition of [q] into singletons, and p$ i = p A i , i # [q], and the conclusion follows.
