<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Q UADROTOR unmanned helicopter, consisting of four individual rotors of "X" arrangement, is an excellent, novel vertical take-off and landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which has shown a broad application prospects in the military and civilian fields, such as rescue, surveillance, inspection, mapping, and so on. However, the quadrotor helicopter is a typical nonlinear and coupled system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and its flight control system design is a challenging work.</p><p>Traditionally, the linear control methods are widely used in the controller design of quadrotor UAV. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) was applied to attitude stabilization of UAV. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller was applied to deal with a nominal system obtained by feed-forward control and linearized approximation. To improve robustness, a robust compensator was developed in the method to reject the external disturbances. In addition, the H ∞ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and µ-synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have also been investigated in quadrotor UAV. Although some linear control methods aforementioned were widely used, a potential drawback is that they can not provide excellent tracking performance for systems with high nonlinearity under large operation range. In recent years, more and more nonlinear control methods have received much attention.</p><p>The recursive backstepping is generally utilized as a baseline controller due to the cascaded structure of quadrotor dynamics. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, trajectory tracking for the quadrotor UAV was achieved by combining classical backstepping and sliding mode approach, but the two-time scale separation assumption needs large inner-loop gain to guarantee the closedloop stability. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a new command-filtered backstepping technique was developed to achieve trajectory tracking control for a quadrotor UAV, where a linear tracking differentiator was used to eliminate the assumption of inner/outer-loop structure. In addition, the dynamic inversion control <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, model predictive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, singular perturbation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and adaptive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> were widely investigated in flight control for quadrotor UAV subject to uncertainties and external disturbances. In spite of the extensive development of robust and adaptive control techniques, the sliding mode control (SMC) has been known as one of the most important tools for control of uncertain systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This technique utilizes a discontinuous control to ensure finite time convergence of the sliding mode output. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a SMC approach was developed to stabilize a class of uncertain underactuated systems in cascaded form, and then, the proposed method was utilized to control a quadrotor UAV. An asymptotic tracking control scheme was proposed for the quadrotor UAV in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where the SMC was utilized in the inner-loop to compensate the unmatched disturbances. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a nonlinear control algorithm for the attitude tracking of a quadrotor UAV was proposed, where a sliding model disturbance rejection technique was utilized to improve the robustness with respect to bounded external disturbances. In addition, the SMC can be combined with other control technologies, such as fuzzy logic, backstepping and adaptive control, to improve control performance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. However, the robustness of the SMC is achieved at the cost of a high frecuency switching of the control signal, which has a negative effect in the actuator. To reduce the chattering, a family of continuous sliding mode controllers named STA have been developed. The STA demonstrates robustness with respect to unbounded disturbance satisfying a Lipschitz condition. The finite time stability of the method was constructed by means of geometric homogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Lyapunov methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a super-twisting sliding mode controller was developed for the quadrotor UAV, which demonstrates more robust comparing with a LQR controller and a nonlinear feedback linearization based controller. In the method, the sliding mode controller helps to reject disturbances and model uncertainties, whereas the STA is used to reduce the chattering effect. Traditionally, the STA is designed for systems with relative order one. A sliding manifold has to be included when STA is applied in attitude control of quadrotor UAV. Although the finite time convergence of the sliding manifold can be achieved, the evolution of trajectory on the sliding manifold is asymptotic. Recently, some modified super-twisting algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> have been developed for systems of dimension more than one. Nevertheless, most of the algorithms were discussed for single-input single-output (SISO) systems. When applied in multivariable systems, the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system is separated into multi-SISO systems, and then the developed theory is used (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>). As pointed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, a multivariable control scheme may be preferred for MIMO control systems since it can bring some improved control performance such as chattering reduction for SMC.</p><p>Motivated by the above observations and inspired from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, a continuous multivariable finite time stabilizing attitude control law is developed for quadrotor UAV in the present paper. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. Theoretically, a multivariable high-order super-twisting-like algorithm is proposed, and a rigorous proof of the finite time stability of the algorithm is derived by using the homogeneity and Lyapunov theory. Practically, the multivariable finite time attitude control of quadrotor UAV is investigated by theory and experiment. To the best of our knowledge, no published experimental results on the multivariable finite time attitude control of quadrotor UAV are available till now.</p><p>The outline of the paper is given as follows. Some definitions and lemmas on finite time stability are recalled in Section II. The problem is formulated in Section III. In Section IV, a multivariable STLA is developed for systems of dimension more than one, and then a multivariable supertwisting-like attitude controller is designed for the quadrotor UAV. The results in both numerical simulation and experiment are provided in Section V. Finally, some conclusions are summarized in Section VI.</p></div>

First, the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is designed in scalar form, whereas the developed algorithm is multivariable, and some improved performances are derived by the multivariable algorithm (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> for more details). Second, the super-twisting algorithm (STA) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is designed for systems with relative order one. Nevertheless, the developed algorithm can be applied for systems with arbitrary order. Third, a sliding manifold has to be designed when STA in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is applied in higher order systems, e.g. the attitude control of quadrotor. Although the finite time convergence of the sliding manifold is achieved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the attitude tracking is asymptotic due to using a linear sliding manifold. The sliding manifold is not required and the finite time attitude tracking can be achieved by the developed method.</p><p>0278-0046 (c) 2017 IEEE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Numerical Results</head><p>Case 1: Simulation in Monte Carlo. In the simulation, the disturbances ∆ = [1 + sin(5t), 1 + cos(5t), 0.5(1 + sin(5t) + cos(5t))] T I are added. In addition, the model parameter uncertainty ∆ I determined randomly in [-30%, +30%]I is added, which means that the real inertia matrix I + ∆ I is used in the simulation. The desired reference commands are selected by Θ ref = [0.1sin(t), 0.1cos(t), 0] T rad. The initial values of the attitude angle and angular velocity are set to Θ(0) = [ϕ(0), θ(0), χ(0)]rad and Ω(0) = [0, 0, 0]rad/s, where ϕ(0), θ(0) and χ(0) are selected in the interval [-0.5, 0.5]rad, [-0.4, 0.6]rad and [-0.5, 0.5]rad randomly. All the initial values of the integral items used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> are set to zero. The simulation is carried out in Matllab/Simulink with a fixed-sampling time 4ms.</p><p>A Monte Carlo simulation with 200 runs has been carried out. The attitude tracking, including roll angle, pitch angle and yaw angle, are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, from that it can be observed that the desired attitude commands can be tracked effectively by the proposed control scheme. Furthermore, the tracking errors are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, it can be seen that the tracking errors converge to zero even in the presence of model parameter uncertainty ∆ I , external disturbance ∆(t) and the random diversification of the attitude initial values. In addition, an interesting phenomenon can be observed that the tracking errors of roll angle, pitch angle and yaw angle, converge to zero synchronously, which is an advantage of the multivariable STLA. Moreover, the zoomed figures given in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> show that the tracking accuracy is about 10 -4 degree at a sampling frequency of 250HZ. Finally, the simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed approach in attitude tracking with high accuracy and fast converge rate.</p><p>Case 2: Simulation in Noise Environment. To show the performance of the developed method with respect to noise, a mean of 0 and a covariance of 0.01 measurement noise is added in attitude angle. In this case, the maximum disturbance ∆ I = 30%I and zero initial values are used. All the parameters are the same with those provided in the previous. The simulation results are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>.</p><p>From the results, it can be observed that the attitude tracking errors converge to small regions around zero even in the presence of noise.</p><p>Remark 5: It is worth noting that the effects of wind and aerodynamics such as blade flapping as well as aerodynamic drag are neglected in quadrotor dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. The detailed discussions about the effects of wind and aerodynamics on quadrotor can be referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The role of the simulation in this subsection is to provide a set of reliable control parameters for the following experiments. A more satisfactory control performance could be expected in practice if the effects of wind and aerodynamics are considered in the controller design. This issue will be investigated in our future work.   </p></div>

Experimental Results</head><p>Attitude tracking experiment has been conducted in this subsection, and some experimental results are given to illustrate the control performances of the developed algorithm. To this end, a quadrotor experimental platform is established, which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>. In this platform, the vehicle is fixed at a stationary joint base to restrict the translational motion of the vehicle. An MEMS-based IMU is used to measure the attitude and the angular velocities, and a Wi-Fi wireless module is used to transmit data between the quadrotor UAV and the ground station. Furthermore, the developed algorithm is implemented in an open source flight controller PX4, where the control computer and flight control extension board including accelerator, compass and gyroscopes are integrated. The updating frequency of the attitude control loop is selected as 250HZ.</p><p>Case 1: Comparison with PID. A comparison between the developed method with PID control is performed in this subsection. The PID parameters with K p = 8, K i = 0.2 and K d = 3 are used through painstaking selection. The control parameters of the our proposed method are the same with those provided in the previous. First, the hover flight is performed. In this case, the experimental results are provided in Figs. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure">9</ref>. From the results, it can be observed that the hover flight can be achieved by the both methods. The result in the bottom of Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows that the better yaw control performance can be achieved by the developed method. To further show the performance of the both method, the maneuver flight is carried out. The reference commands of roll angle and pitch angle are defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">ϕ ref =    0 t ∈ [0, 30] 0.1sin π(t-30) 15 t ∈ [30, 90] 0 t ∈ [90, 110] θ ref =    0 t ∈ [0, 35] 0.1sin π(t-35) 15 t ∈ [35, 95] 0 t ∈ [95, 110]<label>(54)</label></formula><p>The desired yaw angle is set to</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">ψ ref = 0 for t ∈ [0, 110].</formula><p>In view of the given reference commands, the attitude stabilization (hovering flight) of quadrotor UAV from some given initial states is verified during t ∈ [0, 30]. For t ∈ <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr">95]</ref>, the attitude tracking (maneuver flight) is investigated. Then, the hovering flight is recovered. The whole process is provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>. The results in this case are plotted in Figs. <ref type="figure">10</ref> and<ref type="figure">MFig11</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> shows the attitude tracking curves, including roll angle, pitch angle and yaw angle of the quadrotor UAV.</p><p>In addition, the attitude tracking errors of the PID and the developed control are also provided in the bottom of Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>.</p><p>From that, it can be seen that the tracking errors are driven into a small region around zero by our developed method. However, the tracking errors with PID control increase obviously when the quadrotor perform a maneuver flight. Further analysis shows that additional external disturbances are induced when the vehicle is in the maneuver flight mode due to the fact that the centroid of the vehicle does not pass through the stationary point in this case. From the disturbance estimate curves obtained by k 2 ∫ t 0 sign(s 1 )dt (see Remark 2) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>, it can be seen that the disturbances, especially in the roll direction, increase obviously when the quadrotor enters the maneuver flight mode. Since the discontinuous integral term k 2 ∫ t 0 sign(s 1 )dt in the developed control law (52) plays a key role in rejecting external disturbances, the developed method demonstrates the better robustness and the higher tracking accuracy especially in the presence of the transition between hover to maneuver, which can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. Another remarkable feature of the developed method is that the nominal control performance can be recovered because the disturbances can be compensated completely (at least in theory) by k 2 ∫ t 0 sign(s 1 )dt, which can also be validated by the evolutions of the tracking errors in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> of wind disturbances. In the experiment, we found that the control performance degrades significantly when the velocity of wind exceeds 3.6 m/s due to the small scale of the quadrotor applied in the experiment. The corresponding control torques are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">14</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>A continuous multivariable STLA is developed for a quadrotor UAV, which ensures the finite time convergence of the states to the equilibrium point. A rigorous proof of the finite time stability of the proposed algorithm is achieved through homogeneity technique and Lyapunov method. Also, the convergent condition is derived. An application of the method on quadrotor UAV is discussed, and the Monte Carlo numerical simulation and experiment have been carried out to verify the efficiency of the developed method.</p></div>

See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. Proof. The proof is similar with the proof of Proposition 8.1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. If specified with α = 1 in Lemma 5, the closed-loop system (2) and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is reduced to</p><p>which is globally asymptotically stable provided that the parameters k i , (i = 1, ..., n) are selected such that the polynomial</p><p>Therefore, there exists a continuous, positively definite and proper function V (x) such that V (x) &lt; 0 for system (55) with any x ∈ R n \{0}.</p><p>Due to the continuity of the right hand side of the closedloop system ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) with respect to α, the condition V (α, x) &lt; 0 also holds for system (2) and (3), if α is selected in the interval (1 -ϵ, 1) with ϵ being chosen close enough to 1. Hence, the closed-loop system (2) and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is finite time stable with appropriate selection of the parameters α.</p><p>Additionally, a direct verification shows that the multivariable system (2) under control law (3) with parameters (4) is homogeneious with degree k = -1 with respect to dilation mapping Λ r λ (x) = [λ r1 x 1 , ..., λ rm x m ] T with weight vector r i = i+1-iα 1-α . It follows from Lemma 1 that the system (2) under control law (3) is finite time stable. This completes the proof. </p></div>			</div>
