The objective is to design a suitable observer-based dynamic output feedback controller that guarantees the global stability of the resulting closed-loop fuzzy system with a prescribed H ∞ disturbance attenuation level. Based on common/piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions combined with S-procedure and some matrix inequality convexification techniques, some new results are developed to the controller synthesis for the underlying continuous-time T-S fuzzy affine systems with unmeasurable premise variables.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>F UZZY systems and control have attracted a great deal of attention from both the academic and industrial communities during the past few decades. Tremendous effort has been devoted to both theoretical research and implementation techniques for fuzzy controllers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It has been well recognized that fuzzy control is a simple and effective approach to controlling many complex nonlinear systems or even nonanalytic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In many cases, fuzzy logic control (FLC) has been suggested as an alternative approach to conventional control techniques. However, it is also worth mentioning that the traditional FLC techniques suffer from a number of disadvantages such as the difficulty for systematic design and inconsistent performance. Recent research efforts have led to numerous results on systematic stability analysis and controller synthesis of continuous-and discrete-time fuzzy control systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models or the so-called fuzzy dynamic models are used. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and survey papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and references cited therein, for the most recent advances on this topic.</p><p>The key idea of T-S fuzzy models is to use a set of fuzzy rules to describe a global nonlinear system in terms of a set of local linear models, which are smoothly connected by fuzzy membership functions. The appeal of T-S fuzzy models is that they combine the flexible fuzzy logic theory and fruitful linear multivariable system theory into a unified framework so that the control design and analysis can be carried out via Lyapunov function-based approaches. The earlier approaches often employ common quadratic Lyapunov functions (CQLFs). It has been shown that the stability and stabilization of the overall fuzzy system can be determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities with a common positive-definite Lyapunov matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Nevertheless, a CQLF might not exist for many fuzzy systems, especially for highly nonlinear complex systems. In fact, it has been shown that there are many fuzzy systems that do not admit such a CQLF, whereas they may still be asymptotically stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This has motivated the development of more advanced approaches such as the piecewise/fuzzy(nonquadratic) Lyapunov function-based approaches. To mention a few, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, a number of results on analysis and synthesis approaches that are based on piecewise Lyapunov functions are presented. However, due to the discontinuity of the function across the region boundaries, for these methods based on the piecewise Lyapunov function, certain restrictive boundary conditions have to be imposed to ensure the stability of the system. More recently, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a different kind of piecewise Lyapunov function has been introduced, and a stability result for continuous-time fuzzy dynamic systems that are based on this piecewise Lyapunov function, which is continuous across region boundaries of the state space <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> has been developed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a number of stability analysis, robust stabilization, and filtering design results for discrete-time fuzzy dynamic systems that are based on pieecewise/fuzzy(nonquadratic) Lyapunov functions have been developed. It was also demonstrated in these works that the piecewise/fuzzy Lyapunov functions are a much richer class of Lyapunov function candidates than the CQLF candidates and, thus, is able to handle a larger class of fuzzy dynamic systems.</p><p>On the other hand, networked control systems (NCSs) have attracted great attention in control community due to their successful applications in a broad range of areas such as transportation networks, power grids, mobile sensor networks, water distribution networks, haptics collaboration over the Internet, unmanned aerial vehicles, and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Nevertheless, the utilization of networks as a communication medium in feedback loops brings us new challenges, which makes the analysis and synthesis of control systems much more complex and difficult due to their limited transmission capacity. Among a number of issues that arise from such a framework, the quantization effect is an important issue to be addressed. In a network environment, signals are usually quantized before being communicated, and the number of quantization levels is closely related to the information flow between the system components and, thus, to the capacity that is required to transmit the information <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>More recently, there have been some results on robust controller/filter analysis and synthesis for network-based fuzzy dynamic systems in the open literature; see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. To mention a few, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, some results on robust stabilization and H ∞ control for a class of discrete-time T-S fuzzy systems with packet dropout based on common/fuzzy-basisdependent Lyapunov functions have been presented. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, some results on robust H ∞ dynamic output feedback control of discrete-time T-S fuzzy systems with packet dropout and time delay based on a CQLF have been presented. We have also proposed some new results on output feedback control and robust filtering design of discrete-time networked T-S fuzzy dynamic systems that are based on piecewise Lyapunov functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In the continuous-time context, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> studied the guaranteed cost control and robust H ∞ control for a class of networked T-S fuzzy systems with packet dropout and/or time delay based on a common Lyapunov function/functional. It is noted that due to the particular structure of piecewise Lyapunov matrices and decoupling techniques for corresponding stability/performance analysis conditions, the controller synthesis for continuous-time networked (or non-networked) T-S fuzzy affine systems that are based on piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions (PQLFs) are more difficult and challenging than that for the discrete-time case <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are, to the authors' best knowledge, very few results that are available in the literature on the output feedback controller design for continuous-time networked (or non-networked) T-S fuzzy affine (or non-affine) systems based on the PQLFs, especially when the plant premise variables are not measurable. Note that the output feedback control is particularly very useful and more realistic owing to the partially measurable state variables in practical applications. Recently, some results on the design of observer-based output feedback control for continuous-time fuzzy systems without affine terms have been reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which are mainly based on CQLFs and, thus, tend to be conservative. This motivates us to adopt PQLFs in output feedback controller synthesis which shall make the resulting controller less conservative and more applicable in practice though the computation cost of the controller design with PQLFs is more demanding.</p><p>In this paper, we will consider the observer-based robust H ∞ output feedback control for a class of networked nonlinear systems using quantized measurements. Specifically, the nonlinear system is represented by a continuous-time T-S fuzzy affine dynamic model with norm-bounded parametric uncertainties, and the quantization error is treated using a sector bound method <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It is also assumed that the plant premise variables are not measurable; therefore, there is no guarantee that the plant and the controller always operate in the same region at the same time, i.e., they may not synchronize in transition from one region to another. Based on common/PQLFs combined with S-procedure and some matrix inequality convexification techniques, three new synthesis approaches will be proposed. The first design approach is based on a CQLF, while the other two are based on PQLFs. It will be shown that the resulting closedloop fuzzy system is globally stable with a guaranteed H ∞ performance, and the observer/controller gains can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II formulates the problem under consideration. Section III presents three approaches to controller synthesis based on common and PQLFs, respectively. Two simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in Section IV, which is followed by conclusions in Section V.</p><p>Notations: The notations that are used throughout this paper are standard. n ×m denotes the set of n × m matrices.

Remark 2.1: To avoid unnecessarily complicated notations, in this paper, we only consider the uncertainty terms that appear in the matrices A l and a l .

Since the rules of the fuzzy system (1) induce a polyhedral partition of the state space, the global fuzzy system (5) can be viewed as a number of subsystems in a set of individual regions. Denote the state-space partition as {S i } i∈I and I as the set of region indices. In this paper, we follow the idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to divide the state space into two kinds of regions: crisp (operating) regions and fuzzy (interpolation) regions. The crisp region is defined as the region where μ l [x(t)] = 1 for some l, and all other membership functions evaluate to zero. The system dynamic of the crisp region is given by the lth local model of the fuzzy system (1). On the other hand, the fuzzy region is defined as the region where 0 &lt; μ l [x(t)] &lt; 1, and the system dynamic is given by a convex combination of several local models. Then, we can rewrite the global system (5) to be an equivalent piecewise fuzzy affine system as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ x(t + 1) = (A i + ΔA i ) x(t) + a i + Δa i + Bu(t) + D i w(t) z(t) = L i x(t) + N i w(t) y(t) = C i x(t) + M i w(t), x(t) ∈ S i , i ∈ I (7)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ A i := m ∈I(i) μ m A m , ΔA i := m ∈I(i) μ m ΔA m a i := m ∈I(i) μ m a m , Δa i := m ∈I(i) μ m Δa m C i := m ∈I(i) μ m C m , D i := m ∈I(i) μ m D m M i := m ∈I(i) μ m M m , L i := m ∈I(i) μ m L m N i := m ∈I(i) μ m N m (8) with 0 &lt; μ m [x(t)] ≤ 1, m ∈I(i) μ m [x(t)] = 1.</formula><p>For each local region S i , the set I(i) contains the indices for the system matrices that are used in the interpolation within that region.

In such circumstances, the continuous-time fuzzy affine system in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is partitioned which is based on the general state space but not the measurable output space, and thus, there is no guarantee that plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and the controller with observer ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">17</ref>) always operate in the same region at the same time, especially in the initial period of the system dynamics.

Now, we are ready to present the following lemma. Lemma 3.1. Given a constant γ &gt; 0, the closed-loop fuzzy control system in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">18</ref>) is globally stable with disturbance attenuation level γ, if there exist a set of positive scalars ε is &gt; 0, symmetric matrices T , W is , and U is , i, s ∈ I , such that W is and U is have nonnegative entries, and with</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">P is = P is = F T is T F is , if i, s ∈ I 0 Pis = F T is T Fis , else<label>(38)</label></formula><p>the following matrix inequalities hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">P is -E T is U is E is &gt; 0, i, s ∈ I (39) ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ -ε is I 0 -γ 2 I + N T m N m + ε is M T m Mm P is H m 1 P is D m s + L T m N m + ε is H T m 2 Mm Ψ ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ &lt; 0, m ∈ I(i), n ∈ I(s) (<label>40</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_56">)</formula><p>where It is noted that when the observer and controller gains are known, the conditions that are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(40)</ref> are strict LMIs, and, thus, are useful to performance analysis for the closed-loop system in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Nevertheless, when the controller/observer gains are unknown, conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_55">40</ref>) are bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs), which are nonconvex, NP-hard, and, therefore, expensive to solve globally from a computational viewpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. Thus, the main purpose, hereafter, is to convexify the products of the systems matrices with the Lyapunov matrices. Nevertheless, it is noted that the continuity matrices F is in the Lyapunov matrix P is are generally not square. In addition, it is also noticed that indices of the Lyapunov matrices and the controller/observer gains are (i, s) and s, respectively, which are not the same. Thus, it is anticipated that conditions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(40)</ref> are not convenient when used for the controller/observer synthesis purpose. To resolve this difficulty, it shall be useful to eliminate the products between the system matrices and the Lyapunov matrices. Unfortunately, it is noted that in this continuous-time case the well-known inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> -G T P -1 G ≤ P -G -G T with P &gt; 0 cannot be used to separate the Lyapunov matrices from the system matrices. Instead, the powerful Projection lemma (see Appendix A) will be exploited to realize the decoupling feature.

(44) Proof. See Appendix D. Remark 3.5: By Projection Lemma and introducing two sets of slack variables G is , V is , it is easy to see that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42)</ref>, the Lyapunov matrices are not involved in the products with the system matrices. It is shown that this decoupling feature enables one to use the PQLFs and LMIs for the observer/controller syn-thesis purpose. Here, it is also worth mentioning that Theorem 3.2 is generally less conservative than Theorem 3.1, because a PQLF is adopted and no constraint is imposed on the piecewise Lyapunov matrices P is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42)</ref>. Nevertheless, it is also worth pointing out that when deriving the LMIs-based conditions in Theorem 3.2, we still impose up-triangular structural constraints on the slack variables as in (84), which inevitably brings some degree of design conservatism. To circumvent this drawback, two natural questions arise: Is it possible to separate the Lyapunov matrices in (77) from the system matrices, but without introducing any slack variables?

Several approaches have been proposed to solve such nonconvex feasibility problems, among which the cone complementarity linearization (CCL) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> is the most commonly used one; see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.

(55)</formula><p>Nevertheless, it is interesting to show that even with structural constraint, the relaxed condition (81) is still a necessary and sufficient condition for the original inequality in (77). We summarize this result in the following proposition. Proposition 3.1: There exists a solution P is , i, s ∈ I to (77) if and only if there exists a solution P is , G is , V is , i, s ∈ I to (81).</p><p>Proof.

The proof is, thus, completed.</p><p>Remark 3.7: Note that the conditions given in Theorem 3.2 involve two tuning parameters: λ 1 and λ 2 . When these two scalar parameters are given, the conditions in Theorem 3.2 are strict linear matrix inequalities and can be solved by using the LMI toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. The problem is then how to find some combination of these scalars such that the LMIs have a feasible solution. A simple way to address the tuning issue is by the trial-and-error method. Another possible way is to apply some numerical optimization search algorithms (such as genetic algorithm or the program fminsearch in the optimization toolbox of MATLAB). It has been demonstrated that these optimization search procedures are indeed efficient for the LMIs-based parameter tuning problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 3.8: It is noted that all the conditions in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 and Algorithm 3.1 are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities that can be solved by the polynomial time algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> with complexity proportional to σ 3 ρ, where σ and ρ are the number of scalar variables and number of rows in the LMIs, respectively. Especially, it is noticed that in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 and Algorithm 3.1, the controller gains and the observer gains can be obtained simultaneously. It is also noted that the results that are given in this paper are obtained based on the assumption that the input matrix B is a common one. When the input matrix is not a common one, i.e., B l = B, l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r}, the closed-loop matrices Ãmns and ã m ns in (67) can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">Ãmns := A m + B m K s A m -A n + (B m -B n )K s -R s (C m -C n ) -B m K s A n -(B m -B n )K s -R s C n ã m ns := a m + B m k s a m -a n + (B m -B n )k s .</formula><p>It is noted that for this case, with the presence of terms (B m -B n )K s and (B m -B n )k s , unfortunately, the convexification procedures that are presented in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 are not applicable to the observer-based nonsynchronized output feedback controller design (see the last few steps in the proofs of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2). In this case, the well-known two-step design method <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> or BMIs-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> can be applied for the corresponding controller synthesis. It is also noted that the crossing terms (B m -B n )K s and (B m -B n )k s emerge due to the nonsynchronized controller design. In other words, the convexification technique that is presented in Theorem 3.2 is applicable for the synchronized control case when the input matrix is not a common one; as for this case, these crossing terms are not involved. Finally, it is also worth pointing out that the design techniques that are presented in Theorem 3.3 (see Algorithm 3.1) are applicable to both the synchronized and nonsynchronized control cases when the input matrix is not a common one. Remark 3.9: It is noted that in practical NCSs, in addition to quantization effects, the network-induced signal transmission delay and data packet dropout are more or less existing at the same time, which can also degrade the performance of the systems and even cause system instability. In this paper, we have only considered the measurement quantization, but the study of nonsynchronized output feedback control of continuous-time networked nonlinear systems via T-S fuzzy affine models with simultaneous consideration of different types of network-induced constraints deserves further investigation.</p></div>
