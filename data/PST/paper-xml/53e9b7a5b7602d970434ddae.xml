<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We address the problem of counting the number of peers in a peer-to-peer system, and more generally of aggregating statistics of individual peers over the whole system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Peer-to-peer systems have achieved fast and widespread adoption for both legal and illegal applications, ranging from file sharing (e.g. Kazaa or eDonkey) to VoIP (e.g. Skype). It is reasonable to expect novel applications to appear, and the scale of such systems to increase beyond millions of interacting peers.</p><p>A key feature of peer-to-peer systems is their distributed nature. Indeed, popular architectures organise the peers in an overlay network, typically layered over the Internet, and let peers communicate solely with their overlay neighbours. In such architectures, a peer's knowl-edge of the system is limited to its collection of neighbours. These architectures have good scalability properties; in particular they do not suffer from central servers becoming performance bottlenecks, or single points of failure.</p><p>On the flip side however, overlay architectures make it delicate to monitor system characteristics of interest that would be straightforward to observe in centralised systems. One example of such a system characteristic that will concern us in this paper is the system size, namely the number of peers. More generally, we are interested in (approximately) counting the number of peers with given characteristics, or aggregating characteristics of interest of individual peers over all peers.</p><p>The need to perform such peer counting arises in the following contexts. Recently proposed overlay maintenance protocols, such as Viceroy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, rely on approximate knowledge of the overlay size to incorporate a newly arrived peer in the system. Several gossip-based information dissemination protocols (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) rely on system size to determine the number of gossip targets per peer. We expect that such peer counting could find other applications. For instance, in a Live Media streaming system such as that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, it may be of interest to measure the number of peers using a Broadband connection or a dialup connection, in order to decide whether new dialup users can be accepted without compromising performance.</p><p>For particular overlay architectures, specific overlay properties may be exploited to efficiently measure system size. In contrast, our aim here is to design measurement techniques that are generic, in that they are applicable to arbitrary overlay networks. We propose two such techniques in this paper.</p><p>The first technique, which we call the Random Tour method, relies on launching a message from the peer initiating the measurement. This message then performs a random walk along the overlay until it returns to the initiator, i.e. a random tour. Local statistics accumulated along the tour within this message provide an estimate of system size. We analyse the quality of the resulting estimate, and in particular show how the spectral gap of the overlay graph, which is in turn affected by the expansion properties of the graph, conditions the accuracy of the estimate. This technique can be easily adapted to estimate aggregate statistics of other node properties.</p><p>We then propose a second technique, which we call the Sample&amp;Collide method. One building block of the method is a sampling function, which aims to provide a requesting overlay node with another node chosen uniformly at random from the overlay. Previous proposals have relied on a Discrete Time Random Walk stopped after a large constant time; clearly, this yields samples biased towards high-degree nodes. We describe a sampling algorithm based on a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW), which yields unbiased samples. We characterise the sampling quality/complexity trade-off and find that it is again critically affected by the expansion properties of the overlay graph.</p><p>The Sample&amp;Collide method produces an estimate of the system size based on the number of uniform random samples it takes before a target number of redundant samples are obtained. This method is inspired by the "Inverted Birthday Paradox" method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy and complexity of the Sample&amp;Collide method, and show how it improves upon the original proposal of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> by achieving a target accuracy with fewer samples.</p><p>While we do not study the impact of churn analytically, we evaluate it through simulations. These show that the proposed techniques are robust to both gradual and sudden changes in system size.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: in the next section we survey related work. We present the Random Tour method and its analysis in Section 3, and the Sam-ple&amp;Collide method and its analysis in Section 4. The evaluation of the two methods by simulation is shown in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.</p><p>We distinguish two classes of techniques for system size estimation. Techniques of the first type are tailored to a specific overlay architecture, while those of the second type are generic and applicable to any overlay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Architecture-specific techniques</head><p>In structured peer to peer overlay networks, peers are assigned identifiers drawn uniformly at random. The approach taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> deduces the network size in distributed hash tables (DHT) by measuring the density of identifiers around a node initiating a size estimate. The communication cost for getting a relative error of order īs Ç´½ ¯¾µ message exchanges, irrespective of the number of nodes AE . A similar approach is also considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, an estimate of the system size is constructed based on observations of node degrees, and relies on prior knowledge of a power law structure for the distribution of node degrees. A conceptually similar approach is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It produces an estimate of system size based on node degree observations, assuming a specific topology (namely, the Erdős-Rényi random graph model). No error estimates are provided in these papers; the cost of the latter is Ç´ÐÓ AE µ.</p><p>Another approach involves building a spanning tree on top of the overlay, and using it to estimate the system size <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> by aggregating estimates along the tree.</p><p>The obtained estimates are then exact in the absence of failures, and the cost is ¢´AE µ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> estimate the network size by observing the renewal of contacts in peers' views, in a gossip based overlay.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Generic techniques</head><p>Jelasity and Montresor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have considered the following gossip-based method. Initially one distinguished node sets a counter to 1 while all other nodes set their counter to 0. Nodes communicate asynchronously; when a pair of nodes communicates, they both reset their individual counters to the mean of the two previous values. In the long run, all counter values coincide with the reciprocal of the system size. This approach is suitable in stable environments. As all users eventually share the same size estimate, its cost is amortized over all nodes when they are all interested in obtaining such an estimate. A theoretical evaluation of the cost of such schemes can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The cost, evaluated in number of messages, is Ç´AE ½•¾ µ for -dimensional random geometric graphs. 1 It is Ç´AE ÐÓ ´AE µµ for expander graphs.</p><p>Another generic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, sometimes referred to as probabilistic polling, consists of a querying node requesting all nodes to report their presence probabilistically, the probability of responding being a function of node characteristics, such as distance (in number of hops) from the initial requestor. This produces unbiased estimates. One drawback of the method is that the initial querior is potentially faced with "ACK implosion". The cost of this method scales linearly with system size.</p><p>Finally, Bawa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> propose a method which assumes one can sample peers uniformly at random. They form an estimate of system size based on the number of samples required before the same peer is sampled twice. Here and in the sequel, we assume that peers (or nodes) are organised in an undirected graph, each node being aware of, and able to communicate directly with its neighbours. The node set is denoted by AE, and its size is AE .</p><p>The degree of node is denoted , and is by definition the number of neighbours of node in the overlay graph.</p><p>The aim is to design lightweight techniques for estimating for instance the system size AE . In fact, our techniques also apply to the estimation of sums of functions of the nodes, ¨ È ¾AE ´ µ, for general functions .</p><p>Estimation of the system size is just one special case, corresponding to ½. One may for instance be interested in evaluating the number of nodes with a degree larger than 100; this would correspond to the special case</p><p>´ µ ½ if ½¼¼, and ´ µ ¼ otherwise. There are many variants of interest, e.g. counting peers that have an upload capacity above 10Mb/s. We assume throughout that the graph is connected; if it is not, each node will only be able to estimate the size of its connected component.</p><p>This section is organised as follows. We first decribe the Random Tour method. We then prove that it is unbiased. We next interpret it in terms of Continuous Time Random Walks. This allows us to evaluate its accuracy, captured by the variance, and how it is affected by the spectral gap of the graph. Finally we discuss the role of the expansion property of the overlay, and the cost/accuracy trade-off of the method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Basic Algorithm</head><p>An estimation procedure is launched at an arbitrary node, say node , of the system. It proceeds as follows:</p><p>1. The initiator, node , initialises a counter value, , to ´ µ . It forwards a message, tagged with the counter value , and its identity, , to one of its neighbours, chosen uniformly at random. ), and forwards it to one of its neighbours, chosen uniformly at random.</p><p>3. When the originator, , receives the message it originally sent, with associated counter value , it forms the following estimate ¨of the system size ¨:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>¨</head><p>The estimate is thus obtained by adding a specific amount to a probe message at each node along a random tour, that is, a random walk started at initiator node and ended upon return to node .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Lack of bias</head><p>We now establish that the above estimation procedure is unbiased. We shall use ´¡µ to denote mathematical expectation when the random walk is started at node .</p><p>Note that so far we are considering discrete time random walks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 1</head><p>The Random Tour algorithm produces an unbiased estimate, that is, the expectation ´¨µ coincides with the quantity to be estimated, È </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ì ½ Ò ¼ ´ Ò µ</formula><p>where ´ µ</p><p>´ µ</p><p>. In order to compute its expectation, we rely on the cycle formula for so-called regenerative processes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Chapter VI for definitions and rigorous statements). Basically, a regenerative process is a stochastic process the trajectories of which can be broken into cycles, the cycles being independent from one another and identically distributed. In the present setting,</p><p>´ Ò µ is a regenerative process, as can be seen by defining a cycle to start with a visit to state , and to end before the next visit to state . In this context, the cycle formula yields that, for an arbitrary function :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">È Ì ½ Ò ¼ ´ ´Òµµ ´Ì µ ´ ´Òµµ ¾AE ´ µ<label>(2)</label></formula><p>here denotes expectation when the process Ò Ò ¼ is in a stationary regime (so that the marginal distribution of Ò is , for any Ò), denotes the expectation when it is started from the initial state ¼ , and Ì is the (random) time of the first Ò such that Ò , i.e. Ì is the beginning of the second cycle. Specialising (2) to the</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">indicator function ´ µ ½ (that is, ´ µ ¼ unless ) yields ´Ì µ ½ È ¾AE ¡<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Finally, note that the counter value obtained in the algorithm above when the original message returns to the sending node is exactly</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ì ½ Ò ¼ ´ Ò µ</formula><p>where ´ µ</p><p>´ µ</p><p>. We thus have by formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> that</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">´ µ ´Ì µ ¾AE ´ µ È ¾AE ¾AE È ¾AE ´ µ ¨ Since ¨</formula><p>, this last expression guarantees that the mathematical expectation of ¨is indeed equal to ¨. ¾</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Analysis of Variance</head><p>Here we specialise the discussion to the case where ½, that is we consider only estimation of the system size AE . We shall give bounds on the variance in this case, which involve a global parameter of the graph, namely the spectral gap of the graph. Before providing a definition, we re-interpret our estimation procedure in terms of Continuous Time Random Walks (CTRW).</p><p>Consider the CTRW defined as follows. After entering a node , the walker stays there for exactly ½ time units, and then moves to a randomly selected neighbour of node . We shall denote by Ø the position of the walker at time Ø. To distinguish from the discrete time case, we let denote the first time Ø ¼ when the walker moves from another node to node . It is readily seen that our estimate ¨also reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">¨ ¼ ´ Ø µ Ø<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and thus in the special case where ½, this reads ¨ .</p><p>We now introduce some more notation required to describe bounds on the variance of </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">AE ¾ ¢ ¾´½ ½ AE µ ¾ ½ £ AE Var ´¨µ AE ¾ ¾ ¾ ¡ (5)</formula><p>The proof is deferred to the appendix. We now interpret this result. Consider the lower bound first. When is small compared to AE (which one expects to be the normal situation) and AE is large, the lower bound on the variance of ¨is equivalent to AE ¾ . Thus, the standard deviation Ô</p><p>Var´¨µ of the estimate is at least of the order of its mean, that is AE . As for the upper bound, it is then of order AE ¾ ¾ ¾ . Provided ¾ is of order 1, this matches the order of the lower bound, and the estimate ¨has a standard deviation precisely of the order of its mean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">The role of graph expansion</head><p>To illustrate this further, introduce the notation</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Á ´ µ Ò Ë Ë AE ¾ ´Ë Ëµ Ë</formula><p>where ´Ë Ëµ denotes the number of edges in the graph between the set of nodes Ë, and the complementary set Ë. The constant Á ´ µ is known as the isoperimetric constant of the graph, or also as its conductance; see e.g. Mohar <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for further discussion. The so-called Cheeger inequality (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>) states that the spectral gap ¾ of the graph verifies</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">¾ Á ´ µ ¾ ¾¡´ µ</formula><p>where ¡´ µ is the maximal degree of nodes in the graph.</p><p>Combined with (5), Cheeger's inequality entails that</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Var ´¨µ AE ¾ ¡´ µ Á ´ µ ¾ AE ¾ ¾¡´ µ Á ´ µ ¾<label>(6)</label></formula><p>This illustrates how the ratio ¡´ µ Á ´ µ controls the quality of the estimator ¨. The conductance parameter Á is sometimes called the expansion parameter of a graph, and graphs with large Á are referred to as expanders. The reader can find additional material on expanders in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>,</p><p>or <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Several overlay architectures proposed in the literature ensure good expansion properties by design: the expansion parameter Á is bounded away from 0.</p><p>In particular, overlays comprising sufficiently many "random" edges have large expansion parameter. It is shown for instance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Theorem 5.4, that Erdős-Rényi graphs on AE nodes with average degree such that ÐÓ ´AE µ have an expansion of ¾. It is also</p><p>shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> that, if each node chooses Ñ ¾ other nodes uniformly at random as its neighbours in the overlay, then the resulting graph has expansion at least Ñ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Complexity/Accuracy trade-off</head><p>We measure the complexity of a single Random Tour by the number of (discrete-time) steps taken by the random walk during that tour, that is Ì with the above notation. Thus, in view of ( </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">È´ ¨ AE AE ¯µ VarAE ¾ ¯¾ ¡</formula><p>If we can tolerate a relative error greater than ¯with probability of Ô for some Ô ¾ ´¼ ½µ, then in view of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and the previous display it suffices to take</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">¾¡´ µ ¯Á ´ µ ¾ ½ Ô ¡</formula><p>Assuming for concreteness Ô ½¼± is fixed, and the graph is regular, that is all its nodes have degree , then for runs we get on average a cost of AE, and we can guarantee a relative error of</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">¯ ¾ Á ´ µ ½ Ô Ô</formula><p>Thus the cost is linear in AE , and an extra cost factor of buys a reduction in relative error of order ½ Ô .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Sample&amp;Collide method</head><p>In this section we present an algorithm which is based on, and improves upon a technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This technique essentially relies on sampling uniformly at random from the peer population. It then uses such random samples to produce an estimate of system size, based on how many random samples are required before two samples return the same peer.</p><p>We improve the proposal of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Ì • Ð Ó Í µ ). If Ì ¼,</formula><p>then this node is the sampled node; it returns its ID to the initiator, and the procedure stops. Otherwise, it forwards the message with the updated timer to one of its neighbors, chosen uniformly at random.</p><p>This procedure returns a random node sample, the distribution of which is exactly that of the state of the standard CTRW at time Ì , started from node . This follows from the well-known fact that ÐÓ ´Í µ has a unit mean exponential distribution. See Ross <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and in particular the inverse function method for random numbers generation, for a proof.</p><p>A convenient measure of accuracy of the proposed sampling technique is provided by the variation distance between the probability distribution of the returned sample, and the target uniform probability distribution. Recall that the variation distance between two measures </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Estimation procedure</head><p>The technique we use is as follows. We pick an integer ¼, which will determine the accuracy of our estimates. We then obtain node samples ´½µ ´Òµ.</p><p>Denote by ½ the first time Ò when a sample ´Òµ is obtained which has already been seen (the first collision), i.e., for some Ñ Ò , ´Ñµ ´Òµ. Likewise, denote by ¾ the second time Ò when the corresponding sample ´Òµ has previously been observed, and define similarly for ½. We shall stop sampling at Ò , that is, when exactly newly obtained samples have previously been observed, where is a fixed control parameter.</p><p>For a given AE , we denote by Ä AE ´Ò½ Ò µ the probability that ½ Ò ½ Ò .

This implies that is a sufficient statistic for the estimation of AE : all the information about the unknown parameter AE that is carried by the observations ½ is contained in the variable . Or to put it another way, given , the other 's don't contain any additional information about AE .</p><p>Hence, the best estimator (for any performance measure) based on ½ is a function of only.</p><p>Our approach to estimating AE will be to use the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>We first describe the setting of the experiments. We then report results on the accuracy and cost of the two methods in a static environment, and finally consider dynamic environments with both gradual and abrupt changes in system sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Setup and evaluation criteria</head><p>Our experiments are simulation-based. We consider overlay networks of exactly 100,000 nodes in the static case, and comprising between 50,000 and 150,000 nodes in the dynamic case. We consider two classes of topologies in the evaluation, which we refer to as balanced and scale-free random graphs.</p><p>Overlays of the first type (balanced random graphs) are generated so as to guarantee node degrees lying between 1 and 10, in the following manner. Sequentially, each node selects a random number ÓÙØ between 1 and 10. It then selects ÓÙØ target nodes at random, among target nodes with a current degree less than 10. Then ÓÙØ undirected edges are created between node and its ÓÙØ targets, whose degree is increased by 1 at this stage. The resulting average degree is between 7 and 8.</p><p>From the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we expect such graphs to have large expansion, hence a favourable situation for our two techniques. Existing overlay maintenance protocols aim to maintain graphs with similar statistical properties; see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In scale-free networks on the other hand, the node degree distribution follows a power law; there is evidence that the Internet and the World-Wide-Web have this property. We generate random scale-free graphs using the preferential attachment scheme of Barabási and</p><p>Albert <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Here, each new node added to the network chooses its links prefentially targeting high-degree nodes.</p><p>The result is a random graph in which the probability that a node has neighbors decays like ¿ . Thus, node degrees are much more variable than in the balanced random graph model.</p><p>In the dynamic scenarios, newly incorporated nodes are connected via their own set of random targets, chosen according to the rule for the corresponding model. Nodes to be removed are selected uniformly at random, and the remaining nodes that lose neighbors do not search for new ones. The actual system size we report is always that of the connected component to which the probing node belongs.</p><p>We evaluate our algorithms for estimating system size on the following metrics. Accuracy relates to the relative error in the system size estimate and is clearly a basic criterion. It can be improved by taking more measurements.</p><p>So there is a tradeoff with the Overhead, specified as the number of messages required to obtain the system size estimate. Depending on the application, a quick approximate estimate could be preferable to a more accurate one which would take much longer to compute, and create more overhead. This could also be the case when churn is high, causing the system size to change rapidly. In that case, Reactivity to changes is an important characteristic of the algorithms. To evalutate this, we compute the time to react to a growth or increase in the number of peers in the system.</p></div>

The size of the sliding window conditions both the accuracy, with a variance estimate proportional to the reciprocal of the window size, and the reactivity of the estimates, which are less reactive to changes for larger windows. For S²C with ½¼¼, we choose not to average, i.e. take a sliding window of size 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Random Tour</head><p>The performance of RT is illustrated on a shrinking network (gradual decrease scenario) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, on a growing network (gradual increase scenario) in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>, and on a network with catastrophic failures and flash crowd arrivals in Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>. A sliding window of 700 samples is used in all three cases. The key observation to make from these figures is the following. The overlay structure can be drastically affected by population changes; in particular, node departures may reduce the expansion parameter of the initial overlay, which would lead to a poorer accuracy of the RT estimators. Nevertheless, in all three scenarios, we observe that RT maintains a constant accuracy level throughout the changes in system size. In summary, RT is robust to changes in system sizes.</p><p>We also note, particularly in Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>, an increased convergence time of the estimate due to the averaging sliding window; obviously, the smaller the window, the faster the convergence time but the higher the estimator variance. We should mention at this stage that in the simulations reported here, we did not allow a departing node to leave the system with the probing message. Such a situation may however arise in practice, for instance due to node crash or improper departure from the overlay.</p><p>One way of handling such message loss at the node initiating the measurement is to declare a probing mes-sage to be lost if it has not been recovered in a given duration since its launch. The corresponding timeout parameter needs to be sufficiently large so that only few Random Tour packets time out while the corresponding message is not lost, and still traveling through the system. One could for instance set this time-out to the aver- A similar solution could be applied to protect the sampling procedure used in S²C against packet losses; now the trip time is the time till the walk stops, rather than the time till the walker returns to the originator.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We addressed the issue of estimating the size of largescale peer-to-peer overlay networks. We proposed two peer counting approaches based on random walks. More generally, these approaches may be used to count the number of peers with given characteristics or to estimate aggregate statistics. This is useful for basic overlay maintenance, and we expect it to be useful as well for applications such as live media streaming.</p><p>The Random Tour method aggregates local node statistics along a "random tour", that is a random walk stopped when it returns to its starting node. It is simple to implement, and is suitable for small to moderate systems. Its cost scales linearly with system size, like several other proposals we reviewed, such as gossip or random polling.</p><p>It does not incur the ACK implosion problem that random polling techniques face. We analysed the properties of the Random Tour estimator, and showed that it is unbiased, and how its standard deviation is controlled by the expansion parameter of the overlay.</p><p>The Sample&amp;Collide method requires random samples of peers. We proposed a peer sampling algorithm based on a Continuous Time Random Walk and showed that it produces asymptotically uniform samples, in contrast to previous proposals which were biased towards high degree nodes. We showed that its cost for a specified accuracy is characterised again by the expansion parameter of the overlay. We constructed a system size estimate based on the number of samples required to observe duplicated samples. We analysed in detail the asymptotic properties of this estimate, and showed that it makes the most efficient use of the information in the samples, by achieving the smallest possible variance. To our knowledge this achieves the best cost / accuracy trade-off of proposals to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, with a cost scaling like the square root of the system size, and the square root of the required accuracy (measured in reciprocal of relative variance). It is therefore a suitable candidate for large scale environments. Random Tour can still be attractive in moderately large systems, when one is interested in measuring aggregates of node properties rather than just system size.</p><p>Finally we evaluated our two schemes via simulations, in both static and dynamic environments. The simulation results confirmed the theoretical analysis of the two schemes. We found that both were robust to system changes, both gradual and sudden.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>final term is finite and independent of AE , which implies the announced uniform integrability.</figDesc></figure>
