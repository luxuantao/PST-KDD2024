<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The problem of distributed formation control for multiple quadrotor aircraft in the form of leader-follower structure is considered in this paper.

The designed formation control law for position systems will generate the desired attitude for the attitude control systems. Second, for the attitude control subsystem described by unit quaternion, by employing the technique of finite-time control and switch control, a global bounded finite-time attitude tracking controller is designed such that the desired attitude can be tracked by the multiple quadrotor aircraft in finite time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A S A TYPICAL application of consensus/synchronization of complex network, the formation control problem of multiple quadrotor aircraft has got much attention from many research communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Due to the fact that the quadrotor aircraft has many special superiorities (e.g., small size, simple structure, rapid maneuverability, and vertical take offlanding), it is often used to perform a complex task in some dangerous environments, such as disaster monitoring, wilderness search and rescue, among many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This paper will consider the formation control problem for a group of quadrotor aircraft by using the consensus theory of complex network or multiagent systems.</p><p>Compared with a single quadrotor aircraft, the advantages of formation control of multiple quadrotor aircraft lie in the following aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. First, the total carrying capacity of aircraft can be improved which means that more devices or sensors can be equipped such that more difficult tasks can be achieved. Furthermore, the system stability and reliability can also be improved through the exchange of information among multiple aircraft. As both the control problem of a single quadrotor and the cooperative control problem among multiple quadrotor aircraft should be addressed, the formation controller design and stability analysis of formation achieving for multiple quadrotor aircraft will be much more difficult than controlling a single quadrotor aircraft.</p><p>Up to now, in order to achieve formation control of multiple quadrotor aircraft, a variety of control strategies have been proposed by researchers from various fields. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, an integral sliding mode control method was employed to design the controller for a quadrotor aircraft, where its application to formation control was also studied. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a leader-following formation control strategy was proposed and analyzed. Based on the optimal control design method, a formation control algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to achieve the desired formation behaviors of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a behavior-based formation control algorithm was proposed and employed. Based on a virtual structure, a two-levels formation control algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for autonomous formations in 3-D. Based on a coordination architecture, the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> designed a formation controller for multiple spacecraft. To achieve collision avoidance, the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> constructed a distributed coordination controller by employing a bounded control technique for a group of quadrotor aircraft.</p><p>2168-2267 c 2017 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.</p><p>See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.</p><p>Although many results about formation control of multiple quadrotor aircraft have been reported in existing literature, how to improve the control performance is still faced with certain challenge due to the inherent high-dimensional dynamics, nonlinear coupling among neighboring aircraft, etc. To this end and partly motivated by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, this paper will employ a nonsmooth consensus algorithm (protocol) to design a formation control algorithm for multiple quadrotor aircraft. It is worth noting that the nonsmooth controller itself is of interest as it can offer faster convergence speed and better ability of disturbance rejection compared with traditional smooth controllers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, within the context of formation control of multiple quadrotor aircraft, many difficulties of using nonsmooth control approach arise from the system's high nonlinear features. To conquer the difficulties, a nonsmooth backstepping method is proposed by skillfully exploiting the structural features of quadrotor model. Specifically, for the outer-loop, i.e., position control subsystem, the aircraft's attitude is taken as a virtual control signal based on the backstepping control approach. By using the design method of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control, a consensus formation control algorithm is proposed such that the multiple quadrotor aircraft asymptotically come into formation pattern and track the leader's trajectory. Then, for the inner-loop, i.e., attitude control subsystem, based on finite-time control technique, a finite-time attitude tracking control law is developed. By carefully choosing Lyapunov function, it is shown that the aircraft's attitude can converge to the desired attitude in finite time. Note that the inner-outerloop control strategy is one of the widely employed control methods for quadrotor aircraft, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Under this kind of controllers, stability analysis of the closed-loop system is often performed based on backstepping control theory. Compared with the traditional backstepping-type controllers, the proposed nonsmooth controller-based backstepping design has the following advantages: 1) the controller is easy to construct and the subsequent stability analysis is relatively simple and 2) the convergence speed and disturbance rejection property for the attitude-loop can be enhanced by adjusting the additional parameters, i.e., the fractional powers.</p><p>The organization of this paper is given as follows. The mathematical model of multiple quadrotor aircraft and some preliminaries are provided in Section II. In Section III, the formation controller and attitude controller are, respectively, designed and utilized. In Section IV, the numerical simulation results are presented for illustration. At last, Section V concludes the whole work.</p></div>
