<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Modern probability theory, whose foundation is based on the axioms set forth by Kolmogorov, is currently the major tool for performance analysis in stochastic systems. While it offers insights in understanding such systems, probability theory, in contrast to optimization, has not been developed with computational tractability as an objective when the dimension increases. Correspondingly, some of its major areas of application remain unsolved when the underlying systems become multidimensional: Queueing networks, auction design in multi-item, multi-bidder auctions, network information theory, pricing multi-dimensional options, among others. We propose a new approach to analyze stochastic systems based on robust optimization. The key idea is to replace the Kolmogorov axioms and the concept of random variables as primitives of probability theory, with uncertainty sets that are derived from some of the asymptotic implications of probability theory like the central limit theorem. In addition, we observe that several desired system properties such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality in auction design are naturally expressed in the language of robust optimization. In this way, the performance analysis questions become highly structured optimization problems (linear, semidefinite, mixed integer) for which there exist efficient, practical algorithms that are capable of solving problems in high dimensions. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves computationally tractable methods for (a) analyzing queueing networks, (b) designing multi-item, multi-bidder auctions with budget constraints, and (c) pricing multi-dimensional options.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Probability theory has a long and distinguished history that dates back to the beginning of the seventeenth century. Games involving randomness led to an exchange of letters between Pascal and Fermat in which the fundamental principles of probability theory were formulated for the first time. The Dutch scientist Huygens, learned of this correspondence and in 1657 published the first book on probability entitled De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae. In 1812 Laplace introduced a host of new ideas and mathematical techniques in his book Theorie Analytique des Probabilities. Laplace applied probabilistic ideas to many scientific and practical problems. The theory of errors, actuarial mathematics, and statistical mechanics are examples of some of the important applications of probability theory developed in the nineteenth century. Many researchers have contributed to the theory since Laplace's time; among the most important are Chebyshev, Markov, von Mises, and Kolmogorov.</p><p>One of the difficulties in developing a mathematical theory of probability has been the need to arrive at a definition of probability that is precise enough for use in mathematics, yet comprehensive enough to be applicable to a wide range of phenomena. The search for a widely acceptable definition took nearly three centuries. The matter was finally resolved in the 1933 monograph of Kolmogorov who outlined an axiomatic approach that forms the basis for the modern theory. With the publication in 1933 of Kolmogorov's book Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, Kolmogorov laid the foundations of an abstract theory, designed to be used as a mathematical model for certain classes of observable events. The fundamental concept of the theory is the concept of a probability space (Ω, A, P), where Ω is a space of points ω which are denoted as elementary events, while A is a σ -algebra of sets in Ω, and P is a probability measure defined for all A-measurable events, i.e., for all sets S belonging to A. Kolmogorov's three axioms form the basis of this theory 1. P(S) ≥ 0, ∀S ∈ A. 2. P(Ω) = 1. 3. If S i ∈ A, i ≥ 1, are pairwise disjoint, then P(∪ ∞ i=1 S i ) = ∞ i=1 P(S i ). Another important primitive of probability theory is the notion of a random variable as a quantity that takes values with certain probabilities. A key objective of probability theory is to estimate the probability distributions of a random variable Y , which is a function of n primitive random variables X 1 , . . . , X n , that is Y = f (X 1 , . . . , X n ), given information on the joint probability distribution of the primitive random variables X 1 , . . . , X n . For example, suppose that we are given n independent, random variables X i uniformly distributed in [0, 1], and we are interested in evaluating the distribution the random variable Y = n i=1 X i . Specifically, we are interested in the quantity P(Y ≤ t), 0 ≤ t ≤ n. Even for a modest value of n = 10, this is a complex calculation involving convolutions. Perhaps the simplest way to calculate the Laplace transform of Y , which is the product (because of independence) of the Laplace transforms of the X i 's and then numerically invert the transform. Note that in order to estimate a probability of a relative simple event, we need to invoke rather heavy machinery from complex analysis and inverse of transforms.</p><p>The situation we described is not an isolated instance. Consider a single class queueing network (see Sect. 3), that has been used in the latter part of the twentieth century to model computer and communication networks. Suppose we are interested in the expected value of the number of jobs waiting in one of the queues in the network. If the distribution of interarrival and service times is not exponential, we do not know how to calculate this expectation exactly, and two avenues available to make progress are simulation and approximation. Simulation can take a considerable amount of time in order for the results to be statistically significant, and in addition, if the simulation model is complex as it is often the case, then it is difficult to isolate and understand the key insights in the model.</p><p>On the other hand, approximation methods can potentially lead to results that are not very close to the true answers. Given these considerations, it is fair to say that after more than 50 years of research we really do not have a satisfactory answer to the problem of performance analysis of queueing networks. J.F.C. Kingman, one of the pioneers of queueing theory in the twentieth century in his opening lecture at the conference entitled "100 Years of Queueing-The Erlang Centennial" <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, writes, "If a queue has an arrival process which cannot be well modeled by a Poisson process or one of its near relatives, it is likely to be difficult to fit any simple model, still less to analyze it effectively. So why do we insist on regarding the arrival times as random variables, quantities about which we can make sensible probabilistic statements? Would it not be better to accept that the arrivals form an irregular sequence, and carry out our calculations without positing a joint probability distribution over which that sequence can be averaged?".</p><p>The situation in queueing networks we discussed above is present in other examples. Shannon <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> characterized the capacity region and designed optimal coding and decoding methods in single-sender, single-receiver channels, but the extension to multi-sender, multi receiver channels with interference is by and large open. Myerson <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, in his Nobel Prize winning work, solved the problem of optimal market design in single item auctions, but the extension to multi-item case with bidders that have budget constraints has remained open. Black and Scholes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, in their Nobel Prize winning work, solved the problem of pricing an option in an underlying security, but the extension to multiple securities with market frictions has not been resolved. In all of these and other problems, we see that we can solve the underlying problem in low dimensional problems, but we have been unable to solve the underlying problems when the dimension increases.</p><p>In our opinion, the reason for this is related to the history of probability theory as a scientific field. The multi-century effort that led to the development of modern probability theory aimed to lay the conceptual and foundational basis of the field. The primitives of probability theory, the Kolmogorov axioms and the notion of a random variable, while powerful for modeling purposes, have not been developed with computational tractability as an objective when the dimension increases. In contrast, consider the development of optimization as a scientific field in the second part of the 123 twentieth century. From its early years (Dantzig <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>), modern optimization has had as an objective to solve multi-dimensional problems efficiently from a practical point of view. The notion of efficiency used, however, is not the same as theoretical efficiency (polynomial time solvability) developed in the 1970s ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>). The Simplex method, for instance, has proven over many decades to be practically efficient, but not theoretically efficient. It is exactly this notion of practical efficiency we use in this work: it is the ability to solve problems of realistic size relative to the application we address. For example, queueing networks with hundreds of nodes, auctions with hundreds of items and bidders with budget constraints, network information theory with hundreds of thousands of codewords, and option pricing problems with hundreds of securities.</p><p>Given the success of optimization to solve multi-dimensional problems, it is natural, in our opinion, to formulate probability problems as optimization problems. For this purpose, we utilize robust optimization, arguably one of the fastest growing areas of optimization in the last decade, to accomplish this. In this effort, we are guided by the words of Dantzig <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, who in the opening sentence of his book Linear Programming and Extensions writes "The final test of any theory is its capacity to solve the problems which originated it." In this respect, we report in this paper our progress to date in the three areas that originated the need to develop the proposed theory: The research program surveyed here aims to develop a tractable theory for analyzing stochastic systems in high dimensions via robust optimization. In addition to the applications covered here, we have applied this approach to:</p><p>(a) Network Information theory (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>), where we present a robust optimization based framework to formulate and solve the central problem of characterizing the capacity region and constructing matching optimal codes for multi-user channels with interference. In particular, we solve the open problems of characterizing the capacity regions of the multi-user Gaussian interference channel, the multicast and the multi-access Gaussian channels and construct matching optimal codes by solving semidefinite optimization problems with rank one constraints. (b) Transient Analysis of queueing networks (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>), where we concentrate on the transient analysis of single class queues, and feed-forward networks, and derive closed form expressions for the transient behavior of such systems. (c) Analysis of Multi-class queueing networks (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>), under various scheduling policies (FCFS and priority based).</p><p>Given the broad spectrum of applications we cover, our aim is to introduce the key concepts and algorithms, and provide the main theoretical and empirical evidence that illustrates the strength of the method. We do not provide all the mathematical proofs but give reference to our specific papers that give more details. In the next section, we outline the building blocks of the proposed approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The building blocks of our approach</head><p>One of the major successes of probability theory is the development of limit laws. As an illustration consider the central limit theorem that asserts that if X i , i = 1, . . . , n are independent, identically distributed random variables with mean μ and standard deviation σ , then as n → ∞, the random variable S n = n i=1 X i is asymptotically distributed as a standard normal, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">lim n→∞ P S n -nμ σ √ n ≤ t = P (Z ≤ t) ,</formula><p>where Z ∼ N (0, 1). The importance of the limit laws in the theory of probability can be emphasized by quoting Kolmogorov <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>: "All epistemological value of the theory of probability is based on this: that large scale random phenomena in their collective action create strict, non random regularity."</p><p>The key building block in our approach is that rather than assuming as primitives the axioms of probability theory (Kolmogorov axioms and the notion of a random variable), we assume as primitives the conclusions of probability theory, namely its limit laws. Let us give a motivating example. From the central limit theorem (S n -nμ)/σ √ n is asymptotically standard normal. We know that a standard normal Z satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(|Z | ≤ 2) ≈ 0.95, P(|Z | ≤ 3) ≈ 0.99.</formula><p>We therefore assume that the quantities X i take values such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">n i=1 X i -nμ ≤ Γ σ √ n,</formula><p>where Γ is a small numerical constant 2 or 3 that is selected adaptively to make a good fit empirically. In other words, we do not describe the uncertain quantities X i as random variables, rather they take values in an uncertainty set</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">U = (X 1 , . . . , X n ) n i=1 X i -nμ ≤ Γ σ √ n . (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>In specific situations we can augment the uncertainty set U by using additional asymptotic laws as we illustrate in Sect. 2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The connection with optimization</head><p>Suppose we are interested in estimating/analyzing E[ f (X 1 , . . . , X n )], where (X 1 , . . . , X n ) are random variables. Using asymptotic laws of probability, we construct an uncertainty set U. We have already seen an example in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Then, we estimate E[ f (X 1 , . . . , X n )] by solving the constrained optimization problems</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">max f (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) min f (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) s.t.

(x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) ∈ U,</formula><p>In other words, we transform the performance analysis question to a constrained optimization problem, arguably a problem we can solve efficiently in high dimensions, and we use the asymptotic laws of probability theory, arguably the most insightful aspect of probability theory, to construct the constrained set in the optimization problem. Suppose that we are interested in a design problem involving design parameters θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ n ) and uncertain parameters x = (x 1 , . . . , x n ) ∈ U and we are interested in solving the problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">max θ E[ f (x, θ )].</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">)<label>2</label></formula><p>Problems like (2) have been studied in the literature of Stochastic Programming that started with the work of Dantzig <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and continues to be strong to this date. For a more comprehensive review of Stochastic Programming, we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In the Robust Optimization (RO) paradigm, we model the uncertainty of the parameters x by the uncertainty set U where the parameters x take values and solve the optimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">max θ min x∈U f (x, θ ).</formula><p>(</p><p>RO is one of the fastest growing areas of optimization in the last decade. It addresses the problem of optimization under uncertainty, in which the uncertainty model is not stochastic, but rather deterministic and set-based. RO models are typically tractable computationally. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, proposed linear optimization models with ellipsoidal uncertainty sets, whose robust counterparts correspond to conic quadratic optimization problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> proposed RO models with polyhedral uncertainty sets that can model linear/integer variables, and whose robust counterparts correspond to linear/integer optimization models. For a more thorough review we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Within the interface of Robust Optimization and Stochastic Programming, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref> (pp 27-60), <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> propose alternative tractable approaches to model chance constrained problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Performance analysis of queueing networks</head><p>The origin of queueing theory dates back to the beginning of the twentieth century, when Erlang <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> published his fundamental paper on congestion in telephone traffic.</p><p>In addition to formulating and solving several practical problems arising in telephony, Erlang laid the foundations for queueing theory in terms of the nature of assumptions and techniques of analysis that are being used to this day. In the second part of the twentieth century, a very substantial literature of queueing theory was developed modeling queueing primitives as renewal processes.</p><p>From the time of Erlang, the Poisson process has played a very significant role in modeling the arrival process of a queue. When combined with exponentially distributed service times, the resulting M/M/m queue with m servers is tractable to analyze in steady-sate. While exponentiality leads to a tractable theory, assuming general distributions, on the other hand, yields considerable difficulty with respect to performing a near-exact analysis of the system. The G I /G I /m queue with independent and generally distributed arrivals and services is by and large intractable. Currently, there does not exist a method that is capable of producing accurate numerical answers, let alone closed form expressions, for arbitrary distributions.</p><p>The situation becomes even more challenging if one considers analyzing the performance of queueing networks. A key result that allows generalizations to networks of queues is Burke's theorem (Burke <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>) which states that the departure process from an M/M/m queue is Poisson. This property allows one to analyze queueing networks and leads to product form solutions as in Jackson <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. However, when the queueing system is not M/M/m, the departure process is no longer a renewal process, i.e., the interdeparture times are dependent. With the departure process lacking the renewal property, the state-of-the-art theory provides no means to determine performance measures exactly, even for a simple network with queues in tandem. The two avenues in such cases are simulation and approximation. Simulation can take a considerable amount of time in order for the results to be statistically significant. In addition, simulation models are often complex, which makes it difficult to isolate and understand key qualitative insights. On the other hand, approximation methods can potentially lead to results that are not very close to the true answers.</p><p>Given these challenges, it is fair to say that the key problem of performance analysis of queueing networks has remained open under the probabilistic framework. Our objective in this section, is to analyze queueing networks by replacing the primitives of stochastic processes with uncertainty sets. In this section, we summarize the results of Bandi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for single class queueing networks. Extensions to multiclass queueing networks are contained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>

In this sense, both approaches lead to the same qualitative insights. (b) Heavy-tailed behavior: During the past decade, studies have shown the heavytailed behavior of internet traffic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>). The absence of closed form expressions for queueing systems with heavy tail behavior has made it difficult to make progress in the area of communication networks scheduling. Using our approach, we are able to provide closed form expressions for the waiting times [Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_38">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_40">16</ref>)], which to the best of our knowledge, are not available under stochastic heavy-tailed assumptions on arrivals and services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Analysis of single class queueing networks</head><p>In this section, we analyze single class queueing networks in our framework. Consider a network of J queues serving a single class of customers. Each customer enters the network through some queue j, and either leaves the network or departs towards another queue right after completion of his service. In order the analyze the waiting time in a particular queue j in the network, we need to characterize the overall arrival process to queue j and then apply Theorem 2. The arrival process in queue j is the superposition of different processes, each of which is either a process from the outside world, or a departure process from another queue, or a thinning of a departure process from another queue, or a thinning of an external arrival process. Correspondingly, in order to analyze the network, we need to characterize the effect that the following operations have on the arrival process:</p><p>(a) Passing through a queue: Under this operation, we characterize the departure process {D i } i≥1 when an arrival process {T i } i≥1 ∈ U a passes through a queue.</p><p>We show that the interdeparture times belong to an uncertainty set that has the same form as the uncertainty set for the interarrival times. This is the generalization of Burke's theorem (Burke <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>) for an M/M/m queue. This is a significant advantage of our approach compared to modeling queues with arrival processes from a renewal process. While, the departure process satisfies the same properties as the arrival process under our framework, in traditional queueing networks the departure process fails to be a renewal process.</p><p>(b) Superposition of arrival processes: Under this operation, m arrival processes {T j i } i≥1 ∈ U a j , j = 1, . . . , m combine to form a single arrival process. Proposition 2 characterizes the uncertainty set of the combined arrival process. (c) Thinning of a process with probability p: Under this operation, an arrival from a given arrival process is classified as type I with probability p and type II with probability 1p. In Proposition 3, we characterize the uncertainty set of the resulting thinned type I process.</p></div>

We observe that (a) The percentage errors are slightly higher for multi-server networks compared to single-server networks. (b) The performance of RQNA is generally stable with an increased degree of feedback with errors below 6.2 %. (c) RQNA is fairly insensitive to network size with a very slight increase in percent errors between 10-node and 30-node networks. (d) RQNA presents slightly improved results for lower traffic intensity levels. It is nevertheless fairly stable with respect to higher traffic intensity levels.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Optimal mechanism design for multi-item auctions</head><p>The optimal design of auctions is a central problem in Economics which arises when an auctioneer is interested in selling multiple items to multiple buyers with private valuations for the items. The auctioneer is faced with the task of designing the rules of the auction so as to maximize revenue, while also incentivizing the buyers to reveal their true valuations when they participate in the auction. Building on the work of Vickrey <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, Myerson <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> considers the optimal auction design problem for the sale of a single item to buyers with unlimited budgets. He considers this problem in a probabilistic setting, that is, he assumes that the buyers' valuations are drawn from independent, but not necessarily identical, probability distributions. These distributions are assumed to be common knowledge, so that all buyers and the auctioneer know the distribution from which each buyer's valuation is drawn. He obtains a characterization of the optimal solution as a second price auction with buyer dependent reservation prices, which for the special case of identical buyers, reduces to that of a second price auction with a single reservation price.</p><p>In the past decade, auction theory has also attracted the attention of researchers in Theoretical Computer Science. In what follows, we present a brief review of the relevant literature around the predominant modeling paradigms mentioned earlier. For a more comprehensive review, we refer the readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref> for the Economics and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> for the Computer Science perspective, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The probabilistic approach</head><p>This approach has been widely studied (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>). The key primitive assumptions are:</p><p>(a) Buyers' valuations are sampled from a joint probability distribution; (b) The auctioneer has exact knowledge of this joint distribution; (c) The auctioneer is risk neutral and seeks to obtain a mechanism in order to maximize the expected revenue.</p><p>In this setting, we divide the literature based on the problem that was solved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public budget constraints (Problem P1):</head><p>The analysis of budget constrained auctions was first done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, where they assume that all buyers have the same common knowledge budget constraint and derive the subsidy-free (i.e., payments are non-negative) optimal auction. Under the same assumption of equal budgets, Maskin <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> obtained the optimal auction that maximizes social surplus. Malakhov and Vohra <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> relaxed the assumption of symmetrical budgets and obtained the revenue maximizing auction for the case of two buyers, only one of whom is budget constrained. Chawla et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> obtained the first approximation algorithm for the general problem where they show that a sequential all-pay mechanism is a 4-approximation to the revenue of the optimal truthful mechanism with a discrete valuation space for each bidder. They also show that a sequential posted price mechanism is an O(1)-approximation to the revenue of the optimal truthful mechanism, when the valuation space of each bidder is a product distribution that satisfies the standard hazard rate condition. Dobzinski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> shows that an adaptive version of the "clinching auction" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) is Paretooptimal and incentive compatible. Moreover, they show that it is the unique auction with these properties, when there are exactly two bidders. The more general problem, however, remains open in the setting of public budget constraints under probabilistic assumptions.</p><p>Private budget constraints (Problem P2): Dobzinski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> show that there is no incentive compatible, individual rational and Pareto-optimal deterministic auction, for any finite number m &gt; 1 of units of a single indivisible good and any n &gt; 2 players, when the budgets are private. In the same setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> showed that it is impossible to design a non-trivial truthful auction which allocates all units. Instead they provide the design of an asymptotically revenue-maximizing truthful mechanism which may allocate only some of the units. Furthermore, Pai and Vohra <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> shows several interesting qualitative properties of such auctions by discretizing the valuation space and formulating a linear optimization problem, whose dimension is exponential in the number of buyers. Based on these results, there is a need to consider other notions of optimality in order to obtain computationally tractable auction mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlated valuations (Problem P3):</head><p>For the case of correlated buyers which was left open by Myerson <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, some of the early work was done by Cremer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> who solved it in a weak sense, that is, using auctions that are individually rational only in expectation. However, the computational complexity of designing the optimal ex-post individually rational auction for correlated valuations has been open until recently, when <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> obtained a polynomial time algorithm for the two buyer case and established an inapproximability result for three or more buyers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The adversarial approach</head><p>The objective in the adversarial approach is to identify a single mechanism that always has good performance, e.g., under any distributional assumption. There have been broadly three approaches that have been used so far:</p><p>(a) The resource augmentation approach, also known as, the bicriteria approach which was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, is based on the observation that in some cases increasing competition, e.g., by recruiting more agents, and running the second price auction mechanism increases revenue when compared to running the (optimal) Myerson mechanism in the original setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b)</head><p>The main idea in the average-case approach is to show that, for a large class of distributions and settings, there is a single mechanism that approximates the revenue of the Bayesian optimal mechanism. For example, when the probability distribution is known, the second price auction mechanism with a particular way (the so-called monopoly reservation price) of calculating the reservation prices is approximately optimal by a constant factor (of 2). Dhangwatnotai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> relaxes the need to know the probability distribution of the valuation and uses a sampling-based approach to calculate the reservation price. For the case of correlated buyers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> proposed a mechanism for the correlated case that achieves half of the optimum revenue. (c) The worst-case approach, where the idea is to define an appropriate performance benchmark and attempt to obtain mechanisms that approximate this benchmark on any worst-case valuation vector. Goldberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, in a negative result, showed that when the adversary knows all of the buyers' valuations exactly, then no incentive compatible auction can obtain more than a vanishingly small fraction of its revenue in the worst case. Under this approach, it is desirable to identify the right kind of performance benchmarks, but this problem is still open.</p><p>All the aforementioned results have been for the cases of buyers without budget constraints and, except for the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, they all assume independent valuations. Thus, Problems (P1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">P3</ref>) are open under the adversarial approach.</p><p>In what follows, we revisit the auction design problem for multi-item auctions with budget constrained buyers by using a robust optimization approach to model (a) concepts such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality that are naturally expressed in the language of robust optimization and (b) the auctioneer's beliefs on the buyers' valuations of the items. In this setting, we provide a characterization of the optimal solution as an auction with reservation prices, thus extending the work of Myerson <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> from single item without budget constraints, to multiple items with budgets, potentially correlated valuations and uncertain budgets. We report computational evidence that suggests the proposed approach (a) is numerically tractable for large scale auction design problems, (b) leads to improved revenue compared to the classical probabilistic approach when the true distributions are different from the assumed ones, and (c) leads to higher revenue when correlations in the buyers' valuations are explicitly modeled.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of valuations</head><p>We consider a setting where n buyers, indexed by i ∈ N , are interested in a set of m items, indexed by j ∈ M, made available by an auctioneer. Each buyer i ∈ N has a valuation v i j associated with each of the items j ∈ M, which is not known to the auctioneer. Additionally the buyers are also budget constrained with budgets {B 1 , B 2 , . . . , B n }. Before proceeding further, we introduce the following notation.</p><p>For each item j ∈ M, let v j = v 1 j , v 2 j , . . . , v nj ∈ R n be the vector of valuations for the jth item by the n bidders. We let v = (v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v m ) denote the concatenation of the vectors v j , j ∈ M. With a slight abuse of notation, let v i = (v i1 , v i2 , . . . , v im ) be the vector of valuations for the ith bidder for all items. In the same vein, we let v -i, j = v 1 j , . . . , v i-1, j , v i+1, j , . . . , v nj ∈ R n-1 be the vector of valuations of all bidders except i, for item j, ∀ j ∈ M. And let v -i = v -i,1 , . . . , v -i,m ∈ R (n-1)×m be the concatenation of the vectors v -i, j j∈M . Finally, we write v ∈ U to denote v j ∈ U j , j ∈ M.</p><p>For each item j ∈ M, we model the auctioneer's beliefs on valuations for this item using an uncertainty set U j ∈ R n , from which the n dimensional valuation vector v j is derived. We can construct such an uncertainty set in multiple ways, depending on the type of information that we have access to. Specifically, we use the following uncertainty sets, if valuations are (a) i.i.d Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">1</ref>), (b) correlated Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), and (c) normally distributed Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">8</ref>). See Sect. 2 for more discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimization formulation</head><p>We next introduce the concept of worst case optimality and show how the resulting auction design problem can be formulated as a robust linear optimization problem. In this case, the objective is to maximize the worst case revenue over all valuation vectors v lying in an uncertainty set U. We introduce the decision variables x v and p v that represent the allocation and the payment rules, respectively, for all valuation vectors v ∈ U. That is, if the realized valuation vector is v, then we allocate a fraction x v i j of item j to buyer i, and charge a total of p v i to the ith buyer. Note that we do not account for payments of buyer i relative to item j, but only account for the total payment of buyer i.</p><p>The allocation and payment rules should be chosen to satisfy the following properties:</p><p>(a) Individual Rationality (IR) : This property ensures that the buyers do not derive negative utility by participating in the auction when they bid truthfully.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Pricing multi-dimensional options</head><p>The problem of pricing and hedging derivative securities has been one of the most well studied problems in Financial Economics. The most important breakthrough, to this date, has been the celebrated Black and Scholes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Merton <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> option-pricing formula, which is based on the principle of dynamic replication that allows one to look for a portfolio of simpler securities which is self-financing and whose value at the end of the time horizon matches the payoff of the option. Such a portfolio of simpler securities is known as a replicating portfolio, and the value of this portfolio at the beginning is the no-arbitrage price of the option. For example, under the assumption of geometric Brownian motion for price dynamics, Black and Scholes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> shows that a European call-option on a stock can be replicated exactly by a dynamic-hedging strategy involving only stocks and risk-free borrowing and lending. This replication allowed them to give the first closed-form expression for the price of a European Option.</p><p>The Black-Scholes formula, in spite of its popularity, has some well-known deficiencies. Empirically, the model prices appear to differ from market prices in certain systematic ways. These discrepancies are usually ascribed to the strong assumption that the underlying security follows a stationary geometric Brownian motion. Apart from the problems with the price-dynamics, there are other factors that arise mostly due to transaction costs and liquidity issues, that make it intractable for one to look for an exact replicating portfolio. This suggests that we consider the natural trade-off between exactness and tractability and to look for nearly exact replications, which can be found in a tractable manner. Motivated by the inability to exactly replicate different types of options (American style options, among others), <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have proposed the idea of -arbitrage pricing using dynamic programming under which we seek a self-financing dynamic portfolio strategy that most closely approximates the payoff of an option.</p><p>In this section, we summarize the major results of Bandi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and propose to model the underlying price dynamics with uncertainty sets, and then apply robust optimization as opposed to dynamic programming to solve the -arbitrage problem. We use the 1 -norm to measure the error in replication which when combined with polyhedral uncertainty sets results in linear optimization problems. This approach also allows us to easily model transaction costs, very general pricing dynamics, accommodate high dimensional problems that today can only be handled by simulation methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Modeling flexibility</head><p>In this section, we discuss the other main advantage of this framework (other than computational tractability)-modeling flexibility. Apart from the ability to model transaction costs and liquidity effects, which comes from our use of linear optimization as the main tool, we also show how our framework allows us to capture the implied volatility smile, defined below, in an intuitive way. This is achieved by adjusting the parameter Γ in order to account for the risk attitude of the investor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk aversion as an explanation for the implied volatility smile</head><p>As the Black-Scholes model became popular, many people started using the model to calculate the volatilities in the market from the market prices observed. This quantity known as the implied volatility of an option is simply that volatility that makes the model price exactly equal to the observed market price. Each option has a unique implied volatility, and traders started to quote options in terms of implied volatilities. The main reason is that as the underlying asset price changes through the day, the implied volatility does not have to be adjusted as much as the option prices, which change all the time. The implied volatilities started to appear as fundamental quantities associated with an option.</p><p>When the implied volatilities are plotted across strike prices for options with the same time to expiration and on the same underlying stock, it was observed that these plots exhibit smiles or smirks. According to the Black-Scholes formula, the plot should be a flat line because only one volatility parameter governs the underlying stochastic process on which all options are priced. The same holds for European-style options on the U.S. S&amp;P 500 Index, which were flat from the start of their exchange-based trading in April 1986 until the U.S. stock market crash of October 1987. After the crash, however, volatility smiles became skewed; that is, volatility smiles became downward sloping as the strike price increased. Other markets also often exhibit volatility smiles.</p><p>Many explanations have been offered to explain the downward sloping and the U-shaped volatility smiles. As noted by Taylor <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, there is no economic intuition behind many of these explanations. In particular, Taylor critiques the stochastic volatility models and suggests that it does not capture the true dynamics of the smile. We believe that risk attitude of an investor may be a possible explanation for the existence of the smiles. This is supported from the widely noted empirical observation that the phenomenon of volatility smile started appearing after the crash of 1987.</p><p>One of the key features of our pricing methodology is the ability to capture the risk attitude of an option writer, when pricing an option. This is achieved with the help of the parameter Γ which characterizes the uncertainty set that is used for pricing. A lower value for Γ implies that the user is willing to take higher risk by ignoring the variability of stock prices. On the other hand, a higher value of Γ indicates that the user seeks a price that will allow him to replicate the payoff of the option for a larger range of stock prices. Therefore, Γ becomes a natural way to express one's risk aversion.</p><p>In tune with the concept of implied volatility, we define the quantity Implied Coefficient of Risk Aversion Γ implied , as the value of the parameter Γ, which leads to a model price that matches the market price. We observe, from our experiments, 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 K/S Gamma -level of risk aversion Implied Gamma vs K/S -Index Call Quadratic fitting Implied Gamma for various K Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Quadratic nature of coefficients of risk aversion-European simple call and European Index call that Γ implied behaves a lot like the implied volatility. When plotted against the strike prices, it displays a U-shaped behavior and downward sloping. This observation can be explained by simply recalling the meaning of the parameter Γ which stands for the risk aversion of the option writer.</p><p>In particular, we observe, from our experiments, that Γ implied varies in a near-quadratic manner with K . When we model this quadratic dependence, we observed that the vertex of the parabola lies very close to the spot price S 0 . This suggests that as K moves away from S 0 , Γ implied increases indicating the increase of risk aversion of the option writer as K moves away from S 0 .</p><p>In the experiments, we show empirically that a quadratic variation of Γ implied with K /S 0 would be adequate to characterize the risk aversion of an investor towards different strike prices. We use the following function to describe the relationship:</p><formula xml:id="formula_135">Γ (K ) = θ 0 + θ 1 K -S 0 S 0 + θ 2 K -S 0 S 0 2 , θ 2 ≥ 0. (<label>57</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_136">)</formula><p>The quantity (K -S 0 ) /S 0 captures the distance between the strike and the spot price and is also called as moneyness in the literature. We use a quadratic regression model to compute the coefficients {θ 0 , θ 1 , θ 2 } so that the prices obtained using these Γ 's match the market prices of our training set of strikes. We then use the resulting quadratic model Γ (K ) to calculate Γ and input it to yield the price for options with other strike prices (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling transaction costs and other market constraints</head><p>Our framework also has the ability to model transaction costs and other market constraints.

We consider 8 week options with spot S 0 = $90.8, for strike prices in the range $74-$105. We report out of sample results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">11</ref>. In these and other experiments, we have found that the errors between the model and the market prices for the single asset European options, and European style Index options are smaller than the errors obtained in other types of options. In general, when the option type is simpler (e.g. European or Asian) the replication error is small. The largest replication error occurs in the American put option where the price we produce tries to protect the holder against the worst choice for exercising the option, thus adding an additional layer of conservativeness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Concluding remarks</head><p>We revisited some of the major successes of stochastic analysis in the twentieth century. In all these examples, together with considerable success, came challenges when researchers and practitioners desired to generalize the problems studied to multiple dimensions. It is our contention that stochastic analysis, based on the primitives of the Kolmogorov axioms and the concept of random variables was not intended to provide a tool for efficient computation. Rather it was intended to put the theory on a firm ground and give insights on the modeling of stochastic phenomena. In retrospect, given the historical developments and intentions of the originators, the computational challenges that stochastic analysis has faced, when attempting to solve problems in multiple dimensions, should have been anticipated.</p><p>Possibly because the development of modern optimization happened at about the same time as the development of the digital computer, optimization had from its very beginning efficient computation as its intention. Correspondingly, optimization has succeeded remarkably to solve problems in high dimensions. Given its success, it seems natural to us to apply optimization to solve problems of stochastic analysis in multiple dimensions. We also remark that in real world problems, what is available is data. Modeling stochastic phenomena with probability theory is a choice, that is probability distributions are not inherent to the problem. Given the computational difficulties in high dimensions, we feel we should consider alternative, computationally tractable approaches in high dimensions. We have proposed such an approach in this paper.</p><p>In all three examples we addressed in this paper, as well as others reported elsewhere ([2,5,7]), we have implemented the proposed approach and have included in the paper tables and figures with computational evidence in concrete examples in order to show that the approach of stochastic analysis based on optimization is capable of solving problems numerically in ways that, in our opinion, go beyond the current state of the art of stochastic analysis. The types of optimization problems that were required to be solved ranged from linear, discrete, and bilinear optimization problems. We anticipate that this research program, in addition to advancing stochastic analysis, will also advance optimization as it will reveal new optimization problems that need to be addressed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( a )</head><label>a</label><figDesc>Analyzing queueing networks in Sect. 3.

Once the reservation price is calculated, both these mechanisms solve linear optimization problems to carry out the auction. While the Myerson auction solves the non-linear equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>, ROM-Si solves the optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> to calculate the reservation price. As long as the uncertainty set U is polyhedral (for example given as in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>),( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)), this optimization problem is efficiently solvable. In particular, when U is a polyhedron, the optimization problem reduces to a linear optimization problem. On the other hand, the Myerson auction gives different values of reservation prices for different distributions. For uniform and exponential distributions, the reservation prices obtained by the auctions match, while for other distributions, the reservation prices are different. This dependence of reservation prices on the distribution may lead to lack of robustness on the part of the Myerson auction, when the assumed distribution differs from the realized distribution.</p><p>In order to study this, we design the following experiments. We first assume that valuations are normally distributed with parameters μ = 1, and σ = 0.5, 1, 2 and carry out ROM-Si and the Myerson auctions with these parameters. Then, we investigate how these auctions compare with each other, when the realized distributions are different from the assumed distributions. This is done by computing the quantity Relative Revenue defined as</p><p>which when positive, indicates that the proposed auction results in a greater revenue than the Myerson auction. In Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, we compare the expected revenues (obtained by simulation) of the ROM-Si and of the Myerson auction, when the realized distribution is Gamma, Beta,</p></div>			</div>
