<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As the number of authors is increasing exponentially over years, the number of authors sharing the same names is increasing proportionally. This makes it challenging to assign newly published papers to their adequate authors. Therefore, Author Name Ambiguity (ANA) is considered a critical open problem in digital libraries. This paper proposes an Author Name Disambiguation (AND) approach that links author names to their real-world entities by leveraging their co-authors and domain of research. To this end, we use a collection from the DBLP repository that contains more than 5 million bibliographic records authored by around 2.6 million co-authors. Our approach first groups authors who share the same last names and same first name initials. The author within each group is identified by capturing the relation with his/her co-authors and area of research, which is represented by the titles of the validated publications of the corresponding author. To this end, we train a neural network model that learns from the representations of the co-authors and titles. We validated the effectiveness of our approach by conducting extensive experiments on a large dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Author name disambiguation is an important task in digital libraries to ensure that each publication is properly linked to its corresponding co-authors. Consequently, author-level metrics can be accurately calculated and authors' publications can be easily found. However, this task is extremely challenging due to the high number of authors sharing the same names. In this paper, author name denotes a sequence of characters referring to one or several authors 1 , whereas author refers to a unique person authoring at least one publication and cannot be identified only by his/her author name 2 but rather with the support of other identifiers such as ORCID, ResearchGate ID and Semantic Scholar author ID. Although relying on these identifiers almost eliminates any chance of mislinking a publication to its appropriate author, most bibliographic sources do not include such identifiers. This is because not all of the authors are keen to use these identifiers and if they are, there is no procedure or policy to include their identifiers when they are cited. Therefore, in bibliographic data (e.g. references), authors are commonly referred to by their names only. Considering the high number of authors sharing the same names (i.e. homonymy), it is difficult to link the names in bibliographic sources to their real-world authors especially when the source of the reference is not available or does not provide indicators of the author identity. The problem is more critical when names are substituted by their initials to save space, and when they are erroneous due to wrong manual editing. Disciplines like social sciences and humanities suffer more from this problem as most of the publishers are small and mid-sized and cannot ensure the continuous integrity of the bibliographic data.</p><p>Since these problems are known for decades, several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> have been conducted using different machine learning approaches. This problem is mainly tackled using supervised approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Bayesian Classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and Neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. These approaches rely on the matching between publications and authors which are verified either manually or automatically. Unsupervised approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> have also been used to assess the similarity between a pair of papers. Other unsupervised approaches are also used to estimate the number of co-authors sharing the same name <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and decide whether new records can be assigned to an existing author or a new one <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Due to the continuous increase of publications, each of which cites tens of other publications and the difficulty to label this streaming data, semi-supervised approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> were also employed. Recent approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> leveraged the outstanding efficiency of deep learning on different domains to exploit the relationship among publications using network embedding. All these approaches use the available publication data about authors such as titles, venues, year of publication and affiliation. Some of these approaches are currently integrated into different bibliographic systems. However, all of them require an exhausting manual correction to reach an acceptable accuracy. In addition, most of these approaches rely on the metadata extracted from the papers which are supposed to be correct and complete. In real scenarios, the source of the paper is not always easy to find and only the reference is available.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to employ bibliographic data consisting of publication records to link each author's name in unseen records to their appropriate realworld authors (i.e. DBLP identifiers) by leveraging their co-authors and area of research embedded in the publication title and source. Note that the goal of this paper is to disambiguate author names in newly published papers that are not recorded in any bibliographic database. Therefore, all records that are considered unseen are discarded from the bibliographic data and used only for testing the approach. The assumption is that any author is most likely to publish articles in specific fields of research. Therefore, we employ articles' titles and sources (i.e. Journal, Booktitle, etc.) to bring authors close to their fields of research represented by the titles and sources of publications. We also assume that authors who already published together are more likely to continue collaborating and publish other papers.</p><p>For the goal mentioned above, our proposed model is trained on a bibliographic collection obtained from DBLP, where a sample consists of a target author, pair of co-authors, title and source. For co-authors, the input is a vector representation obtained by applying Char2Vec which returns character-level embedding of words. For title and source, BERT model is used to capture the semantic representations of the sequence of words. Our model is trained and tested on a challenging dataset, where thousands of authors share the same atomic name variate. The main contributions of this paper are:</p><p>-We proposed a novel approach for author name disambiguation using semantic and symbolic representations of titles, sources, and co-authors. -We provided a statistical overview of the problem of author name ambiguity.</p><p>-We conducted experiments on challenging datasets simulating a critical scenario.</p><p>-The obtained results and the comparison against baseline approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in disambiguating author names.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly presents related work. Section 3 describes the proposed framework. Section 4 presents the dataset, implementation details and the obtained results of the proposed model. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and gives insights on future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In this section, we discuss recent approaches softly categorized into three categories, namely unsupervised-, supervised-and graph-based;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Unsupervised-based:</head><p>Most of the studies treat the problem of author name ambiguity as an unsupervised task <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> using algorithms like DBSCAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and agglomerative clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> rely on the similarity between a pair of records with the same name to disambiguate author names on the PubMed dataset. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> used Recurrent Neural Network to estimate the number of unique authors in the Aminer dataset. This process is followed by manual annotation. In this direction, Ferreira et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have proposed a two-phases approach applied to the DBLP dataset, where the first one is obtaining clusters of authorship records and then disambiguation is applied to each cluster. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> fused features such as affiliation and content of papers using Shannon's entropy to obtain a matrix representing pairwise correlations of papers which is in return used by hierarchical agglomerative clustering to disambiguate author names on Arnetminer dataset. Similar features have been employed by other approache <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Supervised-based:</head><p>Supervised approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> are also widely used but mainly only after applying blocking that gathers authors sharing the same names together. Han et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> present two supervised learning approaches to disambiguate authors in cited references. Given a reference, the first approach uses the naive Bayes model to find the author class with the maximal posterior probability of being the author of the cited reference. The second approach uses SVM to classify references from DBLP to their appropriate authors. Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> employ heuristic features like the percentage of citations gathered by the top name variations for an author to disambiguate common author names. Neural networks are also used <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> to verify if two references are close enough to be authored by the same target author or not. Hourrane et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> propose a corpus-based approach that uses word embeddings to compute the similarity between cited references. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, an Entity Resolution system called the DEEPER is proposed. It uses a combination of bi-directional recurrent neural networks along with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) as the hidden units to generate a distributed representation for each tuple to capture the similarities between them. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposed an online Bayesian approach to identify authors with ambiguous names and as a case study, bibliographic data in a temporal stream format is used and the disambiguation is resolved by partitioning the papers into homogeneous groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Graph-based:</head><p>As bibliographic data can be viewed as a graph of citations, several approaches have leveraged this property to overcome the problem of author name ambiguation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Hoffart et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> present a method for collective disambiguation of author names, which harnesses the context from a knowledge base and uses a new form of coherence graph. Their method generates a weighted graph of the candidate entities and mentions to compute a dense sub-graph that approximates the best entity-mention mapping. Xianpei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> aim to improve the traditional entity linking method by proposing a graph-based collective entity linking approach that can model and exploit the global interdependence, i.e., the mutual dependence between the entities. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, the problem of author name ambiguity is overcome using relational information considering three graphs: person-person, person-document and document-document. The task becomes then a graph clustering task with the goal that each cluster contains documents authored by a unique real-world author. For each ambiguous name, Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> build a network of papers with multiple relationships. A networkembedding method is proposed to learn paper representations, where the gap between positive and negative edges is optimized. Further, HDBSCAN is used to cluster paper representations into disjoint sets such that each set contains all papers of a unique real-world author.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach: WhoIs</head><p>In this paper, author name disambiguation is designed using a bibliographic dataset D = {d i } N i=1 , consisting of N bibliographic records, where each record d i refers to a unique publication such that d i = {t i , s i , a i,u , ? i,u ?i u=1 }. Here, t i and s i denote the title and source of the record, respectively. a i,u and ? i,u refer to the uth author and its corresponding name, respectively, among ? i co-authors of d i . Let ? = {?(m)} M m=1 be a set of M unique author names in D shared by a set of L unique authors A = {a(l)} L l=1 co-authoring all records in D, where L &gt;&gt; M . Note that each author name ?(m) might refer to one or more authors in A and each author a(l) might be referred to by one or two author names in ?. This is because we consider two variates for each author as it might occur differently in different papers. For example the author "Rachid Deriche" is assigned to two elements in ?, namely "Rachid Deriche" and "R. Deriche".</p><p>Given a reference record d * / ? D, the goal of our approach is to link each author name ? * u ? ? that occurs in d * to the appropriate author in A by leveraging t * , s * and {? * u } ? * u=1 . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates an overview of our proposed approach. First, the approach computes the correspondence frequency ? * u RA that returns the number of authors in</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A corresponding to ? * u . ? * u RA = 0 indicates that ? * u corresponds to a new author a(new) / ? A. ? * u RA = 1</formula><p>indicates that ? * u corresponds to only one author a(l) ? A. In this case, we directly assign ? * u to a(l) and no further processing is necessary. Note that in this case, ? * u might also refer to a new author a(new) / ? A who have the same name as an existing author a(l) ? A. However, our approach does not handle this situation. Please refer to Section6.6 that lists the limitation of the proposed approach.</p><p>The goal of this paper is handling the case of ? * u RA &gt; 1 which indicates that ? * u can refer to more than one author. To this end, the approach extracts the atomic name variate from the author name ? * u . For example, for the author name ? * u = "Lei Wang", the atomic name variate is ? * u = "L Wang". Let ? * u correspond to ? ? which denotes the ?th atomic name variate among K possible name variates. Afterwards, the corresponding Neural Network model</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">? ? ? ? = {? k } K k=1 is picked to distinguish between all authors A ? = {a(l ? )} L? l?=1</formula><p>who share the same name variate ? ? .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model Architecture</head><p>The Neural Network model ? ? takes as input the attributes of d * , namely the first name of the target author ? * first-name u , full names of two co-authors ? * p and ? * j , title t * and source s * . Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the architecture of ? ? , with an output layer of length L k corresponding to the number of unique authors in A ? who have the same atomic name variate ? k . As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, ? ? takes two inputs x ?,1 and x ?,2 , such that: where char2vec(w) returns a vector representation of length 200 generated using Char2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which provides a symbolic representation of w. bert(w) returns a vector representation of each token in w w.r.t its context in the sentence. This representation of length 786 is generated using BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The goal of separating the two inputs is to overcome the sparseness of content embedding and force the model to emphasise more on target author representation. All the hidden layers possess ReLU activation function, whereas the output is a Softmax classifier. Since the model has to classify thousands of classes, each of which is represented with very few samples, 50% of the units in the last hidden layers are dropped out during training in order to avoid over-fitting. Furthermore, the number of publications significantly differs from one author to another. Therefore, each class (i.e. the author) is weighted according to its number of samples (i.e. publications). The model is trained with adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. This architecture and these parameters achieved the best performance in our empirical analysis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x ?,1 = char2vec(? * first-name u ) 1 2 char2vec(? * p ) + char2vec(? * j ) , x ?,2 = 1 2 (bert(t * ) + bert(s * )) ,<label>(1)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Author name representation</head><p>The names of authors do not hold any specific semantic nature as they are simply a specific sequence of characters referring to one or more persons. Therefore, we need a model that can encode words based on the order and distribution of characters such that author names with a similar name spellings are encoded closely, assuming possible manual editing errors of cited papers.</p><p>Chars2vec is a powerful Neural Network-based language model that is preferred when the text consists of abbreviations, typos, etc. It captures the non -vocabulary words and places words with similar spelling closer in the vector space. This model uses a fixed list of characters for word vectorization, where a one-hot encoding represents each character. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Source and Title embedding</head><p>The source (e.g. journal names and book titles) of reference can provide a hint about the area of research of the given reference. In addition, the title is a meaningful sentence that embeds the specific topic the reference. Therefore, we used these two features to capture the research area of the author. Contrary to the author's name, the goal here is to capture the context of the sequences of words forming the title and source. Therefore, we employed the pre-trained BERT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to obtain sentence embeddings of both the title and source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Model Training</head><p>Given the training set D ? ?

Note also that we consider one combination where ? i?,p = ? ? . In order to train the model with the other common name variate where the first name is substituted with its initial, for each sample, we generate another version with name variates ? ? , ? i?,p , ? i?,j , t i? , s i? . Consequently, each bibliographic record is fed into the model 2 ? ? i? times.</p><p>Since the third co-author ? i?,p is randomly assigned to the training sample among ? i? co authors d i? , we randomly reassign it after Y epochs. In addition to lower training complexity, this has shown in the conducted experiments a slightly better result than training the model at each epoch with samples of all possible co-author pairs p and j.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>This section presents the experimental results of the proposed approach on the DBLP dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset</head><p>Although there are several proposed datasets for Author Name Disambiguation, most of them are not practical and do not reflect the real scenario. Section 6.4 list list the most used datasets and why they cannot be used to evaluate our approach.</p><p>In this work, we collected our dataset from the DBLP bibliographic repository <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . The DBLP version of July 2020 contains 4.4 million bibliographic records such as conference papers, articles, thesis, etc., from various fields of research. As stated by the maintainers of DBLP <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , the accuracy of the data is not guaranteed. However, they are putting a lot of effort into manually disambiguating homonym cases when reported by other users. Consequently, we are aware of possible homonym cases that are not resolved yet.</p><p>In this work, we collected only records of publications published in journals and proceedings because other publications (e.g. theses and books) are authored by a single author and do not contain a source name. Each record in this collection represents metadata information of a publication with one or more authors, title, journal, year of publication and a few other attributes. The number of these attributes differs from one reference to another. Also, the authors in DBLP who share the same name have a suffix number to differentiate them. For instance, the authors with the same name 'Bing Li' are given suffixes such as 'Bing Li 0001', and 'Bing Li 0002'. The statistical details of the used DBLP collection are as follows:</p><p># of records 5258623 # of unique authors 2665634 # of unique author names 2613577 # of unique atomic name variates 1555517</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the frequency of authors sharing the same names and the same atomic name variates. As can be seen, the problem is more critical when the authors are cited with their atomic name variate as there are five atomic name variates shared by around 11.5k authors. This makes the problem of disambiguation critical because not only target authors who might share the same atomic name variate but also their co-authors. For instance, we observed publications authored by the pair of co-authors having the atomic name variates: Y. Wang and Y. Zhang. However, they refer to different Y. Wang and Y. Zhang pairs of real-world authors. Since our approach gathers authors with the same name variates, 261464 models are required to disambiguate all author names in our collection. Therefore, we present in this paper the experimental results on 5 models corresponding to the highest number of authors sharing the same name variates. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> presents statistical details of the five sub-collections which demonstrates the challenge of author name disambiguation in real world-scenarios. # R2A for example shows that in some publications two co-authors have the same exact names. This makes the disambiguation more difficult as these authors share not only their names but also co-authors and papers.</p><p>To ensure a credible evaluation and result reproducibility in real scenarios, we split the records in each sub-collection into a training set (? 70%), validation set (? 15%) and training set (? 15%) in terms of records/target author. Specifically, for each target author, we randomly split the corresponding records. If the target author did not author enough publications for the split, we prioritize the training set, then validation and finally the test set. Consequently, the number of samples is not necessarily split according to 70 : 15 : 15 as the number of co-authors differs among publications. Moreover, it is highly likely that the records of a unique target author are completely different among the three sets. Consequently, it is difficult for the model to recognize the appropriate author only from his/her Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Statistical details of the top 5 sub-collections of authors sharing the same atomic name variates, where # ANV is the corresponding atomic name variate, # UTA is the number of unique target authors, # RCD is the number of bibliographic records, # UCA is the number of unique co-author full names, # UAN is the number of unique target author full names, # R2A is the number of records with two coauthors of the same record having the same names or the same atomic name variates and # R3A is the number of records with three co-authors of the same record having the same names or the same atomic name variates. For # R2A and # R3A, it is not necessary that the authors have the same name / atomic name variate as the target author but most probably. co-authors and research area. However, we believe that this is more realistic and a perfect simulation of the real scenario.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">'Y Wang' 'Y Zhang' 'Y Chen' 'Y Li' 'Y</formula><p>To account for possible name variates, each input sample of full names is duplicated, where the duplicate down sample full names of all co-authors to atomic name variates. Note that this is applied to training, validation and test sets. The goal is to let the model capture all name variates for each author and his/her co-authors. In none of the sets, the variates are mixed in a single sample as we assume that this case is very less likely to occur in the real world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>The existing Author Name Disambiguation approaches use different datasets to design and evaluate their models. This lead to different assumptions and challenge disparity. Unfortunately, the codes to reproduce the results of these approaches are not available or easily accessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Therefore, it is not possible to fairly compare WhoIs against baseline approaches. For future work, our code and the used datasets are publicly available 5 .</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> presents the result of WhoIs on the sub-collections presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The label All in the table denotes that all samples were predicted twice, one with full names of the target author and its co-authors and another time with only their atomic name variates, whereas the label ANV denotes that only samples with atomic names are predicted. The obtained results show that an important number of publications are not properly assigned to their appropriate authors. This is due to the properties of the sub-collections which were discussed above and statistically presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. For example, 1) two authors with the same common name authoring a single publication. 2) more than one author 5 https://whois.ai-research.net with the same common atomic name variate authoring a single publication, 3) number of authors with the same full name, 4) the uncertainty of the accuracy of the dataset, etc.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Detailed results of WhoIs on the sub-collections corresponding to the top five of authors sharing the same atomic name variates in the DBLP repository. The results are presented in terms of Micro average precision (MiAP), Macro average precision (MaAP), Micro average recall (MiAR), Macro average recall (MaAR), Micro average F1-score (MiAF1) and Macro average F1-score (MaAF1). ANV denotes that only atomic name variates were used for all target authors and all their co-authors. Although the comparison is difficult and cannot be completely fair, we compare WhoIs to other state-of-the-art approaches, whose results are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. These results are obtained on a collection from CiteSeerX<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> that contains records of authors with the name / atomic name variate 'Y Chen'. This collection consists of 848 complete documents authored by 71 distinct authors. We picked this name for comparison because of two reasons; 1) the number of authors sharing this name is among the top five as shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and<ref type="table">2</ref>) All methods cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> could not achieve a good result. We applied WhoIs on this collection by randomly splitting the records into 70% for training, 15% for validation and 15% for testing. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Note that in our collection, we consider way more records and distinct authors (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) and we use only reference attributes (i.e. co-authors, title and source).</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">'Y Wang' 'Y Zhang' 'Y Chen' 'Y Li' 'Y</formula><p>As the results presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> show, WhoIs outperforms other methods in resolving the disambiguation of the author name 'Y Chen' on CiteSeerX dataset, which is a relatively small dataset and does not really reflect the performance of all presented approaches in real scenarios. The disparity between the results shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table">3</ref> demonstrates that the existing benchmark datasets are manually prepared for the sake of accuracy. However, this leads to covering a very small portion of records whose authors share similar names.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Examples of Homonomy and Synonymy</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> demonstrates real examples of reference strings covering the abovementioned problems. The homonomy issue shows an example of two different papers citing the name J M Lee which refers to two different authors. In this case, it is not possible to disambiguate the two authors without leveraging other features. The Synonymy issue shows an example of the same author Jang Myung Lee cited differently in two different papers as Jang Myung Lee and J Lee.</p><p>Synonymy is a serious issue in author name disambiguation as it requires the awareness of all name variates of the given author. Moreover, some name variates might be shared by other authors, which increases homonymy. Often, the very first indication of no more improvement in the validation loss would not be the right epoch to stop training; because the model may start improving again after passing through a few more epochs. We overcome this by adding a delay to the trigger in terms of consecutive epochs count on which, we can wait to observe no more improvement. A delay is added by setting the patience argument to an appropriate value.patience in Bib2Auth is set to 50, so that the model only halts when the validation loss stops getting better for the past 50 consecutive epochs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Model checkpoint</head><p>Although Bib2Auth stops the training process when it achieves a minimum validation loss, the model obtained at the end of the training may not give the best accuracy on validation data. To account this, Keras provides an additional callback called ModelCheckpoint. This callback is configured with the help of another monitor argument. We have set the monitor to monitor the validation accuracy. With this setup, the model updates the weights only when it observes better validation accuracy compared to earlier epochs. Eventually, we end up persisting the best state of the model with respect to the best validation accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Existing Datasets</head><p>The following datasets are widely used to evaluate author name disambiguation approaches but the results on these datasets cannot reflect the results on real scenario streaming data. For this reason, up to our knowledge, none of the existing approaches with high accuracy is integrated in an automatic AND system with reliable outcome.</p><p>-ORCID<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">11</ref> : it is the most large accurate dataset as the publication is assigned to the author only after authorship claim or another rigorous authorship confirmation. However, this accuracy comes at the cost of number of assignments.</p><p>Our investigation shows that most of the registered authors are not assigned to any publication and an important number of authors are not even registered. This is because most of the authors are not keen to claim their publications due to several reasons. -KDD Cup 2013<ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">12</ref> : it is a large dataset that consists of 2.5M papers authored by 250K authors. All author metadata are available including affiliation. -Manually labeled (e.g. PENN <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">13</ref> , QIAN<ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">14</ref> , AMINER<ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">15</ref> , KISTI <ref type="foot" target="#foot_14">16</ref> ):</p><p>These datasets are supposed to be very accurate since they are manually labelled. However, this process is expensive and time consuming and, therefore, it can cover only a small portion of authors who share the same names.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Data Details</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows that the majority of target authors in the sub-collections have unique full names but a noteworthy portion of them share full names and causes a significant challenge, especially when several authors (e.g. more than 80 in 4 out of 5 of the sub-collections) share the same full name but the number of their publications is unbalanced. Here, these author names are more likely to be distinguished to the dominant author. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> illustrates the log frequency of bibliographic records with same full name in the top five sub-collections used in this paper. As illustrated, in all subcollections, the target authors of around half of the records authored few records (less than 5) and have unique names. Although, it is simple to distinguish these authors when their full names occur, it is extremely challenging to recognize them among more than 2000 authors sharing the same atomic name variate due to the unbalance of records with the other authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Limitations and obstacles of WhoIs:</head><p>WhoIs demonstrated a satisfactory result and outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on a challenging dataset and real world scenario, which makes it ready to be integrated into bibliographic systems. However, the approach faces several obstacles that will be addressed in our future works. In the following, we list the limitations of the proposed approach:</p><p>-New authors cannot be properly handled by our approach, where a confidence threshold is set to decide whether the input corresponds to a new author or an existing one. Up to out knowledge, none of the existing approaches is capable to handle this situation. -It is very common that authors make new collaborations which lead to new co-authorship. Our approach cannot benefit from the occurrence of new cocombinations of co-authors as they were never seen during training.</p><p>Planned solution: We will train an independent model to embed the author discipline using his/her known publications. With this, we assume that authors working in the same area of research will be put close to each other even if they did not publish a paper together, the model would be able to capture the potential co-authorship between a pair of authors in terms of their area of research. -Authors continuously extend their research expertise by co-authoring new publications in relatively different disciplines. This means that the titles and journals are not discriminative anymore. Consequently, it is hard for our approach to disambiguate authors holding common names.</p><p>Planned solution: we plan to develop an efficient method to determine the author's areas of research interest by mining domain-specific keywords from the entire paper instead of its title assuming that the author uses similar keywords / writing style even in different domain area and that they gradually changes which gives the model the chance to capture this change. -There are a lot of models that have to be trained in order to disambiguate all authors in the DBLP repository. -Commonly, the number of samples is very small compared to the number of classes (i.e. authors sharing the same atomic name variate) which leads to overfit the model.</p><p>Planned solution: we plan to follow a reverse strategy of disambiguation. Instead of employing the co-authors of the target author, we will employ their co-authors aiming to find the target author among them. We aim also to learn co-author representation by employing their co-authors to help resolving the disambiguation of the target author's name. -As mentioned earlier and stated by the maintainers of the platform<ref type="foot" target="#foot_15">17</ref> , the accuracy of DBLP repository is not guaranteed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FilteringF.Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

To avoid this, we enabled early stopping, which allows the model to specify an arbitrary large number for the epoch.Keras supports early stopping of the training via a callback called EarlyStopping. This callback is configured with the help of the monitor argument which allows to set the validation loss. With this setup, the model receives a trigger to halt the training when it observes no more improvement in the validation loss.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Issue Type Source</cell><cell>Citations</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>T.

<div><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We presented in this paper a comprehensive overview of the problem of Author Name Disambiguation. To overcome this problem, we proposed a novel framework that consists of a lot of supervised models. Each of these models is dedicated to distinguishing among authors who share the same atomic name variate (i.e. first name initial and last name) by leveraging the co-authors and the titles and sources of their known publications. The experiments on challenging and realscenario datasets have shown promising and satisfactory results on author name disambiguation. We also demonstrated the limitations and challenges that are inherent in this process.</p><p>To overcome some of these limitations and challenges, we plan for future work to exploit citation graphs so that author names can be linked to real-world entities by employing the co-authors of their co-authors. We assume that using this reverse process, the identity of the target author can be found among the co-authors of his/her co-authors. We plan also to learn the research area of co-authors in order to overcome the issue of new co-authorships.</p></div>
