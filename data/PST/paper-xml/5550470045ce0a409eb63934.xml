<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION 1.Motivation</head><p>People's psychological stress is severely rising. Nowadays, many people feel increasingly stressed under the rapid pace of modern life. According to a worldwide survey conducted by the Regus Business Tracker in 2009 1 , over half of the business population (53.8%) have experienced an appreciable rise in stress over the last two years. Though stress can be a positive aspect in our daily life, excessive amount of stress can be rather harmful to physical and mental health. Long-term stress may lead to many severe physical and mental problems, such as clinical depressions, insomnia and even suicide. According to China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> , suicide has become the top cause of death among Chinese youth, and excessive stress is considered to be a major factor of suicide. All these reveal that the rapid increase of stress has become a great challenge to human health and life quality.</p><p>Thus, there is significant importance to detect stress before it turns into severe problems. While traditional psychological stress detection is mainly based on face-toface interviews conducted by psychologists, it is usually labor-consuming, time-costing and hysteretic.</p><p>Microblog has become a popular platform for people to express themselves. Nowadays, with the rapid development of social networks, people are more and more willing to use microblog to express their moods. As reported by Sina weibo (the largest microblog platform in China), the number of weibo users has reached 500 million <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> . And according to the report given by Chinese Academy of Social Sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, self-expression is the first main usage of microblog The hashtag (stress label) word given by the user himself is shown between two "#" marks.</p><p>(74.3%). This makes the detection of users' psychological stress through their tweets on microblog feasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Related work</head><p>Due to the challenges of traditional stress detection, many efforts have been devoted to detecting psychological stress more efficiently and timely recent years. Most of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> focus on detecting stress in real-time via body-worn sensors and mobile devices. The equipment is used to gather physiological parameters and daily activity data. Andrew Raij .etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> designed a mobile phone based system, named mStress, using 6 extra wireless sensors to collect physiological data to support real-time detection of stress. Hong Lu. etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed StressSense for unobtrusively recognizing stress from smartphone-recorded conversational voice data. However, such applications rely on additional sensors or devices to collect one's real-life data. It makes stress detection invasive to normal life, and can't be used widely in more people. There are also some researchers turning to non-invasive ways to automatically detect psychological stress from social networks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> presented methods to detect psychological stress from forum posts and microblog tweets respectively. These methods are mainly based on text data in the social networks, while other equally important content, like images and social actions are ignored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Our work</head><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method of detecting psychological stress using cross-media microblog data. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW</head><p>An overview of our three-level stress detection framework is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Tweets from the microblog usually consist of the following parts: 1) text content with no more than 140 words; 2) images uploaded together with the text message; 3) social interactions with comments, favorites and retweets within friends. These three parts together make tweets of microblog to be actually cross-media data.</p><p>To incorporate different features from the cross-media microblog data to enhance stress detection, we obtain a set of low-level features from the microblog tweets at the first stage, such as key words from texts, colors from images, and the numbers of social actions from microblog interactions. Then we define and extract stress-related middle-level representations from the low-level features of tweets, namely linguistic attributes from tweets' texts, visual attributes from tweets' images, and social attributes from tweets' comments, retweets and favorites. The definition and extraction of the middle-level representations is based on psychological principles and art theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Finally, a deep neural network is implemented to learn the stress detection model from the extracted middle-level representations.</p><p>According to the psychological lexicon LIWC2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, in this paper we define 5 different psychological stress categories as our output (affection, work, social, physiological, and others). The "others" categories represents having stress caused by other reasons. Given a tweet T, our task is to detect whether T reflect its author with psychological stress and which category the stress belongs to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">MIDDLE-LEVEL REPRESENTATION</head><p>To narrow the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level stress semantics, we define and extract several middle-level representations from tweets' low level features based on previous psychological principles and art theories in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. The definitions are as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Linguistic Attributes:</head><p>Three stress-related linguistic lexicons are constructed for stress detection, including stress-category lexicon, negative emotion lexicon and negation lexicon. The stress-category lexicon is built based on the "Simplified Chinese Language Inquiry and Word Count Dictionary" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It contains 1307 words, which are categorized into four typical types, i.e., physiological, work-related, social and affection-related stress. The negative emotion lexicon is composed of negative emotion words such as "sad, distressing" to indicate the bad emotion under some stress. The negation lexicon is proposed here to judge whether a sentence have the negative meaning.</p><p>Based on the stress related lexicons, we define the text content related features as the middle-level linguistic attributes:</p><p>• Linguistic Association between Stress Category and Negative Emotion Words (1 dimension). To find out associations among the stress-related words, we apply a graph-based Chinese parser to generate a wordassociation tree from the tweet-text-content. Each node of the tree denotes a word token, and each edge between two nodes denotes a word association. If there exists a path between a stress-category-related word node and a negative emotion word node and no negation words in between, a stress in the corresponding category is detected. is denoted as the number of edges between the stresscategory word and negative word in the path. We use to determine the stress existence in a tweet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Negative Emotion Words (1 dimension).</head><p>The more negative emotion words are used in tweets, the more possibility of stress can be detected. We calculate the number of negative emotion words to improve the accuracy of the stress detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Positive and Negative Emoticons (2 dimensions). Emoticons are often used to express users' emotional inclination in tweets because of its iconicity. We use this attribute to distinguish users' emotional leaning in a tweet. Sina weibo platform provide 129 emoticons which contain positive and negative emoticons. We give each of them a weight ranged from -4 to 4 to denote its strength of positive and negative sentiment. The higher the weight assigned, the higher possibility of stress can be determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Punctuation Marks and Associated Emotion Words (4 dimensions). Punctuation plays a vital, though subtle, role in showing a character's emotion, .i.e. exclamation mark is often used to strengthen mood, while question mark is often used to imply confused mood. We use this attribute to signify the intensity of emotion in a tweet, either positive or negative according to the associated emotional words. Four typical punctuation marks (exclamation mark, question mark, dot mark and the Chinese full stop mark " ") are considered. Thus, we get 8-dimensional vector to denote the linguistic attributes from the tweets' content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Visual Attributes:</head><p>Based on previous work on affective image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and color psychology theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we combine the following features as the visual middle-level representation: experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> find out that people under stress and anxiety prefer lower saturation than normal states, revealing the correlation between stress and saturation of • Brightness (2 dimensions): the mean value of brightness and its contrast. It illustrates the perception elicited by the luminance and the related differences of an image (e.g., low brightness makes people feel negative, while high brightness elicits mainly positive emotional associations).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Warm or cool color (1 dimension): ratio of cool colors with hue ([0-360]) in the HSV space between 30 and 110. It is defined based on human feelings elicited by colors. Warm colors like red, orange and yellow often evoke feelings of happiness, optimism and energy, Cool colors like green, blue, and purple are usually calming and soothing but can also express sadness sometimes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Clear or dull color (1 dimension): ratio of colors with brightness ([0-1]) and saturation less than 0.6. It depicts the clear or dull feeling of an image, determined by both brightness and saturation. An image with low brightness and saturation usually feels dull, otherwise clear. To extract the five-color theme feature, we use the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Saturation, brightness and warm or cool color features of an image can be easily calculated in HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) space, which is the cylindrical-coordinate representations of RGBs. The clear or dull color feature can be derived from saturation and brightness.</p><p>Thus, based on the psychological studies and color theories, we finally get a 21 dimensional middle-level representation from the low-level RGBs of an image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Social Attributes:</head><p>Besides the text content and image content of a tweet, some additional features like comments, retweeting and favorites can also imply one's stress state to some degree. We define a tweet's social attention degree based on these additional features into social attributes.</p><p>An apparently stressful tweet may attract more attention from friends. The number of comments, retweets and favorites reveals how much attention a tweet attracts. To find out the changes of attention degree of one's tweet, we first calculate the mean and variance of the number of one's tweets' comments, retweets and favorites respectively. Then with the number of a tweet's comments, retweets and favorites , we define the variation characteristic of social interaction as: 1 Thus, we get a 3-dimensional vector to represent the social attributes of a tweet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">MODEL AND LEARNING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Architecture</head><p>In order to handle microblog data from multiple modalities in a cross-modal setting, we propose to use a deep sparse neural network. In our stress detection task, representations for features from each single modal are extracted using proposed method in previous section. A joint representation layer follows after the single modal representation layer to fuse information from different modalities. We further stack another auto-encoder to extract high-level representation for microblog data. On the top of the hierarchy, we employ 5 binary classifiers that each indicates one category of stress. The overall architecture of the network is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.</p><p>We assigned 8 visible neurons for content representation, 18 visible neurons for image representation and 5 visible neurons for social representation corresponding to the representations extracted from content, image and social features. The model also contains 100 hidden neurons for joint representation and another 100 for high-level representation. The 5 classifiers work independently.</p><p>We adopt Softplus activation function which is given by: Softplus(x)=log(1+e x ).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>2</label></formula><p>Softplus activation function is a smooth alternative to hard zero rectifier, which prevent hard zero to hurt back propagation optimization while creating an easy-to-train sparse representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Cross-media Auto-Encoder</head><p>Though microblog is an open platform, we may not have access to complete features of tweets all the time due to the fact like user did not provide any image for a tweet by privacy issues. This is a typical cross-media setting. It has been reported that deep neural networks can be used to learn cross-media or share representations in speech video <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or images with text tag <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.  We propose a Cross-media Auto-Encoder (CAE) to learn the joint representation using Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) style learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows a sketch of a CAE. With training data containing all modality information, we manually disable image representation and/or social representation when training the auto-encoder, while requiring it to reconstruct all three. In this part of training, thought the missing part of data did not contribute as input, they enforce the network to reconstruct them even if they are missing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Model learning</head><p>Training a CAE is quite different from standard autoencoders. There is not explicit objective for standard autoencoders to learn feature across modalities and they tend to learn feature within each single modality with few correlation connection between multiple modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We train the CAE with a cropped set of data that input from or two modalities are absent while require it to reconstruct data from three.</p><p>(3) where is the joint representation, , , , are the connection weights of encoders and decoder for different modalities, is the Softplus activation function and are the reconstruction results. In practice, to fully utilize available data, we augment the training dataset with four cropping setting: 1) content + image + social, 2) content + image, 3) content + social and 4) content only, with input from other modality being set to 0. For all these four sets of input we require our model to reconstruct data from content, image and social and evaluate with the energy function given by (4) and are weight decay and sparse penalty while is the sparse parameter.</p><p>is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to enforce sparsity in joint representation.</p><p>The high-level representation is then trained with outputting joint representation with all four cropping settings and fine-tuning is in supervised manner with a Softmax classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">EVALUATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Experiment setup</head><p>Dataset. We crawl about 600 million tweets from the biggest Chinese microblog site, Sina weibo, from 2009.10 to 2012.10. Many of these tweets contain a variety of userlabeled hashtags, with keywords surrounded by "#". These hashtags are usually used to express users' opinion on some topics or there psychological states. We use these userlabeled hashtags as our ground-truth, and collect the tweets with hashtags only belonging to one of our five stress categories (affection, work, social, physiological, and others) by Simplified Chinese Language Inquiry and Word Count Dictionary. We also crawl tweets with no stressed hashtags. We finally get 57785 hashtag labeled tweets as ground-truth in total. The details of the dataset are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p><p>To test the reliability of the ground-truth labeling using hashtags, we randomly select and manually label 500 tweets from each category. Each tweet is manually labeled by 3 persons, and the hashtag label is treated as correct only if at least 2 persons agree to label the tweet into the same category as the hashtag label. The experiment results show that 95% of hashtag labels are correct, indicating that the hashtag labeled data is quite reliable.</p><p>Experiments. We design 3 experimental settings to demonstrate the performance of our model dealing with cross-media data.</p><p>Detecting stress using only tweets' text information, which means using only linguistic attributes in testing model. Detecting stress using visual attributes in additional to linguistic attributes in testing model. Detecting stress using tweets' cross-media information, which means using all the proposed attributes in testing model. For each of the setting, we compare our model <ref type="bibr">(</ref>   Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> demonstrates results of detecting stress using all proposed attributes.
