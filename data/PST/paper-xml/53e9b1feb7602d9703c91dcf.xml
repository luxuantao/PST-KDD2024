<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Accurate calibration of a vision system is necessary for any computer vision task requiring extracting metric information of the environment from 2D images, like in ego-motion estimation and structure from motion. While a number of methods have been developed concerning planar camera calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>, little work on omnidirectional cameras has been done, and the primary focus has been on particular sensor types.</p><p>For omnidirectional camera is usually intended a vision system providing a 360° panoramic view of the scene. Such an enhanced field of view can be achieved by either using catadioptric systems, obtained by opportunely combining mirrors and conventional cameras, or employing purely dioptric fish-eye lenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>, it is highly desirable that such imaging systems have a single viewpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6]</ref>. That is, there exists a single center of projection, so that, every pixel in the sensed images measures the irradiance of the light passing through the same viewpoint in one particular direction. The reason a single viewpoint is so desirable is that it permits the generation of geometrically correct perspective images from the pictures captured by the omnidirectional camera. Moreover, it allows applying the known theory of epipolar geometry, which easily permits to perform ego-motion estimation and structure-from-motion from image correspondences only.</p><p>Previous works on omnidirectional camera calibration can be classified into two different categories. The first one includes methods which exploit prior knowledge about the scene, such as the presence of calibration patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7]</ref> or plumb lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. The second group covers techniques that do not use this knowledge. This includes calibration methods from pure rotation <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> or planar motion of the camera <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, and self-calibration procedures, which are performed from point correspondences and epipolar constraint through minimizing an objective function <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>. All mentioned techniques allow obtaining accurate calibration results, but primarily focus on particular sensor types (e.g. hyperbolic and parabolic mirrors or fish-eye lenses). Moreover, some of them require special setting of the scene and expensive equipment <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>. For instance, in <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, a fish-eye lens with a 183° field of view is used as an omnidirectional sensor.</p><p>Here, the calibration is performed by using a halfcylindrical calibration pattern perpendicular to the camera sensor, which rotates on a turntable. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref>, the authors treat the case of a parabolic mirror. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> it is shown that vanishing points lie on a conic section which encodes the entire calibration information. Thus, projections of two sets of parallel lines suffice for intrinsic calibration. However, this property does not apply to non-parabolic mirrors. Therefore, the proposed technique cannot be easily generalized to other kinds of sensors.</p><p>Conversely, the methods described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref> fall in the self-calibration category. These methods require no calibration pattern, nor a priori knowledge about the scene. The only assumption is the capability to automatically find point correspondences in a set of panoramic images of the same scene. Then, calibration is directly performed by epipolar geometry by minimizing an objective function. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>, this is done by employing a parabolic mirror, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref> a fish-eye lens with a view angle greater than 180° is used. However, besides focusing on particular sensor types, the mentioned self-calibration techniques may suffer in case of tracking difficulties and of a small number of features points <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</p><p>All previous calibration procedures focus on particular sensor types, such as parabolic and hyperbolic mirrors or fish-eye lenses. Furthermore, they are strongly dependent on the omnidirectional sensor model they use, which is suitable only when the single effective viewpoint property is satisfied. Although several panoramic vision systems exist directly manufactured to have this property, for a catadioptric system this requires to accurately align the camera and the mirror axes. In addition, the focus point of the mirror has to coincide with the camera optical center. Since it is very difficult to avoid camera-mirror misalignments, an incorrectly aligned catadioptric sensor can lead to a quasi single-viewpoint optical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. As a result, the sensor model used by the mentioned techniques could be suboptimal. In the case of fish-eye lenses the discussion above is analogue. Motivated by this observation, we propose a calibration procedure which uses a generalized parametric model of the sensor, which is suitable to different kinds of omnidirectional vision systems, both catadioptric and dioptric. The proposed method requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few different locations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. No a-priori knowledge of the motion is required, nor a specific model of the omnidirectional sensor. The developed procedure is based on the assumption that the circular external boundary of the mirror or of the fish-eye lens (respec-tively in the catadioptric and dioptric case) is visible in the image. Moreover, we assume that the image formation function, which manages the projection of a 3D real point onto a pixel of the image plane, can be described by a Taylor series expansion. The expansion coefficients, which constitute our calibration parameters, are estimated by solving a two-step least-squares linear minimization problem. Finally, the order of the series is determined by minimizing the reprojection error of the calibration points. The proposed procedure does not require any expensive equipment. Moreover, it is very fast and completely automatic, as the user is only requested to collect a few images of the calibration pattern. The method was applied to a KAIDAN 360° One VR single-viewpoint mirror mounted on a CCD camera. The system has a vertical view angle greater than 200° and the image size is 900x1200 pixels. After calibration, we obtained an average reprojection error of 1 pixel. In order to test the accuracy of the method, we used the estimated model in a structure from motion problem, and we obtained a 3D metric reconstruction of a scene from two highly distorted omnidirectional images, by using image correspondences only. The structure of the paper is the following. The omnidirectional camera model and calibration are described in Sec. 2 and 3. The results of the calibration of a real system are given in Sec. 4. Finally, the 3D structure from motion experiment and its accuracy are shown and discussed in Sec. 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Omnidirectional Camera Model</head><p>We want to generalize our procedure to different kinds of single-viewpoint omnidirectional vision systems, both catadioptric and dioptric. In this section we will use the notation given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In the general omnidirectional camera model, we identify two distinct references: the camera image plane . In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> the two reference planes are shown in the case of a catadioptric system. In the dioptric case, the sign of u'' would be reversed because of the absence of a reflective surface. All coordinates will be expressed in the coordinate system placed in O, with the z axis aligned with the sensor axis (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</p><p>Let X be a scene point. Then, assume</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T ] ' ' , ' ' [ v u ' u'</formula><p>be the projection of X onto the sensor plane, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T ] ' , ' [ v u u'</formula><p>its image in the camera plane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>). As observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, the two systems are related by an affine transformation, which incorporates the digitizing process and small axes misalignments; thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">t A u' ' u'</formula><p>, where x . Then, let us introduce the image projection function g, which captures the relationship between a point ' u' , in the sensor plane, and the vector p emanating from the viewpoint O to a scene point X (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>). By doing so, the complete model of an omnidirectional camera is 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">, P t A X u' g ' u' g p , (1)</formula><p>where 4 X is expressed in homogeneous coordinates; 3x4 P is the perspective projection matrix. By calibration of the omnidirectional camera we mean the estimation of the matrices A and t, and the non-linear function g, so that all vectors t A u' g satisfy the projection equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>). This means that, once the omnidirectional camera is calibrated, we are able to reconstruct, from each pixel, the direction of the corresponding scene point in the real world. We assume for g the following expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T , u'',v'' f u'',v'' u'',v'' g , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where f is rotationally symmetric with respect to the sensor axis. For instance, in the catadioptric case, this corresponds to assume that the mirror is perfectly symmetric with respect to its axis. In general, such an assumption is highly reasonable because both mirror profiles and fish-eye lenses are manufactured with micrometric precision. Function f can have various forms related to the mirror or the lens construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>. As mentioned in the introduction, we want to apply a generalized parametric model of f , which is suitable to different kinds of sensors. Moreover, we want this model to compensate for any misalignment between the focus point of the mirror (or the fish-eye lens) and the camera optical center. We propose the following polynomial form for</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f N N a a a a u'',v'' f ,, 2 ,, 2 ,, 1 0 ... ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the coefficients ...N 2, 1, 0, , i a i , and the polynomial degree N are the model parameters to be determined by the calibration; 0 , , is the metric distance from the sensor axis.

In order to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated, we compute the matrices A and t, up to a scale factor , by transforming the view field ellipse (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>) into a circle centered on the ellipse center.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Solving for camera intrinsic parameters</head><p>In the previous step, we exploited equation (8.3) to find the camera extrinsic parameters.

At the same time, we also compute the unknown i t 3 for each pose of the calibration pattern. As done above, we stack all the unknown entries of (8.1) and (8.2) into a vector and rewrite the equations as a system of linear equations.

Then, we increase N by unitary steps and we compute the average value of the reprojection error of all calibration points. The procedure stops when a minimum error is found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental Results</head><p>The calibration algorithm presented in the previous sections was tested on real data. The omnidirectional sensor to be calibrated is a catadioptric system composed of a KAIDAN 360° One VR hyperbolic mirror and a SONY CCD camera having a resolution of 900x1200 pixels. The calibration rig is a checker pattern containing 9x7 squares, so there are 48 corners (calibration points) (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The size of the pattern is 24.3cm x 18.9 cm. Eleven images of the plane under different orientations were taken, some of which are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Some images of the calibration pattern taken under different orientations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Performance with respect to the number of planes and the polynomial degree</head><p>This experiment investigates the performance of our technique with respect to the number of images of the planar pattern, for a given polynomial degree. We vary the number of pictures from 2 to 11, and for each set we perform the calibration. Next, according to the estimated extrinsic parameters, we reproject the 3D calibration points onto the images. Then, we compute the Root of Mean Squared Distances (RMS), in pixels, between the detected image points and the reprojected ones. The calculated RMS values versus the number of images are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for different polynomial degrees. Note that the error decreases when more images are used. Moreover, by using a 4 th order polynomial to fit the model, we obtain the minimum RMS value, that is of about 1.2 pixels. A 3 rd order polynomial also provides a similar performance if more than four images are taken. Conversely, by using a 2 nd order expansion, the RMS remains above 2 pixels. Thus, for our applications we used a 4 th order expansion. As a result, the RMS error of all reprojected calibration points is 1.2 pixels. This value is very good if we consider that the image resolution is 900x1200 pixels, and that corner detection is less precise on omnidirectional images than on conventional perspective pictures. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> you can see several corner points used to perform the calibration, and the same points reprojected onto the image according to the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters estimated by the calibration. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Performance with respect to the noise level</head><p>In this experiment, we study the robustness of our calibration technique in case of inaccuracy in detecting the calibration points. At this end, Gaussian noise with mean 0 and standard deviation is added to the input calibration points. We vary the noise level from 0.1 pixels to 1.5 pixels. For each level, we perform the calibration and we compute the RMS error of the reprojected points. The results obtained using a 4 th order polynomial are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. As it can be seen, the RMS values remain under 2 pixels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Performance with respect to image rectification</head><p>In this experiment, we test the accuracy of the estimated sensor model by rectifying all calibration images. Rectification determines a transformation of the original distorted image such that the new image appears as taken by a conventional perspective camera.</p><p>In general, is impossible to rectify the whole omnidirectional image because of a view field larger than 180°. However, it is possible to perform rectification on image regions which cover a smaller field of view. As a result, linearity is preserved in the rectified image. As you can see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>, curved edges of a sample pattern in the original image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>) appear straight after rectification (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Application to Structure from Motion</head><p>Our work on omnidirectional camera calibration is motivated by the use of panoramic vision sensors for structure from motion and 3D reconstruction. In this section, we perform a 3D metric reconstruction of a real object from two omnidirectional images, by using the sensor model estimated by our calibration procedure. In order to compare the reconstruction results with a ground truth, we exploited a trihedral object composed of three orthogonal checker patterns of known geometry (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>). Two images of the trihedron were taken by positioning our calibrated camera at two unknown different locations (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref>). Then, several point matches were picked manually from both views of the object and the eight point algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> was applied. In order to obtain good reconstruction results, more than eight points (actually 135) were extracted. Then, the coordinates of the correspondent 3D vectors, back-projected into the space, were normalized according to the nonuniform mirror resolution. The results of the reconstruction are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10</ref>, where we used checker patches to fit the reconstructed 3D points (red rounds). In order to compare the results with the ground truth, we computed the angles between the three planes fitting the reconstructed points. We found the following values: 94.6°, 86.8° and 85.3°. Moreover, the average distances of these points from the fitted planes were respectively 0.05 cm, 0.75 cm and 0.07 cm. Finally, since we knew the size of each checker to be 6.0 cm x 6.0 cm, we also calculated the dimension of every reconstructed checker, and we found an average error of 0.29 cm.     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we presented a flexible new technique for single-viewpoint omnidirectional camera calibration. The proposed method only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few different orientations. No a-priori knowledge of the motion is required, nor a specific model of the omnidirectional sensor. The only assumption is that the image projection function can be described by a Taylor series expansion whose coefficients are estimated by solving a two-step least-squares linear minimization problem. To test the proposed technique, we calibrated a panoramic camera having a field of view greater than 200° in the vertical direction, and we obtained very good results. To investigate the accuracy of the calibration, we also used the estimated omni-camera model in a structure from motion experiment. We obtained a 3D metric reconstruction of a real object from two omnidirectional images, by using image correspondences only. The reconstruction results were also compared with the ground truth. With respect to classical techniques, which rely on a specific parametric model of the omnidirectional camera, the proposed procedure is independent of the sensor, easy to use and flexible.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
