<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The present paper is concerned with the statistical analysis of the resolution limit in a so-called "diffraction-limited" imaging system. The canonical case study is that of incoherent imaging of two closely-spaced sources of possibly unequal brightness. The objective is to study how far beyond the classical Rayleigh limit of resolution one can reach at a given signal to noise ratio. The analysis uses tools from statistical detection and estimation theory. Specifically, we will derive explicit relationships between the minimum detectable distance between two closelyspaced point sources imaged incoherently at a given SNR. Furthermore, asymptotic estimation performance for computing the unknown separation is carried out using the Cramér-Rao bound.</p><p>Much of the analysis is illuminated and simplified by using frequency domain analysis. To gain maximum intuition, the analysis is carried out in one dimension, but can be well extended to the two-dimensional case and to more practical models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In incoherent optical imaging systems the image of an ideal point source is captured as a spatially extended pattern known as the point-spread function (PSF), as shown for the one-dimensional case in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In two dimensions, this function is the well-known Airy diffraction pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>When two closely-located point sources are measured through this kind of optical imaging systems, the measured signal is the incoherent sum of the respective shifted point spread functions.</p><p>According to the classical Rayleigh criterion, two incoherent point sources are "barely resolved" when the central peak of the diffraction pattern generated by one point source falls exactly on the first zero of the pattern generated by the second one. A more detailed and complete explanation of incoherent imaging and related topics can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The Rayleigh criterion for resolution in an imaging system is generally considered as an accurate estimate of limits in practice. But under certain conditions related to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resolution beyond the Rayleigh limit is indeed possible. This can be called the super-resolution limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Indeed, at sufficiently high sampling rates, and in the absence of additive noise, arbitrarily small details can be resolved.</p><p>To gain maximum intuition and perspective from the foregoing analysis, all discussion herein will be carried out in the one-dimensional case, which can later be extended to the twodimensional case. To begin, let us assume that the original signal of interest is the sum of two impulse functions separated by a small distance d:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">√ αδ(x - d 2 ) + βδ(x + d 2 )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where as an energy constraint we require α + β = 2 throughout the following computations. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>As mentioned before, the measured signal will be the incoherent sum of two "sinc" (squared) point spread functions, resulting from a rectangular imaging aperture (or slit in one-dimensional case, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f (x) = s(x; α, β, d) + w(x) = αsinc 2 (x - d 2 ) + βsinc 2 (x + d 2 ) + w(x)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where sinc(x) = sin(πx) πx and w(x) is assumed to be a zero-mean Gaussian white noise process with variance σ 2 . This last assumption is of course not accurate for photon-limited imaging systems, and this case can be considered in the continuation of this work.</p><p>With the present definition, the Rayleigh limit corresponds to d = 1 as can be seen in Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref>. This means that for values d &lt; 1, the two point sources are (in the classical Rayleigh sense) "unresolvable". It is important to note that the Rayleigh criterion does not consider the presence of noise. In the last forty years or so, there have been several attempts, and more recently surveys, of the problem of resolution from the statistical viewpoint. Of these, the most significant earliest works were done by Holstrom <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. In particular, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, he derived lower bounds on the mean-square error of unbiased estimators for the source positions, the distance between the sources, and the radiance values, using the Cramér-Rao inequality. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, he considered two separate situations. In the first, the problem of whether any signal was present or not was treated, whereas in the second, the question of whether one or two sources were present was treated. (This second scenario is, of course, what interests us in the present paper.) Helstrom described a geometrical optics field model of the problem involving a general radiance distribution and point spread function, for objects with arbitrary shape. To study the case of the circular aperture and point sources, he applied a complex and remarkable set of approximations and simplifications of the initial model.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, an approximate statistical theory was given to compute the required number of detected photons (similar to the notion of signal to noise ratio) for a certain desired resolution, and the value of achievable resolution by image restoration techniques was also investigated by numerical and iterative deconvolution. In these papers the definition of resolution was made as the separation of the two point sources that can be resolved through a deconvolution procedure.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the analysis of the achievable resolution in deconvolved astronomical images was studied based on a criterion similar to Rayleigh's.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> two-point resolution of imaging system was studied using a model fitting theory for coherent and partially coherent imaging, where the probability of resolution (probability of detection) was computed for different models. Also in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> the Cramér-Rao lower bound formulation was used to study the limits to attainable precision of estimated distances of the two point sources. Assuming a Gaussian PSF, they determined a lower bound for the variance of estimation of the distance. Also, In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the reader can find a very comprehensive review of past and present approaches to the concept of resolution. In this paper, we also present a frequency domain approach to optimal (Maximum Likelihood) estimation of the distance between the sources, and also compute the Cramér-Rao (CR) lower bound in exact, closed form, which is in fact extendable to any point spread function. In contrast, the earlier works only computed the (CR) bounds on the estimate of the separation, without explicitly studying the ML solution.</p><p>Finally, an interesting, more recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> views the resolution problem from the information theory perspective. This line of thinking, again with simplifying approximations, is used to compute limits of resolution enhancement using Shannon's theorem of maximum transferable information via a noisy channel. This paper considers the case of equally bright nearby point sources and derives an expression relating resolution (here defined as the inverse of the discernable distance between two equally bright point sources), logarithmically to the SNR.</p><p>The results of our paper extend, illuminate, and unify the earlier works in this field using more modern tools in statistical signal processing. Namely, we use locally optimal tests, which lead to more explicit, readily interpreted, and applicable results. In addition, we study various cases including unknown and/or unequal intensities, which have not been considered in their full complexity before. These present results clarify, arguably for the first time, the specific effects of the relevant parameters on the definition of resolution, and its limits, as needed in practice.</p><p>In this paper we formulate the problem of two-point resolution in terms of statistical estimation/detection. Our approach is to precisely define a quantitative measure of resolution in statistical terms by addressing the following question: what is the minimum separation between two point sources (maximum attainable resolution limit) that is detectable at a given signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). In contrast to earlier definitions of resolution, there is little ambiguity in our proposed definition, and all parameters (PSF parameters, noise variance, sampling rate, etc.) will be explicitly present in the formulation. Our earlier work on this problem was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which essentially covers the material in Section 4.1 of this paper.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 will explain and formulate our definition, and the corresponding statistical framework and models, in detail. In Section 3, in order to use linear detection/estimation structures, we will discuss a signal approximation approach. In Section 4, we will study our statistical analysis for three different cases: when the point sources have known, and equal, intensities, known, but unequal intensities, and finally the case of unknown intensities. Frequency domain analysis will be discussed in section 4 in order to obtain Maximum Likelihood estimate of d, and its asymptotic performance in terms of the Cramér-Rao lower bound is studied. Finally, some comments and conclusion will be presented in section 5.</p></div>

From Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">4</ref>, since the probability density function (PDF) under H 1 is not known exactly, it is not possible to design optimal detectors (in the Neyman-Pearson sense) by simply forming the likelihood ratio. The general structure of composite hypothesis testing is involved when unknown parameters appear in the PDFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. There are two major approaches for composite hypothesis testing. The first is to use explicit prior knowledge as to the likely values of parameters of interest and apply a Bayesian method to this detection problem. However, there is generally no such a priori information available. Alternately, the second approach, the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) first computes maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the unknown parameters, and then will use this estimated value to form the standard Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector. Our focus will be on GLRT-type methods because of less restrictive assumptions and easier computation and implementation; but most importantly, because uniformly most powerful (UMP) and locally most powerful (LMP) tests can be developed for the parameter range 0 ≤ d &lt; 1.</p><p>To be a bit more specific, consider the case where it is known that α = β = 1, with the parameter d unknown.

This is the approach we take.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">(Quadratic) Model Approximation</head><p>Much of the complexity we encountered in the earlier formulation of the problem can be remedied by appealing to an approximation of the signal model. This approximate model is derived by expanding the signal about the small parameter values around d = 0. As alluded to earlier, this approximation is quite adequate in the sense that all the parameter values of interest for resolution beyond the Rayleigh diffraction limit are contained in the range [0, 1] anyway.</p><p>We consider the Taylor series expansion of s(x k ; α, β, d) around d = 0, with all other variables fixed<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . More specifically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">s(x k ; α, β, d) ≈ s 0 (x k ) + dh 1 (x k ) + d 2 h 2 (x k )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">s 0 (x k ) = 2sinc 2 (x k ) (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">h 1 (x k ) = (α -β) sin(πx k )(sin(πx k ) -πx k sin(πx k )) π 2 x 3 k (14) h 2 (x k ) = (2π 2 x 3 k -3) cos(2πx k ) -4πx k sin(2πx k ) + 3 4π 2 x 4 k (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>In the above approximation, we elect to keep terms up to order 2 of the Taylor expansion.</p><p>This gives a rather more accurate representation of the signal, and more importantly, if we only kept the first order term, then in the case α = β, h 1 (x k ) would simply vanish and no term in d would appear in the approximation. The proposed approximation simplifies the hypothesis testing problem to essentially a linear detection problem (as we will see in next section). The approximation is helpful in that we can carry out our analysis more simply. In addition, it leads to a general form of locally optimum detectors as will be discussed later.</p><p>Refering to (4) and continuing with vector notation we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">s ≈ s 0 + dh 1 + d 2 h 2<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">s 0 = [s 0 (x 1 ), • • • , s 0 (x N )] T h 1 = [h 1 (x 1 ), • • • , h 1 (x N )] T h 2 = [h 2 (x 1 ), • • • , h 2 (x N )] T</formula><p>Writing in the form of hypotheses described earlier in (4):</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">   H 0 : f = s 0 + w H 1 : f = s 0 + dh 1 + d 2 h 2 + w<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Since s 0 is a common term in both hypotheses and it is independent from d, we may simplify further:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">   H 0 : y = w H 1 : y = dh 1 + d 2 h 2 + w<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where y = f -s 0 and the parameter d is unknown.</p><p>At this point, we can consider two related definitions of signal-to-noise ratio (both per sample). The first one (SNR m ) is the measured SNR per sample and the second (SNR s ) is the natural definition of SNR from the simplified hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">SNR m = s 0 + dh 1 + d 2 h 2 2 N σ 2<label>(19)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">= E 0 + d 2 (E 1 + 2E * ) + d 4 E 2 N σ 2<label>(20)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">SNR s = dh 1 + d 2 h 2 2 N σ 2 (21) = d 2 E 1 + d 4 E 2 N σ 2<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">E 0 = s T 0 s 0 (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">E 1 = h T 1 h 1 (24) E 2 = h T 2 h 2 (25) E * = s T 0 h 2<label>(26)</label></formula><p>as energy terms 3 . It is worth noting that</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">SNR m = SNR s + E 0 + 2d 2 E * N σ 2 = SNR s E 0 + d 2 (E 1 + 2E * ) + d 4 E 2 d 2 E 1 + d 4 E 2<label>(27)</label></formula><p>As we will see in next sections, it is more reasonable and intuitive to present the results in terms of measured SNR m .</p><p>3 Both SNR m and SNR s are independent of N (and f s ) since energy terms are all proportional to f s .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Detection Theory for the Approximated Model</head><p>In this section, we develop detection strategies for the hypothesis testing problem of interest based upon the approximated model. It is illuminating to study the various cases of interest in order. Namely, we will treat the problem when the intensity coefficients α and β are known or not known, and when these coefficients are equal or unequal.</p><p>As we began to describe earlier, when α = β, the hypothesis test will be reduced to the case of detecting a known signal with unknown positive amplitude (D = d 2 ). For this case, there exist well-known optimal detection strategies. In the interest of clarity and ease of exposition, we start with this case and will then extend it to the case of unequal intensities α = β, and the case with unknown intensities (α and β), in the following sections.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Generalized Locally Most Powerful Tests</head><p>An approach that is very similar to our signal approximation method is the locally most power detection (LMP) method. The LMP is a standard approach to obtaining asymptotic one-sided UMP tests. The LMP approach typically assumes that the parameter is a scalar and is used to test for values of the parameter that are near but greater than some fixed value (d = 0 in our case). Under these conditions, the LMP approach yields the largest P d for a fixed P f over all parameter values in this (one-sided) interval. To be more precise mathematically, the LMP test is derived by a local approximation of the original log-likelihood function. In our case this is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">p(f, d, H 1 ) p(f, H 0 ) &gt; γ ⇒ L(f, d) = ln p(f, d, H 1 ) -ln p(f, H 0 ) &gt; ln γ (53)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">p(f, d, H 1 ) = 1 √ 2πσ 2 N exp(- 1 2σ 2 f -s 2 ) (<label>54</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_59">)</formula><p>The Taylor series about d = 0 gives:</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">L(f, d) ≈ ln p(f, d)| d=0 + ∂ln p(f, d, H 1 ) ∂d | d=0 d + 1 2 ∂ 2 ln p(f, d, H 1 ) ∂d 2 | d=0 d 2<label>(55)</label></formula><p>We note here that in the literature, the LMP typically refers to the case where only the first order term in the approximation is retained. In our case, we retain terms up to second order.</p><p>In any case, after some algebra, the derived test statistic can be shown to have the following form <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">T LMP (y) = dT 1 + d 2 T 2<label>(56)</label></formula><p>The apparent difficulty in the implementation of this detector is that the value of d is, of course, unknown to the detector. A generalization, based on the same thinking as that in the GLRT framework is again to use the distinct (and independent) estimates of d and d 2 (i.e. d and d 2 ) instead <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> . By doing so, we define the generalized LMP detector as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">T GLMP (y) = dT 1 + d 2 T 2 (57) = E 1 d 2 + E 2 d 2 2 (58) = T 2 1 E 1 + T 2 2 E 2<label>(59)</label></formula><p>A more intuitive and direct interpretation of this detector is that instead of maximizing p(f, d, H Fortunately, since T 1 and T 2 are independent variables as discussed earlier, the PDF of T GLMP is easily shown to be a Chi-Squared under both H 0 and H 1 . From <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> the exact detection performance of the test T GLMP &gt; γ is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">P f = Q χ 2 2 (γ) (<label>61</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_64">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_65">P d = Q χ 2 2 (λ) (γ) (62) λ = SNR s = d 2 E 1 + d 4 E 2 σ 2 (63)</formula><p>where Q χ 2 2 is the right tail probabilities for a Central Chi-Squared PDF with 2 degrees of freedom, and Q χ 2 2 (λ) is the right tail probability for a non-central Chi-Squared PDF with 2 degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter λ. In order to perform the same analysis as Section 4.1 (i.e. d min vs. SNR curve), we start by computing the required λ (or SNR s ) from the above expressions, based on the fixed values of P d and P f . Then, using the relation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">27</ref>), we will have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">SNR m = SNR s (P f , P d ) E 0 + (E 1 + 2E * )d 2 + E 2 d 4 E 1 d 2 + E 2 d 4 (<label>64</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_67">)</formula><p>where SNR s (P f , P d ) represents the value of SNR s as a function of the desired P f and P d . For instance with P d = 0.99 and P f = 10 -6 we have:  detector, it is useful to compare its performance (in terms of minimum detectable d) against the "best" case where the parameter d is actually known. In fact, a comparison in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> demonstrates that, happily (and perhaps rather unexpectedly), the curves are very close, implying that the performance of GLMP is very close to the optimal detector which knows d.</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">SNR m = 56.29 70 π 4 -7 π 2 αβd 2 + d 4 N ( 7 π 2 (α -β) 2 d 2 + d 4 )<label>(65)</label></formula><p>Another natural question one may ask is how this detector can be compared with the rather more complicated nonlinear detector described in relations (37) and ( <ref type="formula">38</ref>). The performance of this direct detector was studied via Monte-Carlo simulations, and the comparison with the GLMP detector is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, again indicating the GLMP to be very near optimal. That is, for a fixed d, the required SNR for resolving two closely-spaced unequally bright point sources is smaller than the SNR required to resolve two equally spaced sources. This results seems counter-intuitive. Yet, the reason behind it is somewhat clear in hindsight. Equal α and β produce a perfectly symmetric signal (without noise) and therefore result in redundancy in the measured signal content. With unequal α and β, an anti-symmetric part is added to signal information and better decision is made possible. More specifically, the incoherent sum of two equal amplitude sincs, "looks" more like one larger sinc.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">The case of unknown α and β</head><p>With the earlier machinery in place, in this section we discuss the general case where neither the intensities α and β, nor the distance d, are known 6 .

So the GLMP detector for the case of known but unequal, α and β, performs precisely as well as the GLRT detector for unknown α and β. Again, this seems rather counter-intuitive, but the intuitive reason for this is that the coefficient α -β in (69) essentially captures the uncertainty of the relationship between d and d 2 , where in the GLMP detector, this relationship is essentially ignored.</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref>   We have set out in this paper to address the question of resolution from a sound statistical viewpoint. In particular, we have explicitly answered a very practical question: What is the minimum detectable distance between two point sources imaged incoherently at a given signalto-noise ratio? Or equivalently, what is the minimum SNR required to discriminate two point sources separated by a distance smaller than the Rayleigh limit? We explicitly studied three different cases: known equal intensities, known unequal intensities, and unknown intensities. In order to use standard hypothesis testing frameworks like locally most powerful tests, the original highly nonlinear problem was approximated using a quadratic model in the parameter d. We also discussed asymptotic performance for estimation of the parameter d (distance). The analysis has been carried out in one dimension to facilitate the presentation and to yield maximum intuition.</p><p>We have begun the analysis in 2-D, including studies as a function of different aperture shapes and lenses, and the complete 2-D (spatial integration) sampling model. This 2-D analysis is not so different in spirit from the 1-D case, but is significantly more messy; so we have elected to defer its presentation to the near future.</p><p>The major conclusion of this paper is that for a given imaging scenario (in this case, incoherent imaging through a slit), with required probabilities of detection and false alarm, the minimum resolvable separation between two sources from uniformly sampled data can be derived explicitly as a function of the SNR per sample of the imaging array, and the sampling rate. The most useful rule of thumb we glean from these results is that for the case of equal intensities, the minimum resolvable distance is essentially proportional to the inverse of the SNR to the fractional power of 1/4. The proportionality constant was shown to be a function of the probabilities of detection and false alarm. In deriving these results, we have unified and generalized much of the literature on this topic that, while sparse, has spanned the course of roughly 4 decades.</p><p>Many interesting questions remain to be studied. Of these, the analysis of the problem as a function of the sampling rate and sampling strategy come to mind. For instance, it is useful to study the performance in the presence of aliasing (i.e. sub-Nyquist sampling). It would also be useful to study the effect of nonuniform sampling on performance.</p><p>It is important to note that the strategy for the analysis of resolution we have put forward here is very generally applicable to other types of imaging systems. Once the point-spread function of the imaging system is known, the signal model s(x; d) is determined, and the same line of reasoning can be carried out. The optical imaging scenario we have described here should really be thought of as a canonical example of the application of the general strategy we propose for studying resolution. Extensions of these ideas can also be considered to study limits to resolution for indirect imaging such as in computed tomography.</p><p>As for other extensions and applications in optical imaging, an appealing direction is to study the limits to super-resolution from video <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The analysis presented here can help answer questions regarding the ability of image super-resolution methods to integrate multiple low resolution frames to produce a high resolution image from aliased data. Finally, we wish to mention that this paper, we hope, represents one step forward in an overall methodology for studying imaging and image processing that appeals directly to concepts in information theory. This approach and point of view has been sorely lacking in the imaging community, and we hope that it will become more pervasive in the years to come. </p><formula xml:id="formula_98">E 1 = h T 1 h 1 = f s π 2 (α -β) 2 15 (<label>107</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_99">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_100">E 2 = h T 2 h 2 = f s 2π 4 105 (<label>108</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_101">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_102">E * = s T 0 h 2 = f s 4π 2 15 (<label>109</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_103">)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_104">h T 1 s 0 = h T 1 h 2 = 0 (110)</formula><p>Note that in every case the energy terms are proportional to the sampling rate.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_11"><head>Figure 9 :</head><label>9</label><figDesc>Figure 10 the value of d = 0.2 is fixed, and the CRLB for d is shown over a range of values of α. The graph demonstrates the effect of the difference of α and β on the CRLB. As seen in this figure, the CRLB for unknown α and β is almost fixed over a wide range of α; but for known α and β, there is a rapid decay away from the position α = β = 1. The observed phenomenon is counter-intuitive, but can be readily explained by looking at the derivatives we computed in the calculation of the CRLB. With unequal intensities, the shape of the overall signal is dramatically different than the case when α = β = 1. This difference is accentuated further as the value of α -β becomes larger. More specifically, when α -β = 0, the shape of the overall function is dominated by one or the other peak, whereas in the case α = β, the signal always maintains a symmetric shape regardless of the value of d. The observed behavior is consistent with what we saw before where we demonstrated that unequal α and β yields improved detection.</figDesc></figure>
