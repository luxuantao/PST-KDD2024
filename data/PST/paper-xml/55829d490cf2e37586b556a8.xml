<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An undesirable side effect of many watermarking and data-hiding schemes is that the host signal into which auxiliary data is embedded is distorted. Finding an optimal balance between the amount of information embedded and the induced distortion is therefore an active field of research. In recent years, with the rediscovery of Costa's seminal paper Writing on Dirty Paper, there has been considerable progress in understanding the fundamental limits of the capacity versus distortion of watermarking and data-hiding schemes. For some applications, however, no distortion resulting from auxiliary data, however small, is allowed. In these cases the use of reversible data-hiding methods provide a way out. A reversible data-hiding scheme is defined as a scheme that allows complete and blind restoration (i.e. without additional signaling) of the original host data. Practical reversible data-hiding schemes have been proposed by Fridrich et al., but little attention has been paid to the theoretical limits. It is the purpose of this paper to repair this situation and to provide some first results on the limits of reversible data-hiding. Admittedly, the examples providedin this paper are toy examples, but they are indicative of more practical schemes that will be presented in subsequent papers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In 1999 it was observed that data-hiding is closely related to the information-theoretical concept o i "channels with side-information". E.g. Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Chen and Womell <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and Moulin and O'Sullivan <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> realized that (in the Gaussian case) there is a connection between data-hiding and Costa's writing on dirty paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Coding theorems for data-hiding situations appeared in Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (specialized to the Gaussian case), Moulin and O'Sullivan <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Barron [l], and Willems [SI.</p><p>In the present paper we will focus on data-hiding schemes that are reversible, i.e. data-hiding schemes with the additional constraint that the original host signal can be restored from the received signal. These type of datahiding schemes are important in cases where no degradation of the original host signal is allowed. This is for example true for medical imagery, military imagery and multimedia archives of valuable original works.</p><p>The literature on reversible data-hiding is not very extensive yet. A good overview of the history and the stateof-the-art of reversible data-hiding can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Referring to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the general idea of current methods is simple. A set B of features of a signal X is derived such that (i) B can be losslessly compressed, and such that (ii) randomization of B has little impact. Lossless data-hiding is then achieved by lossless compression of B , concatenating the bitstream with auxiliary data and replacing the original set B. Most of the results available in literature focus on practical methods and have little information theoretic aspects. In tlus paper a first attempt is made at deriving theoretical bounds.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we set the notation. In Section 3 we provide a simple example that will be used to show that the general approach sketched above is not optimal. Section 4 states the main result and gives an outline of the proof. In Section 5 and Section 6 we apply the main result to the simple example and show that we can do better than the straightforward compression and filling the gap with auxiliary data. The coding scheme presented in Section 6 is inspired by the methods introduced in [5]. for some probability distribution ( P ( x ) : x E X ) .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A FIRST EXAMPLE</head><p>Consider the case of a memoryless source with binary alphabet X = (0, l ] with Hamming distance as distortion measure. Let po = Pr(X = 0) and p1 = Pr(X = 1). In this case it is quite easy to construct a reversible datahiding scheme with distortion D,, = 0.5. All that is needed is a coding scheme C that compresses a string of x r into a string y f , where K is approximately equal to n H ( p 0 ) . A reversible data-hiding scheme is now obtained by appending N (1 -H (PO)) auxiliary symbols to y f , resulting in a marked sequence y r . As the bits of the compressed seqpence y f are uncorrelated with those of x r , and the auxiliary data are randomly chosen, one easily sees that the distortion D,, between x;" and y r is equal to 0.5. It is also clear that x," can be decoded from y;": an appropriate prefix of y ;" is decoded until N symbols are obtained. The remainder of the symbols in y ;" are then to be interpreted as auxiliary data. The information rate is clearly equal to I -H ( p 0 ) . This construction can be slightly generalized by timesharing, i.e. by performing the construction above on only a fraction a of the symbols in x ;". The resulting distortion and information rate are then given D,, = a / 2 md p = a (1 -H (PO)). In summary, using an optimal compression code C we can achieve a rate-distortion line</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I Psimple(A) = 2A(1 -H ( P o ) ) . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>The above method of reversible data-hiding is essentially the same method as being proposed by Fridrich et al.</p><p>[7]. In their approach for say still images, a number of least significant bit planes is compressed (using the context from the higher bit planes), replacing the original bit planes. The bit gap that is created, is used to embed auxiliary data. The question that we address in this paper is the following: can we do better than simply compression and bit replacement? In the sections below we prove that in general the result as given in Equation 8 is not optimal. We will also construct codes such that the ration p / A is larger than 2(1 -H (PO)).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Recursive Reversible Embedding</head><p>The basic ingredient of the recipe is an embedding scheme D as above(no requirements on reversibility) with average distortion D,, and rate R. Let x;" be a sequence from a given memoryless source, N sufficiently large. The sequence is segmented into disjoint intervals of length K , such that the ratio N / K is sufficiently large. A message mi of size K R is embedded in the first segment, resulting in a segment y r . A priori it is not possible to reconstruct x r from y:. The amount of information needed to reconstruct x: is equal to H ( X k l Y F ) . The proposed method embeds this reconstruction information for the first interval in the second interval, leaving room for K R -H ( X r I Y F ) bits of auxiliary information. Similarly as for the first interval, reconstruction information for the second interval is embedded in the third interval. This process is continued recursively until the one but last segment of the sequence x;". For this last segment of x;", the naive method of Section 3 is used to complete the construction to a fully reversible data-hiding method.</p><p>The following theorem summarizes the result. As a simple application of this theorem, we consider again the binary Bemouilli source of Section 3 with p o = 0.9. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> we consider a data-hiding method D constructed from a Hamming codes. In particular we consider as a first example a Hamming code of length 3. The method given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> embeds auxiliary information into a sequence x r by modifying in each disjoint triple of symbols at most one sample. The modification is such that the embedded information can be read from the two bits in the syndrome computed over the triple. Assuming that the auxiliary bits of the auxiliary data have a random distribution, the average distortion and rate are given by D,, = 114 and p = H(Y:IX:)/3 = 2/3, respectively. The conditional entropy term H(X:IY:) is easily computed, resulting in a reversible data-hiding construction with distortion 1/4 and rate 0.3786. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> the results of this construction for Hamming codes with block lengths 1 , 3 , 7 , 15, 3 1 and 63 have been plotted. We observe that the constructed rate-distortion pairs all lie above the time-sharing line and (as expected) below the curve for symmetrical test channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 1. Note that the test channels derived from the</head><p>Hamming codes are memoryless when viewed as a block channel. However; the channel is not memoryless when viewed as a channel on separate symbols. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>.

In each of the three sets of curves, the top curve corresponds to prev, the middle curve to psym and the iiottnm curve to time-sharing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Non-Reversible Embedding based on Hamming codes</head><p>To describe the embedding code consider the (7, 4,3) binary Hamming code. Fix a certain coset C,, for some message w = 0, 1 , . . . , 7 . Consider the vector containing the 7 host symbols X I , x2, . ' . , x7. Denote this binary vector by x : . Now determine the composite vector y: E C, which is closest to x : in Hamming-sense.</p><p>First we determine the maximum average distortion D, of t h s embedding method. The Hamming code is perfect and has dmin = 3, thus we will find a word y l E C , at Hamming distance 1 from x: with probability 7/8 and a word at distance 0 with probability 118. Hence D,, = 718 x 117 = 118. The decoder determines from the vector y ! the coset to which it belongs, hence reliable transmission is possible with rate R = (log2 8)/7 = 3/7 bitlsymbol. Thus we achieve (D,,, R ) = (1/8,3/7). The RID,,-ratio = 24/7, which is a factor 12/7 larger than the rate-distortion ratio by bit substitution.</p><p>We can now design a series of embedding codes, based on binary Hamming codes.
