<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Wearability will significantly increase the use of haptics in everyday life, as has already happened for audio and video technologies. The literature on wearable haptics is mainly focused on vibrotactile stimulation, and only recently, wearable devices conveying richer stimuli, like force vectors, have been proposed. This paper introduces design guidelines for wearable haptics and presents a novel 3-DoF wearable haptic interface able to apply force vectors directly to the fingertip. It consists of two platforms: a static one, placed on the back of the finger, and a mobile one, responsible for applying forces at the finger pad. The structure of the device resembles that of parallel robots, where the fingertip is placed in between the static and the moving platforms. This work presents the design of the wearable display, along with the quasi-static modeling of the relationship between the applied forces and the platform's orientation and displacement. The device can exert up to 1.5 N, with a maximum platform inclination of 30 degree. To validate the device and verify its effectiveness, a curvature discrimination experiment was carried out: employing the wearable device together with a popular haptic interface improved the performance with respect of employing the haptic interface alone.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>W EARABILITY will open many opportunities to exploit haptics in everyday life and will improve the way humans interact with each other and the surrounding environment. Think, for instance, about the possibility of taking your haptic interface wherever you go, use it to get in touch with your family while you are abroad <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, touch the brand new sofa you are about to buy, or telemanipulate a remote robotic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Wearable haptic systems shall be comfortable to be carried around and well integrated into people habits, with the aim of providing valuable services to the users. Moreover, they shall be intrinsically integrated with the human body and fit it without constraining its motion, or requiring additional voluntary actions to be held.</p><p>Many haptic devices have been studied and designed to be portable or wearable, and there are three main approaches used to generate haptic feedback in wearable devices: 1) systems generating vibrations, 2) pin-arrays locally deforming the skin to simulate a given shape, and 3) mechanisms applying three-dimensional vector forces at one or more contact points.</p><p>Vibrotactile feedback became popular in the 1990s with the advent of mobile phones and the innovative DualShock game controller produced by Sony. Nowadays, one of the most popular portable device providing vibrations is the game interface Wii Remote motion controller (Nintendo Co. Ltd., Japan). The form factor and weight of this device facilitate its portability. However, it can only provide very simple vibrating patterns, limiting its possibility of properly simulating any rich contact interaction with virtual or remote objects. Traylor and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> presented a vibrating wearable device able to impart directional information on the user's back. The tactile display consisted of a single tactor strapped to the volar side of the user's forearm. An accelerometer was placed on top of the tactor to record its displacement during signal delivery. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> developed a 5-DoF arm suit able to guide the motion of the wearer by providing solely vibrotactile feedback. The suit was composed of eight vibrotactile actuators distributed throughout the right arm, whose frequency and amplitude were independently controlled. Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> developed a vibrotactile display to provide safety information to drivers. The device was placed on top of the foot and was composed of a 5 Â 5 array of vibrating motors. More recently, a vibrating haptic bracelet has been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for humanrobot interaction in leader-follower formation tasks. The bracelet consisted of three vibrating motors providing the user with relevant information about robot formation. For all these wearable devices, the stimuli applied to the user consisted of sinusoidal signals varying in their intensity and frequency. Although these haptic devices can be considered wearable, their force feedback is limited to vibrations, thus limiting their possibility of simulating richer force patterns. The second approach for providing haptic force feedback with wearable devices deals with dynamic pin arrays. Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> developed a cutaneous display composed of a 6 Â 5 pin-array, actuated by piezoelectric bimorph actuators. It was able to display planar and Braille cell patterns to the fingertips. Pin-arrays are also employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, where the authors used a solenoid, a permanent magnet, and an elastic spring to develop a miniature cutaneous module. Although this kind of display is very flexible and effective, it usually employs a large number of actuators, which compromises the overall wearability and portability of the system. For this reason, Sarakoglou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed a compact 4 Â 4 tactors array, remotely actuated through a flexible tendon transmission. Their implementation achieved a compact design, but it still required an external drive unit for the actuation system, thus compromising portability.</p><p>The third approach to wearable haptics consists of applying three-dimensional force vectors at given points on the human body. These devices are the closest, in terms of interaction modality, to grounded haptic interfaces, since both are able to apply forces at one contact point. Their distinguishing characteristic is that they need one motor for each component of the force to be independently rendered, and, for this reason, it is quite difficult to make them wearable and portable.</p><p>Glove-type haptic displays, such as the CyberGrasp (CyberGlove Systems LLC, San Jose, CA), are the most popular devices of this type and they can provide force vectors to all five fingers of the hand simultaneously. However, the mechanics of these displays is usually rather complex, thus compromising their wearability and portability. Wearability of this kind of device has been dramatically improved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, where Minamizawa et al. presented a wearable and portable ungrounded haptic display able to apply cutaneous forces to simulate weight sensations of virtual objects. The approach was based on the novel insight that cutaneous sensations make a reliable weight illusion, even when the kinesthetic information is absent. The device consisted of two motors and a belt able to deform the fingertip. When motors spun in opposite directions, the belt applied a force perpendicular to user's fingertip, while if motors spun in the same direction, the belt applied a shear force to the skin. That device was also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to examine the role of cutaneous and kinesthetic feedback in weight sensations, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for experiences of remote tactile interaction. However, the device proposed by Minamizawa et al. was only able to render forces in two directions: the force control was open loop and it was not very accurate. The main issue was that its control accuracy largely depended on the viscoelastic parameters of the fingerpad, which change with different subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. More recently, Solazzi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> developed an effective 3-DoF wearable cutaneous display, but the portability and wearability of the device was limited by its mechanical structure. The motors were placed on the forearm and two cables for each actuated finger were necessary to transmit the motor torque. Provancher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed a fingertip device with two degrees of freedom. The device used two RC servo motors and a compliant flexure stage to create planar motion. The servos could operate simultaneously, allowing motion along any path in a plane. Another interesting device has been developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, where the authors presented a fingertip device which provided the user with the cutaneous sensation of making and breaking contact with virtual surfaces. However, this display had no actuation and relied on the haptic feedback provided by the haptic device it was attached to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Contribution</head><p>This paper introduces design guidelines for the development of wearable haptic devices and presents a novel 3-DoF wearable display able to apply cutaneous forces to the finger pad. A prototype of the device, worn on the index fingertip, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>.</p><p>This work has been inspired by the gravity grabber interface, presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which generates forces by means of a single cable and two actuators. The device proposed here greatly differs from it, since it is designed as a 3-DoF parallel mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>: the static part is fixed on the back of the finger, and the mobile platform, or end effector, is in contact with the finger pulp. The device applies normal and tangential shear forces to the fingertip by controlling the tension of three cables by means of three actuators. Moreover, to avoid calibration problems, the cutaneous device integrates force sensors between the finger and the mobile platform. A closed-loop control of force is thus possible, and increases force control accuracy. The wearability of cutaneous devices, like the one proposed in this paper and the gravity grabber, is gained at the expense of kinesthetic feedback, which is missing.</p><p>The 3-DoF wearable interface has been preliminarily presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In this paper, we extend the discussion on wearability, the analysis of the model, and control of the device, its performance evaluation, and we introduce design guidelines for the development of wearable haptic devices.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents guidelines for the development of a wearable haptic interface, along with the structure and working principles of the proposed device. Section 3 discusses the device closed-loop control. An experiment, carried out to validate the device and verify its effectiveness in the reproduction of cutaneous sensations, is presented and discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 6 gives concluding remarks and perspectives of the work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">WEARABLE FINGERTIP HAPTIC DEVICE 2.1 Design Guidelines</head><p>Most of the well-known haptic devices for single-point contact interaction, such as the Omega (Force Dimension, Nyon, Switzerland) or the Phantom (Sensable group, Geomagic, 3D Systems, Rock Hill, SC), provide kinesthetic feedback to the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, these devices also provide cutaneous feedback to the fingertips if we assume that the interaction with the virtual environment is mediated by a stylus, a ball, or any other tool mounted on the haptic interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These devices are known as grounded interfaces (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>) and, although they are very accurate and able to provide a wide range of forces, their form factor is very far from being portable and wearable.</p><p>Wearability in haptics is gained with the body-grounded design of exoskeletons, where the robotic system is worn by the human operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, the main drawback of body-grounded haptics is that two forces are applied to the user: the contact force simulating the interaction and an undesired reaction force, which counterbalances the first one (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). A good design principle is to distribute this reaction force onto a large contact surface, thus making it less perceivable than the one employed to simulate the contact interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>To improve wearability, we need to go beyond exoskeletons, reducing the mechanical complexity of the device. This may be obtained by moving the body-grounded base as close as possible to the point of application of the force, as sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>, where the base has been moved from the forearm to the nail. Removing the exoskeleton makes the devices extremely wearable, but presents the drawback of reducing the haptic interaction to cutaneous stimuli only, since the kinesthetic component cannot be provided anymore <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, reducing haptic feedback to the cutaneous component only should not be seen as a problem, but as an opportunity to design more wearable devices. Indeed, recent studies assert that cutaneous stimuli are fundamental in recognizing shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, in curvature discrimination tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and to improve the illusion of presence in virtual and remote environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. We, therefore, expect cutaneous feedback to provide the user with a reliable illusion of telepresence, as the cutaneous force feedback is perceived where it is expected (i.e., the fingertip) and provides the operator with a direct and colocated perception of the contact force, even though kinesthesia is missing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fingernail-Grounded Device</head><p>The proposed wearable fingertip device, which implements the design guidelines discussed above, is sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, while a prototype worn on the index fingertip is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. The device is able to provide cutaneous forces only and it is composed of two main parts: the first one (named B in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) is grounded to the fingernail and supports three small DC motors (named A in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), while the active part is composed of a mobile contact platform placed on the fingertip's volar surface (C). These two parts are connected by three wires (F) whose lengths and strains are controlled by the motors through three pulleys (E). The actuators we used for the prototype are three 0615S motors (Dr. Fritz Faulhaber GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Scho ¨naich, DE), with planetary gear-heads having 16:1 reduction ratio. The maximum stall torque of the motors, after the gearbox, is 3.52 mNm. The mobile platform has a Y shape and allows simulation of contact interaction with slanted surfaces. The desired contact surface orientation is achieved by modifying the forces applied to the platform vertices. Three 400 FSR (Interlink Electronics, Camarillo, CA) piezoresistive force sensors (D in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) are placed near to the platform vertices, in contact with the finger, to measure the force applied to the fingertip. They have a diameter of 5 mm and a thickness of 0.3 mm. The small size makes them very transparent to the user and easily integrated with the device. These sensors are also useful for the initial calibration of the cutaneous system, since different fingertips require different initial positions of the mobile platform.</p><p>The contact force applied by the device to the finger pad is balanced by the structure of the device, which exerts a counterbalancing force on the back of the finger and the nail. However, the force applied by the device is still mainly perceived on the finger pad, rather than on its back, since the static structure has a larger contact surface with respect to the active mobile platform (see <ref type="bibr">Section 4.2 and [20]</ref>). The local pressure is, thus, much lower. Moreover, the back of the finger, especially the nail, is less sensitive to tactile stimuli than the finger pulp. The nail also prevents problems regarding the compliance of the tissue, which may otherwise require a higher displacement to produce perceptible forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>The mobile platform and the mechanical support for the actuators are made with a special type of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, called ABSPlus (Stratasys, Eden Prairie, MN). The device can be also embedded in a finger glove, to fasten it tightly to the user's finger and make it easier to wear (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). The total weight of the prototype device, including sensors, actuators, wires, and the mechanical support is about 30 g. It is worth noting that the device has no direct measurement of motor/cable position and that it is powered by two external 3.7 V 2 Ah batteries, which can be placed on the user's wrist. A cable then connects the device to its batteries. It is also worth highlighting that these cables, one for each cutaneous device being worn, could compromise the overall wearability and portability of the system. For this reason, in the next future, we are going to develop a glove embedding the finger-worn devices, the batteries, and the cables. The evaluation of the perceived wearability of the system will be discussed in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Force and Fingertip Deformation</head><p>The device actuators, through the wires, move the platform on the fingertip. Let us indicate with ¼ ½p x p y p z T the displacement of the platform from an initial reference equilibrium condition in which the fingertip is not stimulated. Since the finger pulp is compliant, the displacement of the platform produces a deformation of the fingertip that leads to a contact stress distribution. In a quasi-static condition, the stress distribution on the fingertip is balanced by the wrench w p applied by the platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. A relationship between platform configuration and wrench w p can be, thus, assessed.</p><p>Toward this objective, let us recall some of the mathematical and numerical models for the human fingertip which have been proposed in the literature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, for example, Srinivasan and Dankekar described a 2D continuum fingertip model, in which the finger was approximated by a homogeneous, isotropic, and incompressible elastic material. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, Serina et al. proposed a model incorporating both inhomogeneity and geometry of the fingertip. The underformed fingertip was modeled as an axial symmetric ellipsoidal elastic membrane, filled with a incompressible fluid with an internal pressure. The model was 2D and an external load was applied to the finger through a flat surface. The model predicted a pulp force/displacement relationship which could be represented as a nonlinear hardening spring, i.e., whose stiffness increases with the applied load. Most of the displacement was reached with a load of 1 N, which corresponded to a displacement of about 2 mm. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Wu et al. presented a 2D finite-element model of the fingertip: the skin was modeled as a hyperelastic and viscoelastic membrane, and the subcutaneous layer was considered a biphase material. Nakazawa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> studied the force/deformation behavior of the fingertips in the lateral, or shearing, direction. The impedance characteristics of the fingertip in the direction tangential to the tip surface were experimentally measured, and a simplified Kelvin model was adopted to describe the relationship between applied shear force and finger deformation. The experiments showed that the fingertips have different stiffness properties in the shearing direction, for example, the thumb was found stiffer than any other finger. Moreover, the shearing stiffness depended on the force direction: fingers were found stiffer in the pointing direction than in the lateral one. Actually, the stress/strain behavior of the fingertip under shearing forces is nonlinear: Wang and Hayward <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> experimentally quantified the anisotropic and hysteretic behavior of fingertip deformation under the application of shear forces.</p><p>In this paper, we consider a simplified model of the fingertip, i.e., a linear relationship between resultant wrench and platform displacement. In other terms, we assume that the platform configuration is proportional to the wrench w p ¼ ½f T p m T p T 2 &lt; 6 applied to the mobile platform</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">¼ K À1 w p ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where K 2 &lt; 6Â6 is the fingertip stiffness matrix. An isotropic elastic behavior is considered here for the sake of simplicity, so that the stiffness value is the same for all the elements of the matrix diagonal:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">K ¼ k t I 0 0 k r I</formula><p>! with k t ¼ 0:5 N/m and k r ¼ 0:5 Nm/rad <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Three-DoF Actuated Platform</head><p>The mobile platform is actuated by three cables whose lengths and strengths are controlled by three motors. The main geometrical parameters of the device are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. B 1 , B 2 , and B 3 are the points, on the platform, where the cables, linking the mobile patch to the three actuators, pass. The reference frame s 1 ¼ hx; y; zi is fixed to the mobile platform and its origin P 1 is placed at the geometric center of the triangle defined by points B i . Let A 1 , A 2 , and A 3 be the vertices of the fixed platform and s 0 ¼ hX; Y ; Zi a reference frame on that platform, whose origin is located at P 0 . A i and B i coordinates are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, expressed with respect to s 0 and s 1 reference frames, respectively. Transformation from frame s 1 to the fixed frame s 0 is described by a vector p ¼ P 1 À P 0 and a 3 Â 3 rotation matrix R 0 1 , defined as a function of the yaw (), pitch (), and roll () angles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Statics</head><p>Let T ¼ ½T 1 T 2 T 3 T be the vector of force magnitudes applied by the wires to the platform. These forces are balanced by the wrench due to the deformation of the fingertip. The following equilibrium condition, thus, holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w p ¼ J T T ;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where J is the Jacobian matrix of the structure, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">J ¼ s T 1 ðb 1 Â s 1 Þ T s T 2 ðb 2 Â s 2 Þ T s T 3 ðb 3 Â s 3 Þ T 2 6 4 3 7 5;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where s i represent the unit vectors describing the direction of the cable force and b i the coordinates of points B i , expressed with respect to frame s 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>We observe that a generic wrench w p can be reproduced by the platform if it belongs to the &lt; 6 subspace, whose basis is defined by the columns of J T . In this case, the corresponding cable tensions can be evaluated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T ¼ J T À Á # w p ;<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where ðJ T Þ # is the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian transpose.</p><p>If we neglect the friction between the cable and the finger skin, cable strength can be assumed constant over the cable, and then, the relationship between actuator torques and cable strengths is simply given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Q i ¼ T i r i ;<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where r i ; i ¼ 1; 2; 3 represents the radius of the ith actuator pulley.</p><p>On the other hand, if the friction between the wires and the lateral part of the fingertip cannot be neglected, the relationship between cable strengths at the motor side, T a;i , and those at the mobile side, T i , can be approximated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T a;i ¼ T i e f i ;<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where f represents the friction coefficient between the wire and the skin, and i ; i ¼ 1; 2; 3 is the adhesion angle with the fingertip, depending on the fingertip curvature radius and on the length of the contact arc between the wire and the fingertip surface.</p><p>Let us also recall that the mobile platform includes three force sensors, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Since their sensing areas are placed next to the platform vertices, we can assume that the measured forces F m;i ; i ¼ 1; 2; 3 are applied in B 1 , B 2 , and B 3 , respectively. This assumption is partially validated by preliminary experimental tests which showed that sensors' measures are well decoupled: by actuating one motor at a time, we registered significant force variation on the corresponding sensor only, while in the other two, the force sensed was negligible. We can then assume that force sensors measure the component of each cable force normal to the platform, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F m;i ¼ T i s i Á k ¼ T i cos i ;<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where T i is the cable tension, k the unit vector parallel to direction z, and i the angle between the z axis and the s i vector (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that F m;i depends both on the amplitude of cable tension T i and on the configuration of the mobile platform. In particular, angle i can be evaluated as a function of the relative configuration between the fixed and the mobile platform, and according to the fingertip geometry and curvature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Kinematics</head><p>The distance between platforms' vertices d i ¼ B i À A i , for a given displacement p and an angular configuration, can be evaluated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">c i ¼ kd i k ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi a 2 i þ b 2 i À 2a i b i q i ¼ 1; 2; 3;<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>where c i is the distance between the ith vertices, and a i , i ¼ 1; 2; 3, represent the coordinates of points A i , expressed with respect to frame s 0 .

Assume also that the initial platform configuration ð0Þ is known and that the sampling time is small, so that the variation of configuration between two consecutive integration steps is small, i.e., for a generic time step j, ðjÞ ffi ðj À 1Þ.</p><p>The estimation algorithm is reported in the block diagram shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and summarized below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CONTROL</head><p>The device described in the preceding sections is inherently underactuated: since it has only three motors, no more than three components of force/displacement can be controlled, independently, at the same time. For example, if we need to control the three Cartesian components of the contact force resultant, by acting on the cable strengths, we cannot, at the same time, choose the orientation of the platform. On the other hand, when controlling platform orientation, the device can rotate the platform in the X and Y (lateral and longitudinal) directions and the remaining available degree of freedom can be used to regulate contact force magnitude. In this case, the direction of the contact force cannot be controlled.</p><p>The coupling between the applied contact force and the platform position depends essentially on the fingertip compliance matrix. We present here two control strategies: the first one looks at the three Cartesian components of the force, exchanged between the platform and the fingertip, while the second one looks at the platform configuration. When one of the two control schemes is chosen, the uncontrolled parameters vary according to the whole system equilibrium. This coupling is inherently connected to the underactuated nature of the device. It is also worth noting that the device cannot control all the possible configuration and force spaces. To improve the control capabilities, the number of actuators should be increased, affecting the overall wearability of the system.</p><p>The first control scheme, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, aims at controlling cable strengths T r . The second scheme, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and referred to as the position-control scheme, aims at controlling platform orientation. The details of these control strategies are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, for the sake of completeness, the block diagrams and the main features are summarized here. In both the schemes, each motor is controlled by a closed-loop chain with a PD controller. The reference signal is transmitted via a USB-to-serial converter interface with a sampling time of t s ¼ 0:01 s.</p><p>An application in which the force-control scheme would be useful is the one described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where cutaneous stimuli were employed in a 1-DoF teleoperated needle insertion task. On the other hand, position control is suitable for applications in which the shape of the virtual contact surface is more important than the contact force. An example of this type of application is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, in which the authors investigated the influence of cutaneous feedback on convex surface recognition.</p><p>Both control schemes are based on force and position estimation (FPE) procedures, which depend on the finger compliance model and are referred to as FPE in the block diagrams in Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>. In this work, we considered a linear model for the finger compliance, as described in Section 2.3. Work is in progress to investigate the sensitivity of the control performance on the finger compliance and the possibility of using different and more complex finger models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Force Control</head><p>We characterize the force control accuracy using three measures. Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref> shows the control system performance when a step signal is applied to the reference values of the cable strengths T r . The reference force was the same for each cable: T r;i ¼ 0:3 N, for i ¼ 1; 2; 3. In the figure, the reference value (dashed) and the estimated cable strengths Ti are shown. Results show that the estimated forces reach the reference value with a rise time of about 0.1 s and an error in the stationary phase lower than 2 percent. The system bandwidth is about 10 Hz. Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref> shows the behavior of the device when the force reference signal is sinusoidal:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">T r;i ¼ 0:15 sinðtÞ þ 0:15 ð Þ N; for i ¼ 1; 2; 3:</formula><p>We also evaluated the error between a reference force and the one registered by the force sensor. Five subjects (four males, one female) were asked to wear one cutaneous device on their index finger. The system then applied the sinusoidal reference force T r;i at each wire i ¼ 1; 2; 3, for t 2 ½0; 180. The RMS error was 0.021 N and its standard deviation was 0.011 N.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Position Control</head><p>To evaluate the accuracy of the position control system, an additional experimental test was performed. We fixed a three-axis accelerometer on the external surface of the mobile platform, the one not in contact with the fingertip, and we asked a user to wear this modified haptic device on his index finger. The system then simulated the contact between the finger and an arbitrarily oriented surface for N s ¼ 100 iterations. At each repetition, the system chose a random platform configuration r;n , n ¼ 1; . . . ; 100, with p x ¼ p y ¼ 0; 0 p z 5 mm; 0 18 ; 0 18 ; ¼ 0: Then, we compared the reference configuration r;n with the actual configuration a;n measured by the accelerometer.</p><p>The mean error e p , evaluated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">e p ¼ 1 N s X Ns n¼1 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi ð r;n À a;n Þ 2 þ ð r;n À a;n Þ 2 þ ð r;n À a;n Þ 2 q ;</formula><p>was 1:60 degrees and its standard deviation was 0:98 degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CURVATURE DISCRIMINATION EXPERIMENT</head><p>An experiment assessing the effectiveness of the wearable device has been carried out. Its objective was the evaluation of the difference threshold for curvature discrimination when employing kinesthetic and cutaneous force feedback together (condition H) or solely kinesthetic force feedback (condition K). A similar experiment has been carried out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, where the authors presented a haptic device providing both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues informative of shape geometry at the contact point. They evaluated the difference threshold for curvature discrimination when both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues were available (i.e., while using the new haptic device proposed) and when only kinesthetic cues were available (i.e., using a popular grounded kinesthetic device). After that, we also asked users about the perceived wearability, portability, and comfort in using the device.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Methods</head><p>Similarly to the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the same-different procedure of theory of signal detection (TSD) was implemented to evaluate the just noticeable difference (JND) for curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. According to signal detection theory, signals are detected by humans against a noisy background. Two probability distributions describe the variations in the noise (N) and the signal-plus-noise (SN). Subjects set a criterion as a cutoff point for deciding if each observation belongs to N or to SN. On signal-plus-noise trials, positive responses are correct and are termed hits. On noise trials, positive responses are incorrect and are termed false alarms. The hit rate p h , i.e., the probability of responding yes on SN trials, and the false-alarm rate p f , i.e., the probability of responding yes on noise trials, fully describe the performance of the task. In TSD, sensitivity can be quantified by using the hit and false-alarm rates to determine the distance between the means of the SN and N distributions, relative to their standard deviations. A sensitivity index d 0 is then defined as the difference between those means, divided by the standard deviation of the N distribution. The value of d 0 can be calculated from the false alarm and hit rates, after converting them to z scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Fourteen participants (12 males, 2 females, age range 20-31, index size range 3.9-6.1 cm 1 ) took part in the experiment, all of whom were right-handed. Four of them had previous experience with haptic interfaces. None of the participants reported any deficiencies in their perception abilities and they were naı ¨ve as to the purpose of the study.</p><p>The experimental setup was composed of one wearable device attached to the end-effector of an Omega 6 haptic device. Subjects were blindfolded, with a support for the elbow, and were instructed to wear the device on their right index finger. According to the aforementioned TSD procedure, each trial involved exploring, in succession, a pair of virtual spheres. The exploration was carried out in a restricted workspace consisting of a vertical cylinder with a diameter of 30 mm, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. The task consisted in judging, on each trial, if the curvature of the two surfaces was different or the same. Each participant was informed about the procedure before the beginning of the experiment, and a 10-minute familiarization period, both while using the wearable device alone and while using it attached to the Omega 6 end-effector, was given, to make the subjects acquaintance with the experimental setup.</p><p>The hit rate p h corresponded to the percentage of correct responses given by a subject ("yes, the curvatures are different") when the two surfaces had different curvatures, while the false alarm rate p f corresponded to the percentage of incorrect responses ("yes, the curvatures are different") when the curvatures of the two surfaces were the same.</p><p>Two different force feedback conditions have been taken into account. In condition H, both the wearable device and the Omega 6 provided haptic cues to the subject. The mobile platform of the wearable device was providing cutaneous cues about the local geometry of the surface being touched, while the Omega device provided a kinesthetic force perpendicular to the given virtual surface. In condition K, only the Omega 6 fed back contact forces. The mobile platform of the cutaneous device was not in contact with the fingertip and its orientation was fixed. In all conditions, the Omega prevented the user from exiting the restricted exploration area (see Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</p><p>Each subject carried out four series of trials, in which spheres with different curvature values, a;Ã and b , were taken into account: On each repetition of each series, two spheres with random curvature ( a;Ã or b ) were rendered, i.e., the probability of exploring a pair of spheres with same (different) radius was 0.5. The order of presentation of the sequence of series and conditions was different for each subject, to minimize learning and fatigue effects. For each series, subjects' responses were recorded, calculating the hit and false alarm rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>False alarm and hit rate were first converted to z scores of the normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The sensitivity index d 0 was then calculated as the difference</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">d 0 ¼ z h À z f :</formula><p>According to the criterion commonly adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, the discrimination threshold can be defined as the difference between the curvatures for which d 0 ¼ 1. The threshold was computed for each subject for each condition H and K, assuming a linear proportionality between the values of d 0 .</p><p>The overall JND was then computed as the mean of the values obtained for all the subjects. The collected data of each condition passed the D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus K2 normality test. Then, a parametric two-tailed paired t-test (a ¼ 0:05) was performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences between the two conditions. The average JND values were significantly lower (p ¼ 0:014) for condition H than for K, with an average AE standard deviation of 2:22 AE 0:29 and 2:56 AE 0:36 m À1 for conditions H and K, respectively. Time needed to complete the given tasks was recorded as well, and no statistical difference was found between the average values for the two conditions.</p><p>For the subjects enrolled in this experiment, we confirmed that, as was also discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the combination of cutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback led to better 1. The finger size was calculated as the circumference of the fingertip at the level of the base of the nail, i.e., where the cuticle is. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Experimental setup. The exploration was carried out in a restricted workspace consisting of a vertical cylinder with a diameter of performance than employing kinesthetic force feedback only. These data confirmed that the display of surface orientation employing the wearable device here presented can help haptic perception of shape, and, in general, it confirmed the importance of cutaneous cues in haptics.</p><p>The discrimination threshold for curvature observed in this work is in agreement with previous results in the literature. Frisoli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> found an average JND value of 2.62 m À1 for kinesthetic feedback only and of 1.51 m À1 when providing both cutaneous and kinesthetic cues. Our cutaneous device showed worse performance with respect to the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>; however, we believe that this is a price worth paying to gain a great improvement in the wearability and portability of the system (see also Section 2). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, the authors found discrimination thresholds of 3.58 and 2.6 m À1 for direct and virtual discrimination of spheres, respectively, for a reference curvature of 25 m À1 employing both kinesthetic and cutaneous force feedback. Goodwin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> measured the ability of subjects to discriminate convex spherical surfaces from a flat plane using the fingerpad alone. A curvature of 4.58 m À1 could be discriminated, at the 75 percent level (d 0 ¼ 1:35), from the standard curvature of zero. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, using real objects and a reference curvature of 33 m À1 , found the curvature discrimination threshold for the index finger of the preferred hand to be about 2.5 m À1 .</p><p>At the end of this experiment, we also asked the subjects to answer a questionnaire of 15 questions using bipolar Likerttype seven-point scales. It considered the comfort in using the proposed experimental setup (five questions), the perceived performance (five questions), and its level of wearability when detached from the Omega end-effector (five questions). An answer of 7 meant a very high wearability of the system (or comfort or perceived performance), while an answer of 1 meant a very low wearability of the system (or comfort or perceived performance). The evaluation of each question is reported in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>As discussed in Section 2, wearability demands for cutaneous force feedback more than kinesthesia. However, kinesthetic stimuli could be partially recovered with wearable modules able to exert partial force feedback to arm joints. The relationship between cutaneous and kinesthetic perception in haptics is, thus, an important research issue. More in general, going to wearable solutions for haptics, inherently leads to underactuated and undersensed devices, in which the cutaneous stimuli are predominant with respect to the kinesthetic one.</p><p>However, similarly to other robotic research fields, we believe that underactuation and undersensing of haptic devices represent an opportunity, and not an issue, since they allow us to simplify the actuation system, decrease the weight, lower the energy consumption, and improve the mechanical structure design, turning the haptic device into an intrinsically wearable structure. Another advantage of wearable and small-size haptic devices is that they easily allow the simultaneous stimulation of several points on the human skin. We, thus, expect that the consequent richness of information will contribute to mitigate the lack of actuation and sensing, through methods based on cognitive models and multisensory integration.</p><p>The availability of wearable haptic devices will support the investigation on complementary approaches, which interact with different parts of the human body through the sense of touch. The complexity of the wearable system will be not a priori fixed, indeed the inherently modular nature of the wearable haptic solutions will allow us to customize the system according to the given applications.</p><p>In comparison to similar existing cutaneous devices, this one has three actuated degrees of freedom and it is able to simulate a contact force with general direction at the fingertip. The device can be represented as a 3-DoF parallel mechanism in which a mobile platform is actuated modifying the strain of the three wires. The mobile platform is connected to the finger and applies a force whose direction and amplitude depend on cable strengths and on platform's position and orientation. The finger was modeled as a linear six-dimensional spring. Future development of the presented study will include the analysis of other types of fingertip model.</p><p>Two control schemes were presented: in the first one (force control), the wire strains were controlled, while in the second one (position control), the platform configuration (position and orientation) was controlled. Tests on the force control performance showed that the dynamic response of the system is stable and quite accurate. These tests also showed acceptable results in terms of response time and error, and low sensitivity with respect to finger stiffness values. To validate the device and verify its accuracy and effectiveness, we evaluated the JND in curvature discrimination. Results showed that employing the wearable device together with a popular haptic interface (task H) improved the performance with respect of employing the haptic interface alone (task K). Average JND values were significantly lower for condition H than for condition K, with an average AE standard deviation of 2:22 AE 0:29 and 2:56 AE 0:36 m À1 for H and K, respectively (see Section 4.2 for details).</p><p>We strongly believe that this kind of highly wearable devices can be useful in many applications, ranging from rehabilitation to entertainment purposes, from robotic surgery to e-commerce, and will contribute in bringing haptic technologies to everyday life applications.</p><p>The device presented provides tactile stimuli only, while most of the kinesthetic feedback is missing. Possible solutions to compensate for this lack of information, while preserving the portability of the device, are currently being investigated. New experiments aiming at evaluating users' experience, while interacting with real objects and augmented scenarios will be performed in the next future. Moreover, we are planning to equip the device's actuators with position encoders to be able to provide more accurate and efficient control algorithms. Finally, we will also take into account the variability of fingertip mechanical characteristics in different users.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>506IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HAPTICS, VOL. 6, NO. 4, OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2013</figDesc></figure>
