<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents the results of statistical analyses of maritime accidents data and AIS data from Norwegian waters, to identify conditions that are associated with navigation related accidents (groundings and collisions) and could be used as risk indicators. Vessels involved in accidents reported in the accident database of the Norwegian Maritime Directorate (NMA), have been traced in historical AIS records, and data related to each ship have been transformed into variables. These variables are related to the behavior of the ship in front of the accident (e.g. nautical miles sailed, hours in operations, number of port calls etc.), technical and organizational conditions (ship categories, flag state, age, gross tonnage, Paris MoU ratings etc.) and the area where the accident occurred (number of vessels in the area, port calls in the area, nautical miles in the area etc.). Both the AIS data and the data from the NMA accident database have first been analyzed using correspondence analysis (categorical variables), F -tests (continuous variables), and then combined in a multivariate logistic regression model with "navigation accidents " and "other accidents " as dependent variables. The model is a strong predictor for whether the accident is navigation-related or not. Specifically, some vessel types, less vessel length, poor visibility condition, and a flag of convenience increased this probability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Mazaheri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have argued that most models for ship-grounding accident does not fully utilize available evidence, but tend to predominately rely on expert judgment and accident statistics. They have called for a more evidence based model development, using different data sources in order to develop more real-life scenarios. This study is an exploratory statistical analysis of accident-related data, conducted to support an empirically based development process of Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) risk models for Norwegian waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> .</p><p>Statistical analysis of data associated with navigation accidents (groundings and collisions) have been carried out in order to support the conceptualization of relevant nodes in the BBN models for groundings and collisions, and to eventually develop data that could be used when quantifying the models. The objective was to identify conditions that may be used as risk indicators, i.e. measurable variables that can be used to describe risk, and/or states of the nodes in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> .</p><p>The development of the BBN models was not entirely data driven, such as in the work of e.g. Mullai and Paulson <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , but based on an iterative process of comparing results from data analysis with major accident theories (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> ), previous analysis of navigation accident and developed risk models (se e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> for model reviews). The combination of exploratory data analysis, theory, and expert judgment represents a development process that is more in line with the recommendations of Mazaheri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> .</p><p>The BBN models that was developed through the project was supposed to only predict accident probabilities without including consequences. This goal was also reflected in this present analysis, where the aim was to identify factors that might influence the probability of accidents.</p><p>The identification of possible nodes in the models, and relevant historical data to be analyzed, was guided by the accident scenario model of Rasmussen <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> , which conceptualize the relation between "sharp end " conditions (staff and work), "blunt end " conditions (government, regulators, company, management), and environmental "stressors " (e.g. financial pressure, technology, educational level etc. <ref type="bibr">)</ref>.</p><p>Explorative analyses used in the model development included this present work, a qualitative inductive analysis of a sample of accident investigation related to navigation accidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> , analyses of accident data by the use of multiple logistic regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> , comparison of normalized accident frequencies by the use of exposure data calculated from AIS data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . The development process of the models has been described in Haugen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> . Data sources for this analysis have been the accident database of the Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA) and processed AIS (Automated Identification System) data. AIS data were used to construct indicators that could reflect activity of the ship involved in the accident, such as e.g. speed, number of port calls, hours since last port departure, course alteration, and so forth, general ship data (ship category, age, flag), and vessel traffic in the area where the accident occurred.</p><p>The use of both reported accident data and AIS data has partly been done in order to improve the reliability (and the validity) of the data.</p><p>Research have shown that underreporting and missing data is quite widespread within the maritime industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> . Due to this, e.g. Hänninen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> calls for the use of additional data sources, such as e. <ref type="bibr">g</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. results from Port State Controls</head><p>The use of AIS data in this present analysis has also been motivated by previous explorative accident analysis based on the use of AIS data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> , and an ambition to utilize the possibilities of using AIS data to construct relevant and reliable accident data variables that cannot be obtained by established accident report records.</p><p>The main objective for developing BBN models was to establish risk models for Norwegian waters, meaning the whole exclusive economic zone. Due to this, only accident and AIS data from these areas were obtained.</p><p>There could be several characteristics with the Norwegian sea areas that may reduce the generic validity and transferability of our findings to other sea areas. Characteristics that might represent area specific conditions could be e.g. the compositions of vessel types in use, fairways within dens coastal archipelago, the extent of transit traffic from Russian artic areas, liberal cabotage regulations, and use of open register in coasting.</p><p>The scientific contribution of this present work is that it contributes to knowledge regarding navigation accident, by the findings in our analysis and by comparing these findings with previous work. Secondly, the work represents one of relatively few analyses which utilize AIS data in order to construct accident related variables. This present work might contribute to a further development of the development of AIS based variables.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a literature review. Section 3 is a description of the method, including a description of the variables. Section 4 is a presentation of the results of the analysis. In Section 5 the findings will be discussed, with reference to previous research. Sections 6 presents the final conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Previous empirical research on maritime accidents</head><p>More than a decade ago, Hetherington et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> conducted a metastudy to identify risk factors associated with human actions. Their work was based on a review of 30 papers that based the discussion on empirical data from the maritime industry. They concluded that the main factors were related to fatigue, automation, situational awareness, communication, decision-making, teamwork and health, and health and stress.</p><p>In this paper, a reviewed 32 journal publications and conference papers between 2000 and 2017 has been conducted. This is papers that use samples of empirical data from ship accidents (more than one single accident) to identify risk factors associated with maritime accidents. The methods employed by these studies may be divide into three groups: studies that rely on (1) qualitative inductive analysis of accident reports and/or investigations, (2) explorative statistical analysis of incident related data (both qualitative and quantitative), and (3) a combination of the qualitative inductive analysis and explorative statistical analysis.</p><p>Examples of studies based entirely on inductive analysis include Macrae <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> , Kum and Sahin <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> , and Nilsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . Macrae <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> reanalyzed 30 accident reports related to grounding and collision. He found that there was a common pattern in grounding and collision accidents. He concluded that groundings are associated with "planning failure " and collision with "inadequate watch. " Kum and Sahin <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> found that accidents in arctic regions were associated with inadequate quality and extent of training. Nilsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> identified five conditions that occurred frequently in relation to groundings and collisions, based on the analysis of 95 accident investigations worldwide. These conditions were denoted as "pilot-related incidents, " "inadequate use or non-use of navigational aids, " "inadequate navigational attention, " "no dedicated lookout, " and "involvement of fishing vessels in collisions. "</p><p>Goerlandt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have analyzed winter navigation in the Northern Baltic Sea area by using visual data mining related to a sample of 45 accidents. This qualitative approach was based on data from different sources, including, for example, accident databases, AIS data records, and weather data. They found that groundings occurred in port areas and archipelagic waterways, and that collision occurred in open sea areas and archipelagic waterways. Further, they found that the accidents occurred mainly during moderate to excellent visibility conditions. Collisions occurred when the vessels had low speed compared to the average speed of vessels. They also found that the impact area in collisions could vary with the type of vessel operation. Still further, they found that smaller cargo vessels in archipelagic waterways dominate groundings.</p><p>Wróbel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> have conducted an inductive analysis of 100 maritime accidents, using the framework of Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), to identify human contribution to different accident scenarios that might be reduced or increased due to use of unmanned vessels. Conditions increasing the likelihood of a grounding accidents which was assumed to be eliminated by computerization, was e.g. distraction of the officers and improper passage plan. Their analysis of 19 collisions showed that the most frequent associated conditions was insufficient "look -out ", low visibility conditions and proximity to a port.</p><p>Explorative statistical analysis of accident data has also been conducted, using different quantitative methods. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> have carried out statistical analysis of accidents data limited to the Tian Port area in order to develop a BBN model for accident consequences. Their descriptive statistics indicated e.g. that accidents were associated with the position/area where the accident occurred, and types of ships. Banda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> have used descriptive accident statistics, collated with expert judgment in their risk analysis of winter navigation in Finnish sea areas.</p><p>In their analysis they combined accident data with historical data of ice conditions. Most of the accidents were associated with navigation.</p><p>As a part of their work on developing a model for predicting accident frequencies in different zones of the Aegean Sea, Ventikos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have conducted a study of historical data. They found that most of the vessels involved in accidents was older than 25 years, and that 60% of the accident involved RO-RO and bulk carriers.</p><p>Li and Wonham <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> have used vessel data from Lloyd´s Register of Shipping to e.g. calculate accidental total loss rates for different registry countries. They found that the worst group in terms of total loss rate is the open registry countries, except for two registries. <ref type="bibr">Yip [33]</ref> has used negative binominal regression models to analyses accident data from 2012 marine accident in Hong Kong port, to identify factors associated with personal injuries and fatalities. He constructed the following four variables: "port of registry ", "type of vessel ", "type of accident ", "type of waterway " and "underway " (phase of operation). He found that the potential for accidents with injuries increase with specific vessel types (e.g. passengers ship, sampam,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and pleasure vessels), and types of accidents (e.g. structural damage, fire/explosion, and capsizing). Fatal accident was associated with fishing vessels and "miscellaneous vessels ".</p><p>Eleftheria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> have compared ship accident frequencies (normalized by annually operating ships) of different categories of vessels, using a sample of 4,572 accidents word wide. They found that the most accident-prone vessels were general cargo ships, bulk carriers, car carri-ers and other Ro-Ro cargo vessels. The least accident-prone vessels were fishing, LNG, LPG, and reefer vessels. By correlating the accident frequencies with continuous variables, they found a positive relationship with the age of car carriers and bulk carriers.</p><p>Tzannatos and Kokotos <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> have compared accidents before and after the introduction of the ISM (International Safety Management) code to identify change in causes and accident types by analyzing a sample of 268 shipping accident with Greek vessels, using CHAID software. 2 They found that human-induced accidents have declined for Ro-Ro ships.</p><p>Alderton and Winchester <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> have used data from Lloyd´s Register of Shipping to calculate causality rates for the different register states. By comparing the average causality rates for e.g. Flag of Convenience (FOC), second/international registers (open registers, but not FOC), and traditional maritime states, they found that the FOC fleet had a causality rate above the world average. This pattern was also prevalent when they compared only causality rates for cargo ships.</p><p>Tirunagari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> have used data-mining software to identify the most frequent causes of groundings, collisions, and machinery failures and fire, based on 135 investigations conducted by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) in the United Kingdom. Conditions related to the accidents were traffic density, speed, confusion, equipment, bad weather, fatigue, and health.</p><p>Lema et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> have used the k -means clustering method with a sample of 335 shipping accidents to analyze vessel data in relation to different types of accidents. They found that different types of vessels were associated with different factors. For example, general cargo vessels involved in collisions were related to "inadequate education " and "unprofessional behavior, " whereas bulk carriers involved in collisions were related to "work load. <ref type="bibr">"</ref> Weng and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> have used binary logistic regression and accident data from the database of Lloyd's List Intelligence Company. They found that the probability of fatal accidents increased if the accident was a collision or fire/explosion, if it occurred during darkness, adverse weather conditions, a long distance from shore, and if the ship was sinking due to the damage. Weng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> found some of the same conditions in their comparison of shipping accidents with and without loss of life, when they used a different statistical method (zero-inflated negative binominal regression). They found that fatal accidents were associated with fire/explosions and machine damage/failure accidents, adverse weather conditions, a long distance from shore, and sinking ships.</p><p>Some researchers have combined the accident reports with other data sources to obtain information about the accidents. Especially have the relationship between weather data and accident data been analyzed. Most of these publications have been limited to fishing vessel activities. In their analysis of fishing vessels along the northeast coast of the United States, Jin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> have combined data from accident reports with fishing activity data, weather information, and calculated distances. Their logistic regression model showed that medium-sized vessels were the most accident-prone type of fishing vessels, while small vessels had the lowest accident rate. Further, they found that the accident rate was dependent on wind speed, geographical area, distance to the shore, and season. Jin and Thunberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> have combined accident data with weather data and historical recorded revenue of fish landing, using logit regression. They found that high accident probability was associated with weather conditions, vessel location, time of the year, and vessel characteristics. They also analyzed the possible relation between accident probabilities and value of the fish landings, but found no associations with the accident probability. Jin <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> has studied fishing vessel accidents by combining accident data from U.S. Coast Guard with recorded weather data to identify factors associated with vessel damage and crew injury. By developing two regression models (ordered probit), he found that vessel damage severity was positively associated with loss of stability, daytime wind speed, vessel age and distance from the shore, 2 CH i-squared A utomatic I nteraction D etector. and negative associated with daytime sea level pressure and vessel size. Crew injuries were positive associated with loss of stability and sinking.</p><p>Rezaee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> have combined accident data and weather data and used different regressions methods (Negative Binomial Regression, Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression, Fractional Logit Regression, and Random Parameters Negative Binomial Regression) to examine how weather factors affect the severity level of fishing vessel accidents in Atlantic Canada. They found that e.g. that ice concentration, sea surface temperature, wind speed and darkness were associated with the severe incidents, and accident frequencies. They argue that although they found an association between weather conditions and fishing activities, one should not ignore interactions with other conditions when interpreting the results. In their work they have addressed relations between: weather and vessel characteristics; weather, seasons and the fishers experience and properness; and weather, financial pressure and risk taking. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> represents also one of many studies which explore possible relations between accident data and weather conditions within fisheries. By using a regression tree, they found that the relative incident rate increased with deteriorating weather conditions, and ice consecration.</p><p>Heij and Knapp <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> have combined data from accidents databases, vessel data, and oceanographic data, and conducted a binary regression to relate the probability of an incident to oceanographic risk factors for different types of ships with ship specific risk factors. In order to include ship specific data into the analysis, they constructed variables regarding e.g. age, tonnage, classification society, flag state, change in flag, owner, and document of compliance company, flag state inspections, ISM audits, number of detentions and deficiencies in relation to port state control inspections. They found that impact of wind and waves in terms of accident probability, vary by ship type, regions, seasons, and time period.</p><p>Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> has combined ship data from Lloyd´s Register of Shipping, with data from four different port state control regimes. By using e.g. accidental total loss rate, detention rates and age of vessels as variables, he found that they were highly correlated. He also found that the loss rate and the detention rate are above the world average for ships flying flag belonging to open registers (with the exception three states).</p><p>Baniela and Rios <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> have used general vessel information as variables in their analysis of a sample of 258 maritime accidents worldwide. By conducting correspondence analysis and nonparametric tests, they showed that there are differences between serious accidents and less serious accidents in relation to the Paris MoU (Paris Memorandum of Understanding) rating, classification society, age of the vessel (old vessels and very serious accidents), and size of the vessel (small vessels and very serious accident conditions).</p><p>Mazaheri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have conducted a correlation analysis between ship groundings and traffic data obtained from AIS. They constructed three variables that they used as indicators for traffic density and traffic distribution. Their findings showed a minor relation between traffic distribution and groundings, but no relations between groundings and traffic density. In another publication, Mazaheri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> have conducted a correlation analysis regarding the relations between traffic conditions, the complexity of the waterway, and grounding accidents. This was done by combining AIS data and accident data. Their analyses did not reveal any significant correlations.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> have combined a sample with 8023 causality reports with worldwide ship data. Their binary logistic regression models showed that vessels with accidents, compared to vessels without accidents, are associated with low age of the vessel, general cargo, some specific classification societies, navigation zones, and vessel register.</p><p>There are also some quantitative analyses based on preparatory qualitative inductive analysis. Several of these analyses have used HFACS (Human Factors Analysis and Classification System) framework, originally developed by Shappell and Wiegmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> . The HFACS framework has been used to conduct a classification of the accidents by identifying unsafe acts and contributing factors on the bases of a qualita-tive interpretation of accident reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> . Whereas Celik and Cebi <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> only concluded that the human element is the main error inducing factor in shipping accidents, Griggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> , Chauvin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and Mazaheri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> have been able to identify more specified conditions. Griggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> has analyzed groundings, collisions, and allisions using logistic regression and a sample of 48 merchant ships. He found that allisions are related to the organizational condition "resource/acquisition management, " and that both "collisions " and "allisions " are related to "supervision. " Chauvin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> have followed up their initial HFACS classification with quantitative analysis by combining three different statistical methods, which includes multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), hierarchical clustering (HC), and classification tree learning. They identified several factors associated with ship collisions, based on a total sample of 39 accidents. These factors were decision failures, low visibility, misuse of navigation instruments, and inappropriate situational awareness. They also found that there was a difference between collisions that occurred in inner sea areas, and those that occurred at deep sea. Inadequate communication on the bridge and between vessels, was more apparent in inner sea collisions, than in deep-sea collisions. Manning of the bridge, high speed, and noncompliance with the safety management system were associated with deep-sea collision. Mazaheri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> have classified and analyzed data from 115 grounding accidents and 163 near-miss grounding by calculating relative frequencies and conducting a series of bivariate correlations with the assumed contributing conditions. They found that operator´s judgment/decision errors was the most frequent active failure in grounding accidents and that this was related to "inadequate communication and cooperation, " and "inappropriate planning. "</p><p>Graziano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> have used the Technique for Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors (TRACEr), developed by Shorrock and Kirwan <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> , in order to identify conditions that contribute to human error. This is a structured method for identifying conditions that may enhance human errors, and have been used as a framework in Bayesian Network models by e.g. Sotiralis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> . By comparing relative frequencies between conditions coded into TRACEr categories, using a sample of 52 grounding and collision accidents from 2004 to 2013, Graziano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> found e.g. that most of the failures was related to task error of navigation. The errors were associated with decision making, observation of information from the technical equipment, and supervision of bridge tasks. Task error was associated with organizational procedures, staffing characteristics, fatigue and inadequate training/instructions.</p><p>Overall, the two last decades of research in accident data analysis have resulted in a rich portfolio of conditions that appear to be associated with different types of maritime accidents. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> , the different findings in the literature have been categorized according to a classificatory scheme which divide between: ship behavior, external conditions, ship conditions, human conditions, and organizational conditions. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> Although there are some similar findings in the different studies in terms of significant conditions, there are also some divergent ones. The findings regarding, for example, the age of the vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> , and visibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> appear to be contradictory. The differences in the findings may be attributed to different methodological conditions, such as different use of concepts and operationalization of variables, the reliability of the data, sample size in the different studies, and so forth, but also to what extent one may generalize and compare studies conducted in different geographical areas of the world. Conditions related to the operational context, such as e.g. operation in harbor, in VTS surveillance area, open sea navigation, navigation in ice conditions, offshore support operation, etc. would possibly contribute to explain differences in the results between different studies.</p><p>Further, the taxonomies used in databases and in inductive analysis of accident reports vary across the different analysis. Some inductive analyses of accident reports have been structured by the used of established taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> , and some have been developing new categories as a part of the inductive analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> . This may e.g. imply "intersections " between categories across the different studies. This means that the categories used to express the findings in the different studies should not be treated as mutually independent phenomena.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Research design</head><p>The objective of this exploratory statistical analysis has been to identify conditions associated with navigation accidents that could be used as risk indicators. Generally, an indicator is seen as a measurable variable that might be used to describe the state of an unknown phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . The term "risk indicators " denote conditions that correlate with accidents, and represent measurable variables that can be used to describe risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> .</p><p>In this analysis, navigation accidents (groundings and collisions) have been compared with "other accidents ". Defined "other accidents " are fire/explosions, contact damages (assumed to be related to ship handling), environmental spill, capsizing (assumed to be related to activities such as ballasting and cargo planning), and loss of vessel. These other accident has been treated as a reference category due to a lack of information regarding the normal population of vessels. By comparing navigation accidents with non-navigation accidents, one may assume that it is possible to identify some features that are associated with navigation accidents. This hypothesis could be justified because navigation accidents are more about operations, whereas "other types " (fires, explosion, etc.) is more related to e.g. construction/maintenance and ship handling. Further, during the process of developing the conceptual models for collisions and groundings, the main nodes in these two models were overlapping. The similarities were related to e.g. task performance on the bridge and navigational equipment. The dichotomization may also be justified with reference to Wróbel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> , which use a similar categorization.</p><p>The research design consisted of 5 steps: obtain accident data; obtain AIS data for ships involved in accidents; transform the data into variables; conduct exploratory bivariate analysis; and construct a model and perform tests with logistic regression ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ).</p><p>The accident data used in this analysis were obtained from two main sources, NMA's accident database and historical records of AIS data. These two sources were merged to explore the possibility to using AIS to obtain more reliable accident data, especially regarding operational conditions.</p><p>The NMA accident database contains information on maritime accidents as early as 1981 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . This includes accidents involving Norwegian vessels internationally, and all maritime vessel activity in Norwegian waters (activity within the exclusive economic zone, not only the territorial waters). The database consists of information that may be divided into 6 main themes; vessel identity, vessel descriptions, geographical information, accident description, operational description and weather conditions. The database operates with 12 different accident types. In total 13 different primary categories are used to store and represent information regarding the different accidents. Except for the categories of ship types, the categories used in the database are not based on a hierarchical taxonomy.</p><p>Each registered accident is linked to different continuous variables, categorical variables, or string texts.

With reference to e.g. Bowker and Star <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> , one could claim that the database is more a nomenclature than a taxonomy.</p><p>The variables may be grouped into the following categories: type of accident, vessel identity (e.g. vessel type, name, MMSI-number, IMO-number), location and time of the accident, vessel characteristics (e.g. vessel type, age, length, gross tonnage), responsible agencies (e.g. owner, classification, register state), operation (e.g. destination, cargo), and consequences (e.g. degree of seriousness, fatalities). A version of the database, with reduced information regarding e.g. vessel identity, are publicly available. 4  To identify and track the vessels and the accident in the AIS system, a combination of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) number, the Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number, and information 4 https://www.sdir.no/globalassets/sjofartsdirektoratet/fartoy-og-sjofolkdokumenter/ulykker-og-sikkerhet/rapporter/ulykkesstatistikk/personskaderved-ulykker-pa-naringsfartoy-1981-2016.xlsx .</p><p>regarding the date, time, and coordinates of the accident were used. Position reports from AIS within a period of 30 days prior to the accidents, combined with information from the vessel database of IHS Fairplay, the classification of the vessel according to Paris MoU data (state of the vessel and the safety management system), and the classification according to the list of flags of convenience issued by the International Transport Workers ' Federation (assumed to reflect the state of the working condition on board), were used to construct variables that was assumed to capture the relevant features related to navigation accidents. Algorithms to transform the AIS data into variables were then developed, and data were obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref>The NMA accident database and recorded AIS data were combined in a data matrix. The final data matrix was analyzed by comparing those cases representing navigation accidents and those cases representing non-navigation accidents (see <ref type="bibr">2.4</ref>). These initial analyses gave information about variables where there was a statistically significant difference between navigation accidents and all other types of accidents. These variables were included in a logistic regression model in order to investigate the relative contribution of the different variables related to a prediction, and to determine whether the recorded incident had resulted from a navigation accident or not. The results of this regression analysis indicate which conditions that have an impact on navigation accidents, as well as the extent of the impact (measured by explained variance).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Transforming accident data into variables</head><p>The construction of the variables used in the analysis was based on an iterative process with the development of the conceptual BBN model for accident scenarios of grounding and collision (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> ), previous analysis of historical data (see Section 2 ), the type of registered variables available in the NMA accident database, and historical data (vessel identity and positions) obtained from AIS.</p><p>Each registered event/case incident contains a variety of information that can be categorized into the following six (6) themes:</p><p>1 Vessel identity 2 Vessel description 3 Geographical information 4 Accident description 5 Operational description 6 Weather conditions Information regarding vessel identity includes vessel name, IMO number, MMSI number, call sign, shipping company, and flag state. Vessel descriptions include gross tonnage, type of hull material, length, width, year of construction, classification society, and type of vessel. Geographical information comprises the coordinates of the accident, port of departure, arrival port, and type of water. The accident description includes the date of the accident, time, and damage to the vessel. Operational descriptions consist of information regarding the number of people on board, the number of crew members, the type of cargo, the speed of the vessel, the use of a pilot (or not), the use of navigation support equipment, and the duty scheme on board. Weather conditions include visibility, lightning, wind direction and speed, wave height, and current.</p><p>As part of the accident description, the accidents are classified into 13 different accident types. The following accident types were included: 1) collisions, 2) groundings, 3) fire and explosions, 4) contact damage, 5) capsizing, 6) vessel lost, and 7) environmental damage. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref> The information is represented as categorical variables, continuous variables, and as string variables. Categorical variables are dominating, and some of the representative information is redundant both as continuous and categorical variables. Unfortunately, there is a relatively large proportion of missing information related to some of the variables. This is especially related to variables regarding operational description, weather conditions, and geographical information. This implies that the data quality related to these variables is not satisfactory to include in the exploratory statistical analysis.</p><p>Data related to the vessels involved in the accident were also obtained from AIS data, recorded from 2010 to 2016. The quality of the AIS data from the period before 2010 was regarded as inferior. By combining information regarding IMO number, date and time of the accident, and the coordinates, the vessel(s) involved in the accident were identified. Data for each ship were obtained within a time interval stretching from the assumed time of the accident up to 30 days before the accident.</p><p>The AIS data consist of two types of messages transmitted from each vessel: position reports (transmitted in an interval between two seconds and three minutes) and ship static messages (including MMSI numbers and the IMO number). The static messages were translated into different variables (such as nationality and flag state <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref> ), and the position reports were used to calculate different variables related to information such as sailed distance, time in operation, speed, course alterations, and port calls <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> .</p><p>The combination of information regarding date, time, and coordinates of the accidents, were also used to construct variables that were assumed to reflect the traffic density around the accident by using AIS messages from other ships in the area before and at the time of the accident (e.g., number of vessels, sailed distances, and time of operation by other vessels within 1 km by 1 km) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> .</p><p>Some of the variables based on the AIS data were redundant with the variables based on information found in the NMA database. A comparison revealed cases where there was a lack of concurrence. In these cases, it was assumed that the reliability of the AIS data was better than the data obtained from the NMA database, and due to this, AIS data have been used when the variable information was redundant.</p></div>

The variables 1-3, 4-8, 12-15, and 18 represent rather intuitive measures related to the ships involved in the accidents. The rest of the variables are elaborated upon in further detail in the next paragraphs.</p><p>Ship categories (4) Based on the NSRM ship taxonomy that was created earlier in the project <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , the vessels involved in accidents were categorized into four main categories: 1) cargo vessels (including work and service vessels), 2) passenger vessels, 3) fishing vessels, and 4) recreational crafts.</p><p>Paris MoU (9) Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MoU) is a ship inspection regime were ship registers, based on ship inspections, are ranked in accordance to specified standards. The different registers are classified into three different groups (white, grey and black list), which reflects the standard of the vessel. Register states on the white list are among those with acceptable standard. Grey list consists of register states with vessels of low standard. Black list represents those registers that have a fleet of very low standard. Based on the information regarding the flag of the vessels, a new variable was constructed were the ships was categorized according to the Paris MoU categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> .</p><p>Flag of convenience <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) has classified some register states as "flag of convenience " (FOC).

From the reported position and time of accident to the NMA, the accident area was defined as 1 km by 1 km. Using three different parameters (total distance sailed, number of vessels, and hours in operation), it was sought to give an indicator of the density in the area were the accidents occurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Statistical analysis</head><p>The data have been analyzed with standard statistical methods corresponding to the variables ' level of measurement and the research questions. Also, the methods are chosen because they do not require a hy-pothesis of the directions between variables, thus being appropriate with exploratory perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Categorical variables</head><p>The chi-square statistic ( X 2 ) is the preferred method of measuring the degree of association between distributions within groups. It is important to bear in mind that the chi-square analysis does not indicate the direction of the effects, only whether the distributions in total are significantly different from each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> .</p><p>To investigate associations between categorical variables with several values, correspondence analysis has been used. A core idea of the correspondence analysis is to reduce a large contingency table of frequencies into two dimensions in a graphical solution, without prior theoretical basis for the dimensionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref> . In this study, the symmetric graphical plot has been used, where the direct distance between row and column points cannot be directly interpreted <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> . Instead, the angle between a row and column point must be inspected. The more acute the angle, the higher the association. The statistical concept is based on the chi-square method and measures a degree of association between two variables with the inertia statistic. By using the inertia statistic, it is possible to determine a percentage explained by the two-dimensional plot. We have used correspondence analysis to explore associations between ship categories and accident types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Continuous variables</head><p>For investigating differences between averages of two groups, the most common method is to use F -tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> . The F -tests have been conducted using the standard deviation, the group N , and the arithmetic mean, and this method concludes whether the differences between two groups are statistically significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3.">The influencing factors model</head><p>Taking the analyses of differences between groups to a higher level of analysis, the relative contributions of the different set of variables to predict whether the accident was a navigation accident, or another accident type was investigated. We wanted to control for other variables to see whether the relationships still were significant when taking each other's contributions into account. This was done through the application of a multiple logistic regression procedure.</p><p>In logistic regression, the odds-ratio is calculated for each independent variable. For each variable one gets a statistic that describes how the likelihood changes under the different conditions of the variable of interest. Additionally, the total percentage explained by the model is measured by the "pseudo-R " Nagelkerke R squared ( R 2 ), which is used here due to the theoretical maximum amendment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> . Thus, the regression model tests both the total model, as well as the individual predictors ' influence on whether the accident is navigation or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Sample</head><p>The final data sample ( N = 931) consists of all reported maritime accidents in Norwegian waters during the period 01.01.2010- <ref type="bibr">19.01.2016</ref> within the previously defined accident types. A total of 529 accidents from the original accident database ( N = 1460) were excluded. Of these, 260 were related to the lack of reporting of position and/or IMO/MMSI to the NMA. Moreover, 269 were related to lack of AIS data. The latter may be attributed to several factors, for example, AIS satellite coverage in the area the vessel sails, the vessel equipment for broadcasting AIS data, whether the vessel had switched off the AIS transponder, or if the vessel reported the wrong IMO or MMSI number. The cases that has not been fully identified seem to be distributed across accident types and ship categories; thus, one may assume that the sample bias is not affecting the statistical analyses systematically. There are two notable exceptions: fishing vessels below 15 m, which are reduced from 148 to 9, and recreational craft from 45 to 0. These two ship categories, however, rarely have AIS equipment. The bivariate analyses are conducted  with the data available from the original accident database, in which the N varies due to missing or incomplete registrations. In sum, this implies that we are effectively analyzing approximately 64% of the reported accidents to the NMA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ship categories (4)</head><p>To determine whether there were some vessel groups that had relatively more navigation accidents than other accidents when compared to other vessels groups, a chi-square test was conducted ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> ). The chi-square was significant ( X 2 = 82.819a, df = 2, p &lt; 0.01), meaning that there are significant associations between ship type and accident type. Although the chi square does not specify individual relationships, it appears that cargo vessels have had relatively more navigation accidents than other accidents when compared to other vessels groups (69.2% compared to <ref type="bibr">44.3%</ref> for passenger vessels and 66.5% for fishing vessels).</p><p>On a more detailed level (by using vessel categories at a lower level in the NSRM ship taxonomy), a correspondence analysis was conducted. Accident type is analyzed here on the level reported to the NMA. A plot is presented below ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> ).</p><p>From the plot, it appears that well boats and dry cargo are associated with groundings, ferries/high-speed with contact injuries, tankers with fire/explosions, and offshore vessels with environmental spills. The results showed that ship categories explained 26 percent of the variance in accident type ( X 2 = 479.236, df = 54, p &lt; 0.01). The dimensions in correspondence analysis are formed from the data itself. The interpretation is not straight forward. However, one possible interpretation is that dimension 1 is related to speed (as exemplified with offshore vessels, ferries, and high-speed crafts, which also have a relatively high degree of governmental regulation), and dimension 2 is related to inside and outside the sea boundary (as exemplified with offshore and tankers primarily sailing outside the sea boundary). These findings show that there are differences in the "typical " accident among ship categories. This is in line with findings from the study of Yip <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> , and those studies that shows that the probabilities of a specified accident are dependent on the type of vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> .</p><p>Summer/winter (5) To examine whether the winter seasons have been associated with relatively more navigation accidents than other accidents when compared to the summer seasons, a chi-square test was conducted. The result was that seasons were not significantly related to accident type ( X 2 = 1.490, df = 1, p = 0,222). ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> ).</p><p>Sight conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> The results of the chi-square and correspondence analyses of accident types distributed among sight conditions ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> ) were significant ( X 2 = 69.221, df = 30, p &lt; 0.01). However, the explained variance of the correspondence analysis was too low to be deemed important (5%).   Light conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Light conditions were also significantly related to accident type. ( X 2 = 25.983, df = 3, p &lt; 0.01). The proportion of accidents during darkness are higher among navigation accidents when compared with other accidents ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> ).</p><p>Foreign/NIS and NOR flag state <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> The test for groups of flag state related to accident types showed a significant association ( X 2 = 16.200, df = 2, p &lt; 0.01). Foreign vessels and vessels registered in NIS have had relatively more navigation accidents when compared to other Norwegian coastal vessels (NOR), and unidentified vessels ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> ).</p><p>Paris MoU list <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Test results to determine whether there was an association between vessels belonging to different categories of different rank in terms of the   state of the vessel and the state of safety management ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> ) were not significant ( X 2 = 1.979, df = 3, p = 0.577).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flag of convenience (9)</head><p>A test was performed to investigate whether there was a significant difference in the distribution of accident types between vessels with a flag of convenience and vessels with other flags.

This led us to analyze these variables further in the regression analyses, which will be presented Section 4.3 .</p></div>

Coefficients presented are from the last step of the analysis, when all variables are included in the analysis.</p><p>To test the influencing conditions model ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> ), the variables were divided into three steps, based on the "blunt end " and "sharp end " categories used in the conceptual BBN model (see Section 1 ). The categories used were 1) external conditions, 2) technical and organizational conditions, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">9</ref> and 3) ship behavior. By using this procedure, the respective increase of the total variance explained for each step could be observed. The results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">11</ref> .</p><p>Generally, the model was significant on a 1 percent level ( -2 log likelihood = 578.77, X 2 = 189.06, df = 33, p &lt; 0.01). In total, the predictors explained <ref type="bibr">38.4</ref> percent of the variation between navigation accidents and other types of incidents, as measured by the Nagelkerke R square. Running the analysis with a listwise missing method, meaning that, for a case to be included, it needed to have a value on all variables. Due to this interdependency, the total N was 559 for the model.</p><p>External conditions explained 6 percent of the variance in the dependent variable, whereas the inclusion of technical and organizational conditions heightened the total to 37 percent. Lastly, ship behavior increased the total model's explained variance to 38.4 percent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Risk indicators -bivariate relationships</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">12</ref> presents an overview of those conditions that are associated with navigation accidents, and due to this might be considered as risk indicators. Conditions identified using bivariate analysis resembles several of the findings from previous research. This includes: low visibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> , higher age <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> , cargo vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> , smaller vessels (shorter length, less gross tonnage <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">10</ref>The findings that maritime accidents are associated with foreign vessels, and those foreign vessels classified as sailing with a flag of convenience, seem tangent with previous research results regarding associations between accidents and vessel register <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and Paris MoU ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> . However, no association was found between navigation accidents and vessels belonging to the Paris MoU grey or black list. One possible explanation for this is that there are few grey-or black-list vessels operating in Norwegian waters and, thereby, this lowers the statistical power of the analyses. One other possible explanation is -when combining the finding that there is an association between accidents and flag of convenience but no significant relationship with foreign vessels in general -that the relationship to FOC ship indicates something else than both the Paris MoU and the flag state variables. One may assume that the variable reflects what the FOC category of vessels is intended to capture, that is, the standard of the working conditions on board the vessels.</p><p>There are also findings which seem contradictory with previous research. The finding that marine navigational accidents are associated with low visibility, although supported by Chauvin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> , is not supported by the findings of Goerlandt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> . They found that accidents occur primarily during moderate to excellent visibility. The finding that navigation accidents are associated with low speed does not match the findings of, for example, Tirunagari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . However, it does correspond with Goerlandt et al. 's <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> finding that collisions occur when the vessels have low speed compared to the average speed of vessels. Our finding may, when the correlation with a higher number of course alterations into consideration, reflect navigation in areas with a high density of islands and skerries.</p><p>The correlation between less vessel density in the area of the accident (number of other vessels in the area, and percentage of hours with other vessels in the area, hours of vessel operations in the area) and navigation accident contradict the findings of Tirunagari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and Lema et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> . The findings could be interpreted as a reflection of the correlations between vessel types and their activity (e.g., ferries operate close to the harbor with higher traffic density, and fishing boats tend to operate in proximity to each other). The findings that navigational accident correlates with vessels with more hours in operation in the last seven days and those with fewer port calls last day, could be interpreted as spurious relations due to variations between vessel types (e.g., cargo vessels vs coastal ferries).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">The model of risk indicators for navigation accidents</head><p>When including all the variables that were statistically significant in the bivariate tests in a binomial logistic regression analysis, the variables are checked against each other with respect to their unique contribution to the dependent variable. Variables that had a statistically significant influence on the outcome included ship categories (bulk, dry cargo, tanker, fishing boat, well boat, and work and service vessels), flag of convenience, length, and sight conditions ( Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_11">11</ref> ). This means that navigation accidents are more "typical " for cargo vessels and fishing boats than for other vessel types. The probability of a navigation accident increases with the diminishing length of the vessels (independent of vessel category), if the vessel sails under a flag of convenience, and if the visibility is reduced. The explained variance of the model is <ref type="bibr">38.4</ref> percent, which should be considered as a strong result, bearing in mind the complexity of navigation accidents.</p><p>The influence of the variables assumed to measure the ship behavior in the analytical model ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> ), is canceled when controlling for the influence of the technical and organizational variables and the external variables. It is somewhat surprising that the traffic density variables were not significant in the complete model. A possible explanation is that although collisions may correlate with traffic density, this is not necessarily the case for groundings.</p><p>Overall, our model of risk indicators echoes several of the previous findings, based on other samples and other regions of navigation. A rather new finding is that flag of convenience appears to be a risk indicator for navigational accidents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Validity considerations</head><p>The data used in this analysis are based on accident reports received and obtained by the NMA. The time entries and the geographical coordinates in these reports have been used to obtain AIS data related to the accident. The validity of these data influences the validity of the parameters related to ship behavior before the accident. The validity is considered as lower the closer in time to the reported accident time. For example, an analysis of ship behavior 10 and 20 minutes before the accident is completely reliant on the validity of the reported time and position to the NMA, which may vary significantly to this date. Therefore, the last hour as the closest time interval has been used.</p><p>Further, the degree and an unequal distribution of underreporting within, for example, different vessel categories, and related to different accident types, may also influence the validity of our analysis. Earlier studies show that underreporting of accidents is rather common within the maritime industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> . This could mean that the contribution of flag of convenience on the probability of a navigation accident is partly a result of a higher portion of underreported non-navigation accidents. Similar causes may also explain the impact of the vessel types, for example if passenger ships to some greater extent report incidents such as fires and collisions.</p><p>It is also important to take into consideration that this study is based on data from Norwegian sea areas, with belonging characteristics that may influence the results (see Section 1 ). The review of the literature  indicates that there might be regional differences in terms of conditions associated with accidents, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings.</p><p>Interaction effects may also be present, which we have not accounted for in this study. For example, low sight conditions may be influential only when accompanied by e.g. high speed. In this study, correlations rather than joint effects of several variables have been emphasized. However, possible interaction effects should be addressed in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This exploratory statistical analysis of navigation accidents shows that some vessel types such as dry cargo, bulk, tanker, well boats, fishing boats, and work and service vessels, less vessel length, poor visibility condition, and sailing under a flag regarded as a flag of convenience, all increase the probability of a navigation accident, given that accidents have occurred.</p><p>These results should be treated with caution due to the possible impact of underreporting. However, the findings give some indications that weather conditions, vessel type, and flag state may be used as risk indicators. These empirical findings strengthen the arguments for including them as parameters or nodes in a risk model. The finding that the technical and organizational conditions explain 31% of the variance is an argument for further research with samples limited to specified vessels types. Further, the analysis could be further developed by the construction of more variables by using more data sources (e.g., weather data), and further utilize the AIS data records.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. in the analysis.</figDesc><graphic coords="6,121.41,57.52,353.28,275.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
