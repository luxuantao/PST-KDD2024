Campi Abstract-This paper proposes a new probabilistic solution framework for robust control analysis and synthesis problems that can be expressed in the form of minimization of a linear objective subject to convex constraints parameterized by uncertainty terms. This includes the wide class of NP-hard control problems representable by means of parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown in this paper that by appropriate sampling of the constraints one obtains a standard convex optimization problem (the scenario problem) whose solution is approximately feasible for the original (usually infinite) set of constraints, i.e., the measure of the set of original constraints that are violated by the scenario solution rapidly decreases to zero as the number of samples is increased. We provide an explicit and efficient bound on the number of samples required to attain a-priori specified levels of probabilistic guarantee of robustness. A rich family of control problems which are in general hard to solve in a deterministically robust sense is therefore amenable to polynomial-time solution, if robustness is intended in the proposed risk-adjusted sense.</p><p>Index Terms-Probabilistic robustness, randomized algorithms, robust control, robust convex optimization, uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>C ONVEX optimization, and semidefinite programming in particular, has become one of the mainstream frameworks for control analysis and synthesis. It is indeed well-known that standard linear control problems such as Lyapunov stability analysis and or synthesis may be formulated (and efficiently solved) in terms of solution of convex optimization problems with linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints; see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. More recently, research in this field has concentrated on considering problems in which the data (for instance, the matrices describing a given plant) are uncertain. A "guaranteed" (or robust) approach in this case requires the satisfaction of the analysis or synthesis constraints for all admissible values (worst-case approach) of the uncertain parameters that appear in the problem data, see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Therefore, in the "robustified" version of the problem one has to determine a solution that satisfies a typically infinite number of convex constraints, generated by all the instances of the original constraints, as the uncertain parameters vary over their admissible domains.</p><p>Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">March 18, 2004</ref>; revised December 9, 2004 and December <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">2005</ref>.

Unfortunately, however, robust convex programs are not as easily solvable as standard ones, and are NP-hard in general, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This implies for instance that-unlike standard semidefinite programs (SDP)-simply restating a control problem in the form of a robust SDP does not mean that the problem is amenable to efficient numerical solution.</p><p>The current state of the art for attacking robust convex optimization problems is by introducing suitable relaxations via "multipliers" or "scaling" variables, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The main drawbacks of the relaxation approach are that the extent of the introduced conservatism is in general unknown (although it can be assessed for particular classes of problems, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, or asymptotically reduced by increasing the order of relaxation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>), and that the method itself can be applied only when the dependence of the data on the uncertainties has a particular and simple functional form, such as affine, polynomial or rational.</p><p>In this paper, we pursue a different probabilistic approach to robustness in control problems, in which the guarantees of performance are not intended in a deterministic sense (satisfaction against all possible uncertainty outcomes) but are instead intended in a probabilistic sense (satisfaction for most of the uncertainty instances, or in probability).</p><p>Introducing probability in robustness gained increasing interest in the literature in recent years, and the probabilistic approach is now a rather established methodology for robustness analysis; see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. However, the probabilistic approach has found to date limited application in robust control synthesis. Basically, two different methodologies are currently available for probabilistic robust control synthesis: the approach based on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, and the sequential methods based on stochastic gradient iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> or ellipsoid iterations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>The first approach is very general but suffers from the conservatism of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, which requires a very large number of randomly generated samples (i.e., it has high "sample complexity") in order to achieve the desired probabilistic guarantees. Even more importantly, the design methodology proposed in the seminal paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> does not aim to enforce the synthesis constraints in a robust sense, but is instead directed toward minimizing the average cost objective.</p><p>Alternatively, when the original synthesis problem is convex (which includes many, albeit not all, relevant control problems) the sequential approaches based on stochastic gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> or ellipsoid iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, may be applied with success. However, these methods are currently limited to feasibility problems, and have not yet been extended to deal satisfactorily with optimization. More fundamentally, these algorithms have asymptotic nature, i.e., they are guaranteed to converge to a robust feasible solution (if one exists) with probability one, but the total number of uncertainty samples that need to be drawn in order to achieve the desired solution cannot be fixed in advance.</p><p>The main contribution of the present work is to propose a general framework named "scenario approach" to solve convex robust control design problems. The fundamental idea is to consider only a finite number of sampled instances of the uncertainty affecting the system (the scenarios), and to solve in oneshot the corresponding standard convex problem. We will prove in this paper that the number of scenarios that need be considered is reasonably small and that the solution of the scenario problem has generalization properties, i.e., it satisfies with high probability also unseen scenarios. This is fundamentally different from the average reformulation proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>In the key result of this paper (Theorem 1), we provide an efficient bound on the sample complexity of the scenario problem, that increases slowly with the required probabilistic levels. This is different from the stochastic sequential methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> that have an asymptotic nature. Moreover, a notable improvement upon the stochastic sequential methods is that our result holds for robust optimization problems and not only for feasibility.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce more precisely the notion of probabilistic design. Section III contains the main results on scenario optimization, while a proof of Theorem 1 is given in Section IV. Section V discusses some robust control problems that are amenable to the scenario-based solution, and presents a numerical example. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. WORST-CASE VERSUS PROBABILISTIC DESIGN</head><p>A wide class of robust control problems can be expressed as optimization problems subject to constraints that are parameterized by the uncertainties affecting the plant. In formal terms, if is the "design parameter" (which includes the actual controller parameters, plus possibly other additional variables such as parameters of Lyapunov functions, slack variables and scalings), and the family of admissible plants is parameterized by an "uncertainty vector"</p><p>, then the prototype control problem we refer to consists in minimizing a linear objective (the objective to be minimized can be taken as linear, without loss of generality), subject to that satisfies the constraints , , where is a scalar-valued function that specifies the constraints. Note that considering scalar-valued constraint functions is without loss of generality, since multiple constraints can be reduced to a single scalar-valued constraint by the position . In typical situations, has infinite cardinality, i.e., it contains an infinite number of possible instances for .</p><p>In this paper, we make reference to problems where the function is convex in , as formally stated in the next assumption.</p><p>Assumption 1 (Convexity): Let be a convex and closed set, and let . We assume that is continuous and convex in , for any fixed value of . Assumption 1 requires convexity only with respect to the design variable , while generic nonlinear dependence with respect to is allowed.</p><p>Important special cases of robust convex programs are robust linear programs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, for which is affine in , and robust semidefinite programs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, for which , where and denotes the largest eigenvalue. The reader is referred to Section V for a sample of robust control problems that fall within the convex framework here described.</p><p>a) Worst-Case Design: In worst-case design, one aims at enforcing the design constraint for all possible values of the uncertainty . The resulting closed-loop system will hence exhibit a performance level that is guaranteed for each and every plant in the uncertain family. However, a fundamental problem is encountered along this approach: Obtaining worst-case solutions has been proven to be computationally hard; explicit results on the NP-hardness of several worst-case design problems are for instance found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In addition, a second criticism applies to a worst-case design: Seeking guarantees against the worst-case can introduce undesirable conservatism in the design, since all the design focus is on a special "ill" situation (the worst-case plant), which could as well be unrepresentative of the majority of admissible plants. These critical points that we recalled here are extensively documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, to which we refer the reader. For these reasons, we adopt in this paper an alternative design approach, based on satisfaction of the design constraints in probability.</p><p>b) Probabilistic Robust Design: In the probabilistic design paradigm, we assume a probability measure over the uncertainty set is given. Then, for a given probability level , we seek a design parameter that minimizes while satisfying all constraints but a small fraction of them whose probability is no larger than the prespecified level . It should be noted that this approach can be seen as a relaxation of the worst-case paradigm where one allows a risk level and looks for a design parameter such that the performance specification is violated by at most a fraction of the plants in the uncertainty family.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SCENARIO OPTIMIZATION</head><p>The main result of this section (Theorem 1) shows that a solution to the probabilistic design problem can be found at low computational effort, with complete generality.</p><p>We start by formally introducing some relevant definitions. We assume that the support for is endowed with a -algebra and that is defined over . Moreover, we assume that , . Depending on the situation at hand, can have different interpretations. Sometimes, it is the actual probability with which the uncertainty parameter takes on value in . Other times, simply describes the relative importance we attribute to different uncertainty instances. We have the following definition.</p><p>Definition 1 (Probability of Violation): Let be given. The probability of violation of is defined as For example, if a uniform (with respect to Lebesgue measure) probability density is assumed, then measures the volume of "bad" parameters such that the constraint is violated. Clearly, a solution with small associated is feasible for most of the problem instances, i.e., it is approximately feasible for the robust problem. This concept of approximate feasibility has been introduced in the context of robust control in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Any solution such that is here named an " -level" solution.</p><p>Definition 2 ( -Level Solution): Let . We say that is an -level robustly feasible (or, more simply, an -level) solution, if . Our goal is to devise an algorithm that returns a -level solution, where is any fixed small level, and that is worst-case optimal over the set of satisfied constraints. To this purpose, we now introduce the "scenario" version of the robust design problem. By scenario it is here meant any realization or instance of the uncertainty parameter . In the scenario design we optimize the objective subject to a finite number of randomly selected scenarios. Later on in Theorem 1 we show that the scenario design permits to solve the -level probabilistic design.</p><p>Definition 3 (Scenario Design): Assume that independent identically distributed samples are drawn according to probability . A scenario design problem is given by the convex program <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The acronym refers to the fact that ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is a robust convex program with constraints.</p><p>To avoid mathematical clutter, we here make the following technical assumption on the scenario problem. However, this assumption can be released, as shown in Appendix A.</p><p>Assumption 2: For all possible extractions , the optimization problem ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is either unfeasible, or, if feasible, it attains a unique optimal solution.</p><p>Contrary to the robust convex problem, the scenario problem is a standard convex optimization problem with a finite number of constraints and, hence, its optimal solution is usually efficiently computable by means of numerical algorithms. Moreover, since only constraints are imposed in , it is clear that the optimal solution of is superoptimal for the robust convex problem with all constraints in place, i.e., the objective corresponding to outperforms the one achieved with the solution of the robust convex program. In this way, the scenario approach alleviates the conservatism of the worst-case approach.</p><p>The fundamental question that need now be addressed is: what guarantee can be provided on the level of feasibility of the solution of ? The following key Theorem 1 and its Corollary 1 answer this question.</p><p>Before stating the theorem, we note that, since the constraints are randomly selected, the resulting optimal solution is a random variable that depends on the multi-sample extraction . Therefore, can be a -level solution for a given random extraction and not for another. In the theorem, the parameter bounds the probability that is not a -level solution. Thus, is the risk of failure, or confidence, associated to the randomized solution algorithm.</p><p>Theorem 1: Let Assumption 2 be satisfied. Fix two real numbers (level parameter) and (confidence parameter). If <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> ( denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to the argument) then, with probability no smaller than , either the scenario problem is unfeasible and, hence, also the initial robust convex program is unfeasible; or, is feasible, and then its optimal solution is -level robustly feasible. In this theorem, probability refers to the -fold probability ( , times) in , which is the set to which the extracted multisample belongs. Here and elsewhere, the measurability of , as well as that of other sets in , is taken as an assumption. A proof of Theorem 1 is given in Section IV. A visual interpretation of this theorem is provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 1 states that if (specified by ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)) random scenarios are drawn, the optimal solution of is -level feasible according to Definition 2, with high probability . Parameter is important in theory since, if is pushed down to zero, goes to infinity. However, for a practical use, we can observe that plays a very marginal role. The reason is that shows up in (2) under the sign of logarithm so that it can be made very small ( or even ) without significantly increasing . The scenario approach thus provides us with a viable and implementable way to robustify a nominal design up to a desired level . Bound (2) can be simplified as stated in the next corollary. from outside the "bad set." The resulting optimal solution is, hence, feasible for all but at most a set of measure of the uncertainties.</p><p>The subscript " " in (3) highlights the logarithmic dependence on . Proof: Observe that and, hence, the last term in ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is nonpositive and can be dropped, leading to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where can be freely selected in (0, 1). The statement of the corollary is then obtained by selecting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. We also note that further optimizing (4) with respect to always leads to a , with a corresponding improvement by at most of a factor 2.</p><p>Some remarks further comment the results in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1.</p><p>Remark 1 (The Role of Convexity): Theorem 1 says that if we extract a finite number of constraints, then the solution of the randomized problem-if feasible-satisfies most of the other unseen constraints. This is a generalization property in the learning theoretic sense: The explicit satisfaction of some "training" scenarios generalizes automatically to the satisfaction of other unseen scenarios. It is interesting to note that generalization calls for some kind of structure, and the only structure used here is convexity. So, convexity in the scenario approach is fundamental in two different respects: On the computational side, it allows for an efficient solution of the ensuing optimization problem; on the theoretical side, it allows for generalization.</p><p>Remark 2 (Sample Complexity): Formula (3) provides a ready-to-use "sample complexity" for the number of random scenarios that need to be drawn in order to achieve the desired probabilistic level in the solution. In fact in (3) only depends on the number of optimization variables, besides the probabilistic levels and , and its evaluation does not involve computing complicated complexity measures such as the VC-dimension. It is not difficult to conceive situations where the class of sets , parameterized in , has infinite VC-dimension (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> for a definition of VC-dimension), even for small . Then, estimating uniformly with respect to is impossible and the VC-theory is of no use. Theorem 1 says that, if attention is restricted to , then estimating is indeed possible and this can be done at a low computational cost.</p><p>Remark 3 (Prob-Independent Bound): In some applications, probability is not explicitly known, and the scenarios are directly made available as "observations." This could for example be the case when the instances of are actually related to various measurements or identification experiments made on a plant at different times and/or different operating conditions; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In this connection, we notice that the bound (2) is probability independent, i.e., it holds irrespective of the underlying probability , and can therefore be applied even when is unknown. Remark 4 (Comparison With an Older Bound): In a previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> devoted to general convex optimization, the authors of the present paper derived a different bound on the sample complexity of sampled convex programs. This earlier result establishes that the statement of Theorem 1 holds for <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> This bound is linear both in and and, since one typically desires to have very small, bound ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is worse by orders of magnitude with respect to the newly derived bounds. The number of samples required by (2) appears to be reasonable and useful for a practical implementation of our method. For instance, in a problem with variables, setting probability levels and , bound (2) would require samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Chance-Constrained Problem</head><p>Consider the probability-constrained problem subject to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> The distinctive feature of is that it is required that the neglected constraint set is chosen in an optimal way, i.e., among all sets of constraints with probability no larger than , the removed one is the one that allows for the greatest reduction in the design objective. In the optimization literature, this problem is called a "chance-constrained" optimization problem, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. It should readily be remarked that an exact numerical solution of is in general hopeless, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Moreover, is in general nonconvex, even when the function is convex in for all . There are however very specialized instances of chance-constrained problems (in particular, linear programs with log-concave distributions of the uncertain parameters) that can indeed be reformulated as standard convex programs and, hence, solved efficiently, see again <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> for an application to control design.</p><p>As we have already seen, returns with high probability a feasible solution of . In the next theorem, we establish a precise connection between and . Theorem 2: Let be given probability levels.

For a ready comparison between and , observe that relation holds for any and (as it easily follows by observing that the two sides coincide for and and that is convex in ). Then, with the position ; , we have which, used in result 2 of the theorem, gives , with any number satisfying (2). For a crude evaluation, use bound (3) for . If and is not taken to be very small as compared to , then the dominant term in (3) is , leading to , where is the rescaling factor between and .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Preliminaries</head><p>We first recall a classical result due to Helly; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The number of support constraints for problem is at most . A proof of this result was first given by the authors of the present paper in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. We here report an alternative and more compact proof based on an idea suggested to us by A. Nemirovski in a personal communication.</p><p>Proof: Let problem have support constraints , where is a subset of indexes from . We next prove (by contradiction) that . Consider the smallest objective improvement obtained by removing a support constraint and, for some with , define the hyperplane . By construction, the points , , lie in the half-space , while lies in the half-space , and therefore separates , , from . Next, for all indices , we denote with the point of intersection between the line segment and . Since , , and , then by convexity we have that , and, therefore, (since, by construction, )</p><p>For , define the convex sets , and consider any collection of of these sets. Suppose now (for the purpose of contradiction) that . Then, there must exist an index such that is a support constraint and, by the previous reasoning, this means that there exists a point such that . Thus, , that is the collection of convex sets has at least a point in common. Now, since the sets , , belong to the hyperplane (i.e., to , modulo a fixed translation) and all collections composed of of these sets have a point in common, by Helly's Lemma (Lemma 1) there exists a point such that . Such a would, therefore, be feasible for problem ; moreover, it would yield an objective value (since ). This is a contradiction, because would no longer be an optimal solution for , and, hence, we conclude that . We are now ready to present a proof of Theorem 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Proof of Theorem 1</head><p>The fact that, if is unfeasible, then the initial robust convex program is unfeasible too is trivially true, since the latter program exhibits more constraints than . Thus, we have to prove that, with probability , either is unfeasible or, if feasible, its solution is -level robustly feasible. This part of the proof is inspired by a similar proof given in a different context in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>For clarity of exposition, we first assume that problem is feasible for any selection of . The case where infeasibility can occur is obtained as an easy extension as indicated at the end of the proof.</p><p>Given scenarios , select a subset of indices from and let be the optimal solution of the program subject to Based on we next introduce a subset of the set defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> ( is the optimal solution with all constraints in place).</p><p>Let now range over the collection of all possible choices of indexes from ( contains sets).

The resulting optimization problem with constraints admits the same optimal solution as the original problem with constraints. Consider now the set of the remaining constraints and, among these, remove a constraint which is not a support constraint for the problem with constraints. Again, the optimal solution does not change. If we keep going this way until we are left with constraints, in the end we still have as optimal solution, showing that , where is the set containing the constraints remaining at the end of the process.

Fix base of the cylinder. For a point to be in , constraints must be satisfied by , for, otherwise, we would not have , as it is required in . However, in . Thus, by the fact that the extractions are independent, we conclude that the equation shown at the bottom of the page holds.

APPLICATIONS TO ROBUST CONTROL</head><p>In section, we discuss a few relevant control analysis and synthesis problems that can be naturally cast in the robust convex program format, and for which no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm is known that computes an exact solution. For these problems, the solution approach that we propose is to first relax the problem in a probabilistic sense and then solve the probabilistic problem via the randomized scenario approach presented in the previous sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Analysis and Synthesis via Parameter-Dependent Lyapunov Functions</head><p>Consider the family of linear systems described in state-space form as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where is the state variable, and the parameter parameterizing the system family is unknown, but constant in time. In the sequel, we will refer to system families of the type ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) simply as "uncertain systems." Let be a family of symmetric matrices depending on a design parameter and on the uncertainty parameter , and assume that is linear in , for all . The dependence of on the uncertainty , as well as the dependence of on , are instead left generic. We introduce the following sufficient condition for robust stability, which follows directly from the standard Lyapunov theory.</p><p>Definition 5 (Generalized Quadratic Stability -GQS): Given a symmetric matrix function , linear in for all , the uncertain system ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) is said to be quadratically stable with respect to if there exists such that (15) ( means negative definite). Such a is called a Lyapunov matrix for the uncertain system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>For specific choices of the parameterization , the above GQS criterion clearly encompasses the popular quadratic stability (QS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) and affine quadratic stability (AQS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>) criteria, as well as the biquadratic stability condition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. For instance, the quadratic stability condition is recovered by choosing (i.e., contains the free elements of , and there is no dependence on ), which amounts to determining a single Lyapunov matrix that simultaneously satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. The AQS condition is instead obtained by choosing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where represents the free elements in the matrices , . Notice that QS, AQS and GQS constitute a hierarchy of sufficient conditions for robust stability having decreasing conservatism. However, even the simplest (and most conservative) QS condition is hard to check numerically. Only in the case when the set is a polytope, the QS condition is exactly checkable numerically via convex optimization, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As a matter of fact, in this case a classical vertex result holds which permits to convert the infinite number of constraints entailed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> into a finite number of LMIs involving the vertices of the polytope. Notice however that in the classical case when is an interval matrix, the number of vertices of the polytope grows as , which means that QS cannot be checked with a computational effort that is polynomial in the problem size . Now, notice that a key feature of the condition ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) is that, for any fixed it represents a convex LMI condition in , and therefore finding a feasible parameter amounts indeed to solving a robust convex program. This is the key observation that makes the scenario paradigm well-suited for probabilistic analysis within the context of generalized quadratic stability. With pre-specified confidence, a matrix generated by a scenario solution would be a Lyapunov matrix for all but a small fraction of the systems in the family <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>1) Formalization as : Notice that condition (15) is a feasibility condition expressed by a strict matrix inequality, while the robust convex problem considered in previous sections is a minimization problem subject to a nonstrict inequality condition (we have as opposed to ). The precise formalization of the GQS problem within the scenario setting can be done in more than one way and it is to a certain extent a matter of taste. Here, as an illustration, we further develop this first example to indicate a possible way to cast it within the setup of Section III. It is tacitly understood that similar formalizations apply to all other examples. First, set an optimization problem with the format of a robust convex program as follows:</p><p>Then, assume a probability measure over the uncertainties is given, and build the scenario counterpart of the problem subject to where the scenarios are independently extracted at random according to . Here, the optimization variable is . Note also that the lower bound has been introduced without loss of generality since, otherwise, the solution may escape to infinity due to homogeneity of the constraint.</p><p>Applying Theorem 1 we can then conclude that, with probaat least , either is unfeasible, so that RCP and the original GQS is unfeasible, or the solution of is a -level solution for RCP. In the latter case, if , it is easily seen that GQS is again unfeasible. Finally, if , then is a -level solution for GQS. Applicability of Theorem 1 subsumes that Assumption 2 holds, while in general situations one can resort to Theorem 4 in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. State-Feedback Stabilization</head><p>Consider the uncertain system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where is the state variable, is the control input, and matrices and are generic of . Suppose we want to stabilize <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> by means of a state-feedback control law , where is a static feedback gain. The resulting closed-loop system is robustly stable if and only if is Hurwitz for all . Using the enhanced LMI characterization proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (Theorem 3.1), robust stabilizability of ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) is equivalent to the existence of matrices , , and a Lyapunov symmetric matrix function such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> (asterisks denote entries that are easily inferred from symmetry). If a feasible solution is found, the robustly stabilizing feedback gain is recovered as . A sufficient condition for robust stabilizability is hence readily obtained by considering a specific parameterized matrix function family (linear in the parameter , for any fixed ) in the above condition. The resulting problem is convex in the decision variable , for any fixed , and it is therefore a robust convex problem. Notice again that this robust problem is hard to solve in general. As an exception, in the special case when is affine in , is a hypercube, and is chosen in the affine form <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, the previous robust condition can be transformed by a standard "vertexization" argument into a finite set of LMIs involving the vertex matrices, and hence solved exactly (this latter special case is indeed the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). We remark however again that the number of vertices (and, hence, of LMI constraints) grows exponentially with the number of uncertain parameters , which makes this standard approach practically unviable in cases when is large. This robust state-feedback stabilization problem is amenable to the scenario randomization approach similarly to the problem in Section V-A. A numerical example is presented in Section V-D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Other Problems</head><p>In the previous sections, only a few control problems amenable to the scenario reformulation have been illustrated. This is just a sample of possible problems and many more can be considered, such as robust or state feedback synthesis (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>), linear parameter-varying (LPV) design (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for a formulation of the LPV synthesis problem in the form of a robust convex semidefinite program, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for a randomized solution approach, alternative to the one proposed in this paper), LP-based robust pole assignment (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>), the various robust design problems based on parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, as well as problems in the robust model predictive control setup. For discrete-time systems, the robust analysis and design criteria proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> are also directly suitable for the scenario technique. Also, problems of set-membership state reachability and filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> may be efficiently solved in a probabilistic sense by the proposed methodology.</p><p>In the next section, we present a numerical example of the scenario design approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. A Numerical Example</head><p>Consider a robust state-feedback stabilization problem of the form presented in Section V-B. In particular, let the uncertain system be given by where and is as given at the bottom of the next page, with , , and</p><p>The objective is to determine a state-feedback control law , such that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stable.</p><p>Using quadratic stability as a sufficient condition for robust stability, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> we have that such controller exists if there exist , , and a Lyapunov matrix such that (18) is satisfied. If a feasible solution is found, the feedback gain is recovered as . Assuming uniform distribution over , and proceeding as discussed in Section V-A.II, we write the scenario version of the problem as where are independent samples uniformly extracted from . The design variable in this problem is , which contains free variables. Hence, fixing a-priori probabilistic levels and , and using bound we determine the sample size . The numerical solution of one instance of the above scenario problem yielded optimal objective , corresponding to the controller Next, we run an a-posteriori Monte-Carlo analysis of robust stability. We can use a much larger sample size for this a-posteriori analysis, since no numerical optimization is involved in the process. This a-posteriori test is conducted by testing directly whether is Hurwitz for a very large number ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) of sampled 's. Interestingly, for the computed controller , the a-posteriori estimated probability of instability of resulted to be equal to zero, which, using Hoeffding's inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, means for instance that we can claim with confidence greater than 99.999% that our controller may fail at most on a set of 's having volume 0.001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presented a novel approach to robust control design based on the concept of uncertainty scenarios. Within this framework, if the robustness requirements are imposed in a probabilistic sense, then a wide class of control analysis and synthesis problems are amenable to efficient numerical solution. This solution is computed solving a convex optimization problem having a finite number of sampled constraints. The main contribution of the paper is to provide an explicit and efficient bound on the number of scenarios required to obtain a design that guarantees an a-priori specified probabilistic robustness level. This methodology is illustrated by control design examples that present difficulties when tackled by means of standard worst-case techniques. We believe that, due to its intrinsic simplicity, the scenario approach will be an appealing solution technique for many practical engineering design problems, also beyond the control applications mentioned in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A RELEASING THE UNIQUENESS ASSUMPTION</head><p>In Section III, the theory has been developed under Assumption 2 requiring that is either unfeasible or, if feasible, it admits a unique optimal solution. Here, we drop Assumption 2 and consider the general case allowing for nonuniqueness of the solution or nonexistence of the solution even when is feasible (i.e., the solution escapes to infinity).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Nonuniqueness of the Solution</head><p>We follow the same approach as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 4.1]</ref>. Suppose that when problem admits more than one optimal solution we break the tie by a tie-break rule as follows:</p><p>Tie-Break Rule: Let , , be given convex and continuous functions. Among the optimal solutions for , select the one that minimizes . If indetermination still occurs, select among the that minimize the solution that minimizes , and so on with We assume that functions , , are selected so that the tie is broken within steps at most. As a simple example of a tie-break rule, one can consider , From now on, by "optimal solution," we mean either the unique optimal solution, or the solution selected according to the Tie-break rule, if multiple optimal solutions occur.</p><p>Theorem 1 holds unchanged if we drop the uniqueness requirement in Assumption 2, provided that "optimal solution" is intended in the indicated sense.</p><p>To see this, generalize Definition 4 of support constraints to: The th constraint is a support constraint for if problem has an optimal solution such that . Indeed this definition generalizes Definition 4 since, in case of a single optimal solution (single without applying the Tie-break rule), is equivalent to . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 4</ref>.1], it is proven that Theorem 3 holds true with this extended definition of support constraint (i.e., the number of support constraints is at most ), and then an inspection of the proof of Theorem 1 in Section IV reveals that this proof goes through unaltered in the present setting, so concluding that Theorem 1 still holds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Nonexistence of the Solution</head><p>Even when is feasible, it may happen that no optimal solution exists since the set for allowed by the extracted con-straints is unbounded in such a way that the optimal solution escapes to infinity. In this section, we further generalize Theorem 1 so as to cope with this situation too and then provide a reformulation of Theorem 1 (Theorem 4) that covers all possible situations.</p><p>Suppose that a random extraction of a multisample is rejected when the problem is feasible but no optimal solution exists, and another extraction is performed in this case. the result of Theorem 1 holds if attention is restricted to the accepted multisamples. This idea is now formalized. Let be the set where is feasible but an optimal solution does not exist (it escapes to infinity) and assume that its complement has positive probability: . Moreover, let be the probability restricted to :</p><p>. In addition, assume that if a problem with, say, constraints is feasible and admits optimal solution, then, after adding an extra th constraint, if the problem remains feasible, then an optimal solution continues to exists (this rules out the possibility of pathological situations where adding a constraint forces the solution to drift away to infinity).</p><p>Going trough the proof of Theorem 1, we can readily see that it remains valid if attention is restricted to . Precisely, the following theorem holds.</p><p>Theorem 4: Fix two real numbers (level parameter) and (confidence parameter). If then, with probability no smaller than , either the scenario problem is unfeasible, and hence also the initial robust convex program is unfeasible; or, is feasible, and then its optimal solution (unique after the tie-break rule has been applied) is -level robustly feasible.</p><p>The proof of this theorem is obtained by following the same steps as in the proof of Theorem 1 in Section IV with a few simple amendments, as sketched in the following.</p><p>Similarly to the proof of Theorem 1, forget for the time being that can be unfeasible and assume . In the present context, interpret all subset of (e.g., , , ) as subsets of , so e.g., . Everything in the proof goes through unaltered till <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, drop the last step and consider the inequality base of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> Now, the cylinder does not intersect since any multisample in the cylinder is formed by the first samples that generate the optimal solution , plus the remaining samples that, in conjunction with the first , either make the problem unfeasible, or, if feasible, add constraints so still preventing escape to infinity. So base of which, used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> gives and, after substitution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, we obtain or, equivalently Since the left-hand side is , the desired result remains proven. The case when is a strict subset of can be dealt with without any additional complication. this implies that, with probability at least , the point is also feasible for problem , entailing</p><p>For the purpose of contradiction, suppose now that result 2 in the theorem is violated so that with probability larger than . Since then and we conclude that there exists a such that with probability larger than . However, this contradicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> for , so concluding the proof.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Corollary 1 : 3 )Fig. 1 .</head><label>131</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
